excellent question   i 'm not aware of one i was going to say go visit some personal finance blogs but then i remembered that i write on one and that i often get a commission if i talk about online accounts so unless something is really bad i 'm not going to post on it because i want to make money not chase it away this is n't to say that i 'm biased by commissions but among a bunch of online banks paying pretty much the same crappy interest rate and giving pretty much the same often not crappy service i 'm going to give air time to the ones that pay the best commissions   that and some of the affiliate programs would kick me out if i trashed them on my blog this also would any site blog or not that does not explicitly say that they do not have affiliate relationships with the banks they review i suppose if you read enough blogs you can figure out the bad ones by their absence but that takes a lot of time   seems like you 'd do all right by doing a sucks google search to dig up the dirt that or call up e mail post on their forum any questions you have about their services before sending them your money   if they 're up front they 'll answer you

as others have pointed out they do in fact exist   but it may be worth pointing out a possible reason that they are not as popular as commodities futures if i want exposure to the oil market for example buying oil futures has a big advantage over buying oil namely i do n't actually need to store the oil i can roll over my position rather than taking delivery on the other hand buying single stock futures does not have such a compelling advantage over buying the stock itself so most people would simply do the latter   although stock futures might provide some other advantages in some very specialized situations

follow the instructions on the w-4 it says exactly how you are supposed to calculate the number of allowances you should n't have to figure out how to get the right number just follow the instructions the only part at all complex is if you have large deductions in that case you 're supposed to subtract a standard amount from your actual deductions for 2017 $ if married filing jointly divide by $ 4,050 and then add the result to the number of allowances in general following the instructions on the w-4 should result in slightly more tax being withheld from your paycheck than you actually owe so that you get a modest refund next april 15 in the long run it does n't matter if you have too much withheld as you 'll get it all back eventually anyway i suppose the withholding could be so high that it does n't leave you enough to live on while waiting for your refund but that should n't normally be the case if you pay too little you could be subject to penalties and interest so you really want to avoid that

yes you can do that and it it wise to do so however you should make sure that the general trend of the stock is upwards and you buy during a in the uptrend so basically if the stock is making higher highs and higher lows on the daily or weekly charts then you would want to buy around one of the higher lows before the ex dividend date if the stock is making lower lows and lower highs then it is in a downtrend so never buy in this instance it is better to miss out on a dividend of $ 1 rather than to buy just for this $ 1 dividend and lose $ 5 or more when the price continues to drop further

you are correct that 20 has an impact on your interest rate although it is not always hugely significant   you would have to do your own shopping around to find that information out   however 20 has an impact that i consider to be far more important than your monthly payment and that is in your equity   if the dc market tanks which i know it has not really done like much of the country but none of us have crystal balls to know if it will or not then you will be more easily underwater the less you put down   conversely putting 20 or more down makes you an easy sell to lenders means that you do n't have to worry nearly so much about having to do a short sale in the future i would never buy a house with less than 20 down personally and have lived well below my means to get there but i am not you with regards to mortgages the way that i found information that i needed was to get books from the library that explained the mortgage process to me   when it came time to select an actual broker i used my realtor 's recommendation because i trusted my realtor to actually have my interests at heart because he was an old family friend you ca n't usually do that so i do n't recommend it and that of others i knew who had bought recently   i compared four lenders and competed them against each other to get the best terms   they will give you estimate sheets that help you weigh not only rates but costs of different fees such as the origination fee and discount points   make sure to know what fees the lender controls and what fees s)he does n't so that you know which lines to actually compare beyond a lender make sure that before closing you have found a title company that you think is a good choice your realtor or lender will try to pick one for you because that 's the way the business is played but it is a racket pick one who will give you the best deal on title a company may be title company lender or other that wo n't charge you an excessive amount a survey company that you like if required in dc for your title insurance and homeowner 's insurance coverage that you think is a good deal   the time between contract and closing is short and nobody tells you to research all the closing costs that on a $ 500,000 place run to in excess of $ 10,000 but you should   also know that your closing costs will be about 2 of the purchase price and plan accordingly in general take some time to educate yourself on as well as neighborhoods and price ranges   do n't rush into this process or you will lose a lot of money fast

discussions around expected values and risk premiums are very useful but there 's another thing to consider cash flow some individuals have high value assets that are vital to them such as   transportation or housing   the cost of replacing these assets is prohibitive to them their cashflow means that their rate of saving is too low to accrue a fund large enough to cover the asset 's loss however their cashflow is such that they can afford insurance while it may be true that over time they would be better off saving that money in an asset replacement fund until that fund reaches a certain level they are unprotected thus it 's not just about being risk averse there are some very pragmatic reasons why individuals with low disposable income might elect to pay for insurance when they would be financially better off without it

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

is there more on where dalio gets his definitions for the short term debt cycle 5 8 years or so and deleveraging and the long term debt cycle 75 100 years or his evidence that separates the two   at one point he says the difference is that in a deleveraging interest rates hit 0 and can no longer go lower but i do n't know if that works as a definition per se   there are other things that central banks do when interest rates hit 0 like buy up assets which he does mention and include in the print money category of things that can be done during a deleveraging   and one of the he cites england in the 1950s according to wikipedia was due to difficulty in transitioning out from war production and according to this excel statistics documents rates from the bank of england on historical rates it does n't say interest rates went to 0 at that time unless dalio is referring to another point in history when he cites 1950s england     his definition of a depression is when debt restructuring or defaults happen   interesting   what i learned was that there is n't really a hard and fast definition for recessions and depressions e.g. a recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row and a depression is just a bad long recession   and i do n't think i recall in the past an attempt to define what a deleveraging event of an economy is     is debt reduction and redistribution of wealth deflationary   i think it depends on how much the debt reduction or redistribution hurts the spending of the lender or wealthy versus how much it helps the spending of the borrower or the poor   both are actually similarly giving some from the haves to the have nots and especially redistribution of wealth is similar to fiscal spending which is mentioned as a valid inflationary way to try to help the economy   are deflationary methods say austerity needed to balance out the inflationary methods central bank buying assets and fiscal spending   are n't central bank interest rates quantitative easing and the government fiscal policy still the main things that move inflation or deflation   i would think that debt reduction and redistribution of wealth are good when needed but i would n't think you would do those things mainly for their supposed see above for my doubts deflationary effects     still a very interesting video and one of the best presented videos on a difficult subject

with regard to commodity futures a paper released in january 2010 by and concluded that index funds have essentially no impact on commodity futures looking at stocks a stock that gets included in a major index does increase in price it increases its turnover by 27 and increases its price by between 2.7 and 5.5 according to information cited by in this paper though it looks like the price increase tends to happen in the lead up to the stock being included interestingly i have read an article but can not now locate it which states that there 's a measurable albeit fairly small price bubble on stocks included in common indexes on monday mornings friday and at the start and end of the month that is the times when mutual funds are most likely to rebalance their holdings this almost certainly applies to a lesser extent to other stocks too my understanding is that the price difference was very small however generally speaking stocks which make part of well known indexes will tend to be in higher demand than stocks which do not it remains the case that almost all actively managed mutual funds are unable to consistently beat the indexes even with this taken into account

everyone buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price no matter who you are there are a few important things you need to understand example eve bid 16.00 eve ask so if your selling eve at market price you are entering an ask equal to the highest bid $ 16.00 if you buy eve at market price you are entering a bid equal to the lowest ask price $ its key to understand this rule an order executes only when both bid and ask meet bid = ask so a market maker puts in a bid when he wants to buy but the trade only executes when an ask price meets his bid price when you see a quote for a stock it is the price of the last trade so it is possible to have a quote higher or lower then both the bid and the ask

gt the washington examiner    gt freedom works   ok bud i 'm sure these are entirely non biased pieces of first class journalism especially with titles like that   gt president obama has been spending a lot of time with the 1 percent lately trying to get them to pony up to keep democrats from losing control of congress in november   the horror that someone would spend time with rich people that fucking monster let 's just elect one of them instead wtf is even the accusation here   gt on wednesday obama was in cambridge mass. for a discussion with about 25 supporters who paid $ each for the opportunity followed by a democratic national committee fundraiser in boston where the tickets started at $ 5,000 a pop   and does n't demand justify price if people bought tickets then obviously those people thought that was a fair price is this not the free market at work that capitalists should like is that not the same as doubling membership rates after the election should the tickets to this discussion have been $ 5 just because or something if i want to meet one on one with mr. trump i 'm going to have that opportunity without up serious cash lease   gt the democrats like to complain about the evil koch brothers one of whom david recently donated $ 35 million to the 's national of natural history to build a new hall for its collection of dinosaurs that 's the largest single donation ever to the publicly administered and nearly twice the $ 18 million both brothers have spent on federal elections since 1989   wtf is this non sequitur about the is journalism at the washington examiner just throwing in random bullshit   gt on the list of top political donors compiled by the koch brothers rank only meanwhile the top 10 list is dominated by unions and corporations which benefit from handouts and special favors from government which really means you the taxpayer and give overwhelmingly to the party that keeps them coming the democrats   yeah no shit this election cycle when the gop nominated a reality tv star in the last election cycle according to that was not the case the majority of campaign donations by corporations went to republicans so instead of crony capitalism the washington examiner should look at the real cause the embarrassment to the republican party

the other answer has mentioned factual resident and you have raised the existence of a tax treaty in your comment and provided a link to a page about determining residency i 'd like to highlight part of the first link you are a factual resident of canada for tax purposes if you keep    significant residential ties in canada while living or travelling    outside the country the term factual resident means that although you left canada you    are still considered to be a resident of canada for income tax    purposes notes if you have established ties in a country that canada has a tax treaty    with and you are considered to be a resident of that country but you    are otherwise a factual resident of canada meaning you maintain    significant residential ties with canada you may be considered a    deemed non resident of canada for tax purposes i 'll emphasize that considered to be a resident of canada for income tax purposes means you do need to file canadian income tax returns the notes section does indicate the potential treaty exemption that you mentioned but it is only a potential exemption note the emphasis theirs not mine on the word may in the last paragraph above please do n't assume may is necessarily favorable with respect to your situation the other side of the may coin is may not the determining your residency status page you mentioned in your comment says this if you want the canada revenue agency 's opinion on your residency    status complete either form determination of residency status    entering canada or form determination of residency status    leaving canada whichever applies and send it to the international    and tax services office to get the most accurate opinion    provide as many details as possible on your form so given your ties to canada i would suggest that until and unless you have obtained an opinion from the canada revenue agency on your tax status you would be making a potentially unsafe assumption if you yourself elect not to file your canadian income tax returns based on your own determination you could end up liable for penalties and interest if you do n't file while you are outside of canada tax residency in canada is not a simple topic for instances let 's have a look at determining an individual ’s residence status it 's a long page but here 's one interesting piece   the courts have stated that holders of a united states permanent residence card otherwise referred to as a green card are    considered to be resident in the united states for purposes of    paragraph 1 of the residence article of the canada u.s. tax    convention for further information see the federal court of appeal 's    comments in v r 2004 fca 2004 dtc    whereas you are in the u.s. on a tn visa intended to be temporary so you would n't be exempt just on the basis of your visa and the existence of the treaty the cra would look at other circumstances consider the centre of vital interests test centre of vital interests test if the individual has a permanent home in both contracting states it    is necessary to look at the facts in order to ascertain with which of    the two states his personal and economic relations are closer thus    regard will be had to his family and social relations his    occupations his political cultural or other activities his place of    business the place from which he administers his property etc the    circumstances must be examined as a whole but it is nevertheless    obvious that considerations based on the personal acts of the    individual must receive special attention if a person who has a home    in one state sets up a second in the other state while retaining the    first the fact that he retains the first in the environment where he    has always lived where he has worked and where he has his family and    possessions can together with other elements go to demonstrate that    he has retained his centre of vital interests in the first state emphasis on last sentence is mine anyway i 'm acquainted with somebody who left canada for a few years to work abroad they assumed that living in the other country for that length of time > 2 years meant they were non resident here and so did not have to file unfortunately upon returning to canada the cra deemed them to have been resident all that time based on significant ties maintained and they subsequently owed many thousands of dollars in back taxes penalties and interest if it were me in a similar situation i would err on the side of caution and continue to file canadian income taxes until i got a determination i could count on from the people that make the rules

i wondered about this problem too so i looked into the maths and made this app it uses the free document format player if you try it out you can see what conditions favour renting vs buying   my own conclusion was to aim to buy a property outright upon reaching retirement age if not sooner example this example compares buying a £ 400,000 house with renting for £ 1,000 a month while depositing equivalent amounts in savings to total the same monthly outgoings as the buyer   mortgage rate deposit rate property appreciation and rent inflation can be specified   the example mortgage term is 20 years   as you can see the buyer and renter come out about even after the mortgage term but the buyer comes off better after that having no more mortgage to pay   of course the rent to live in a £ 400,000 house would probably be more than £ 1,000 but this case shows an equivalence point

this answer is somewhat incomplete as i do n't have definitive conclusions about some parts of your question   your question includes some very specific that may best be answered by contacting the investment companies you 're considering i do n't see any explicit statement of fees for tiaa cref either   i suggest you contact them and ask there is mention on the site of no transaction fee funds ntf but i was n't able to find a list of such funds   again you might have to ask vanguard also offers some non vanguard funds without transaction fees   if you go the vanguard page on other mutual funds you can use the on the right to select other fund companies   those with ntf by the name have no transaction fees scottrade also offers ntf funds   you can use their screener and select no load and no transaction fee as some of your filters you are correct that you want to choose an option that will offer a good lineup of funds that you can buy without transaction fees   however as the links above show vanguard and tiaa cref are not the only such options   my impression is that almost any firm that has their own funds will sell them or at least some of them to you without a transaction fee   also as shown above many places will sell you other companies funds for free too   you have plenty of options as far as free trades so it really depends on what funds you like if you google for ira providers you will find more than you can shake a stick at   if you 're interested in low cost index funds vanguard is pretty clearly the leader in that area as their entire business is built around that concept   tiaa cref is another option as is which you did n't mention and others   realistically though you probably do n't need a gigantic lineup of funds   if you 're juggling money between more than a handful of funds your investment scheme is probably needlessly complex   the standard advice is to decide on a broad allocation of money into different asset classes e.g. us stocks us bonds international stocks international bonds find a place that offers funds in those areas with low fees and forget about all the other funds

why does the value of gold go up when gold itself does n't produce anything why do people invest in gold your perception that the value of gold goes up in the long run is based on the price of gold measured in your favorite paper currency for example the us dollar an increasing price of gold means that in the visible gold market market participants are willing to exchange more paper currency units for the same amount of gold there are many possible reasons for this while hft became extremely important for the short term price movements i will continue with long term effects excluding hft so when as a simple thought experiment the amount of available paper currency units us $ or whatever doubles and the amount of goods and services in an economy stay the same you can expect that the price of everything in this economy will double including gold you might perceive that the value of gold doubled it did not it stayed the same the number of printed dollars doubled the value of gold is still the same its price doubled does the amount of paper currency units grow over time yes in this answer my term paper currency units includes dollars that exist only as digits in bank accounts and printing currency includes creating those digits in bank accounts out of thin air so the first answer gold holds its value while the value of paper currency units shrinks over time so gold enables you to pass wealth to the next generation while hiding it from your government that gold does not produce anything is not entirely true for those of us mortals who have only a few ounces it is true but those who have tons can lease it out and earn interest   in practice it is leased out multiple times so multiple that gain you might call this fraud and rightfully so but we are talking about tons of gold nobody who controls tons of physical gold goes to jail yet   let 's talk about fear you see the perceived value of gold increases as more paper currency is printed   and markets price in expected future developments so the value of gold rises if a sufficient number of wealthy people fear the the will print too much paper currency   second answer so the price of gold not only reflects the amount of paper currency it is also a measurement of distrust in now you might say something is wrong with my argument the chart mentioned above shows that we have now mid 2015 5 times as much printed currency units than we had 2008   so the price of gold should be 5 times as high as 2008 assuming the amount of distrust in governments stayed the same there must be more effects or i might be completely wrong you decide but here is one more effect as the price of gold is a measurement of distrust in governments and especially the us government since the us dollar is perceived as the reserve currency the us government and associated organizations are extremely interested in low gold prices to prove trust so people familiar with the topic believe that the price of gold and silver is massively manipulated to the downside using high frequency trading and shorts in the futures markets by us government and wall street banks to disprove distrust and wall street banks gain huge amounts of paper currency units by manipulating the price mostly to the downside others say that countries like china and russia are also interested in low gold prices because they want to buy as much physical gold as possible knowing of the value that is not reflected by the price at the moment is there one more source of distrust in governments yes since 1971 all paper currencies are debt   they receive their value by the trust that those with debt are willing and able to pay back their debt if this trust is lost the downward manipulation if you think that such a thing exists of the gold and silver prices in the futures markets might fail some day if this is the case some say when this is the case you might see movements in gold and silver prices that bring them back to equilibrium with the amount of printed paper currencies in times of the roman empire you got a good and a pair of handmade shoes for an ounce of gold in our days you get a nice suite and a good pair of shoes for an ounce of gold in the mean time the value of each paper currency in the history of each country went to zero and the us $ lost 98 of its initial value as long as there is not enough distrust more paper currency is made in equity markets and bond markets on average be aware that you earn that currency only after you were able to sell at this price not while you hold it

risk is reduced but is n't zero the default risk is still there the issuer can go bankrupt and you can still loose all or some of your money if restructuring happens if the bond has a callable option the issuer can retire them   if conditions are favourable for the issuer you can still loose some of your investment callable schedule should be in the bond issuer 's prospectus while issuing the bond if the issuer is in a different country that brings along a lot of headaches of recovering your money if something goes bad i.e. forex rates can go up and down ytm when the bond was bought was greater than risk free deposit rates has to be greater than the risk free rate because of the extra risk you are taking reinvestment risk is less because of the short term am assuming 2 3 years at max but you should also look at the coupon rate of your bond if it is n't a zero coupon bond and how you invest that would it be ideal to hold the bond till maturity irrespective of price change it always depends on the current conditions you can not be sure that everything is fine so it pays to be vigilant check the health of the issuer any adverse circumstances and the overall economy as a whole as you intend to hold till maturity you should be more concerned about the of the bond by the issuer on maturity and till then

basically the banks countrywide was the worst about this failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it was n't in their self after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities the banks then had these sub prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities then s&amp;p and other ratings agencies gave them aaa ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time bombs waiting to go off goldman sachs and everyone else knew what was going on but they did n't want to get stuck holding the bag per se so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities   the problem is n't that we need more it 's that the regulations we have are n't even being enforced obama has prosecuted 1/3 as many financial crimes at bush clinton reagan

i interned for about six months at a firm that employed a few technical analysts so i 'll try to provide what little information i can since the bulk of the intra day trading was decided technical analysts had two main functions this basically boils down to my answer to your question there are still enough people trading firms etc who believe in candlestick charting and other visually subjective patterns that if you notice a trend pattern etc before the majority of traders observing you may be able to time the market successfully and profit this is becoming increasingly dangerous however because of the steps i outlined above over time the charting patterns that have been proven effective often in many firms individually since the algorithms are all proprietary are incorporated into computer algorithms so the traders you 're competing with to see the pattern are increasingly low latency computer less than a few blocks from the exchange summary candlestick charting along with other forms of subjective technical analysis has its believers and assuming enough of these believers trade the standard strategies based on the standard patterns one could conceivably time the market with enough skill to anticipate these traders acting on the pattern and therefore profit however the marginal benefits of doing so are decreasing rapidly as computers take over more trading responsibility   caveats   i know you 're in australia where the market penetration of hf algo traders is n't as high as in the us so it might be a few more years before the marginal benefits cease to be profitable that being said if various forms of technical analysis proved wildly profitable in australia above and beyond profits available in other markets rest assured that large american or british trading firms would already have moved in   my experience is limited to one trading firm so i certainly ca n't speak for the industry as a whole i know i did n't address candlestick charts specifically but since they 're only one piece of visual technical analysis i tried to address the issue as a whole   this somewhat ties into the debate between fundamental or technical analysis which i wo n't get into investopedia has a short article on the subject as i said i wo n't get into this because while it 's a nice debate for small traders at large trading firms they do n't care they want to make profit and any strategy that can be vetted whether it 's fundamental technical or will be vetted   i want to add more information to my answer to clear up some of the misconceptions in the comments including those talking about biased studies and a lack of evidence for or against technical analysis and candlestick charts i 'll explore this relationship further down   it 's important to keep in mind that charting methods including candlestick charts are visually subjective ways of representing data and that any interpretations drawn from such charts should ideally represent objective technical indicators a charting method is only as good as the indicators it 's used to represent therefore an analysis of the underlying indicators provides a suitable analysis for the visual medium in which they 're presented   one important study that evaluates several of these indicators is foundations of technical analysis computational algorithms statistical inference and empirical implementation by lo and lest anyone accuse its authors of bias i should point out that not only is it published by the national bureau of economic research a highly reputable organization within economics and finance but also that the majority of its authors come from mit 's sloan school which holds a reputation second to none this study finds that several technical indicators e.g. head and shoulder double bottom and various rectangle techniques do provide marginal value they also find that although   human judgment is still superior to most computational algorithms in the area of visual pattern recognition technical analysis can be improved by using automated algorithms since this paper was published in 2000 computing power and statistical analysis have gained significant ground against human ability to identify and exploit for visual pattern detection like candlestick charts   second i suggest you look into david 's book evidence based technical analysis applying the scientific method and statistical inference to trading signals he finds similar results to the lo et al paper in that some technical indicators do add value to the investment process but those that do are those that can be represented mathematically and thus programmed directly into trading algorithms thus bypassing visual tools like candlestick charts   he describes how studies including lo et al have found that head and shoulders patterns are worse than random i.e. you would earn higher returns if you simply traded at random that point is worth than repeating if a day trader is using a candlestick chart and using head and shoulders patterns as part of their he 's rolling the dice when he uses that pattern and returns that come from its application come from chance this reminds me of that old story about a company that sends out predicting the results of sports games complete with strategies and data to back up the predictions the company sends out several versions of the every game each predicting a different winner given a large enough sample size by the end of the season there are a few people who have received a that accurately predicted the winner for every game and they 're convinced the system is perfect the others were n't so lucky however relying on candlestick charts and ta patterns that are from the pre computerized era is reassuring to some traders and gives them a sense of control and beating the market but how long will chance remain on your side this is why i maintain that visual tools like candlestick charts are a slowly dying medium they certainly still add value to some trading firms which is why bloomberg terminals still ship with this functionality built in but as more and more research shows automated algorithms and statistical indicators can provide more value it 's also important to think about whether the majority of the value added by visual tools like candlestick charts comes in the form of profit or a sense of security to traders who learned the field using them over the past few decades   finally it 's extremely important to realize that the actions of retail investors in the equities market can not begin to represent the behaviors of the market as a whole in the equities markets alone trading firms and institutional investors dwarf retail investors and the difference in scale is even more vastly pronounced in derivatives and currency markets the fact that some retail investors use candlestick charts and the technical indicators they hope them provides nothing but minor anecdotal evidence as to their effectiveness

gt well they 've created what $ in the last few years   i agree with you technically but they control both the quantity and the quantity times velocity of money so they are also responsible for the lack of cashflow    the big thing i think you 're referring to is that they did this weird maneuver where they temporarily injected money into the banks basically so they could say they were solvent without actually being solvent because the were temporary the money never moved and was simply deposited at the fed if like adam smith you do n't consider money to really exist unless it moves they did not create effective money as you point out critically they did not create cashflow which is the appropriate macro definition of money the corresponding macro variable for this is ngdp   but actually the fed also controls ngdp as ben bernanke says every time the fomc makes its report they just choose not to increase it because they think that monetary policy is sufficiently i would agree with you that the present level of cashflow is inadequate but if the fed fixes it at the present level nothing will increase it this is called the critique was raising the issue to argue contra keynes that the multiplier on fiscal policy is 0 if you google it you can probably find someone to defend it better than me in any event this means it 's not very surprising that private spending and investment does n't lift ngdp nothing but the fed can lift ngdp because it can not create new cashflow on its own which it could under free banking this would be the advantage of free banking the market must now move to a new equilibrium ngdp level while it is saddled with a large number of contracts from before 2008 that were negotiated with respect to a higher expected ngdp level this deleveraging process is responsible for the present slump and the you describe

as per irs publication question is money received from the sale of inherited property considered taxable income answer    to determine if the sale of inherited property is taxable you must first determine your basis in the property the basis of property inherited from a decedent is generally one of the following for information on the fmv of inherited property on the date of the decedent ’s death contact the executor of the decedent ’s estate also note that in 2015 congress passed a new law that under certain circumstances requires an executor to provide a statement identifying the fmv of certain inherited property to the individual receiving that property check irs.gov for updates on final rules being to implement the new law if you or your spouse gave the property to the decedent within one year before the decedent 's death see publication 551 basis of assets report the sale on schedule d form 1040 capital gains and losses and on form 8949 sales and other of capital assets under the new law passed by congress in 2015 an accuracy related penalty may apply if an individual reporting the sale of certain inherited property uses a basis in excess of that property ’s final value for federal estate tax purposes again check irs.gov for updates on final rules being to implement the new law for estates of who died in 2010 basis is generally determined as described above however the executor of a decedent who died in 2010 may elect out of the estate tax rules for 2010 and use the modified carryover of basis rules    under this special election the basis of property inherited from a decedent who died during 2010 is generally the lesser of under this special election for estates of who died in 2010 the executor of the decedent ’s estate may increase the basis of certain property that beneficiaries acquire from a decedent by up to $ 1.3 million plus certain unused built in losses and loss if applicable but the increased basis can not exceed the fmv of the property at the date of the decedent ’s death the executor may also increase the basis of certain property that the surviving spouse acquires from a decedent by up to an additional $ 3 million but the increased basis can not exceed the fmv of the property at the date of the decedent ’s death the executor of the decedent ’s estate is required to provide a statement to all heirs listing the decedent ’s basis in the property the fmv of the property on the date of the decedent ’s death and the additional basis allocated to the property contact the executor to determine what the basis of the asset is report the sale on schedule d form 1040 and on form 8949 as described above additional information

here is another way to look at it does this debt enable you to buy more car than you can really afford or more car than you need if so it 's bad debt let 's say you do n't have the price of a new car but you can buy a used car with the cash you have you will have to repair the car occasionally but this is generally a lot less than the payments on a new car the value of your time may make sitting around waiting while your car is repaired very expensive if like me you can earn money in fine grained amounts anywhere between 0 and 80 hours a week and you do n't get paid when you 're at the mechanic 's in which case it 's possible to argue that buying the new car saves you money overall debt incurred to save money overall can be good compare your interest payments to the money you save if you 're ahead great and the fun or joy or potential of your new car is simply gravy now let 's say you can afford a $ 10,000 car cash there are new cars out there at this price but you want a $ 30,000 car and you can afford the payments on it if there was no such thing as borrowing you would n't be able to get the larger car and some people suggest that this is bad debt because it is helping you to waste your money you may be getting some benefit such as being able to get to a job that 's not served by public transit or being able to buy a cheaper house that is further from your job or saving time every day from the first $ 10,000 of expense but the remaining $ 20,000 is purely for fun or for showing off and should n't be spent   certainly not by getting into debt well that 's a philosophical position and it 's one that may well lead to a secure retirement think about that and you may decide not to borrow and to buy the cheaper car finally let 's say the cash you have on hand is enough to pay for the car you want and you 're just trying to decide whether you should take their cheap loan or not generally if you do n't take the cheap loan you can push the price down so before you decide that you can earn more interest elsewhere than you 're paying here make sure you 're not paying $ 500 more for the car than you need to since your loan is from a bank rather than the car dealership this may not apply in addition to the money your cash could earn consider also liquidity if you need to repair something on your house or deal with other emergency expenditures and your money is all locked up in your car you may have to borrow at a much higher rate as much as 20 if you go to credit cards and ca n't get it paid off the same month which will wipe out all this careful math about how you should just buy the car and not pay that 1.5 interest more important than whether you borrow or not is not buying too much car if the loan is letting you talk yourself into the more expensive car i 'd say it 's a bad thing otherwise it probably is n't

different stocks balance dividend versus growth differently some have relatively flat value but pay a strong dividend utility stocks used to be examples of that model and bonds are in some sense an extreme version of this some especially startups pay virtually no dividends and aim for growth in the value of the stock and you can probably find a stock that hits any point between these this is the growth versus income spectrum you may have heard mentioned in the past investors took more of their return on investment as dividends conceptually a share of the company 's net profits for the year reflecting the share 's status as partial ownership if you wanted to do so you could use the dividend to purchase more shares via a dividend reinvestment plan or not but that was up to you these days with growth having been strongly hyped many companies have shifted much more to the growth model and dividends are often relatively essentially this assumes that everyone wants the money reinvested and will take their profit by having that increase the value of their shares of course that 's partly because some percentage of stockholders have been demanding growth at all costs not always realistically   to address your specific case no you probably are n't buying microsoft because you like its dividend rate you 're buying it in the hope it continues to grow in stock value but the dividend is a bit of additional return on your investment and with other companies the tradeoff will be different that 's one of the things along with how much you believe in the company that would affect your decision when buying shares in specific companies personally i mostly ignore the whole issue since i 'm in index funds rather than individual stocks picking the fund sets my overall preference in terms of growth versus income after that it 's their problem to maintain that balance

in the sole interest of improving your credit score the thing you should focus on is lowering your overall utilization the best thing you could do for this would be to get a loan to your credit card debts into a single long term loan the impact of this is that your credit card utilization assuming the loan covers 100 of your balances will suddenly drop to 0 as you 'll no longer have a balance on the cards additionally at this point with a consolidation loan you 'll be building loan history by making steady fixed payments on the loan   the loan will also ideally have a significantly lower interest rate than the cards and thus will save you money that you 'd otherwise be spending on interest   a lot of others here will feed you some irrelevant advice pay off x credit card first ideally you need to eliminate this debt but to directly address the question of how you could improve your credit score based on your utilization i believe the best option would be for you to your credit card debt into a single loan to reduce your utilization on the cards

first you are reading that document correctly but it 's not 78 of original mortgage it is actually 78 of original home value   for example if the home was valued at $ 100 k when you bought it and you received a $ 90 k loan pmi must be removed when you owe $ 78 k not 78 of $ to make matters worse for the bank they missed the required timing to drop pmi i would print the document you referenced cite the applicable portion and tell them if they do not comply you will report them for failure to comply for example   i 'm sure i am not the only one in this situation and the fdic will be    eager to assess the huge fines they can collect from a bank that is n't    operating within the law something like that

although this scheme is likely to get shut down rather quickly by either your broker or credit card company some points you seem to have missed out on properly timed you should be able to get days of grace period 30 day billing cycle + 25 day grace period assuming you pay everything off every month and charge immediately following the statement date   you will need to avoid certain card issuers that code all transactions with financial institutions as cash advances citibank in if it is possible it would be in your best interest to lower cash advance limits to 0 to avoid any chance of cash advance fees if your credit card attempts to process it as a cash advance the transaction will just be declined and you wo n't be out anything otherwise one cash advance fee will eat several months worth of profits as far as investments with guaranteed principal goes the only thing you can realistically do is money market accounts and maybe treasury notes anything else and the short term price fluctuation may leave you high and dry if this scheme were to work you would be much better off attempting to get rewards for the purchases than anything you could invest in if you used a 2 card and it every month you would be looking at a 24 return on credit card rewards even 1 rewards gives you a 12 annual return which is going to beat anything you could invest the money in

you 're confused because the source you cite leaves out one number that is n't relevant to the argument they 're making total costs the number you 're expecting $ 9 x 365 or $ is the total cost of buying the jewelry which when subtracted from the $ sales volume gives us the net profit of $ 365   the investment is the amount of money original put into a system our company in this case the merchant bought his first piece of jewelry for $ 9 sold it for $ 10 took one dollar in profit and used the other 9 to reinvest by buying a new piece of jewelry we can extend the analogy further after 9 days of selling the merchant will $ 18 allowing him to now buy 2 pieces of jewelry each morning and sell them for $ 20 every day his costs will be $ 18 and he 'll turn a $ 2 profit all with the original investment of $ 9

i 'm not sure what point you think i was making it looks like you think i 'm supporting the idea that qe causes inflation which it does n't at least not when it is being used as it has been what it does seem to have done is depress interest rates and create a speculative market that does n't match up with economic reality it has also created a ridiculous profit loop for investment banks selling bonds to the fed   you ca n't talk about qe without mentioning that banks are now incentivized to hold onto reserves because they can collect interest so the banks screwed up were heavily subsidized under the pretense of it being best for the taxpayer and were then rewarded for sitting on all of that money    if i support any viewpoint it is this the government agreed to give the banks a thin veneer of solvency by granting them enormous sums in a short period obviously if that much currency went straight into the market it would be a disaster so it put a mechanism in place to reward them for holding onto it all qe did was massively increase the debt burden of the government which will be passed on to taxpayers in the form of taxes fines fewer benefits worsening infrastructure and more restrictions qe may have not caused inflation but it certainly did n't help the vast majority of americans who will simply see their standard of living decline at a quicker pace i 'm sure this will get blamed on immigrants or something instead of the reality that our government is rewarding banks for not lending to individuals why would they an individual might not pay them back but the government always will by simply extracting more out of those very individuals

mostly ditto to sarwate let me just add i do n't know how you 're making your payments whether through the biller 's web site your bank 's web site by mail in person etc but whatever the mechanism if there is a chance that waiting until the due date to pay may mean that you will miss the due date do n't the cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings bear in mind that we are talking pennies here i do n't know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to say it 's $ 3,000 i think that would be a lot for most people you say you 're getting 3.6 on your savings so if on the average you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have you 're getting an extra 2 52 x 3.6 x $ 3,000 in interest or $ 4 per month i think the last time i paid a late fee on a credit card it was $ 35 so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings   personally i pay most of my bills through either my bank 's web site or the biller 's web site i schedule all payments when i get a paycheck and i generally try to schedule them for 1 week before the due date so there 's plenty of breathing room

a debenture is a security document this means that the bond is secured over assets under english law you can issue bonds which if defaulted upon you can enforce your security against the issuer i.e. the company which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company 's assets    as for a floating charge i 'll first explain what a fixed charge is say you 're a bank a lender and you lend £ 1000 to x. you take security by way of a fixed charge over x 's photocopy machines x is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender 's consent this means that if x can not pay up the loan you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines sell them and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default   a floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate e.g. x 's stock of potatoes x sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you ca n't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons you ca n't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato when an event of default occurs i.e. you do n't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement the floating charge and becomes a fixed charge thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back   random examples but makes sense   source future english solicitor

you appear to be thinking of option writers as if they were individuals with small holdings and a particular view on what the underlying is going to do   this is not the best way to think about them option writers are typically large institutions with large portfolios and that provide services in all sorts of different areas at the same time as they are writing calls on a particular stock they are writing puts on it and options on other stocks   they are buying and selling the underlying and all kinds of different derivatives   they are not necessarily writing the option because they are expecting or hoping to benefit from a price move   it 's just small part of their business   they write the option if the option price is good enough that they think they are selling it for very slightly more than it 's worth    asking why an option writer creates a call is like asking why a grocery store keeps buying groceries from their distributors   do n't they know the price of food may not always rise   sure but their business is selling the food for slightly more than they pay for it not speculating on what will happen to its price   most option writers are doing the same thing except what they are buying and selling is sets of cash flows and risk    as a general rule the business model of option writers is to profit from the few cents of spread or mispricing not from aggregate changes in the price of the underlying   they should and often do maintain balanced portfolios so their option writing activities do n't expose them to a lot of risk also note that there could be lots of reasons for writing options even if you do have a particular view   for example perhaps the option writer thinks volatility of the underlying will decrease   writing a call could be part of an overall strategy that profits from this view

books would be considered personal use property according to canada 's income tax laws   the most detailed it i was able to find is which says gains and losses 3 a gain on the disposition of personal use property is normally a capital gain within the meaning of paragraph where the property is a principal residence the gain > is computed under paragraph or c 4 under a loss on a disposition of personal use property other than listed personal property is deemed to be nil this part of the bulletin indicates that a gain might be considered a capital gain not income   however you do n't get to book a loss as a capital loss   this is the first hint that your book sale which is actually an exempt capital loss should n't go on your tax return unless it 's one of the listed items listed personal property 7 listed personal property is defined in paragraph to mean personal use property that is all or any portion of or any interest in or right to any a print drawing painting or other similar work of art b jewellery c rare folio rare or rare book d stamp or e coin so unless you 're selling rare books the disposition sale of them is essentially exempt as income regardless of whether you sold it at a profit or at a loss   if it is rare then you might be able to consider it a capital loss which does n't help you much unless you had other capital gains but you can carry over capital losses to future years there 's also a newer it related to hobbies and collecting items   this one says 11 in order for any activity or pursuit to be regarded as a source of income there must be a reasonable expectation of profit where such an expectation does not exist as is the case with most hobbies neither amounts received nor expenses incurred are included in the income computation for tax purposes and any excess of expenses over receipts is a personal or living expense the deduction of which is denied by paragraph on the other hand if the hobby or pastime results in receipts of revenue in excess of expenses that fact is a strong indication that the hobby is a venture with an expectation of profit if so the net income may be taxable as income from a business the current version of visual artists and writers discusses the concept of a reasonable expectation of profit in greater detail where a hobby consists of collecting personal use property or listed personal property should be accounted for as described in the current version of personal use property emphasis mine in other words if it 's not the type of thing where you 'd make a tax deduction when you bought it in the first place then you clearly do n't need to report it as income when you sell it just to be absolutely clear here the fact that you are selling them at a loss is not actually what 's important here what 's important is that if the books are n't collectibles then you would have had no expectation of profit   if you did have that expectation then you could have made a tax deduction when you first purchased them so in this case it is probably not necessary for you to report the income however for the benefit of other readers in some cases you might need to report it under other income or book it as a capital gain loss depending on what those personal items are and whether or not you made a net profit

the apathy and ignorance of the majority of americans is the only reason the economic inequality in america was ever able to reach such devastating proportions the business culture in this country is ruining average quality of life and i fundamentally do not believe that you are okay with that and if you are then you 're just adding to the problem by either being sympathetic towards a delusion or an active apologist for greed and thus put yourself in the category of people to be on the receiving end of that fuck you

tax exempt interest and dividends attributable to tax exempt interest is required to be reported on form 1040 line 8b or the analogous line of form 1040a   while it is not directly taxed it does come into play in the calculation of taxable income and various credits   for example tax exempt interest is counted when determining the portion of social security benefits to be included in gross income

dividends are declared by the board of directors of a corporation on date a to stock holders of record on date b a later date these stockholders then receive the declared dividend on date c the so called payment date all of these dates are announced on the first declaration date if there is no announcement no dividend will be paid the stock typically goes down in price by approximately the amount of the dividend on the   date it goes ex   but then moves in price to reflect other developments including the possibility of another declaration payment three months hence dividends are important to some investors especially those who live on the income they are less important to investors who are out for capital gains and who may prefer that the company reinvest its money to seek such gains instead of paying dividends in actual fact dividends are one component of total or overall return the other component is capital gains and the sum of the two represents your return

you can use 's gambit to convert between usd and cad either direction i have never personally done this but i am planning to convert some cad to usd soon so i can invest in usd index funds without paying the typical 2 conversion fee   you must be okay with waiting a few days for the trades to settle and okay with the fact that the exchange rate will almost certainly change before you sell the shares in the opposite currency the spread on is about 0.01 0.02 and you also have brokerage commissions and fees if you use a discount broker the commissions and fees can be quite low eg to transfer $ 5000 usd to cad using questrade you would deposit the usd into a questrade account and then purchase units of since it is an etf there is no commission on the purchase then you request that they journal the shares over to and you sell them in cad will have about a $ 5 fee in cad and lose about $ 1 on the spread and withdraw the whole thing will have cost you $ 6 cad in lieu of ~$100 you would pay if you did a straightforward conversion with a 2 exchange fee the difference in fees scales up as the amount you transfer increases someone has posted the chat log from when they requested their shares be from to here it looks like it was quite straightforward of course there is a time cost and the nuisance of signing up for an maintaining an account with a broker if you do n't have one already you can do it on non discount brokers but it will only be worth it to do it with a larger amount of money since the commissions are larger note if you have enough room to hold the cad amount in your tfsa and will still have that much room at the end of the calendar year i recommend doing the exchange in a tfsa account the taxes are minimal unless the exchange rate changes drastically while your trades are settling from capital gains or losses while waiting a few days for the trades to settle but they are annoying to calculate if you do it often warning if you do it in a tfsa be sure not to over contribute every time you deposit counts as a contribution and your withdrawals do n't count against the limit until the next calendar year

if you are looking to begin living off the money now then dheer 's answer is correct it is not possible however if you are looking to grow that money and potentially additional money added at later dates then you could make this work 250 a month corresponds to 3000 per year a first approximation is that you will need a diversified portfolio of 20 25x that amount to get the required return this approximation is based on the rule of thumb for how much life insurance to buy therefore you need to determine how to grow the 4k you currently have into 60 75k these numbers however are not adjusted for inflation in the us i would like put the long term inflation adjust diversified market return at 4 per year your money doubles about every 18 years so your best approach if you have time is a diversified portfolio with rebalancing and adding additional money each year

you would think so would n't you after all it 's your money in practise though it 's not as easy as you might think because anti money laundering and anti fraud laws mean you generally have to withdraw money to the same account you funded your trading from some forex trading account providers will allow you to fund from multiple sources but then insist on putting money back to those sources in some proportion or some order or other some forex trading account providers at least claim that they may at their discretion let you do it if the destination account is in the same name but i would n't be surprised if they charged you for it and actually the charges might be somewhat justified if they have to invoke identification procedures to make sure the other account is indeed actually you you would have to talk to a specific service provider and see if they agree to do what you want they all have faqs about funding and withdrawal so you can scan around online for the slightly more flexible ones and then give them a call you might find it difficult to get any guarantees out of them though

if i really understood it you bet that a quote currency stock market anything will rise or fall within a period of time     so what is the relationship with trading i see no trading at all since i do n't buy or sell quotes you are not betting as in betting on the outcome of an horse race where the money of the participants is redistributed to the winners of the bet you are betting on the price movement of a security to do that you have to buy sell the option that will give you the profit or the loss in your case you would be buying or selling an option which is a financial contract that 's trading then since anyone should have the same call when a currency rises and put when it falls how can you know what will be the future rate of exchange of currencies it 's not because the price went up for the last minutes hours days months years that it will continue like that because of that everyone wo n't have the same strategy also not everyone is using currencies to speculate there are firms with real needs that affect the market too like importers and exporters they will use financial products to protect themselves from forex rates not to make profits from them how the brokers websites can make money the broker or bank will either i 'm really afraid to bet because i think that they can bankrupt at any time are my fears correct there is always a probability that a company can go bankrupt but that 's can be very low probability brokers are usually not taking risks and are just being intermediaries in financial transactions but sometime their computer systems have troubles thanks to that they are not likely to go bankrupt you after you buy your option also they are regulated to insure that they are solid last thing if you fear losing money do n't trade if you do trade only play with money you can afford to lose as you are likely to lose some maybe all money in the process

what this abbreviated balance sheet tells you is that this company has negative equity   the liabilities are greater than the value of the assets   the obvious problem for the company who wants to do business with you is that they are going to have a real hard time accessing credit to pay off any debts that they incur with doing business with you   in this case the recommended course would be to ask them put cash up front instead of putting them on account you do n't really need to look at the income statement to see that they are currently underwater   if their income statement turns out to be then you can wait for them to get their liabilities under control before you set up an account for them

if the rate is the same then clearing one card to zero does have one advantage getting your grace period back generally when you owe money on your credit card and you make a new purchase that new purchase get charged interest starting on day one but if you are not carrying   a balance in other words you pay off the charges every month then new purchases are n't charged until you fail to pay the balance by the due date that grace period can be 25 to 55 days depending where you are in the billing cycle having one clean card will allow you to use that card when you have no other choice lets say you have an emergency car repair while away from home you do n't have $ 500 in cash so you put it on the clean card when you get home you know that you can pay the bill and not have been charged interest

i 'd recommend an online fx broker like xe trade at xe.com   there are no fees charged by xe other than the spread on the fx conversion itself which you 'll pay anywhere they have payment clearing facilities in several countries including uk bacs so provided you 're dealing with a major currency it should be possible to transfer money free of wire charges at least   the fx spread will be much better than you would get from a bank since fx is their primary business the additional risk you take on is settlement risk   xe will not pay the sterling amount to your uk bank account until they have received the euro payment into their account   if xe went bankrupt before crediting your uk account but after you 've paid them your euros you could lose your money xe is backed by custom house which is a large and established canadian firm so this risk is very small indeed there are other choices out there too is another that comes to mind although xe 's rates have been the best of those i 've tried

the basic equation taught in day one of accounting school is that assets = liabilities + equity my first point was that i looked at the actual financial statements published as of the end of the 2nd quarter 2017 and the total liabilities on their audited balance sheet were like $ 13 billion not $ 20b i do n't know where the author got their numbers from   my second point debt usually needs to be paid on terms agreed upon by the debtor and the including interest so it is important for a business to keep track of what they owe and to whom so they can make timely payments as long as they have the cash on hand to make payments plus whatever interest they owe and the owners are happy with the total return on their investment then it does n't really matter how debt they have on the balance sheet   remember the equation a = there are precisely two ways to finance a business that wants to acquire assets liabilities and/or equity the appropriate level of debt vs equity on a balance sheet varies wildly and totally depends on the industry size of the business cash flow personal preferences of the ceo cfo shareholders et al etc     it gets way more detailed and complicated than that obviously but the point is that looking at debt alone is a meaningless metric this is corporate finance and accounting 101 so you can probably find tons of great articles and videos if you want to learn more

margin is when you borrow to buy stock     the margin is the amount you can have borrowed over your own stock there may also be some other considerations e.g. risk portfolio say you have 10,000 your broker allows you buy on margin with a margin requirement of 100 so you buy 18,000 of stock you have 10k of your own and borrowed 8k to buy this so you have 80 extra stock on margin say the stock has a downturn and loses 12 or so suddenly you have 16k stock value but you still owe 8k you are now at 100 margin 8k is yours 8k is borrowed money      at this point if you drop anymore you are exceeding 100 margin and your broker may sell to ensure they get their 8k     the benefits of this are of course if the stock goes in your favor 10 rise is 1,800 instead of 1,000

the dutch tax office is pretty decent although slightly do n't expect a lot of help but they 're not generally known for making a lot of problems digital copies are fine for instance they will send you your first vat notice you probably would have known if your company would have been incorporated so i 'll assume you 're just trading as a natural person that means you still have to file vat returns but the business income is just filed annually as other income   for the vat part you 'll need to invoice your customers keep a copy of those invoices for your own bookkeeping and keep track of the matching customer payments together these form the chief evidence of your vat obligation you also have a vat deduction from your purchases it 's a value added tax after all again keep receipts the usual vat period is 3 months so you 'd pay vat 4 times a year but if you would pay less than euro you might not need to pay at all and just need to file annually the income part is easy with the receipts you had for vat purposes anyway dutch tax office vat in english

you can call what you 're asking about a wealth tax or capital tax   these are taxes not based on income you earned in a year but some measure of how much you own some countries italy i believe is a prime example tax ownership of foreign land some countries tax amounts owned by corporations canada did this until ~5 10 years ago depending on province some countries strictly tax your wealth above a certain level switzerland as has been mentioned does this   one form of what you are referring to that does exist in the us is the estate tax this is a tax on the amount of wealth that a person owns at the time they die the threshold for when this tax applies has been very volatile over the last 20 years but it is generally in the multi millions and i believe sits somewhere around $ if these taxes start to crop up more and more and i believe they will do n't be shocked at the initial sticker price theoretically a wealth tax could replace some of the current income tax regime in many countries without creating a strict increased tax burden on their people ie if you owe $ 10k in income tax this year but a $ 2k capital tax is instituted next year then you are still in the same position as long as your income tax is reduced to $ 8k   whether these taxes are effective preferable or not is really a question of economics not personal finance so i will not that point note if the money you have saved earns money interest or dividends or maybe rent from a condo you own then those earnings are typically taxed alongside your wage income any wealth capital tax as i 've described it above would be in addition to income tax on investment earnings

if you own 1 of a company you are technically entitled to 1 of the current value and future profits of that company however you can not as you seem to imply just decide at some point to take your ball and go home you can not call up the company and ask for 1 of their assets to be liquidated and given to you in cash what the 1 stake in the company actually entitles you to is 1 of total shareholder voting rights your or nay carries the weight of 1 of the total shareholder voting block does n't sound like much but when the average little guy has on the order of ten of a percentage point ownership of any big corporation your one vote carries more weight than those of millions of single share investors 1 of future dividend payments made to shareholders for every dollar the corporation makes in profits and does n't retain for future growth you get a penny again does n't sound like much but consider that the simon property group ranked 497 on the fortune 500 list of the world 's biggest companies by revenue made $ 1.4 billion in profits last year 1 of that if the company it all up is $ 14 million if you bought your 1 stake in march of 2009 you would have paid a paltry $ 83 million and be earning roughly 16 on your initial investment annually just in dividends to say nothing of the roughly 450 increase in stock price since that time making the value of your holdings roughly $ 460 million that does reduce your actual dividend yield to about 3 of holdings value if this does n't sound appealing and you want out you would sell your 1 stake the price you would get for this total stake may or may not be 1 of the company 's book value this is for many reasons now to answer your hypothetical if apple 's stock tomorrow went from $ market cap to zero that would mean that the market thought when they woke up tomorrow morning that the company was all of a sudden absolutely worthless in order to have this unanimous consent the market must be thoroughly convinced by looking at sec filings of assets liabilities and profits listening to executive statements etc that an investor would n't see even one penny returned of any cash investment made in this company 's stock that 's impossible the price of a share is based on what someone will pay to have it or accept to be rid of it nobody ever just gives stock away for free on the trading floor so even if they 're selling 10 shares for a penny they 're selling it and so the stock has a value $   we can say however that a fall to effectively zero is possible because they 've happened enron for instance lost half its share value in just one week in mid october as the scope of the accounting scandal started becoming evident that was just the steepest part of an 18-month fall from $ in august 00 to just $ as of its bankruptcy filing in dec 01 a loss of value now this is an extreme example but it illustrates what would be necessary to get a stock to go all the way to zero if indeed it ever really could enron 's stock was n't delisted until a month and a half after enron 's bankruptcy filing it was done based on nyse listing rules the stock had been trading at less than a dollar for 30 days and was still traded over the counter on the pink sheets after that point enron did n't divest all its assets until 2006 and the company still exists though its mission is now to sue other companies that had a hand in the fraud get the money and turn it around to enron creditors i do n't know when it stopped becoming a publicly traded company if indeed it ever did but as i said there is always someone willing to buy a bunch of really cheap shares to try and game the market buying shares reduces the number available for sale reducing supply increasing price making the investor a lot of money assuming he can offload them quickly enough

i have also tried mvelopes in the past and my experiences match yours i currently use the desktop version of ynab you need a budget ynab 4 and i like it much better   where we failed after a while with mvelopes we are succeeding with ynab and have been now for the last 3.5 years i do n't want this to sound like a commercial for ynab i will give important caveats about ynab later but here is why i believe we have done better now with ynab than before with mvelopes   i hope that these reasons will be useful to you when you are evaluating your next options as you said we also found mvelopes interface to be slow and   ynab 4 is a desktop app with capabilities that we found to be much quicker and easier to work with than mvelopes flash based interface   that was 4 years ago hopefully mvelopes has their interface since then    we also struggled with mvelopes connection with our banks   with ynab 4 there is no connection to the bank everything has to be entered manually   i initially thought this might be worse but for us it has been better   i can either enter transactions as they happen on the mobile app or i can hold on to receipts and enter them every day or two in the evening categorizing as i go   we always have an up to date picture of our finances and we do n't have to mess with trying to match up downloaded transactions that have been screwed up or are missing we are n't really using ynab much differently than we were using mvelopes but we have learned a few tricks that i think have contributed to our success   one of the things we do differently is that i do n't obsess about the cash accounts too much   cash accounts for us are the hardest to keep track of because most of our cash transactions do n't have a receipt we are paying a friend or family member for something or leaving a tip or something like that which we forget about when it comes time to enter into the software   as a result the cash account balances get off   i periodically enter a correcting transaction to get the balances right and have a budget category specifically for this that we have to put money in for these unknown transactions   fortunately for us our cash spending is a small percent of our total spending we usually pay with a credit card so this bit of spending is n't that big of a concern with ynab the current month 's budget is right in front of you as soon as you open up the app which makes it easy to adjust your budget during the month if necessary   with mvelopes at least how their app worked 4 years ago the budget was somewhat hidden after you funded your budget categories and it was a bit of a pain to move money around between categories   the ability to adjust your budget in the middle of the month is crucial if you do n't do that you 'll get frustrated the first time you find that you do n't have enough money in a category for something you need   ynab makes it very easy to move money around inside your budget that having been said you need to be aware that the current version of ynab is not a desktop application but a web based app   ynab 4 the old desktop version which we have been using is officially unsupported as of the end of 2016   however i see that it is still available for sale if you are interested in it the ynab4 help site is still up and the mobile app you would need to work with it on your phone called ynab classic is still in the app store    as i said the current ynab is now a web app complete with automatic downloading of transactions from your bank   i have no experience with it other than playing around with it a little and so i ca n't tell you how quick the interface is or how well the auto downloading of transactions works as an alternative another web based solution is everydollar from dave ramsey 's company   i have never tried it   the advantage of this one is that it is free if you choose not to link it to your banks the automatic downloading of transactions is a paid feature i wrote an answer a couple of years ago in which i describe two different approaches that budgeting software packages tend to take   i 'm not familiar with buxfer so i do n't know which approach it takes but perhaps that answer will help you evaluate all of your software options on the behavior side of things besides the relaxing of the cash accounting i mentioned above we also involve my wife a little less in the budgeting process than we used to   this is by her choice   i am the one who enters all the transactions into the software she hands me all her receipts i reconcile the accounts at the end of the month and i set the budget for the next month   we have been doing this long enough now that she knows what the budget is and we only need to discuss it if we want to do something different with the budget than we have been doing in the past   she has the ynab app on her phone and can see where we are at with all of our budget categories

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

i know that there are a lot service on the internet helping to form an llc online with a fee around $ 49 is it to pay them to have an llc or i can do that myself no you can do it yourself the $ 49 is for your convenience but there 's nothing they can do that you would n't be able to do on your own what i need to know and what i need to do before forming an llc you need to know that llc is a legal structure that is designed to provide legal protections as such it is prudent to talk to a legal adviser i.e. a virginia licensed attorney is it possible if i hire some employees who living in india is the salary for my employees a expense do i need to claim this expense this i guess is entirely unrelated to your questions about llc yes it is possible the salary you pay your employees is your expense you need to claim it otherwise you 'd be inflating your earnings which in certain circumstances may constitute fraud what i need to do to protect my company for physical protection you 'd probably hire a security guard if you 're talking about legal protections then again talk to a lawyer what can i do to reduce taxes vote for a politician that promises to reduce taxes most of them never deliver though otherwise you can do what everyone else is doing tax planning that is plan ahead your expenses time your invoices and utilize tax deferral programs etc talk to your tax adviser who should be a ea or a cpa licensed in virginia what i need to know after forming an llc you 'll need to learn what are the filing requirements in your state annual reports tax reports business taxes sales taxes payroll taxes etc most are the same for same proprietors and llcs so you probably will not be adding to much extra red tape your attorney and tax adviser will help you with this but you can also research yourself on the virginia department of corporations state department whichever deals with llcs

what do you propose a fair share should be   they pay nearly $ 900 million per year in income taxes their effective rate is reduced due to them paying higher taxes in years prior plus they lost money and can deduct that as well    not to mention they are double taxed as a corporation and payroll taxes are not part of that $ 900 million so they 're paying even more than that    part of what makes the us awesome is an environment that helps business grow what do you think will happen when a business pays let 's say 20 on revenue generated in other countries and then another 20 tax on that revenue here   either companies will move to a country with a lower tax rate or they pull back on global trade both are bad for the economy

inflation can go up for a number of reasons boom times can cause inflation as everyone is making and spending a lot of money so prices and inflation goes up in times like these central banks usually increase interest rates to curb spending and thus bring down inflation by raising interest rates the central bank is increasing the cost of borrowing money so with high prices and a higher cost to borrowing money most people start reducing their spending when this happens businesses sell less stock and have increased costs due to higher interest rates so have to lay off staff or reduce their hours at work so people will have even less money to spend this causes prices to fall and reduces inflation and can result in a recession at this point in time central banks start reducing interest rates to make the cost of borrowing money cheaper and stimulate people to start spending again and so the cycle continues the result in this case is that inflation itself did n't demand but was helped along by the central bank rising interest rates another reason causing inflation can be a restriction on the supply of certain goods or services an example we went through about 2 years ago was when floods caused banana crops up in northern australia to be devastated this caused a lack of supply in bananas for almost a year across australia the normal price for bananas here is between $ 1 to $ 3 per kg during this period banana prices skyrocketed up to $ 14 per kg the result very few were buying bananas so the increase in price here caused a reduction in demand directly

start with the bank where you have your checking and savings account they can streamline some of the paperwork because they can see how much you make and have access to several years worth of bank statement legitimate mortgage companies do publish their rates but there is no guarantee that you will qualify for the best rate without them knowing your credit score salary and down payment information   there is no way to know that you have the best rate because of the time lag involved you will pick the best one you can work with but the rates can change every day   even when you lock in the rates other companies can drift lower once you have started down the application process you will reach a point where switching companies will cost you time and money once you decide to purchase a house the contract usually only gives you a few weeks to prove that you have financing in place therefore you will have to start the process before deciding on the house some advance work is needed to give you an idea of the maximum monthly payment you can afford which will then based on the rate and down payment determine the maximum house you can buy i have had good luck with my credit union but there is no guarantee that yours will be competitive keep in mind that while rates are very important some people also value customer service and also like that the mortgage wo n't be sold to out of town investors

well yes it does but just because the debt is trading at 80 cents on the dollar does n't mean that the company can actually legally get away with paying only 80 cents on the dollar they would have to come to an agreement with the debt holders first and perhaps they could but the more conservative approach is to use the book value of the debt   or what about debt that 's trading at a premium to its face value because say interest rates have come down relative to the time the debt was issued the amount that the owes to the debt holders has n't suddenly gone up

the price of a share of a mutual fund is its net asset value nav before the payout of dividends and capital gain distribution the fund was holding both stock shares and cash that resulted from dividends and capital gains after the payout a share only holds the stock therefore once the cash is paid out the nav must drop by the same amount as was paid out per share thus of course assumes no other activity or valuation changes of the underlying assets regular market activity will obscure what the payout does to the nav

i just read the article and i 'm not sure if the calculation is flawed when they look at the single stocks do they always reinvest the dividends to the same stock that would be quite unusual behaviour i think   an investor who uses the buy and hold strategy   might have a bunch of companies which wo n't exist anymore in 20 or 30 years e.g. coal plants   while many stocks are a good investment now reinvesting all the dividends for decades is obviously a bad decision for a large portion of the stocks   maybe i misunderstood the article but what do you guys think

oh give me a break this argument asserts that people can never from the career path they chose at 17 when applying for universities it 's also inconsistent to state that veterans regardless of whether they studied it or cybersecurity are qualified then go on to state that only people who studied it in university are qualified this argument asserts that all adult education and job retraining efforts are for naught and that experience on the job is less important than the primary focus of study decades ago     seriously give me a break and join the real world   i 'm not making any claim as to her competence in the role because there were clearly severe mistakes made but the idea that decades old coursework in a constantly changing field is somehow more valuable than recent experience is ludicrous    should i fire my dba who has a law degree since despite his 25 years it experience he clearly does n't have any interest in   should i fire my pm who was a non degree holding housewife until entering the workforce eight years ago after her divorce   should i promote my mba holding marine to head risk amp compliance since military experience is apparently more applicable than the finance degree of the person who currently holds the role   the only thing at issue here is whether she has training or certifications hired experienced experts for key roles built a culture of and honesty followed best practices and built a competent organization   her actions are what speak to her inability to properly manage her organization what undergraduate degree she holds does n't matter one

the future shares will be fewer in number yet have claim to less cash in the bank all in all there 's little reason the shares would rise in value   say there are 1 m shares trading at $ 10 market cap is $ 10 m of course now there happens to be $ 2 m cash in the bank so each share had about $ 2 cash by taking the $ 2 m and buying 200 k shares 800 k shares remain but why would you think they 'd be valued at $ 12.50 the same $ 10 value per share is now an $ 8 m market cap as $ 2 m has been disbursed no less so than if it were given out in a dividend

in addition to the difference pointed out by dheer see also this wikipedia link another meaning is that private bankers are those people on the bank staff who deal with personal accounts and people who wish to deposit money in the bank while the people who use the deposits to loan money to businesses underwrite bond issues etc are called investment bankers or sometimes merchant bankers since these staff members deal primarily with merchants or invest the bank 's deposits in various ways

i am a firm believer in the idea of limiting debt as much as possible   i would not recommend borrowing money for anything other than a reasonably sized mortgage   as a result my recommendations are going to be geared toward that goal the top priorities for me then would be to make sure first that we do n't have to go further into debt and second that we eliminate the debt that we already have as soon as possible here is how i would rate your list a small emergency fund perhaps $ 1000 usd is going to ensure that while you are funding other things you do n't end up so cash poor that if something unexpected and urgent comes up you are forced to add to your credit card debt   make this small fund your top priority and it should n't take much more than a month or two to do it getting out of debt is important but if your employer hands out free money you have to take it   it is just too good of a deal get rid of this debt as fast as possible   when you are done you 'll have more income available to you than you 've ever had before now that you have just gotten done eliminating your debt as fast as possible do n't stop there   take the income you had been throwing at your debt and build up your emergency fund to a few months worth of your expenses   finishing this fund up will enable you to withstand a small crisis without borrowing anything you are now in a very strong position financially and can confidently invest   deciding which type of retirement account is best for you depends on the details of your situation once you are contributing a healthy amount to your retirement funds you may want to consider paying off your mortgage early as i said before i recommend getting down to the last step as quickly as possible   depending on how much debt you actually have if you sacrifice for a year or two you could be debt free and in a position to keep all of your investment gains   if you take your time paying off debt like many people do you could find yourself 10 years from now still making payments on your loans still making car payments and still needlessly sending interest to the banks eating away at the gains you are making in your investments if you are n't committed to eliminating your debt quickly and plan on having payments for a long time then skip this advice and put retirement savings at the top

well consider this even if you bought some at every all time high prior to this one you would have still made a profit i was kicking myself when i passed up an opportunity to buy some at $ 30 after its wild ride up to $ 1,200 and subsequent fall i made sure to start buying around $ 250 bitcoin is not going away there are hundreds of different cryptos out there but bitcoin is the gold standard and it is becoming more every day regulators and governments passed it off as a fad for years but are now paying attention because people are actually using it to get around all kinds of bottlenecks that exist due to the structure of the current global banking system if you feel like it will continue to be used more extensively and become more scarce over the next several years then it is probably worth investing at least something into it of course never invest more than you can afford to lose   full disclosure i hold some bitcoin but i am mostly in ethereum right now because i think there is greater potential there bitcoin is pretty expensive right now and ethereum is still catching up to it in market cap i think we will see some great practical uses for it in the coming years there are already some major players involved including the russian state owned banks

the fed currently has interests rates pegged at all time historic lows why is this to generate inflation our economy is currently and has been for almost ten years dangerously close to a deflationary spiral paying out pension funds will likely generate some inflation but that is good taking away people 's pension funds is theft they worked for years to earn those pensions if inflation halves the value of the dollar getting some money is still far better than none at all what you are asking is basically a combination of murder and theft in order to prevent something that we are trying to achieve reasonable inflation

in general when companies are regarded as hot growth stocks they are expected to keep up an accelerated level of growth for a good long time that accelerated growth justifies a high pe relative to a slow growth stock when companies that are supposed to grow miss expectations or worse lose money the markets punish the stock severely particularly if the company does n't make analysts aware of problems early on netflix is a great example of a company a few different business problems creating a much bigger one in the process a poorly conceived rate hike killed the reliable cash flow of the company and that crazy thing just confused everyone now nobody trusts the management blackberry is another example of a high performing company that just screwed up damaging shareholders in the process we 're living in a very challenging era today but growth stocks are always risky by nature growing a company rapidly is very difficult

it can be difficult when all your disposable income is spoken for   your options depend on how good your credit is and how flexible your expenses are   i do n't have all the answers without more details possibly not then   however couple of points of advice paying off that credit card debt and not adding any more to it is your 1 priority   you should make minimum payments to every other debt until you have done that because the interest on it will kill you in the mean time   it is always optimal to pay the maximum to your highest interest debt and minimum to all other debts 11 does n't sound very good on your house loan   you may want to consider refinancing   that is if you can get a lower rate   you may also want to get a longer term loan if you have enough discipline to use the extra income to actually pay off your credit card and then the put it toward the house when the cards are paid off look at options to increase your income at least temporarily   second jobs and such   when your finances are more in order you can back off the debt trap is behavioral   we humans tend to increase our spending until we ca n't any more   but the reason we ca n't spend any more is that we have increased our debt until we have no flexible income   then we are stuck for a long time and have few options the only way out long term is to change our habits so that we do n't increase spending each time we pay down a debt or get an increase to our income   financial discipline is the only way to have financial security   almost always the first step is to pay off credit cards and stop maintaining a balance always pay off every card at the end of each month   then start paying off other debts from highest interest rate to lowest this is a hard challenge and one most of us face at some point in our lives   good luck

in a similar situation i wrote about how i made $ 4,000 + on a cash back credit card offer the total was actually $ and was from an insane offer from a new credit card my bank advertised 10 cash back on all spending during the first 90 days i wondered if gift card purchases counted and more than store cards i saw that visa gift cards with a $ 500 value sold for a $ 4.95 fee a 1 hit   it would have been foolish to load up and realize that they were somehow excluded so i bought 2 and followed the transaction on line when i saw the 10 credit i went full steam and bought these $ 2000 at a time as that was the limit cvs imposed in the end i stopped at $ 50,000 and the bank killed the online offer about $ 25 k into this but still honored my 90 days yes i had to make payments mid cycle to avoid the card limit $ 20 k but in the end the bit of effort paid off it took a bit over a year and a half to burn through them in hindsight i 'd do it for $ 100 k if the opportunity came up cash in the bank is earning near zero     tl dr make a small purchase and confirm your card gives you the bonus you expect

you should definately have a stop loss in place to manage your risk for a time frame of 5 to 10 years i would be looking at a trailing stop loss of 20 to 25 off the recent high   another type of stop you could use is a volatility stop here the more volatile the stock the larger the stop whilst the less volatile the stock the smaller the stop you could use 3 or 4 x weekly average true range to achieve this the reason you should always use a stop loss is because of what can happen and what did happen in 2008 some stock markets have yet to fully recover from their peaks at the end of 2007 almost 9 years later what would you do if you were planning to hold your positions for 5 years and then withdrawal your funds at the end of june 2021 for a particular purpose and suddenly in february 2021 the market starts to fall by the time june comes the market has fallen by over 50 and you do n't have enough funds available for the purpose you planned for instead if you were using a trailing stop loss you would manage to keep at least 75 of the peak of your portfolio you could even spend 10 minutes each week to monitor your portfolio for warning signs that a downtrend may be around the corner and adjust your trailing stop to maybe 10 in these situations protecting 90 of the peak of your portfolio if the downtrend does not you can adjust your trailing back to a higher percentage if you do get stopped out and shortly after the market recovers then you can always buy back in or look for other stocks and etfs to replace them sure you might lose a bit of profits if this happens but it should always be part of your investment plan and risk management how you will handle these situation if you are not using stop losses risk management and money management you are essentially gambling if you say i am going to buy these stocks and etfs hold them for 10 years and then sell them then you are just hoping to make gains which is essentially gambling

candle stick patterns are generally an indication of possible short term changes in price direction if a reversal pattern a doji is such a reversal candle and should be read as there could be a short term change in the direction of price action a doji is most effective at peaks or and the outcome can be a higher probability if during overbought conditions at the peak or during oversold conditions at the trough so a doji should be used for short term changes in direction and not a total change in the overall trend although there could be a doji at the very top of an uptrend or at the very bottom of a downtrend we would n't know it was the change of the trend until price action confirms it   the definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows the definition of a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs so an uptrend will not be broken until we have a lower high and confirmed by a lower low or a lower low confirmed by a lower high similarly a downtrend will not be broken until we have a higher low confirmed by a higher high or a higher high followed by a higher low another thing to consider is that doji 's and other candle stick work best when the market is trending even if they are only short term trends you should usually wait for confirmation of the change in direction by only taking a long trade if price moves above the high of the doji or only taking a short trade if price moves below the low of the doji

most of the recommendations are just total market allocations   within domestic stocks the performance sometimes large cap outperform sometimes small cap outperform you can see the chart here examine year by year   conventional wisdom is to buy the entire market if large cap currently make up 80 of the market you would allocate 80 of domestic stocks to large cap   same case with international stocks developed if japan and uk make up the largest market internationally then so be it   similar case with domestic bonds it is usually total bond market allocation in the beginning   then there is the question of when you want to withdraw the money if you are withdrawing in a couple years you do not want to expose too much to currency risks thus you would allocate less to international markets if you are investing for retirement you will get the total world market   then there is the question of risk tolerance bonds are somewhat negatively correlated with stocks when stock dips by 5 in a month bonds might go up by 2 under normal circumstances they both go upward bond stock allocation ratio is by age i ’m sure you knew that already   then there is the case of modern portfolio theory there will be slight adjustments to the etf weights if it is found that adjusting them would give a smaller portfolio variance while sacrificing small gains you can try it yourself using excel solver   there is a strategy called sector rotation google it and you will find examples of the winners periodically it is difficult to time the rotation but healthcare has somehow consistently outperformed nonetheless those recommendations you mentioned are likely to be market allocations again   the robo advisors list out every asset allocation in detail to make you feel overwhelmed and resort to using their service in extreme cases they can even break down the holdings to digit standard industrial classification codes or break down the bond duration etc   some robo advisors would suggest you as many etf as possible to increase trade commissions if it is n’t commission free for example suggesting you to buy vb instead a vti

the time value decay is theoretically constant   in reality it is driven by supply and demand just like everything else in the market    for instance if a big earnings announcement is coming out after the close for the day you may see little or no time decay in the price of the options during the day before also while in theory options have a set value as related to the trading price of the underlying security that does not mean there will always be a buyer willing to pay a premium as they come close to expiration in the last few minutes you ca n't forget to account for the transaction fees associated with buying the options or the risk factor involved    it is rare but there are times i 've actually had to sell in the money calls at a penny or two less than they 're actually worth at the time just to unload them in the last few minutes before the market closed on expiration day

judging from your comments you seem to be confused about the way banking works   banks can only lend out money that they actually have whether from deposits or investors or loans taken from other banks government entities   the rules on how this works varies from country to country but the principle is always the same   there is no magic money let 's imagine a closed system   there 's only one town and that town only has one bank   there are 100 people total in town and each has $ 10,000   everyone deposits all of their money in the bank the bank now has $ 1,000,000 in total deposits   you take a loan for $ 100,000 and buy a house   the bank now has $ 900,000   you make your payments of $ per month $ 833 of interest and $ 132 toward principal   in this ideal world the bank has no costs associated with doing business   after one month the bank has $ 1,000,000 in deposits $ in cash on hand $ in loans and $ 833 in profit from interest now here 's the confusing part   you bought a house from someone   that person also lives in town   he takes the $ 100,000 you gave him and deposits it in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit assume 10 more people buy houses at $ 100,000 each taking loans for that whole amount for the same terms you did   assume those sellers then deposit the money back in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit   the bank is taking in $ per month $ x 11 in loan payments making profit of $ $ 833 x 11 per month from interest this process of loans and deposits and payments can go on forever without any outside influence   this is the primary way money is created   it 's like printing money without the paper of course we 're not in a closed system   banks are limited in endlessly creating money primarily by two things reserve requirements are set by government agencies   they might say banks can lend until their cash on hand or liquid equivalent is at minimum 35 of total deposits   so a bank with $ 1,000,000 in deposits would have to keep $ 350,000 in cash at any given time capital requirements work largely the same way   it 's more the bank saying what happens if a bunch of people want their deposits back   they plan a reasonable amount of cash to have on hand for that scenario

a fascinating view on this the math of a 10 deposit and projected 10 return lead to an inevitable point when the account is worth 10x your income nice and the deposit 10 of income only represents 1 of the account balance   the use of an ira is neither here nor there as your proposed deposit is still just 1 of your retirement account total pay off debt for one with this level of savings it should be assumed you are n't carrying any high interest debt   it really depends on your age and retirement budget our number was our final income so at 10x we were still saving for you if you project hitting your number soon enough i 'd still deposit to the match but maybe no more it might be time to just enjoy the extra money for others their goal may be much higher and those extra years deposits are still needed i 'd play with a spreadsheet and see the impact of reduced retirement account deposits note the question asks about funding the 401(k vs paying down debt i 'd always advise to deposit to the match but beyond that one should focus on their high interest debt especially by their 50 's

your questions in the world of technical analysis is candlestick charting an effective trading tool in timing the markets it depends on how you define effective but as a standalone and systematic strategy it tends not to be profitable see for example market timing with candlestick technical analysis using robust statistical techniques we find that candlestick trading rules are not profitable when applied to djia component stocks over period neither bullish or bearish candlestick single lines or patterns provide market timing signals that are any better than what would be expected by chance basing ones trading decisions solely on these techniques does not seem sensible but we can not rule out the possibility that they compliment some other market timing techniques there are many other papers that come to the same conclusion if used correctly how accurate can they be in picking turning points in the market technical analysts generally fall into two camps i those that argue that ta ca n't be fully automated and that interpretation is part of the game ii those that use ta as part of a systematic investment model automatically executed by a machine but generally use a combination of indicators to build a working model both groups would argue for different reasons that the conclusions of the paper i quoted above should be disregarded and that ta can be applied profitably with the proper framework psychological biases it is very easy to get impressed by technical analysis because we all suffer from confirmation bias whereby we tend to acknowledge things that confirm our beliefs more than those that contradict them when looking at a chart it is very easy to see all the when a certain pattern worked and miss the when it did not work and not missing those is much harder than it sounds conclusions

in my experience there 's usually only one or two theatres within a small city maybe a few more in larger cities but those are also larger areas so there really is n't much competition sure there are other places to get popcorn but not movie theatre popcorn it wo n't be with 4000 calories worth of tasty butter and salt even if you make it at home that can be difficult to accomplish and then you have to invest the time to make it besides when i go to the movies i do n't go just to see a movie if i just want to see a movie i can watch it at home the junk food they sell is part of the experience even then people do their own food into theatres all the time but it 's hard to in a bag of popcorn and again ordinary popcorn just is n't the same so i think the answer boils down to it 's expensive because people are willing to pay for it and they 're willing to pay for it because it 's not really available elsewhere at any better price and it 's part of what they come for

no my argument is that our system is designed to allow the executive and judicial branch to legislate if the legislative branch ca n't legislate might not be the appropriate word but a decision from the executive branch becomes defacto law if the judicial branch determines that    1 legislation exists allowing the executive branch to make that call as is the case with nlrb    or    2 it does n't conflict with current legislation    after that point its up to the legislative branch to pass a law that negates it     that is just a fact of our system of government yes its fucking anti democracy as hell but imo its less terrible than having no legislation passed

derivatives derive their value from underlying assets   this is expressed by the obligation of at least one counterparty to trade with the other counterparty in the future   these can take on as many combinations as one can dream up as it is a matter of contract for futures where two parties are obligated to trade at a specific price at a specific date in the future one buyer one seller if you short a future you have entered into a contract to sell the underlying at the time specified   if the price of the future moves against you goes up you will have to sell at a loss   the bigger the move the greater the loss   you go ahead and pay this as well as a little extra to be sure that you satisfy what you owe due to the future   this satisfaction is called margin if there were n't margin people could take huge losses on their derivative bets not pay and disrupt the markets   making sure that the money that will trade is already there makes the markets run smoothly it 's the same for shorting stocks where you borrow the stock sell it and wait   you have to leave the money with the broker as well as deposit a little extra to be sure you can make good if the market moves to a large degree against you

the answer likely depends a bit on which state you are in but this should be true for most states   i do n't know anything about pennsylvania specifically unfortunately the affordable care act created the shop marketplace which allows small businesses to effectively form larger groups for group coverage purposes   shop stands for small business health options program and requires only one common law employee on payroll this would effectively allow you to offer group coverage without having a group   talk to your tax accountant for more details as this is still very new and not necessarily well understood there are some other options all of which i would highly suggest talking to a tax accountant about as well   health reimbursement accounts allow the employer to set aside pre tax funds for the employee to use for approved medical expenses they 're often managed by a benefits company say wageworks etc   that would allow your employee to potentially pick a higher deductible health plan which offers poorer coverage on the individual marketplace with after tax dollars and then supplement with your there are also the concept of employer payment plans where the employer reimburses the employee for their insurance premiums but those are not compatible with the aca for the most part although there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether it 's possible to have something effectively the same work see for example this page versus this for example

this is precisely the problem   economic contraction scared people   so instead of continuing making promises they started paying off the promises they had for fear that something in the future would make it so they could n't   this resulted in increased economic contraction because it became more difficult to trade money for service because people basically valued paying off debt more than the service   the biggest issue is that neither position is wrong yet they do n't work well together   people paying off debt is fine so long as there is money for services and people paying for service is fine so long as they do n't rack up more debt than they can pay   really it 's the transitions that always get us   further these transitions are constantly repeated which is why the economic data so often displays patterns

i 'm going to assume that you will spend the money to fix the mold problem correctly   using your numbers after that is done the home is worth perhaps $ 280k to evaluate whether or not to sell the amount you have spent on the house is irrelevant the only thing you need to ask yourself is this would i spend $ 280k to buy this house today you might if you were happy with the rental income that you were getting if the house is fully rented it earns you $ 24k year which is an 8.6 return if you had purchased the house today at $ 280k of course you will have vacancies taxes and other expenses bringing that return number down figure out what that is and see if you are happy with the return based on those numbers   if you decide it would be a bad investment for you at $ 280k then sell the house   by the way this question works for any investment not just real estate when deciding whether or not to sell stock the same thing applies it is irrelevant what your cost basis is you only need to ask yourself if the stock would be a good buy for you at the current price

your freelance income will not qualify you for the work from home deductions for that you would need a form signed by your employer but you are allowed to be self employed as a sole proprietorship while still being an employee of another company if you take that route you 'll be able to write off even more expenses than those you linked to things like a portion of your internet bill can be claimed for example but note that these deductions would only apply to offset the self employment income so if you 're not earning very much from the freelance work it might not be worth all the hassle filing taxes when self employed is definitely more complicated and many people will get professional tax preparation help at least for the first time

my feeling on this is that anything to do with a child and raising a family has to be a joint effort it is very rare that both of you will have exactly the same income or the same time to spend into caring for your family so work out what you can do for us i work 70 + hour weeks my wife works 18 hour weeks far more of my money goes on clothes kids food etc than her money because that is where the bulk of our income is from it 's just part of sharing she does n't feel dependent and when she was on maternity leave 3 times the agreement was that we would just rely on my income i have the same attitude as you it is a shared pool that you each contribute to in your own way and once the essentials are paid for this includes post pregnancy clothing then you can worry about other bits and pieces having said that while most of our finances are shared we do each keep a separate account for buying gifts things for ourselves etc which gives some flexibility

sometimes what is holding us back are barriers which do n't really exist sometimes it is possible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps if only you try but i think conservatives underestimate the difficulties of following a new paradigm    i 've become fascinated by this topic because it ties in with my thoughts on visionary thinking what is it that allows some people to break out of rigid patterns of thought i.e. routines researchers in artificial intelligence are developing interesting theories on how to train neural networks to find new possibilities quicker some of this research might apply to the human mind and how creativity works   anyway i do n't think people can see a way out of poverty when you only present them with hypothetical possibilities i think we need mentoring programs and apprenticeships people can only follow a new paradigm when they have an example before them in other words if they can do it i can do it but when nobody around you is doing it then you are not going to give the possibility much weight no observations support that optimism

first the stock does represent a share of ownership and if you have a different interpretation i 'd like to see proof of that secondly when the ipo or secondary offering happened that put those shares into the market int he first place the company did receive proceeds from selling those shares while others may profit afterward it is worth noting that more than a few companies will have secondary offerings convertible debt incentive stock options and restricted stock that may be used down the road that are all dependent upon the current trading share price in terms of how useful these can be used to fund operations pay executives and so forth third if someone buys up enough shares of the company then they gain control of the company which while you are n't mentioning this case it is something to note as some individuals buy stock so that they can take over the company which happens usually this has more of an overall plan but the idea here is that getting that control of the company 's voting shares are an important piece to things here

i place 90 of the blame on carly and then the board that bitch was primed by her contract to gut and the company   when a board links a ceos remuneration to annual profit it makes unscrupulous individuals do things which have clear and obvious negative long term impacts but which will hike the annual profit for this year and another year or so but then turn badly negative   because carly is a little bitch and wanted to extract as much money as was humanly possible from her position at hp she on the most disastrous set of actions possible   the direct result is what we see now   ceo compensation should never be linked to profitability for an individual year but to their performance throughout their tenure and then beyond   it 's my belief a ceo should take a base salary of no more than 50 times the mean worker 's salary is not the average because that simply encourages the board to enrich the management team rather than the workers   if the company is profitable for a single year ceos should receive a large bonus say no more than 20 times the mean salary at the company   and 3 years after the ceo leaves he 'd be entitled to another round of payments base on long term performance of the company this means ceos have a duty and a very large responsibility to ensure that their replacement is actually a better ceo than they are   when board members leave there 's no incentive to them personally to ensure their replacement is even capable let alone excellent   the other issue i have with ceos is their stock options or stock grants i believe all companies should have strict rules about stock ownership by the board they must own a certain number of shares and those shares must be purchased before they join the board and demonstrably not by any mechanism which the company pays for   directors and officers with no personal investment interest in the performance of the company are a concern

you 're missing the cost of carry aspect the cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity such as grain or metals over a period of time the carrying charge includes insurance storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs in interest rate futures markets it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument so in a nutshell you 'd have to store the gold safely invest your money now i.e. you 're missing out on interests the money could have earned until the futures delivery date   well and on top of that you need to get the gold shipped to london or wherever the agreed delivery place is edit forgot to mention that of course there are arbitrageurs that make sure the futures and spot market prices do n't diverge so the idea is n't that bad as i might have made it sound but being in the arbitrage business myself i should that profits are small and is highly automated so before you spot a $ 1 profit somewhere between any two contracts you can be quite sure it 's been taken by an already

okay savings in a nutshell so take at least year 's worth of rent $ 30k or so maybe more for additional expenses that 's your core emergency fund for when you lose your job or total a few cars or something keep it in a good savings account maybe a cd ladder but the point is it 's liquid and you can get it when you need it in case of emergency replenish it immediately after using it you may lose a little cash to inflation but you need liquidity to protect you from risk it is worth it the rest is long term savings probably for retirement or possibly for a down payment on a home a blended set of stocks and bonds is appropriate with stocks storing most of it if saving for retirement you may want to put the stocks in a tax deferred account if only for the reduced paperwork stocks generate so much having some money especially bonds in something like a roth ira or a non tax advantaged account is also useful as a backup emergency fund because you can withdraw it without penalties take the money out of stocks gradually when you are approaching the time when you use the money if it 's closer than five years do n't use stocks your money should be mostly bonds when you 're about to use it and not 30-year bonds or anything like that either those are sensitive to interest rates in the short term you should have bonds that mature approximately the same time you 're going to use them keep an eye on that if you 're using bond funds which continually roll over that 's basically how any savings goal should work retirement is a little special because it 's sort of like 20 years worth of savings goals so you do n't want all your savings in bonds at the beginning and because you can get fancy tax deferred accounts but otherwise it 's about the same thing college savings likewise there are tools available to help you with this an asset allocation calculator can be found from a variety of sources including most investment firms you can use a target date fund for something this if you 'd like automation there are also a couple things like say vanguard funds from vanguard which target other savings goals you may be able to understand the way these sorts of instruments function more easily than you could other investments you could do a decent job for yourself by just opening up an account at vanguard using their online tool and pouring your money into the stuff they recommend

you do n't offer any specifics so i 'm guessing a little about what you 're talking about but here 's a few thoughts remember that all tax related transactions are reconciled when you file all of your activity for the year is totaled up and for the most part when during the year things happen is irrelevant    your gross taxable income is calculated which will exclude any pre tax activity deduction applied which will any include and post tax deductions tax liability calculated and withholdings subtracted to get your net tax due   whether you have pre tax activity and less tax withheld or after tax activity with a deduction and reduce your net tax the net effect should be the same

this is unfortunately the truth and i spend a lot of time with my clients trying to help them through this process   one of the key metrics that banks judge themselves on is products per household   the more things you have attached to them the less likely you are to leave and they deliberately tie you in with more and more services e.g. direct deposit billpay debit cards credit cards etc   if you want to switch but are held back by the daunting task of all the stuff you need to do it 's easier than most people think and bankers at those smaller banks who are getting your accounts should be more than happy to do about 80 of the work for you   the other 20 can only be done by you personally due to privacy laws but your banker can guide you through that too   a prime example   a customer of mine wanted to switch but he did n't want to go to the old bank to actually wait in line and go through with the nonsense of actually closing the account i see that anxiety over a lot by the way   so i have saved on my desktop a form letter is a simple request by the customer to close their account at bank   they sign it i it and send it off to the branch   the branch of receipt has to close the account per the request   before we send that letter we get everything set up with the new bank draw the old one down to $ 10 or so and give instructions to the old bank to remit a check payable to the customer and mail it to me   then the old account is closed and i just deposit that nominal amount into the customer 's account   the customer literally never has to set foot in the old bank again    the unfortunate thing is that not everyone knows that these kinds of things are even possible that your banker should help you with this stuff or that you can do pretty much everything remotely   plus if you look at the smaller banks and cus these days they have eliminated the need or ubiquity i.e. but their atms are everywhere because a good bank or cu will never allow you to get charged to get your money they will give you the direct line and email address of your branch manager and a lot of places have mobile apps that allow you to deposit checks remotely

i would suggest you forget everything you learned in economics the only applicable knowledge is accounting 101   step 1 an accrual basis financial statement there is no step 2 if you do n't do this most small business do everything cash basis simpler cheaper but useless for analysis you would get better answers from the local fortune teller than a cash basis statement    make one change from the general rules if you have debt or are paying interest for inventory include that in your cost of sales this is actually proper but the rule is little known and often ignored interest on debt up to the amount of inventory is a cost of inventory   step 2 gross profit if you seem to be working hard and still losing money it may be because you are selling products for less than they cost you in this case the more you sell the more you lose so suggestions like advertising or doing anything to increase sales are actually destructive   step 3 price products at the level necessary to turn a profit at current sales and overhead when we have enough sales we will make a profit is the philosophy of a start up business it is toxic for a going concern   step 4 if sales are unsustainable at the price that produces a profit have the courage to sell or close the business i have seen people waste their lives on futile endeavors just because they ca n't make that tough decision   finally step 0 ignore all other suggestions but this they are well meaning but ill informed to reiterate growing sales while losing money on every transaction is a huge mistake trends books charts and graphs analytics and market research are the tools of con men and fortune tellers business is arithmetic and nothing more or less   fyi if i do n't get at least one upvote this is the last time i am giving my valuable professional advice away for free on reddit folks will have to rely on the suggestions of their fellow college kids

presumably the existing house has some value if you the existing house you are destroying that value if the value of the new house is significantly more than the value of the old house like if you 're talking about replacing a small run down old house worth $ 50,000 with a big new mansion worth $ 10,000,000 then the value of the old house that is destroyed might just get lost in the rounding errors for all practical purposes but otherwise i do n't see how you would do this without bringing cash to the table basically equal to what you still owe on the old house presumably the new house is worth more than the old so the value of the property when you 're done will be more than it was before but will the value of the property be more than the old mortgage plus the new mortgage unless the old mortgage was almost paid off or you bring a bunch of cash the answer is almost certainly no note that from the lienholder 's point of view you are not temporarily reducing the value of the property you are permanently reducing it the bank that makes the new loan will have a lien on the new house i do n't know what the law says about this but you would have to either a deliberately destroy property that someone else has a lien on while giving them no compensation or b give two banks a lien on the same property i would n't think either option would be legal   normally when people tear down a building to put up a new building it 's because the value of the old building is so low as to be negligible compared to the value of the new building either the old building is run down and getting it into decent shape would cost more than tearing it down and putting up a new building or at least there is some benefit real or perceived to the new building that makes this worth it

it 's more complicated than that governments raise money in a number of ways   first they tax economic activity within their borders and for connected companies and individuals   then some governments have actual revenues from state owned enterprises licences patents courts business revenues and so on whatever shortage arises between state expenditure and this income is the deficit which is usually financed through debt government usually issues a bond wikipedia for a list of government bonds of various types some with extremely lengthy maturation dates   these bonds can be purchased both locally and by foreign investment funds   the nature of who buys is important from the wikipedia link you 'll see that most government debt is very highly rated based on the ability of the state to simply raise taxes in order to fund redemption   pension funds are legally bound to only invest in highly rated investment classes and the bulk of bonds may be purchased to support local pensioners a state that defaults on debt will first hit its own most vulnerable citizens   in addition the fall out will result in a cut in ratings   countries like argentina and zimbabwe which have both refused to repay their debts even to the imf are currently unable to raise investment at all   this has a tremendous impact on local economic development so default is out of the question without severe penalties the second part of your question is about paying down the debt   as debts increase more and more of the revenue that a country does earn is spent on servicing debt repayments   sometimes bonds are issued merely to refinance old debt   a country that spends too much on refinancing debt is no different from an individual   less and less money is available to do other things in conclusion governments can neither default nor binge borrow unless they wish to severely limit economic opportunities for their citizens

corporate taxes   mises daily wednesday july 09 2008 by sterling t.     lower corporate taxes are associated with economic growth this can be shown a and empirically   a   corporate taxes reduce the profits of business owners this is true because net income is reduced by the tax rate for example firm x with a $ 100 investment earning a 7 return has an income before taxes of $ 7 with a 10 corporate tax rate net income after taxes is $ firm x now has earned a 6.3 return in contrast a corporate tax rate of 40 reduces net income after taxes by $ 2.80 to $ or a 4.2 after tax return this rise in taxes on the margin reduces the profit seeking incentive to take business risks why risk starting a biotech company when inflation protected t bill 's will give you the same return entrepreneurs and venture capitalists less willing to take risk means less innovation and fewer innovative ideas being economically viable this results in less economic growth conversely higher returns on invested capital encourage investment and savings all of this leads to more capital savings more innovation better technology and higher wages   further the above example of firm x is true if the firm does not have the pricing ability to transfer the tax to its customers if the ability does exist an increase in the corporate tax rate is really a tax on customers of the firm in this case consumers now have less to spend and save and the end result is the same   finally a firm unable to pass on a tax increase or bear the reduced profit will either attempt to cut costs by reducing wages among other costs or be forced to go out of business   the main point is this by definition corporations do not pay taxes people pay taxes a corporate tax is either a tax on shareholders of the firm customers of the firm or employees of the firm less corporate tax means more innovation capital savings and spending by these groups also known as economic growth   empirically   after theory and logic tell us what is true can confirm our result   thankfully professors young lee university and gordon uc san diego have done the work for us in a 2005 journal article they concluded   this paper finds that the corporate tax rate is significantly negatively correlated with economic growth in a cross section data set of 70 countries during controlling for many other of economic growth   more specifically they continue the estimates suggest that cutting the corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points can increase the annual growth rate by around   using these figures andrew of the tax foundation   by cutting the u.s. 's combined federal and average state corporate tax rate from roughly 40 percent to 30 percent we could boost u.s. economic growth by around 1.1 percent per year enough to double our nation 's wealth every 63   even better a cut from the actual corporate tax rate of 35 to a rate of 10 would double our nation 's wealth every 30 years   life savers moved production to canada industries and tyco international moved to has announced a move to dubai in a economy is it really a puzzle that firms prefer to operate in lower taxing less regulated environments   these are examples of what can be seen as reminds us however it is imperative to also account for what can not be seen what would the wealth of our nation be today if the corporate tax rate had always been 10 or less what creature comforts would have been what new technologies brought to market what diseases cured   due to a history of high corporate taxes these answers are not known and we are worse off because of it   sterling t. is a ph.d. candidate in the department of agricultural and applied economics at texas tech university

first of all it 's great you 're now taking full advantage of your employer match i.e. free money next on the question of the use of a life cycle target date fund as a hedge life cycle funds were introduced for hands off one stop shopping investors who do n't like a hassle or do n't understand   such funds are gaining in popularity employers can use them as a default choice for automatic enrollment which results in more participation in retirement savings plans than if employees had to opt in   i think life cycle funds are a good innovation for that reason but the added service and convenience typically comes with higher fees   if you are going to be hands off make sure you 're cost conscious   fees can devastate a portfolio 's performance in your case it sounds like you are willing to do some work for your portfolio   if you are confident that you 've chosen a good equity glide path that is the initial and final stock bond allocations and the rebalancing plan to get from one to the other   then you 're not going to benefit much by having a life cycle fund in your portfolio duplicating your own effort with inferior components   i assume you are selecting great low cost liquid index funds for your own strategy   life cycle are neat but replicating them is n't rocket science however i see a few cases in which life cycle funds may still be useful even if one has made a decision to be more involved in portfolio construction similar to your case you have a company savings plan that you 're taking advantage of because of a matching contribution   chances are your company plan does n't offer a wide variety of funds   since a life cycle fund is available it can be a good choice for that account   but make sure fees are n't out of hand   if much lower cost equity and bond funds are available consider them instead let 's say you had another smaller account that you were unable to consolidate into your main account   e.g. a traditional ira vs. your roth and you did n't necessarily want to convert it   even if that account had access to a wide variety of funds it still might not be worth the added hassle or trading costs of owning and rebalancing multiple funds inside the smaller account   there perhaps the life cycle fund can help you out while you use your own strategy in your main account finally let 's assume you had a single main account and you buy partially into the idea of a life cycle fund and you find a great one with low fees except you want a bit of something else in your portfolio not provided by the life cycle fund e.g. some more emerging markets international or commodity stock exposure   is this one reason you 're doing it yourself in that case where the life cycle fund does n't quite have everything you want you could still use it for the bulk of the portfolio e.g. 85 95 and then select one or two specific additional etfs to complement it   just make sure you factor in those additional components into the overall equity weighting and adjust your life cycle fund choice accordingly e.g. perhaps go more conservative in the life cycle to compensate i hope that helps additional references

first i want to point out that your question contains an assumption does anyone make significant money trading low volume stocks   i 'm not sure this is the case i 've never heard of a hedge fund trading in the pink sheets for example second if your assumption is valid here are a few ideas how it might work accumulate slowly exit slowly   this wo n't work for short term swings but if you feel like a low volume stock will be a longer term winner you can accumulate a sizable portion in small enough chunks not to swing the price and then slowly unwind your position when the price has increased sufficiently create additional buyers sellers   your frustration may be one of the reasons low volume stock is so full of scammers pumping and dumping read any investing message board to see examples of this   if you can scare holders of the stock into selling you can buy significant portions without driving the stock price up   similarly if you can convince people to buy the stock you can unload without destroying the price   this is of course morally and legally dubious so i would not recommend this practice

your mortgage represents a negative cash flow of $ x for n months the typical mortgage prepayment does n't reduce your next payment but does reduce the length of the mortgage if you look at the amortization table of a 30 year loan you might see a payment of $ 1000 but only $ 50 going to principal so if on day one you send an extra $ 51 or so to the bank you find that in 30 years you just saved that $ 1000 payment in effect it was a long term bond or cd yielding the post tax rate of the mortgage say your loan were 7 at 7 money doubles every 10 years or so 30 years is 3 doubles or if i were to offer you $ 1000 and ask for $ 7500 in 30 years you might accept it with an agreement to buy me out if you refinanced for me that would be an investment just like buying a bond in fact there is a real return as you see the cash flow at the end the payments not made are your payback   those who insist it 's not an investment are correct in the strict sense of the word 's definition but pedantic for the fact in practice the prepayment is a choice to be considered alongside other investment choices when i have a mortgage i am the the bank the mortgagee same as a company issuing a bond the bank holds my bond and i 'm making payments to them they hold my bond as an investment there is no question of that in fact they package these and sell them as groups of mortgages a pre payment is me buying back the last coupon on my mortgage i fail to see the distinction between me buying back $ 10 k in future coupons on my own loan or me investing $ 10 k in someone else 's loans   the real question for me is whether this makes sense when rates are so low at 4 i 'd say it 's a matter of prioritizing any high rate debt and any other investments that might yield more but even so it 's an investment yielding 4   over the years i 've developed the priorities of where to put new money the priorities are debatable i have my opinion and my reasons to back them up in general it 's a balance between risk and return in my opinion there 's something wrong with ignoring a dollar for dollar match on the 401(k in most circumstances others seem to prefer being 100 debt free before saving at all there 's a balance that might be different for each individual as i started the mortgage is a fixed return with no chance to just get it back if needed if your cash savings is pretty high and the choice is a .001 cd or prepay a 4 mortgage i 'd use some funds to pay it down but not to the point you have no liquid reserves

p e is a pretty poor way to value the company as it exists today   the company generates free cash flow yield of 2.5 3.3 which is n't remarkably high but it 's not nearly as bad as the earnings yield of 1.1   but let 's operate within the p e ratio for right now   the company sells $ 40 billion of stuff each year with a net margin of 2   if they increased prices on every product by 1 which really would n't be that noticeable their profit would grow 50   thus p e drops from 90 to 60     sga expenses equal ~20 of their operating costs   cut 5 of sga and you get the same 1 increase in net margin   this could come from cost cutting today or by greater economies of scale in the future while keeping prices the same     so yes it 's priced as a growth firm but it does n't necessarily need customer growth in the traditional sense to be fairly valued

fund rebalancing typically refers to changing the investment mix to stay within the guidelines of the mutual fund objective   for example lets say a fund is supposed to have at least 20 in bonds   because of a dramatic increase in stock price and decrease in bond values it finds itself with only 19.9 in bonds at the end of the trading day   the fund manager would sell sufficient equities to reduce its equity holdings and buy more bonds    rebalancing is not always preferential because it could cause capital gain distribution typically once per year without selling the fund   and really any trading within the fun could do the same in the case you cite the verbiage is confusing   often times i wonder if the author knows less then the reader   it might also be a bit of a rush to get the article out and the author did not write correctly i agree that the etfs cited are suitable for short term traders   however that is because the market has increased in value over the long term   if you bet it will go down over the long term you are almost certain to lose money like you i can not figure out how rebalancing makes this suitable only for short term traders   if the etfs distribute capital gains events much more frequently then once per year that is worth mentioning but does not provide a case for short versus long term traders    secondly i do n't think these funds are doing true rebalancing   they might change investments daily for the most likely profitable outcome but that really is n't rebalancing    it seems the author is confused

as in most anti living wage   editorials there is a lot of here   first the workers are not minimum wage in the sense that increasing the minimum wage will not increase their wages   second the article cites that one worker claimed to be making $ 2 and hour less in tips before the law was enacted with wages unchanged that seems like pretty strong evidence that tipping behavior is ultimately independent of the minimum wage   finally the article cites studies that show that workers that rely on tips have higher poverty levels than those that do n't   so while the article appears to be an editorial opposed to increasing minimum wage a more objective look at the evidence presented suggests that the minimum wage should be increased and that is either a bit of an idiot or he recognizes that as a non minimum wage earner he benefits from the inequality of a lower minimum wage

yes you are assuming that everything remains equal except for a decrease in revenue more than likely what you will see happen and what is expected to happen is a decrease in benefits along with a decrease in revenue so rather than say revenue of 1000 and payout of 1000 it would become something more like revenue of 750 and payout of 750 and then maybe further down the road revenue 600 and payout 600 but it is unlikely that we continue to see revenue of 750 and payout of 1000 this is a very very simple explanation and i 'm sure someone could use better numbers but i think it illustrates why we wo n't see social security go bankrupt

frequently selling and buying properties is generally not advisable in germany due to the high cost for property purchase tax and land registration fees you can generally assume that ever time you trade homes you pay about 10 extra so it is likely a good idea to keep your property and rent it out while you do n't need it so you can use the rent to pay for your new room that 's especially true if you expect the property to increase in value also due to the low interest rate right now real estate is practically the only good capital investment a 85k asset which makes you each year is a return of investment of any financial asset promising you that kind of dividend at the moment is likely equivalent to gambling yes i ignored maintenance costs but it 's still a really good deal if you want to rent out your flat as stress free as possible give it to a property management company in exchange for a percentage of the monthly rent they will take care of all the small stuff like hiring to fix broken toilets you might still have to pay for really expensive investments though like replacing a leaking roof but when something like that happens you should have no issue to finance it with a loan because you have a real estate as a security   however keep in mind that the german tenancy law might make it difficult but not impossible to get rid of the tenant in case you want to move back into the apartment google for more details should you decide after your study that you do n't want to move back you can always sell the flat with the tenant but rented properties usually get far lower prices on the real estate market than empty ones regarding covering your cost of living besides rent during your studies if you are eligible for state sponsored student loan you should take it because it 's an offer simply too good to refuse it 's literally free money but unfortunately you are not because you own too much real estate wealth you are not living in but you should ask your bank for a loan backed by said property that way you will likely pay far less interest than with a regular private student loan which is n't backed by anything except the hope for a relevant degree

sorry my response was supposed to be to the above comment not yours my main point was that in africa where there was already a large population did not require bringing in people which you would need to incentivize to move to hence offering the free carrot of property rights to settlers of na to extract resources instead the british and other european powers just used the local populace to extract the resources the main reason the us and canada are well off is that property rights were established very early on and this encouraged people to invest and produce more because the higher production accrued to the producer and the producer would have legal recourse should a negative externality be put upon them by someone else obviously there were other reasons as well but property rights are huge this is true globally now in encouraging people to grow their assets part of the reason africa is still so screwed up is that many of their institutions and governments are too corrupt to protect their citizens property rights thereby discouraging investment and production

i assume that whatever you 're holding has lost a considerable amount of its value then what sort of instrument are we talking about if the margin call is 14k on something you borrowed against the you 're a bit more leveraged than just another 100 the trading company you 're using should be able to tell you exactly what happens if you ca n't cover the margin call but my hunch is that selling and taking the cash out ceased to be an option roughly at the time they issued the margin call being labelled as a day trader or not most likely did not have anything to do with that margin call they 're normally issued when one or more of your leveraged trades tank and you do n't have enough money in the account to cover the shortfall not trying to sound but the fact that you needed to ask this question suggests to me that you should n't have traded with borrowed money in the first place

i 'm not sure about the preventing you may be right but the usa basically prevents people from going to college of they are too poor even if they have the grades so which is more disgusting grade based admissions or wealth based admissions   in israel you can go to college if you did n't have the top grades but you might need to pay more and go to a worse school so i do n't know where you 're talking about   as for best universities those were created while encouraging kids to go how long will that last if the usa starts discouraging education not long   i think back to that scene in the movie inception where the guy 's older self tells him i 'm from the future you should go to china

your senses are good a good friend would not put you in such a position it 's simple to skirt some issue we 'll get to that in a second you are being asked to lie all for a 15 return on your $ $ $ $ < < < how much is that   you can easily lend him the money and have a better paper trail but the bank is not going to like that and requires this money from friends or family to be a gift i 've heard mortgage guys at the bank say it 's just a formality we need this paperwork to sell the loan to the investors these bankers belong in jail or at least fired and barred from the industry they broke the economy in 2008 and should be stopped from doing it again

evaluate if the rs 5 million term insurance is sufficient typically the term insurance provided by employer is in the range of 1 to 3 times the gross generally one should be covered in the range of 5 to 10 times the gross the sooner you start the lesser the premium and you can get insured for a large amount for a long duration at very nominal rate   note   you can also buy a health insurance for your father note these typically come at high cost generally if over 70 years of age 25 is the premium amount and 25 as co pay so if your dad does n't fall ill once in 3 years its a loss making proposition edit accident insurance best take is along with rider on term plan additional health insurance is a good idea and helps if you are in between jobs plus the new company health insurance can reject a particular treatment as pre existing i.e. certain illness in certain plans require one to have coverage for 3 years before the claim for it can be covered

i 'm thinking about visiting the uk and i 'm wondering which things are affected by the vat and which are not most consumer goods are subject to vat at the standard rate most food sold in shops is zero rated with the exception of a handful of luxury foods food in cafes restaurants and some takeaway food is subject to vat at the standard rate most paper books are zero rated iirc books that come with cds are an exception   some services are exempt insurance is a notable one so are some transactions with charities some small and sole traders may not be vat registered in which case there is no vat for you to pay but they ca n't reclaim vat on the goods and services they buy there is a distinction between zero rated and exempt but it 's not to you as a customer some goods have special rules notably second hand goods   prices are normally given inclusive of vat the exception to this is suppliers who mostly deal in business to business transactions also as a non uk resident is there a way to get a rebate reimbursement on this tax there is something called the retail export scheme which can get you a refund but there are a number of catches
