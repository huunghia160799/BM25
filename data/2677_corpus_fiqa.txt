i do n't think anyone can give you a definitive answer without knowing all about your situation but some things to consider if you are on a 1099 you have to pay self employment tax while on a w-2 you do not that is social security tax is 12.4 of your income if you 're a 1099 you pay the full 12.4 if you 're w-2 you pay 6.2 and the employer pays 6.2 so if they offer you the same nominal rate of pay you 're 6.2 better off with the w-2 what sort of insurance could you get privately and what would it cost you i have no idea what the going rates for insurance are in california if you 're all in generally good health you might want to consider a high deductible policy then if no one gets seriously sick you 've saved a bunch of money on premiums if someone does get sick you might still pay less paying the deductible than you would have paid on higher premiums i wo n't go into further details as that 's getting off into another question even if the benefits are poor if there are any benefits at all it can be better than nothing the only advantage i see to going with a 1099 is that if you are legally an independent contractor then all your business expenses are deductible while if you are an employee there are sharp limits on deducting employee business expenses maybe others can think of other advantages if there is some reason to go the 1099 route i understand that setting up an llc is not that hard i 've never done it but i briefly looked into it once and it appeared to basically be a matter of filling out a form and paying a modest fee

the tax savings of being 1099 can be significant   it depends on your salary and what you can deduct   you may want to consult with an accountant    the social security tax for the self employed is 12.4 of profit not on revenue   if you can write off more than half of the income as expenses then you could be paying less than a w-2 employee also you might make a higher salary as a 1099 it is rare the offer the same compensation for a w-2 as a 1099 as the former has higher expenses for the employer it is hard to know without actual numbers actual expected expense deductions and so forth   which is why i would suggest consulting with an accountant   you may want to talk to one in the state where he will be working rather than where you live now

i think that the minimum wage is too low that said the people in this article are making shitty decisions and their plight is not the reason to change the minimum wage perhaps if she had always worked minimum wage jobs she should n't have had 2 kids there is no discussion about the father contribution perhaps if he ca n't contribute to kids she should n't   have had kids with him perhaps if she felt   the need to quit one of her jobs to be fair i understand that need given the ridiculous hours she was working she should have quit the lower paying one instead she kept the 9.50 an our one and quit the 11 dollar one that is almost 500 bucks a month difference for a 40 hr week and her friends while good example of poor people being super kind to others are not a good case either like seriously 4 kids on minimum wage   minimum wage should change but not because of these people 's poor choices

the $ 100,000 is taxed separately as ordinary income the $ 350,000 is taxed at long term capital gains of 15 capital gains is not taxed at 20 until $ even though $ 100,000 + 350,000 = $ 450,000 only $ 350,000 can be taxed at capital gains the total ordinary income tax burden will be $ if single in california caveat by creating a holdings corporation c corp you can section that $ 100,000 into the c corp for tax deferment which wo n't be taxed until you take money from the corporation since you will hold 100 of the voting stock all distributions will be considered pro rata additionally you can issue yourself a dividend under the rules of 26 usc a shareholder who receives a dividend can write off 100 of said dividend as long as that dividend does n't trigger of the regulations by keeping the distribution just under 10 of i.e. $ 10,000 wages are deductible against basis so pay yourself $ 35,000 and keep $ 55,000 in the corporation and you can decrease the total liabilities down to $ 22,000 from $ 31,000 which includes the ca franchise tax you do n't have to pay yourself any money out a corporation to use the money

it 's impossibly difficult to time the market generally speaking you should buy low and sell high picking 25 as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you 'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner and those decisions should be based on your research or if you need the money not an arbitrary number to answer your questions if the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid then you should hold and/or buy more if something has changed and you ca n't find a reason to buy more then consider selling keep in mind you 'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax deferred e.g. retirement account no it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock capital gains taxes are one reason i 'm not sure why you would ever want to do this what reasons were you considering you can always sell just some of the shares see above and link regarding wash sales buying more of a stock you already own is called dollar cost averaging it 's an effective method when the reasons are right dca minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time all that said there 's nothing wrong with locking in a gain by selling all or some shares of a winner buy low sell high

it 's not so much pros and cons as much as it is what are your savings goals while it 's best to start early to save money for retirement you may have numerous short- to medium term savings goals school down payment etc here 's a template you can consider i would suggest that you open up an rrsp mutual fund or brokerage account and invest a certain amount that you feel free locking up for the next few decades and investing it in some sort of growth product perhaps look at portfolios using the couch potato strategy then also open up a tfsa mutual fund or brokerage account and use it to invest for medium term goals i.e. 5 10 years invest in products that will allow for some growth but with low chance of losing principle in that time frame what i would n't do is open up a tfsa savings account and use it for day to day savings the tax you save is negligible and you would need to keep track of deposits and withdrawals to ensure that you do n't for the tax year similarly an rrsp savings account or gic is far too conservative at your age imho think of rrsp and tfsa as investment vehicles rather than accounts per se either type allows for you to invest in a vast array of products including mutual funds equities some derivatives gold bonds gics etc   to conclude my view is to use rrsp to invest for conventional retirement goals and use the tfsa to invest for medium term and early retirement goals

i can not answer the original question but since there is a good deal of discussion about whether it 's credible at all here 's an answer that i got from bank of america note the fine difference between your account and our account which does not seem to be a typo the payment method is determined automatically by our system   one of    the main factors is the method by which pay to recipients prefer to    receive payments   if a payment can be issued electronically we    attempt to do so because it is the most efficient method    payment methods include electronic   payment is sent electronically prior to the deliver by date   the funds for the payment are deducted from your account on the    deliver by date corporate check   this is a check drawn on our account and is mailed to the pay to recipient a few days before the deliver by date   the    funds to cover the payment are deducted from your account on the    deliver by date laser draft check this is a check drawn on your account and mailed to the pay to recipient a few days before the deliver by date   the    funds for the payment are deducted from your account when the pay to    recipient cashes the check just as if you wrote the check yourself to determine how your payment was sent click the payments button in    your bill pay service   select the view payment link next to the    payment   payment information is then displayed   transmitted    electronically means the payment was sent electronically   payment    transaction number means the payment was sent via a check drawn from    our account   check number means the payment was sent as a laser    draft check each payment request is evaluated individually and may change each    time a payment processes    a payment may switch from one payment    method to another for a number of reasons   the merchant may have    temporarily switched the payment method to paper while they update    processing information   recent changes or re issuance of your payee    account number could alter the payment method in my case the web site reads a little different payment check 8 digits was sent to company on and    delivered on funds were withdrawn from your named    account on for one due on this must be the corporate check and for another earlier one due on this must be the laser draft check check 4 digits from your named account was mailed to company on    funds for this payment are withdrawn from your account    when the pay to account cashes the check both payments were made based on the same recurring bill pay payment that i set up manually knowing little more of the company than its address

your question does not say this explicitly but i assume that you were once a w-2 employee   each paycheck a certain amount was withheld from your check to pay income social security and medicare taxes   just because you did not receive that amount of money earned does not mean it was immediately sent to the irs   while i am not all that savvy on payroll procedures i recall an article that indicated some companies only send in withheld taxes every quarter much like you are doing now   they get a short term interest free loan   for example taxes withheld by a w-2 employee in the later months of the year may not be provided to the irs until 15 january of the next year    you are correct in assuming that if you make 100 k as a w-2 you will probably pay less in taxes than someone who is 100 k self employed with 5 k in expenses   however there are many factors   provided you properly fill out a 1040es and pay the correct amount of quarterly payments you will almost never owe taxes   in fact my experience has been the forms will probably allow you to receive a refund   tax laws can change and one thing the form did not include last year was the medicare surcharge for high income earners catching some by surprise     as far as what you pay into is indicative of the games the politicians play   it all just goes into a big old bucket of money and more is spent by congress than what is in the bucket   the notion of a social security is pure politics fantasy as well as the notion of medicare and social security taxes   the latter were created to make the actual income tax rate more palatable      i 'd recommend getting your taxes done as early as possible come 1 january 2017   while you may not have all the needed info you could firm up an estimate by 15 jan and modify the amount for your last estimated payment   complete the taxes when all stuff comes in and even if you owe an amount you have time to save for anything additional   keep in mind between 1 jan 17 and 15 apr 17 you will earn and presumably save money to use towards taxes   you can always rob from that money to pay any owed tax for 2016 and make it up later all that is to say you will be golden because you are showing concern and planning   when you hear horror stories of irs dealings it is most often that people spent the money that should have been sent to the irs

you need an accountant and/or a lawyer who is familiar with the us tax code and the rules in south korea assuming from your tag as the interest will be money generated in the us you could be required to withhold some of the interest and remit it to the irs i believe 30 withholding rate since south korea is a treaty country your friend can complete and sign a form w8-ben and give it to you so you may withhold a lower amount your friend would need to file a return if too much was withheld they may also get taxed in south korea there are probably rules in south korea about minimum interest that must be charged similar to applicable federal rates for the us so check with your accountant or lawyer for this if you craft it correctly you will be able to have a loan as a mortgage with the house properly secured which then would allow you to deduct mortgage interest rates from your return as far as i am aware there is no maximum amount for loans

if all of the relocation expenses are paid by your employer to the moving companies then you should not have any tax liability for those payments relocation expenses should be treated as normal business expenses by your employer note i emphasize should because it 's possible that your employer could consider it income to you but companies generally do not go out of their way to classify normal business expenses as income since it costs both them and you more money in taxes as a side note the reason your company is paying these expenses directly is probably to lessen the likelihood of these expenses being questioned in an audit in comparison to if they cut you a reimbursement check which could get more scrutiny

well there are a few comments that need to be made here i suppose though at work now so this will be short    first there is the difference between banking which indeed mostly looks at capital adequacy ratios and uses var as one of the methods to get to the risk weighted assets then there is the buy side which is more interested in how much would i stand to lose in portfolio x if markets head south and how does that relate to what a have promised my client in the first situation it is the bank itself taking on the risk in the second the risk lies entirely with the client an asset manager could lose 100 on your regular old equity mandate and it would n't hit him except for loss in fees whereas a significant trading loss for a bank can put it out of business    my personal view is that all of these metrics are merely useful instruments and for a large part they all tell me the same thing a higher duration on a fixed income mandate will give a higher var a higher shortfall more negative results on rates stress scenarios etcetera they only really become useful when imposing limits on them or using them to steer based on whatever the prevailing risk appetite is at a certain point in time or when looking at trends or relative risk of portfolio a vs b   do n't get me wrong i too can debate for hours about var parameters confidence intervals look back periods return frequency decay factors parametric or historical monte carlo simulation etcetera but i think in practise that is really of limited use if you take any ex ante risk measure and you thoroughly understand it make an informed choice about risk appetite and steer on it you basically have done your job as a risk manager   sorry i know i am not answering your questions in a structured way but am on my phone so it 's hard to keep overview pm me if you want to discuss things in detail

gt;i hear lots of interesting stories about teaching the most recent involves an experimental program where the teacher performance is n't graded on student outcomes but how well they 're following the narrative defined by the program every few years teachers are handed new programs that the district curriculum people bought and told you 're going to teach $ subject using this program now sometimes those programs work better for different groups of students the ones that it was evaluated with do great the ones in different neighborhoods are failed by the program the programs are implemented district wide and the teachers are told not to deviate from the programs   nothing really new there at all and it is n't local control it is the opposite standard central planning typically driven by federal and state department of education bureaucrats in combination with teacher 's union officials but i am being redundant because they are one and the same there being a revolving door and then it is pressed down on the school by an administrator who is attempting to please the higher ups and/or to guarantee the flow of funds linked to said program on one of their several ridiculously inane metrics   gt;a recent example from the town i grew up in   that letter is hilariously sad and not for the reasons that you think   this teacher with a masters degree in reading from which i assume they believe they understand reading better than anyone   be interesting to know the last time this master of reading actually read a book that was n't strictly required the answer is probably a decade or more ago   this teacher is really just one central planning disciple who is to a different central planning program than the one they themselves were indoctrinated into   the whole thing is very revealing regarding the sheer lunacy of the scientific and scientific education paradigm   this teacher like the administrators the teacher is concerned about the wrong things there is really no concern about whether kids are learning how to read and to enjoy utilize reading which is a rudimentary skill kids can pick up on their own provided they have n't had it turned into torture by some brainless amp teacher   but rather it is all about what to use for reading language arts   the phrasing of that question and the misguided emphasis of it reveals the fact that the teacher really does n't have a clue how to truly get kids reading and understanding the english language   basically he she just wants to work a program by a semi mindless rote and is really only pissed because the programs keep being changed on them    fortunately a least a small part of the kids will learn to read mostly due to authors industry putting out things they are interested in all hail jk amp collins not because of but despite the formal schooling systems attempts to teach them

sometimes you need to do more than ask to have your rating reduced   you need to make it in their best interest no pun intended to do it find the lowest rate card and then tell the others you want to transfer your balance to that card and close the account do n't do it it is an empty threat i guarantee they will transfer you to a retention agent who will give you a better deal   from their perspective your current offer is getting 19 interest instead of 22 why would they do that without some motivation with the approach described above their options are get 19 interest instead of 0 interest it is all about negotiation and the retention agents have the most leverage to do so

realize this is almost a year old but i just wanted to comment on something in answer above   whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me its a zero sum game from a market maker 's perspective their primary goal is not necessarily to make money by you being wrong it is to make money on the bid offer spread and hedging their book and potentially that being said the market maker would likely be quoting one side of the market away from top of the book if they do n't want to take exposure in that direction i.e. their bid will be lower than the highest bid available or their offer higher than the lowest offer available this is n't really going to change anything if you 're trading on an exchange but important to consider if you can only see the prices your broker dealer provides to you and they are your counterparty in the trade

an activity which can help improve your credit score and actually make you money is it 's a little complicated but can be beneficial to do using either a credit card which allows fee free money withdrawals from or building up debt using your credit card gives you access to your credit amount you then use a long term 0 balance transfer card to transfer the debt which you pay off at the minimum rate it 's 0 so no costs are associated except for the initial fee paid for the balance transfer amount the money that would have been used to pay off the credit amount or money withdrawn from a can then be deposited in a savings account so you are now earning interest on the credit balance continuing to make monthly minimum payments via direct debit will help improve your credit rating and the savings money will earn interest it is also available if you suddenly need to pay off the 0 card

parenting towards was the main theme discussed during a conference held recently organised by agenzija sedqa in collaboration with the office of the children ’s commissioner ms. sina bugeja chief executive officer foundation for social welfare services during her opening address explained that parenting towards resilience was the main theme chosen by the foundation to celebrate this year ’s children ’s day moreover ms. bugeja mentioned the recent launch of the national children ’s policy that safeguards children ’s rights and ensures space for their opinions before decisions are taken she mentioned that parents need to be kept with changing parenting styles as well as with different influences which might affect children ’s development ms commissioner for children said that the inherent vulnerability of children requires not only a strong legal and institutional framework of protection but also the consolidated ability on the part primarily of parents to nurture their children in such a way as to in them the inner strength and will to overcome the challenges that come their way during their childhood this is important she said as there is a limit to how far the legal and institutional framework can go to actually protect children in the context of an increasingly complex and challenging social and cultural environment and also because the development of such inner strength and will is an integral part of children ’s gradual maturity into strong independent and responsible adults the development of this inner strength or resilience should be seen as a main goal of the child ’s upbringing ms thus urged all parents to continue helping their children develop these inner qualities during his closing address mr. operations director agenzija sedqa said that since its inception sedqa has always been at the forefront of imparting skills to parents to improve their communication with their children although the agency is best known for its work with persons experiencing drug alcohol or gambling related problems it nevertheless invests a lot of resources in prevention the main presentation of this conference was entitled l l delivered ms. sammut registered counselling psychologist and family therapist she is also a full time member of staff within the department of psychology at the university of malta her presentation focused on a clear description of what is resilience in children highlighting the kind of parenting that makes a difference in enhancing resilience in children she stressed the importance of a warm parent child relationship that is to the child ’s needs according to his or her unique development this relationship greatly affects influences every aspect of children ’s learning and development especially the growth of their inner security self worth and ability to build relationships with others ms. sammut also spoke about how harmony in the family consistent guidance especially in and adequate role models also help to promote resilience in children she also cited from her research on families with domestic violence highlighting the resilience and challenges of these family members this conference was attended by parents and various professionals in touch with children of all ages the workshops delivered were families of children with disability by ann and education amp parenting by role models by building resilience in children by the mindful parent parenting against substance use risk by anthony building attachment by parenting towards resilience with the media by john playful parents playful children playful therapists by amp daniel looking after children in foster care by john and power struggle between parents and young people by sammut r parenting

you are presuming that after the transfer the cash is still sitting in a western union register but no that cash may have already been taken by the fraudster to refund the victim western union would have to 1 pay the victim back the amount of money lost and then 2 pursue the fraudster to reclaim the lost funds because the fraudster at the other end can simply show id to get the money ie they do not have an account with western union the cost to pursue that person to reclaim the lost funds would be substantially higher than for your bank because your bank can simply ding your account in the event that your account goes into overdraft because there were insufficient funds to reclaim the full amount the bank at least has a framework in place to pursue you for penalties

did a great job explaining your options so i wo n't rehash any of that i know you said that you do n't want to save for retirement yet but i 'm going to risk answering that you should anyway specifically i think you should consider a roth ira when it comes to tax advantaged retirement accounts once the contribution period for a tax year ends there 's no way to make up for it for example in 2015 you may contribute up to $ 5,500 to your ira you can make those contributions up until tax day of the following year april 15th 2016 after that you can not contribute money towards 2015 again   so each year that goes by you 're losing out on some potential to contribute as for why i think a roth ira specifically could work well for you i 'm advocating this because i think it 's a good balance you put away some money in a retirement account now when it will have the most impact on your future retirement assets taking advantage of a time you will never have again at a low cost custodian like vanguard you can open an ira with as little as $ 1,000 to start and choose from excellent fund options that meet your risk requirements if you end up deciding that you really want that money for a car or a house or beer money you can withdraw any of the contributions without fear of penalty or additional tax but if you decide you do n't really need to take that money back out you 've contributed to your retirement for a tax year you likely would n't have   otherwise and would n't be able to make up for later when you have more than enough to max out an ira each year i also want to stress that you should have a liquid emergency fund in a savings or checking account to deal with unexpected emergencies before funding something like this but after that if you have no specific goal for your savings and you do n't know for sure you 'll actually need to spend it in the near future funding a roth ira is worth considering in my opinion

not long after college in my new job i bought a used car with payments i have never done that since i just do n't like having a car payment i have bought every car since then with cash you should never borrow money to buy a car there are several things that come into play when buying a car when you are shopping with cash you tend to be more conservative with your purchases look at this study on credit card purchases    a bradstreet study found that people spend 12 18 more when using credit cards than when using cash and mcdonald 's found that the average transaction rose from $ 4.50 to $ 7.00 when customers used plastic instead of cash   i would bet you if you had $ 27,000 dollars cash in your hand you would n't buy that car you 'd find a better deal and or a cheaper car when you finance it it just does n't seem to hurt as bad even though it 's worse because now you are paying interest   a new car is just insanity unless you have a high net worth at least seven figures your $ 27,000 car in 5 years will be worth about $ 6500 that 's like striking a match to $ 340 dollars a month you ca n't afford to lose that much money pay cash if you lose your job get hurt or any number of things that can cost you money or reduce your income it 's no problem with a paid for car they do n't repo paid for cars you have so much more flexibility when you do n't have payments you mention you have 10k in cash and a $ 2000 a month positive cash flow i would find a deal on a 8000 9000 car i would not buy from a sell the car you have put that money with the positive cash flow and every other dime you can get at your student loans and any other debt you have keep renting cheap keep the college lifestyle broke until you are completely out of debt then i would save for a house   finally i would read this dave ramsey book if i would have read this at your age i would literally be a millionaire by now i 'm 37 do n't buy from a dealer find a private sale car that you can get a deal on pay less than kelly blue book pay a little money $ 50 75 to have an automotive technician to check it out for you and get a car fax to make sure there are no major problems i have worked in the automotive industry for 20 + years and you rarely get a good deal from a dealer everything popular is wrong

there are two things i can think of that might be different in other countries until 2013 american express visa and mastercard prevented businesses from charging extra for credit card usage and credit card surcharges still illegal in several states since credit card companies add a surcharge to credit card purchases and merchants ca n't pass that onto credit card users they just make everyone pay extra instead since everyone gets charged the credit card surcharge you might as well use a credit card and recoup some of that via rewards points almost all credit cards here have grace periods where you wo n't be charged interest if you pay back your loans in full within some period of time at least 21 days this makes credit cards attractive to people who do n't need a loan but like the convenience that credit cards provide not carrying cash extra insurance better fraud protection apparently grace periods are n't required by law here so this might be common in other countries as well

you should always always enroll in an espp if there is no lockup period and you can finance the contributions at a non onerous rate you should also always always sell it right away regardless of your feelings for the company   if you feel you must hold company stock to be a good employee buy some in your 401k which has additional advantages for company stock   gains treated as gains and not income on distribution if you ca n't contribute at first do as much as you can and use your results from the previous offering period to finance a greater contribution the next period   i slowly went from 4 to 10 over 6 offering periods at my plan the actual apr on a 15 discount plan is if you are able to sell right when the shares are priced   usually not the case but the risk is small there usually is a day or two administrative lockup getting the shares into your account even for espp 's that have no official lockup period see here for details on the calculation just a note   for your reference i worked for motorola for 10 years   a stock that fell pretty dramatically over those 10 years and i always made money on the espp and more than once doubled my money one additional note be aware of tax treatment on espp   specifically be aware that plans generally withhold income tax on gains over the purchase price automatically   i did n't realize this for a couple of years and double taxed myself on those gains   fortunately i found out my error in time to and get the money back but it was a headache

i believe mrchrister 's answer is correct   since they 're fdic insured they are legit   second on the seemingly too good to be true rate they 're basically making up the difference on other fees not necessarily paid by you in order to offer you the higher than market rate i 'd like to point out two things not mentioned about the current rate offer though the high apy advertised is only on balances up to $ 25,000 anything over that threshold is at a lower 1.01 apy the offer also states in the footnotes rates may change after the account is opened you might want to see if they have a good history of paying higher than average interest rates you would n't want to switch only to find out the promotional rate was a teaser that soon gets reduced

i do n't see how you could have this conversation without also including mention of the labor participation rate if the unemployment rate is low but there is still a huge pool of workers trying to get back into the workforce then you still have high competition for positions which would depress the wage rate this has been my experience looking for work in the last 12 months linkedin tracks applications and it is routine to see 100 300 applicants for entry level business analyst positions that are only a week or two old does that seem like low unemployment low competition for work hell no i bet most employers are still flooded with applications and can be as picky as they want and can lowball applicant wages

it 's definitely a racket but safety is a pretty good reason to implement regulation and filters on who can be a driver some places have had illegal taxis operating for years which might be fine a lot of the time but can also lead to drivers robbing hurting people this is the thing that taxi drivers keep trying to remind us of while they try to keep their jobs it 's also why a lot of people would be scared to try in fact my previous manager went on a work trip to africa years ago was met at the airport by a taxi driver got driven into the middle of nowhere and robbed at gunpoint similar might have happened to me and my mum after landing in kuala lumpur years ago having a taxi driver offer us his services which we accepted only for him to run away before we got to his car because the airport police saw him and gave chase on sight   do n't forget when you get into a car you are at the mercy of the driver if taxis were just any dude who happens to be in a car then it could easily be a bad guy pretending to be a taxi driver to find victims but if taxis are uniquely marked and drivers have special licenses you at least get some assurance that their main motivation is to provide a taxi service   a key thing that uber changed is making it feel like the drivers and passengers are easily identified by being on the app while making a strong public case for their service making drivers and passengers seem legitimate but imagine getting into strangers cars a few years ago when it was n't common or even easier imagine getting into a strangers car that you did n't book through uber imagine standing at a bus stop and having some dude in a camry pull up and ask if you need a ride or seeing some guy on craigslist advertising himself as a private taxi who does n't want to use uber   if you 're asking why taxis are so expensive everywhere well that 's probably more to do with them being scummy protectionist businesses than anything else but until a few years ago the service that uber and airbnb provide was highly sketchy outside the proper channels

taking examples from this loosely googled page if you find or calculate the standard deviation volatility of the returns from your various investment classes you will find they range from low risk low volatility such as cash to high risk high volatility such as strategic growth   the risk rating volatility is a good indicator of how reactive to market conditions your investment is likely to be   as you can see below from to the high risk index performed really well but it was also most reactive when the market subsequently turned down   the medium risk indices performed the best over the chart period 2010 to 2013 but it could have turned out different   generally you choose your investment according to your risk appetite how much you 're willing to risk   you might play safe with say 30 cash 60 medium risk 10 high risk   then again are you paying someone to manage cash which you might be able to do for free in a bank assuming for a moment european 3 and equity tracker 9 had the same medium risk profile then holding 50 50 would also add some currency diversification which is usually advisable   however the main choice is down to risk appetite to address your specific question my main interest for now is between stockmarket growth and strategic growth first thing to do is check their volatilities for a further level of sophistication you can check how they are correlated against each other   if they are inversely correlated i.e. one goes up when the other goes down then holding some of each could be a good diversification fyi an introduction to investment theory the historical returns are important too but the investment classes your pension fund is offering will probably be reasonably aligned on a risk return basis   you should check though   i.e. do they line up on a plot of 3 year return vs volatility e.g. the line through sa cash sa bonds vol target 20 sa equity   source

when you sell a house around between 7 10 of the sales price will go to various fees mostly to the agents but also to county fees city fees deed tax and possibly covering closing costs for the buyers so if you sell a $ 400k house for the same price you buy just in fees you 're out $ 40k mortgages are structured so that the frontend is very interest heavy while at the end you 're mostly paying towards principal so for the first two years you will pay down very little of the principal figure around $ 2500 for the mortgage and without running the numbers i bet you would pay an average for the first two years of around $ in interest $ mortgage interest is tax deductible so you 'll get some of that back that 's also $ 16,800 in equity you 'll have on the house so you 'll get that back out when you sell rough numbers i would be you lose around $ 50k buying the house and selling for the same price two years later that does n't take into account having to do any maintenance and it assumes you can sell quickly when you want to renting is not throwing away money you do n't lose any money you get a place to live in exchange you do n't build equity sure but you do n't need to worry about maintenance and other related issues when you 're looking to be somewhere short term renting is generally the best idea

diamonds are intrinsically worthless this is simply wrong 1 diamonds that are sold for anything less than oh let 's say $ 5000 at original retail are indeed utterly totally completely worthless it is simply one of the great scams their real price is maybe five bucks end of story there is no secondary market   literally end of story if you buy a diamond lol for $ 2000 to impress your loved one you can not then sell it for any amount of money   it is worthless once again simple undeniable fact the diamond you bought for 2 grand can not be resold ir 's worthless ok maybe you can get 100 bucks for it something like that or you can scam someone clueless and get 200 bucks 2 however actual investment stones do in fact have a value if somewhat fragile example a few years ago i sold a stone for 30 thousand that was a real price and it was quite liquid i was within days able to find a buyer a dealer he would have then sold it on for 35 or whatever i have never dealt in stones over six figures but i 'm fairly certain those are real valuable objects just like by name artists however yes the line between laughable diamonds and actual investment stones is indeed moving ever upwards note the elephant in the room with diamonds is that ge 's industrial process for simply making utterly flawless diamonds starting with carbon is getting better every decade a second point that nobody has mentioned diamonds get beat up   regarding engagement ring diamonds a used one is exactly as useless as a used car   it 's crap   just as with $ 200,000 this concept does not apply to actual investment stones note that many of the comments arguments on this page are very confused because people are not distinguishing between the engagement ring scam market and the investment gem market the two things are utterly different yes engagement ring diamonds are an utter scam and are simply worthless   the fundamental basic overwhelming scam in today 's business social universe is engagement diamonds yes the price is only due to marketing monopolies etc elephant in the room a ge 's technology can end of story manufacture diamonds   starting with pencil leads   end of story   it 's all over elephant in the room b folks forget that diamonds get beat up they are just like used cars regarding engagement ring diamonds nobody has ever or will ever bought a used one simple utterly undeniable fact regarding engagement ring diamonds they have zero value   you can not resell them end of story if you buy a house you can resell it if you buy a car you can resell it at a spectacular loss if you buy a you can resell it almost always making a huge profit if you buy an engagement ring diamond it is worth nothing zero nada strictly regarding investment stones which is a distinctly utterly different market   this market has no connection in any way at all even vaguely it is utterly unrelated to engagement ring diamonds   you can in fact buy and sell these items very much like say art or mid century antiques and make money this market just has utterly no connection to the whole engagement ring diamonds scam system say you buy wine at the supermarket for 5 to 100 bucks a bottle if you think that the wine thus bought has a secondary market or you can invest in it or something you have lost your mind in total contrast yes although totally there is indeed an investment wine market which is real and reasonable i for example have made some money in that i have a great anecdote even i had one of wine in which could have been sold for say 30 grand but we it     again the somewhat bizarre actual market in investment wine just has to buying wine in the supermarket   to further the analogy wine prices in the supermarket your wine dealer from 5 to 100 bucks are just utterly laughable utterly laughable much as folks sit around and decide on label designs they sit around and decide on price points there is utterly no difference between $ 5 and $ 100 juice wine the price difference is simply a marketing decision at best you can think of it as a good exactly the same applies to engagement ring diamonds

partly i suspect this is selection bias you say you see so many luxury cars go by but if you 're looking for them you 're going to notice them have you calculated the actual percentage do they make up 50 of the cars that pass a specific point in a specific period of time or just 10 if you really counted you say you live in baltimore county maryland that 's a relatively wealthy area so i 'd expect the percentage of luxury cars to be higher than the national average you 'd likely see considerably fewer in the of mississippi that said some people who own luxury cars ca n't really afford them i 'm reminded of a wonderful tv commercial i saw recently where a man is showing off all his material goods he talks about his big house and his swimming pool and his fancy car with a big smile on his face standing tall and generally looking proud and happy and then he says how do i do it and suddenly his expression changes to complete despair he down and says i 'm in debt up to my eyeballs it turns out to be a commercial for a debt counseling service some people put very high value on owning a fancy car and are willing to sacrifice on other things if having a big fancy car is more important to you then say having a nice house or the latest computer or a big screen tv or dining out more often or going on more expensive vacations or whatever you have to give up to get the car well that 's your decision personally i do n't care much about a fancy car i just want something that gets me where i want to go and i 've always figured that with an expensive car you have to constantly worry about getting in an accident and damaging or destroying it if you put your money into a big fancy house at least houses rarely with each other personally i make a nice income too and i have a $ 500/month mortgage and zero car payment because i drive a 2003 pickup that i bought with cash but i have two kids in college and i 'm trying to get them through with no debt that 's where all my money is going

you will hear a lot about diversifying your portfolio which typically means having a good mix of investment types areas of investments etc i 'd like to suggest that you should also diversify your sources   sad to say but the defined benefit pension is not a rock solid sure fire source of security in your retirement planning companies go bankrupt government agencies are reorganized and those untouchable assets are destroyed overnight so treat your new investment strategy as if you were starting over and invest accordingly for example aggressively for a few years then progressively safer as you get older there are other strategies too depending on factors like your taste for risk you might prefer to be conservative until you reach some safety threshold to reach certain safety and then start making riskier investments you may also consider different investment vehicles and techniques such as index funds dollar cost averaging and so on

bonds still definitely have a place in many passive portfolios   while it is true that interest rates have been unusually low yields on reasonable passive bond exposures are still around 2 4   this is significantly better than both recent past inflation and expected inflation both of which are near zero    this is reasonable if not great return but bonds continue to have other nice properties like relatively low risk and diversification of stock portfolios the losses you mention in the op   so to say that bonds are no longer a good idea is certainly not correct   one could say bonds may no longer be a good idea for some people that have a particularly high risk tolerance and very high return requirements however to some extent that has always been true it is worth remembering also that there is some compelling evidence that global growth is starting to broadly slow down and many people believe that future stock returns and in general returns on all investments will be lower   this is much much harder to estimate than bond returns though   depending on who you believe bond returns may actually look relatively better than the have in the past edit in response to comment   corporate bond correlation with stocks is positive but generally not very strong except for high yield junk bonds so while they do n't offset stock volatility negative correlation they do help diversify a stock portfolio   government bonds have essentially zero correlation so they do n't really offset volatility as much as just not add any   negative correlation assets are generally called insurance and you tend to have to pay for them   so there is no free lunch here   assets that reduce risk cost money assets that add little risk give less return and assets that are more risky tend to give more return in the long run but you can feel the pain   the mix that is right for you depends on a lot of things but for many people that mix involves some corporate and government bonds

there is a way to get a reasonable estimate of what you still owe and then the way to get the exact value when the loan started they should have given you amortization table that laid out each payment including the principal interest and balance for each payment if there are any other fees included in the payment those also should have been detailed determine how may payments you have maid did you make the first payment on day one or the start of the next month was the last payment the 24th or the next one the table will then tell you what you owe after your most recent payment to get the exact value call the lender the amount grows   between payment due to the interest that is accumulating they will need to know when the payment will arrive so they can give you the correct value to calculate how much you will save do the following calculation payment = monthly payment for principal and interest = number of payments made = 24 = number of payments remaining = 60 = 60 24 = 36 = number from loan company   savings = payment

i 'm going to give a simpler answer than some of the others although somewhat more limited the complicated loan parameters you describe benefit the lender   i 'll focus on this part of your question you should be able to pay back whenever what 's the point of an arbitrary timeline here you refers to the borrower   sure yes it would be great for the borrower to be able to do whatever they want whenever they want increasing or decreasing the loan balance by paying or not paying arbitrary amounts at their whim   but it does n't benefit the lender to let the borrower do this   adding various kinds of restrictions and extra conditions to the loan reduces the lender 's uncertainty about when they 'll be receiving money and also gives them a greater range of legal recourse to get it sooner since they can pursue the borrower right away if they violate any of the conditions rather than having the wait until they die without having paid their debt then you say and if you want you can set a legal deadline but the mere deadline in the contract does n't affect how much interest is paid the interest is only affected by how much money is borrowed and how long has passed i think in many cases that is in fact how it works or at least it is more how it works than you seem to think   for instance you can take out a 30-year loan but pay it off in less than 30 years and the amount you pay will be less if you pay it off sooner   however in some cases the lender will charge you a penalty for doing so   the reason is the same as above if you pay off the loan sooner you are paying less interest which is worse for the lender   again it would be nice for the borrower if they could just pay it off sooner with no penalty but the lender has no reason to let them do so i think there are in fact other explanations for these more complicated loan terms that do benefit the borrower   for instance an amortization schedule with clearly defined monthly payments and proportions going to interest and principal also reduces the borrower 's uncertainty and makes them less likely to do risky things like skip lots of payments intending to make it up later   it gives them a clear number to budget from   but even aside from all that i think the clearest answer to your question is what i said above in general it benefits the lender to attach conditions and parameters to loans in order to have many opportunities to penalize the borrower for making it hard for the lender to predict their cash flow

yes you should invest and yes you should save for the house down payment these should be two separate pools of money and the goals and time frames for them are different with a 3 year time frame for the down payment on the house the risk you should accept should be essentially zero that means it is less of an investment and more plain vanilla savings account or maybe a higher interest account or a cd the worst thing to have happen would be to try and save for the house while the value of your investment keeps dropping   you have to decide how to allocate your income between retirement accounts and saving for the house while still meeting all your other obligations the exact balance depends on how much you need to save for retirement and things such as rules for the company match

in general yes if interest rates go higher then any existing fixed rate bonds and hence etfs holding those bonds become less valuable the further each bond is from maturity the larger the impact as you suggest once the bonds do mature the fund can replace them at a market price so the effect tails off the bond market has a concept known as duration that helps reason about this effect roughly it measures the average time from now to each payout of the bond weighted by the payout the longer the duration the more the price will change for a given change in interest rates the concept is just an approximation and there are various slightly different ways of calculating it but very roughly the price of a bond will reduce by a percentage equal to the duration times the increase in interest rates so a bond with a duration of 5 years will lose 5 of its value for a 1 rise in interest rates and of course vice versa for your second question it really depends on what you 're trying to achieve by diversifying this might be best as a different question that gives more detail as it 's not very related to your first question short term bonds are less risky but both will lose value if the underlying company is in trouble gilts government bonds are less risky than corporate bonds

keep in mind that many checks are being cashed via scanner or photo these can be home based business based or atm based systems the key requirement is that the software has to be able to distinguish the written parts from the background parts if the image does n't have enough contrast for the edge detection to work the check ca n't be easily processed in that case a human looks at the image and the image and processes the transaction the image is not in color   many businesses scan the check and hand the original back to you after having the point of sale system process the image post 2001 the checks in the united states are no longer moved through the banking system only their images with the roll out of these image based systems in the future almost no physical checks will be seen by banks therefore the actual ink color is not important only the result

i do n't buy the house prices will always increase due to the increased cost of raw materials argument in a lot of countries you will find that the cost of a property is substantially lower than its perceived sale value if it was n't there would be no incentive for developers to take the risk of buying the land and building houses on it say the cost of building the house is 50 of the sale price which might already be generous materials probably account for half of the building cost so you 've got 25 tail 75 dog i 'd start to worry if people buy property as a get rich quick scheme which seems to be what you 're describing

there are 3 entities in a credit card transaction typically when you swipe for 100 the merchant only gets around the 2.5 is divided amongst the 3 entities roughly around 0.5 for the merchant bank around 0.5 for the card network and a lions share to issuing bank of around 1.5 the reason issuing bank gets large share is because they take the risk and provide the credit to customer typically the issuing bank would pay the merchant bank via the card network the money in couple of days so the merchant bank is not out of funds the issuing bank on the other hand would have given you a credit of say 10 to 50 days depending on when you made the transaction and when the payment is due on an average 30 days of credit so roughly the acquiring bank is lending money at the rate of 18 it is from this money the issuing bank would give out rewards which is typically less than 1 also in cases where say merchant bank and the issuing bank are same bank would make money on both the legs of transaction and hence launch co branded cards with better rewards the above numbers are illustrative and actual practices vary from bank to bank to card network to country related question at how do credit card companies make profit

it appears the company you 're talking about did not report as you expected them to which is not unusual for otc companies because as stated they are not well managed that being said reports on edgar are available as soon as they 're posted   i 'm not aware of any lag between when the company uploads their report and it is available on the edgar site looking at the profile of the company you 're referring to i 'm curious why you 'd be so interested in a company with huge negative earnings a near zero share price and an obviously spotty history of reporting its numbers   in order to make any money with this stock you 'd have to buy a huge number of shares which could be difficult to unload   further the fees you 're going to pay to make your trades are very likely to outstrip your return so you 'd be upside down on it this company has pretty negative financials and in a world of cheap oil alternative energy and the companies that deal in it are out of vogue so they 're not likely to see a turnaround anytime soon   they 're spending money on r d at a rate almost 17 times earnings and the losses are while revenues are not improving all that much   these guys are bleeding to death and there 's little prospect of a financial on the horizon this is as they say a dog with so your best bet is to find something else to put your money into i hope this helps good luck

i would not classify utilities including electric as additional fees   in many cases you interact directly with the utility not the landlord and pay for what you use   there are exceptions like when renting a room the renter 's insurance also is not part of the landlord 's profit it is simply there to protect you   in the case of loss the landlord can not insure your property you have to provide your own insurance   its pretty low costs typically less than 20 per month the application fee is typical    the move in fee is something that could be negotiated away and sounds pretty sketchy    you can always let your fingers do the walking and find out the fees before you look at the place

i 'm another programmer i guess we all just like complicated things or got here via obligatory tedious but accurate point investing is not personal finance in fact it 's maybe one of the less important parts of it see this answer where to start with personal finance   obligatory warning for software developer type minds getting into investing because it 's complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective   or see behavioral finance research on how analytical professional creative type people are often terrible at investing while even tempered practical people are better the thing with investing is that inaction is better than action tried and true is better than creative and simple is better than complicated so if you 're like me and many programmers and like creative complicated action not good for the wallet you 've been warned that said stuff i read in general i hate reading too much financial information because i think it makes me take ill advised actions the actions i most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns so i try to focus on reading about software development for example or i answer questions on this site which at least might help someone out and i enjoy writing for basic financial news and research i prefer especially if you get the premium version the writing has more depth it 's often from qualified financial analysts and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks instead of a small number as with motley fool newsletters i do n't follow morningstar regularly anymore instead i use it for research when i need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever another caveat on morningstar is that the star ratings on funds are dumb look at the analyst picks and the analyst instead i just flipped through my rss reader and i have 20 30 finance related blogs in there collecting posts it looks like the only one i regularly read is which is sort of random but i find david very thoughtful and interesting he 's also a conservative without being a partisan hack and posts frequently i read the weekly market comment at as well most weeks it says the market is overvalued so that 's predictable but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about i read a lot of software related blogs and there 's some bleed into finance especially from the vc world blogs like or or whatever anyway i spend most of my reading time on career related stuff and i think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective if you were a doctor you 'd be better off reading about too i read finance related books fairly often i guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front i prefer books about principles rather than a of daily financial news and questionable ideas other than that i keep up with headlines just reading the paper every day including business related topics is good enough if there 's some big event in the financial markets it 'll show up in the regular paper take a class i initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the cfp course and the first cfa course both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus you can just do the class and take the exam if you like without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications i did n't go on to do that this sounds like a crazy thing to do and it kind of is but i think it 's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material if you 're a normal person and do n't have time to take finance courses you 're likely better off either keeping it super simple or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money   when it 's inevitably complex e.g. as you approach retirement then an advisor is best my mom is retiring soon and i found her a professional for example i like having a lot of knowledge myself because it 's just the only way i could feel comfortable so for sure i understand other people wanting to have it too but what i 'd share from the other side is that once you have it the conclusion is that you do n't have enough knowledge or time to do anything fancy anyway and that the simple answers are fine check out investing for fun is n't investing for profit many people recommend motley fool i see two on this question already the site is n't evil but the problem in my opinion is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that is n't objectively justifiable for practical reasons essentially i do n't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun very well if investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or then motley fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money wise see behavioral finance research again talking to others is n't compatible with ice in your decision making also motley fool tends to make it sound like active investing is easier than it is there 's a reason the chartered financial analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience rather than reading blogs practical investing just buy the target date fund can be super easy but once you go beyond that it 's not i do n't really agree with the anyone can do it and it 's not work premise any more than i think that about or or computer programming after 15 years i 'm a programming expert after some courses and a lot of reading i 'm not someone who could professionally run an actively managed portfolio i think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages or just do something else for fun besides investing morningstar has this problem too and and bloomberg i mean they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to they all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference when they do n't bottom line i do n't think personal finance changes very quickly the details of specific mutual funds change and there 's always some new twist in the tax code but the big picture is pretty stable i think going in depth say read the chartered financial analyst curriculum materials would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently the most important things to work on are income career and spending to maximize income minus spending that 's where time investment will pay off i know it 's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering but i did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there

the definition i use for financial independence is 99 confidence that at a specific estimated spending rate per year allowing for estimated inflation and budgeting for likely medical emergencies and taxes on taxable investments the money will me this translates to needing an average annual return on investment which covers the average yearly spending for my purposes that works out to my relying on being able to draw only a 4 income from the money each year which should give me good odds of the money not just being sufficient but being able to deliver that rate forever historically average us stock market rate if return is around 8 that is overkill if course i could plan on the money just barely lasting past my birthday or something of that sort but the goal us to be pretty sure not only that i wo n't run out but that i will have some cash unexpected needs which in turn means that i estimate i need investments times the yearly spending estimate to declare the forever independence retirement or 25x the yearly from that i can calculate how much longer at a given savings rate and rate of return it 'll take for me to reach that target   obviously you need to adjust all these numbers to reflect your opinions understanding if the market your own needs your priorities and expected maximum age and the phase of 's but that 's the basic rationale or you can pay a financial planner to give you this number and a strategy for getting there based on the numbers you give him or her plus some statistical analysis of the market 's overall history

what i 'm going to write is far too long for a comment so i 'll put it here even though its not an answer that 's the closest thing to an answer you 'll get here i 'm afraid i 'm not a tax professional and you can not rely on anything i say as you undoubtedly know but i 'll give you some pointers things you should be researching when you have international clients check if sec can apply to the pension funds if so your life may become much easier if not and you have no idea what you 're doing consider referring the client elsewhere you can end up with quite a liability suit if you make a mistake here because the penalties on not filing the right piece of paper are enormous

your goals are mutually exclusive   you can not both earn a return that will outpace inflation while simultaneously having zero risk of losing money at least not in the 2011 market in 2008 a cd would have been a good choice here 's a potential compromise sacrifice some immediate liquidity for more earnings say you had $ 10,000 saved in this scheme you 've diversified a little bit have access to 50 of your money immediately either through online transfer or bringing your bonds to a teller have an implicit us government guarantee for 50 of your money and low risk for the rest and get inflation protection for 75 of your money

assuming you 're talking about a property in the united states the answer generally would be no   you are n't actually paying any of the expenses for the property and yet you want to take the deductions for doing so   that 's a rather move i 'd say grin    it probably would lead to some real strife with your brother since he would have proper claim to those credit on the basis he 's the one footing the bills for the property   before you do anything like what you 're talking about it might be best to speak with him because both of you are running the very real risk of an audit and if that happens then i can guarantee the irs will slap the out of you for it   your brother i 'm sure is already claiming all of the deductions he can for what he 's putting into the property and on top of that you want to file for your half   what half are you referring to when your out of pocket is zero   so what you 're saying is you think that between you and your brother you should be able to take a credit of 150 of the actual deductions sounds like a recipe for disaster to me i strongly encourage you to talk to a tax professional but if you get a different answer to this than what i 've already given then i 'd be stunned    i hope this helps good luck

as with everything else it 's a question of trade offs pros for buying in bulk cons for buying in bulk inventory cost you need to purchase more shelving to stock the goods   this is a real cost the psychological effect of having more means you are more likely to use more thus costing you more deflation of the cost of the item should occur over time in a well functioning market economy   a $ 10 item today might be $ 9.50 in one year in real terms there is a real opportunity cost associated with   granted an extra $ 100 in your bank account wo n't be earning too much if you have to spend it one month later but it does mean you have less financial independence for that month risk of spoilage   there is a nonzero risk that your goods could be ruined by flood fire damage you need to decide which of these pros and cons are more important to you   financially you should only buy what you need between shopping trips   in reality the convenience of holding goods in storage for when you need them may outweigh the costs

do i have to explain the source of all income on my taxes yes you do say the of and mary the argued to the irs that the money was n’t income and so it should not be taxed as such the irs was n’t swayed by the couple ’s argument the case went to federal court and the irs won found property and money has been considered taxable income ever since the irs plainly states that taxpayers must report all income from any source even income earned in another country unless it is explicitly exempt under the u.s. tax code this covers a wide range of miscellaneous income including gambling winnings according to the decision money you find is n’t explicitly exempt the tax impact wo n’t be significant if you find an item of property with a fair market value of only $ 500 and are in the 25 tax bracket you ’ll owe the irs $ 125 $ 500 x .25 = $ 125 however if you are a finder and keeper of $ 10,000 your tax burden will be $ 2,500 $ 10,000 x .25 = $ 2,500

interest is a fee that you pay in order to use someone else 's money once you 've made the deal pretty much anything you do that reduces the total interest that you pay does so by reducing the time for which you get to use their money as an extreme example consider a thirty year interest only loan with a balloon payment at the end if you pay it off after fifteen years you pay half as much interest because you had the use of the money for half as long the same thing happens when you make biweekly payments you reduce the total interest that you pay by giving up the use of some of the borrowed money sooner that 's not necessarily bad but it 's also not automatically good

yes you can   this is known as a short selling against the box   in the old days this was used to delay a taxable event   you could lock in a gain without triggering a taxable event   any loss on one side of the box would be offset by a loss on the other side and vice versa   however the irs down on this and you will realize the gain on your long position as soon as you go short on the other side   see as to how to initiate the short cover just transfer the long position to the same account as your short position and make sure your broker covers the short   should be relatively easy

being the geek that i am i actually developed a financial model of a few different career salary scenarios when i graduated in 2000 while it may not matter from a financial pov it 's a nice thing to reference later on to help you stick with your financial goals my recommendation would be to not factor in inflation upfront build a model based on the current value of money you course correct things in the future when inflation starts kicking in also your retirement income requirements will vary dramatically depending on other decisions that you make ie kids mortgage college etc if achieving the lifestyle that you desire 10 20 or 30 years down the road looks difficult because your salary is n't keeping up with your earnings savings goals you need to either re evaluate your priorities or look for better compensation

the standard double entry approach would just be to create a liability account for the loan and then make a transfer from that account to your asset savings account when the loan proceeds are distributed to you after that point the loan does n't belong to your savings account in any way each account and transaction is tracked separately so you might for instance pay that loan back with a transfer from your checking account even though the initial disbursement arrived into your savings account in order to see how much of a loan you have remaining you need to look at the loan 's liability account to see what transactions occurred in it and what its remaining balance is it sounds like what you 're really trying to accomplish is the idea of   or putting into an envelope certain assets for certain purposes this kind of budgeting is n't really something that gnucash at it does have some budget features but there 's more about being able to see how actual expenses are to expected expenses for a reporting period not about being able to ask how much discretionary assets do i have left before i start hitting my emergency fund the closest you get is splitting up your asset accounts into subaccounts as you suggest in which case you can allocate funds for your specific purposes and make transfers between them as needed that can work well enough depending on your exact goals though it can sometimes make it a little trickier to reconcile with your actual bank statements but there 's not really an accounting reason to associate the emergency fund portion of your assets with the remaining balance of your loan though there 's nothing stopping you from doing so if that 's what you 're trying to do accounting answers questions like how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now if you want to ask how much am i allowed to spend on x right now or am i likely to run out of money soon you may want a budgeting tool rather than an accounting tool

construction loans are typically short term that then get rolled into conventional mortgages at the end of the construction period since the actual construction loan is short term you can not combine it with a long term land loan as well you could do the two separate loans up front to buy the land and finance the construction then at the end roll both into a conventional mortgage to close out the land and construction loans this option will only work if you do all three through the same lender trying to engage various lenders will require a whole new refinance process which i very much doubt you would want to go through these are sometimes called combo loans since they aggregate several different loan products in one transaction not a lot of places do land loans so i would suggest first find a lender that will give you a land loan and set an appoint with a loan representative explain what you are trying to do and see what they can offer you you might have better luck with credit unions as well instead of traditional banks

first make sure you have some money in a savings account that you can use instead of credit cards for making future purchases that go beyond what you have in your checking account $ 1000 is a good amount to start with so just take that out of the $ 5000 then pay off the best buy card you should n't be worried about the minimum payment determine what you can pay per month say $ 400 and take the minimum payments out of that then choose one card to get the rest of your $ 400 plus the remaining $ 1500 of your $ 5000 this should be the highest interest card mathematically but it may or may not be your best choice it depends on your personality some people get a psychological lift out of seeing debts disappear and it gives them more motivation to keep going those people may be better served by paying off the smallest debts first to get them out of the way i 'm an so it bothers me more to think that i 'll be paying a little more in interest over the long term by taking that route

you have a few options option 1 leave the money where it is if your balance is over $ 5k you should be able to leave the money in your former employer 's 401(k the money will stay there and continue to be invested in the funds that you elect to invest in you should at the very least be receiving quarterly statements for the account even better you should have access to some type of an online account where you can transfer your investments rebalance your account conform to target etc if you do not have online account access than i 'm sure you can still transfer investments and make trades via a paper form just reach out to the 401(k tpa or recordkeeper that administers your plan their contact info is on the quarterly statements you should be receiving option 2 rollover the money into your current employer 's 401(k plan this is the option that i tend to recommend the most roll the money over into your current employer 's 401(k plan this way all the money is in the same place and is invested in the funds that you elect let 's say you wanted to transfer your investments to a new fund lineup right now you have to fill out the paperwork or go through the online process twice for both accounts moving the money to your current employer 's plan and having all the money in the same place eliminates this redundancy and allows you to make one simple transfer of all your assets option 3 roll the money from your former employer 's plan into an ira this is a cool option because now you have a new ira with a new set of dollar limits you can roll the money into a separate ira and contribute an additional $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 if you are 50 + years of age so this is cool because it gives you a chance to save even more for retirement many ira companies give you a sign on bonus where if you rollover your former employers they will give you a bonus typically a few hundred bucks but hey its free money other things to note take a look at your plan document from your former employer 's 401(k plan take a look at the fees compare the fees to your current employer 's plan there could be a chance that the fees from your former employer 's plan are much higher than your current employer so this would just be yet another reason to move the money to your current employer 's plan do n't forget you most likely have a financial advisor that oversees your current employer 's 401(k plan this financial advisor also probably takes fees from your account so use his services you are probably already paying for it talk to your hr at your employer and ask who the investment advisor is call the advisor and set up an appointment to talk about your retirement and financial goals ask him for his advice its always nice talking to someone with experience face to face good luck with everything

i 've read this claim many times in the news banks are making less profit from the lending business when interest rates are historically low the issue with most loans is they can be satisfied at any time   when you have falling interest rates it means most of the banks loans are refinanced from nice high rates to current market low interest rates which can significantly reduce the expected return on past loans   the bank gets the money back when it wants it the least because it can only re lend the money at the current market lower interest rates   when interest rates are increasing refinance and early repayment activity reduces significantly it 's important to look at the loan from the point of view of the bank a bank must first issue out the entire principal amount   on a 60 month loan the lender has not received payments sufficient to satisfy the principal until around or month depending on the interest rate   if the bank receives payment of the outstanding amount on month 30 the expected return on that loan is reduced significantly consider a $ 10,000 60 month loan at 5 apr   the bank is expected to receive $ in total for interest income of $   if the loan is repaid on month 30 the total interest is about $ 972   that 's a 26 reduction of expected interest income and the money received can only be re lent for yet a lower interest rate add to this the tricky accounting of holding a loan which is really a discounted bond which is an asset on the books and profitability of lending while interest rates are falling gets really funky and this does n't even examine default risk cost

i work on a buy side firm so i know how these small data issues can drive us crazy hope my answer below can help you   reason for price difference 1 vendor and data source basically data providers such as google and yahoo redistribute eod data by aggregating data from their vendors although the raw data is taken from the same exchanges different vendors tend to collect them through different trading platforms for example yahoo is getting stock data from which was acquired by morningstar which is not the most accurate source of eod stocks google gets data from deutsche   to make the process more complicated each vendor can choose to get eod data from another eod data provider or the exchange itself or they can produce their own open high low close and volume from the actual trade tick data and these data may come from any exchanges   2 price adjustment   for equities data the re distributor usually adjusts the raw data by applying certain customized procedures this includes adjustment for corporate actions such as dividends and splits for futures data rolling is required and back ward and for rolling can be chosen different adjustment methods can lead to different price display   3 extended trading hours   along with the growth of electronic trading many market tends to trade during extended hours such as pre open and post close trading periods futures and fx markets even trade around the clock this leads to another freedom in price reporting whether to include the price movement during the extended trading hours    conclusion to cross verify the true price we should always check the price from the exchange where the asset is actually traded given the convenience of getting eod data nowadays this task should be easy to achieve   in fact for professional traders and investors alike they will never reply price on free providers such as yahoo and google they will most likely choose bloomberg reuters etc however for personal use yahoo and google should both be good choices and the difference is small enough to ignore

it appears that the company in question is raising money to invest in expanding its operations specifically lithium production but that is off topic for here the stock price was rising on the back of perceived increases in demand for the company 's products but in order to fulfil demand they need to either invest in higher production or increase prices they chose to increase production by investing to invest they needed to raise capital and so are going through the motions to do that the key question as to what will happen with their stock price after this is broken down into two parts short term and long term in the short term the price is driven by the expectation of future profits see below and the behavioural expectations from an increase in interest in the stock caused by the fact that it is in the news people who had never heard of the stock or thought of investing in the company have suddenly discovered it and been told that it is doing well and so want a piece of it this will exacerbate the effect of the news broadly positive or negative and will drive the price in the short run the effect of extra leverage assuming that they raise capital by writing bonds also immediately increases the total value of the company so will increase the price somewhat the short term price changes usually back after a few months as the shine goes off and people take profits for investing in the long run you need to consider how the increase in capital will be used and how demand and supply will change since the company is using the money to invest in factors of production i.e. making more product it is the return on capital or investment employed roce that will inform the fundamentals underlying the stock price the higher the roce the more valuable the capital raised is in the future and the more profits and the company as a whole will grow a to ask yourself is whether they can employ the extra capital at the same roce as they currently produce it is possible that by investing in new more productive equipment they can raise their roce but also possible that because the lithium mines or whatever can only get so big and can only get so much access to the extra capital will not be as productive as existing capital so roce will fall for the new capital

thank you for this point   i 've worked on the front end of union shops as an engineer at several different places union workers can be incredibly short sighted lazy incompetent and act like asshole union leadership can often act as a agent that itself in between workers and management unions will often act in resistance to the implementation of necessary business practices and block forward progress   this is because management lets them   managers will often complain about how they wish their plants were n't unionized yet wo n't even stand up for their own rights that have been negotiated into the management side of the contract at the first sign of resistance they will fold and refuse to fight for what is necessary for the business they do n't engage the workers and leaders on the floor by just implementing policies with no input from the floor   any stupid fucking rule or unsustainable compensation that a union has negotiated has a management signature approving it   running a union shop can be difficult but it is no excuse for allowing it to harm the bottom line any time a plant needs to relocate to a right to work state represents just as much of a failure on management as it does labor

because large stores do not pay their cashiers enough that the companies can dock the employees pay if they allow a bad credit card to go through   so most cashiers at large stores wo n't take the extra effort to check the card properly   as a result large stores come up with other ways to handle potential credit card fraud   for example they calculate a certain amount of fraud as expected and include it in their price calculations   or they can use cameras to catch fraudsters    at small stores there is a much higher chance that the cashier is either the owner or a relative of the owner   and even those who are unrelated tend to be hired by the owner directly   the owners do have their pay if a bad credit card is accepted as their pay is the profit from the business   so they tend to create protocols that at least in their mind reduce the chance of taking a bad credit card   the cashier is often the only employee in the store to check anything    another issue is that small stores have a harder time getting approved to accept credit cards   the companies that process the credit cards can take back their machine if there is a lot of fraud   so the companies can require more from small stores than they can from big stores   those companies ca n't stop processing cards for safeway because they need safeway as much if not more than safeway needs them   so the processors have more leverage to make small stores do what they want   and small stores can feasibly fire non owner cashiers who do not comply    owners of course ca n't be fired   but they are far more vulnerable to business losses   so it is really important to an owner to keep the credit card machine   and it is pretty important to avoid losses as it is their money directly    relatives of owners may be safe from firing but they are not safe from family retaliation like taking away television privileges   and they may also think of the effect of business losses on the family    large stores can fire cashiers but they are chronically understaffed and almost none of their cashiers will consistently follow a strict protocol   since fraudsters only need to succeed once an inconsistent application is almost as bad as no application   they might charge the cashiers for fraud but then they would have to pay the cashiers more than minimum wage specifically for that reason e.g. a $ 50 a month bonus for no fraud   for many of them it 's cheaper to risk the fraud    and large stores ca n't mix owners and relatives of owners into the mix   it 's hard to say who owns safeway   and even if you could the relationship between one fraud transaction and the dividend paid on one share of stock is tiny   it would take thousands of shares to get up to a penny

are you sure the question even makes sense in the present day world economy it 's unlikely that someone young who just started working has the means to put away any significant amount of money as savings and attempting to do so might actually preclude making the financial choices that actually lead to stability things like purchasing the right types and amounts of insurance buying outright rather than using credit to compensate for the fact that you committed to keep some portion of your income as savings spending money in ways that enrich your experience and expand your professional opportunities etc there 's also the ethical question of how viable sustainable saving is the mechanism by which saving ensures financial stability is by everyone hoarding enough resources to deal with some level of worst case scenario that might happen in their future this worked for past generations in the us because we had massive amounts relative to the population of stolen natural resources infrastructure built on enslaved labor etc it does n't scale with modern changes the world is undergoing and it inherently only works for some people when it 's not working for others from my perspective much more valuable financial skills for the next generation are

other people have the point that you will get a better rate on a 15 year mortgage typically around 1.25 lower the lower rate makes the 15 year mortgage financially wiser than paying a 30 year mortgage off in 15 years   so go with the 15 year if your income is stable you will never lose your job your appliances never break your vehicles never need major repairs the pipes in your house never burst you and your spouse never get sick and you have no kids or if you do have kids they happen to have good straight teeth they have no aspirations for college do n't play any expensive sports and they will never ask for help paying the rent when they get older and move out   but if any of those things are likely possibilities the 30 year mortgage would give you some flexibility to cover short term cash shortages by reverting to your normal 30 year payment for a month or two now the financially wise may balk at this because you are supposed to have enough cash in reserves to cover stuff like this and that is good advice but how many people struggle to maintain those reserves when they buy a new house   consider putting together spreadsheet and calculating the interest cost difference between the two strategies how much more will the 30 year mortgage cost you in interest if you pay it off in 15 years that amount equates to the cost of an insurance policy for dealing with an occasional cash shortage do you want to pay thousands in extra interest for that insurance it is pretty pricey insurance one strategy would be to go with the 30 year now make the extra principal payments to keep you on a 15 year schedule see how life goes and refinance to a 15 year mortgage after a couple years if everything goes well and your cash reserves are strong unfortunately rates are likely to rise over the next couple years which makes this strategy less attractive if at all possible go with the 15 year so you lock in these near historic low rates consider buying less house or dropping back to the 30 year if you are worried that your cash reserves wo n't be able to handle life 's little surprises

i 'm not sure what you mean by writing off your time but to answer your questions remember that essentially you are a salaried employee of a corporation   so if you are spending time at your job even if you are not billing anything to a client you are earning your salary if there are costs involved with these activities maybe class fees a book purchase or travel expenses the corporation should be paying the costs as business expenses   however the logistics of this whether the corporation writes a business check to the vendor directly or you put the expenses on a personal credit card and are reimbursed with an expense check from the corporation do n't matter   your accountant can show you the right way to do this

you can make a rough calculation of the annual turnover rate of stocks by calculating the institutional investors holding of that stock institutional investors are the only firms that are required to provide such data the good this is they usually make the lion share of trading activity on the other hand this task might proof    a different ratio that could be used as a substitute share turnover which is calculated as   share turnover gives the number of shares traded as a fraction of the number of shares outstanding for example if you compare the results of stock turnover for three companies and the results came as follows   company a share turnover 1.5 times company b share turnover 3 times company c share turnover 0.3 times from the results we can conclude that for a particular period company c had the least activity and the number of shares traded for that period was only a small fraction of the shares outstanding while other traders of company c hold most shares and never trade them if you make a cross analysis of a list of businesses you intend to invest in you could figure which one has the least number of in the shares traded

a loan is not a taxable income neither is a gift loans are repaid with interest the interest is taxable income to the lender and may or may not be deductible to the borrower depending on how the loan proceeds were used gifts are taxable to the donor the person giving the gift under the gift tax they 're not a taxable income to the recipient some gifts are exempt or excluded from gift tax there 's the annual exemption limit lifetime exclusion which is correlated to the estate tax various specific purpose gifts or transfers between spouses are exempt in general   if you trade for something of equal value is that considered income yes sale proceeds are taxable income however your basis in the item sold is deductible from it if you borrow a small amount of money for a short time is that considered income see above loan proceeds are not income does the friend have to pay taxes when they get back their $ 10 no repayment of the loan is not taxable income interest on it is do you have to pay taxes if you are paid back in a different format than originally paid form of payment does n't matter barter trade does n't affect the tax liability the friend sold you lunches and you paid for them the friend can deduct the cost of the lunches from the proceeds what 's left is taxable income everything is translated to the functional currency at the fair market value at the time of the trade you are required to pay taxes on the gross amount very rarely taxes apply to gross income definitely not the us federal income taxes for individuals an example of an exception would be the california llc taxes the state of california taxes llcs under its jurisdiction on gross proceeds regardless of the actual net income this is very uncommon however the irc the us federal tax code is basically everything is taxable except what 's not and the cost of generating income is one of the what 's not that is why you can deduct the basis of the asset from your gross proceeds when you sell stuff and only pay taxes on the net difference

see my answer here what is the dividend tax rate for uk stock the only tax from us stocks you 'd need to worry about would be dividend withholding tax of 30   if you contact your isa provider they should be able to provide you with a w8-ben form so that you can have this rate reduced to 15   just because there 's a tax treaty does not mean you will automatically be charged 15 you must provide a w8-ben form and renew it when it expires that last 15 is unfortunately unavoidable   if you were paying any uk taxes you could claim that 15 as a discount against your uk dividend tax liability but as your us stock would be wrapped in an isa there 's no uk tax to pay which means no tax to reclaim from the tax treaty other than though you will pay absolutely no tax on us stocks held in an isa to either the us or uk government

if we take only the title of the question can the ceo short the stock it was probably different before enron but nowadays a ceo can only make planned trades that is trades that are registered a very long time before and that can not be avoided once registered so the ceo can say i sell 100,000 shares in exactly six months time then in six months time the ceo can and must sell the shares anything else will get him into trouble with the sec quite automatically i do n't know if shorting a stock or buying options can be done that way at all so it 's possible only in the sense of it 's possible but you 'll be in deep trouble   selling shares or exercising share options may indicate that the company 's business is in trouble if the sale makes that impression and everyone else starts selling because the ceo sold his shares then the ceo may be in trouble with the board of directors such a sale would be totally legal if announced long time ahead but just a bad move if it makes the company look bad shorting sales is much worse in that respect if the ceo wants to buy a new car he may have to sell some shares there are people paid almost only in share options no matter where the share price is going but shorting shares means that you most definitely think the share price is going to drop you 're betting your money on it that would tend to get a ceo fired even if it was legal

mutual funds buy and sell shares in companies in accordance with   the policies set forth in their prospectus not according to the   individual needs of an investor that is when you invest money in or withdraw money from a mutual fund   the manager buys or sells whatever shares that in the manager 's judgement   will be the most appropriate ones consistent with the investment policies thus a large cap mutual fund manager will not buy the latest hot small cap stock that will likely be hugely profitable he she must choose only between various large capitalization companies some exchange traded funds are fixed baskets of stocks suppose you will not invest in a company x as a matter of principle unless a mutual fund prospectus says that it will not invest in x you may well end up having an investment in x at some time because the fund manager bought shares in x. with such an etf   you know what is in the basket and if the basket does not include stock in x   now it will not own stock in x at a later date some exchange traded funds are constructed based on some index and track the index as a matter of policy thus you will not be investing in x unless x becomes part of the index because standard or poor or russell or somebody changed their minds and the etf buys x in order to track the index finally some etfs are exactly like general mutual funds except that you can buy or sell etf shares at any time at the price at the instant that your order is executed whereas with mutual funds the price of the mutual fund shares that you have bought or sold is the nav of the mutual fund shares for that day which is established based on the closing prices at the end of the trading day of the stocks bonds etc that the fund owns   so you might end up owning stock in x at any time based on what the fund manager thinks about x.

in 2010 the restore online shoppers confidence act was passed which prohibited certain activities most of which had to do with online sites sharing your cc info with third parties   however the final part of the act deals with negative option marketing which is basically what you 're describing we will charge you unless you say no it requires three components to allow a negative option if you did not explicitly enroll in automatic payment and made the initial purchase online or made your most recent purchase online i suspect then it sounds like this was a violation of this act   on the other hand the act is n't terribly careful about defining terms and is really quite vague in a lot of places so it 's possible they would argue they are not using a negative option scheme but instead simply charging your bill similar to how your phone company might use autopay if it was not online then this probably does n't apply   instead the ftc 's rule on negative option with regard to sale of goods applies   title 16 part covers this this law is much less limiting as to what the marketer can do

is this an employee stock purchase plan espp if so and there is no required holding period selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk one caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop if your discount is only 5 for example a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out the only other cons i can think of is espp contributions being withheld from you for months albeit for a virtually guaranteed return and it complicates your taxes a bit on the flip side another pro is that after you sell the shares you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it

this is an excellent question one that i 've before as well here 's how i 've reconciled it in my mind why should we agree that a stock is worth anything after all if i purchase a share of said company i own some small percentage of all of its assets like land capital equipment accounts receivable cash and securities holdings etc as others have pointed out notionally that seems like it should be worth something   however that does n't give me the right to lay claim to them at will as i 'm just a very small minority shareholder the old adage says that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay you for it that share of stock does n't actually give me any liquid control over the company 's assets so why should someone else be willing to pay me something for it as you noted one reason why a stock might be attractive to someone else is as a potentially tax advantaged revenue stream via dividends especially in this low interest rate environment this might well exceed that which i might obtain in the bond market the payment of income to the investor is one way that a   stock might have some inherent value that is attractive to investors as you asked though what if the stock does n't pay dividends as a small shareholder what 's in it for me without any dividend payments there 's no regular method of receiving my invested capital back so why should i or anyone else be willing to purchase the stock to begin with i can think of a couple reasons expectation of a future dividend you may believe that at some point in the future the company will begin to pay a dividend to investors dividends are paid as a percentage of a company 's total profits so it may make sense to purchase the stock now while there is no dividend banking on growth during the no dividend period that will result in even higher capital returns later this kind of your question a non dividend paying stock might be worth something because it might turn into a dividend paying stock in the future expectation of a future acquisition this addresses the original premise of my argument above if i ca n't as a small shareholder directly access the assets of the company why should i attribute any value to that small piece of ownership because some other entity might be willing to pay me for it in the future in the event of an acquisition i will receive either cash or another company 's shares in compensation which often results in a capital gain for me as a shareholder   if i obtain a capital gain via cash as part of the deal then this proves my point the original non dividend paying stock was worth something because some other entity decided to acquire the company paying me more cash than i paid for my shares they are willing to pay this price for the company because they can then reap its profits in the future if i obtain a capital gain via stock in as part of the deal then the process in some sense maybe the new stock pays dividends otherwise perhaps the new company will do something to make its stock worth more in the future based on the same future expectations the fact that ownership in a stock can hold such positive future expectations makes them worth something at any given time if you purchase a stock and then want to sell it later someone else is willing to purchase it from you so they can obtain the right to experience a positive capital return in the future while stock valuation schemes will vary both dividends and acquisition prices are related to a company 's profits this provides a connection between a company 's profitability expectations of future growth and its stock price today whether it currently pays dividends or not

budget means both expenses and revenue in quite a few cases say personal finance typically one refers to budget more from expenses point of view as the revenue is typically fixed known mostly salary    the operating budget and capital budget are laid out separately as operating budget gives out day to day expenses that are typically essential employee salaries routine maintenance of infrastructure etc the revenue is also tied in to match this these are done within the same year where as capital budget is to build new infrastructure say a new bridge or other major expense that are done over period of years the revenues to this are typically tied up differently and can even be linked to getting more funding from other agencies or loans

a few ideas if you can find cards that do n't have fees you could use re debit gift cards as your envelopes you can write the purpose for each card on its face carrying around more than a few cards will get unwieldy fast how many categories do you need use the rewards card strategy that was recommended to you put all of your spending on this carry a slip of paper in your wallet for each of your categories of spending when you charge against a category punch mark tear off a piece of the paper according to some scheme that will allow you to track the amount you do n't have to carry the envelopes around with you all the time you would n't carry around the grocery envelope all the time unless you often just randomly decide to go grocery shopping while you 're out and about when you are going out and know you need to have cash for a certain purpose pull some money from your envelope put a paper clip around it with maybe a slip of paper and put it into your wallet you could carry around a few different categories of money this way without too much hassle this requires planning your spending for the day the best way to avoid spending money is to not have it

the average of a dozen good answers is close to what would be right the wisdom of crowds but any one answer will be skewed by one 's own opinions   the question is missing too much detail i look at $ 400 k as $ 16k yr of ongoing withdrawals how much do you make now when the kids are all in school full time can your wife work $ 400 k seems on the low side to me especially with 3 kids how much have you saved for college   the $ 150 k for your wife is also a bit low without a long tangent on the monetary value of the stay at home spouse what will you spent on childcare if she passes   term life also has a expiration date when my daughter was born my wife and i got 20 year term she is now 16 her college account fully funded and we are semi retired the need for insurance is over if one of us dies the survivor does n't need this big of a house and will have more than they need to be comfortable in a downsized one my belief is that the term value should bridge the gap to the kids getting through college and the spouse getting too much less i 'd have left my wife at risk too much more she 'd be better off if i were dead i say that half joking the insurance company will often limit the size policy to something reasonable

i think you 're missing a couple of things first why do you think its a reverse mortgage more likely than not its a regular mortgage home equity loan if so if they expect the stock market to rise significantly more than the amount of interest they pay on the loan then its a totally sensible course of action second the purchase in cash only to take out a loan later can definitely be a sensible way to do things for example if the seller wants to close fast or if there are competing offers where not having a contingency is the tipping point another reason might be purchasing in an entity name for example holding the title as an llc and in this case it is easier to get a loan if you already have the house since the banks see the owner 's actual commitment and not just promises

credit unions operate for the benefit of their depositors who are the actual owners of the institution whereas conventional banks operate for the benefit of their shareholders who of course are not necessarily depositors so credit unions will typically give a benefit or service for free if it is free or extremely cheap to them whereas conventional banks will charge for it if they think it will not lose them depositors

the reason that funds and the like are bad is n't because of the leverage ratio it 's because they 're compounded daily and the product of all the doubled daily returns is not mathematically equivalent to the double the long term return i 'd consider providing big fancy equations using pi as the product of elements in a sequence operator and other calculus but that would be overkill i do n't think i can do here and i do n't know the relevant anyway anyway from the economics theory perspective the ideal leverage ratio is 1x that is unlevered straight investment consider using leverage costs money you know that surely if someone could borrow money at n% and invest at an expected where x > 0 then they would they would borrow all the money they could and buy all the s&p500 they could but when they bought all that s&p500 they 'd eventually run out of people who were willing to sell it for that cheap that would mean the excess return would be smaller eventually you 'd get to a point where the excess return is zero well no empirically we can see that it 's definitely not zero and that in the real world that stocks do return more than bonds why   because stocks are riskier than bonds the difference in expected return between an index like the s&p500 and a us treasury bond is due to the relative riskiness of the s&p500 which is n't guaranteed by the us government to return your principal any money that you make off of leverage comes from assuming some sort of a risk now assuming risk can be a profitable thing to do but there are also a lot of people out there with higher risk tolerance than you like insurance companies and billionaires so the market is n't exactly short of people willing to take risks and you should n't expect the returns of assuming risk in the general case to be awesome now it 's true that investing in an unlevered fashion is risky also but that 's not an excuse to go leveraged anyway it 's a reason to hold back in fact regular stocks are sufficiently risky that most people probably should n't be holding a 100 stock portfolio they should be that risk with bonds instead and increasing the size of their bond holdings over time the appropriate time to use leverage is when you have information which limits your risk you have done research and have reason to believe that you understand the future of an individual stock index better than the rest of the stock market does you calculate that the potential for achieving returns with leverage outweighs the risks then you dump your money into the leveraged position in exchange for this the market receives information about anticipated future returns of this instrument because of the price movement which occurs as a result of someone putting his money where his mouth is if you 're just looking to dump money into broad market in a leveraged fashion you 're doing it wrong there is no free money ed which is not to say there 's not money there 's lots of money but if you go looking for the free kind you wo n't find it and may end up with money that you thought was free but was actually quite expensive edit okay so you do n't like my answer i 'm not surprised i 'm giving you a real answer instead of a make free money answer okay here 's your how to make free money answer assume you are using a constant leverage ratio over the length of time you 've invested your money and you do n't get to just jump into and out of the market that 's market timing not leverage so you have to stay invested you 're going to have a scenario which falls into one of these categories the s&p500 historically rises over time the average rate of return probably exceeds the average interest rate so the ideal leverage ratio is infinite of course this is a stupid answer in real life because you ca n't pull that off your risk tolerance is too low and you will have trouble finding a lender willing to lend you unsecured money and you 'll probably lose all your money in a crash sooner or later ultimately it 's a stupid answer because you 're asking the wrong question you should probably ask a better question when i use leverage to gain additional exposure to risk am i being properly compensated for assuming that risk

agree with it is rare larger cap examples include nokia and holdings   if cash exceeds market cap that means total debt is greater than ev the value of the operating assets if the debt is partially repaid matures the equity is ok but if management is crap and the cash is spent at an below the interest rate on the debt now you have a situation where the net debt exceeds the value of the operating assets the credit quality suffers debt trades down you need to in order to avoid bankruptcy   the above assumes debt is greater than cash situations where cash exceeds market cap and debt is less than cash i.e. a negative ev are exceedingly rare in larger companies and are either a a wonderfully attractive mispricing or b market views management as so awful that the cash will get burnt up by the business and the value of that cash will be destroyed

if the correction results in you owing them money you typically just need to pay them the appropriate amount i believe they charge back dated interest on the amount if it was supposed to have been paid in the past but if it 's for this year 's taxes then payment is n't due until the end of april and so interest would not apply in some circumstances they may apply fines or press charges for tax evasion but only if they have reason to believe you intentionally knowingly attempted to your tax return in order to avoid paying taxes you can challenge their decision to fine you but you are considered guilty until proven innocent obviously that 's the opposite for any criminal charges the good news is lots of people accidentally enter the wrong numbers and the cra is aware of this and rarely takes action against them other than making them pay what they owe they have ways to look for suspicious behavior and differentiate that from innocent mistakes so do n't worry you should be fine not fined

first the obvious business school rankings are flawed    i have no doubt that asian business schools are improving rapidly and many are already on par with western universities many of the best teachers at us european schools are also teaching in asia i have never had an asian teacher but i expect that they are as great as their western counterparts also academic journals accept more and more asian submissions    but we also have to put the numbers in perspective an american student who did an mba in china will have a hard time getting a job in the us even those who go to european universities are met by recruiters with so these the high ranking of asian schools is really only relevant for asian students    in short what the ranking says is if you 're chinese you do n't need to go to the us or europe for your business degree personally i suggest you still do if you can afford it because the experience abroad and the exposure to students with a different attitude will be an enrichment

first to actually answer the question how long at these rates   these is nothing magic or nefarious about what the bank is doing they add accrued interest and take your payment off the new total   i 'd make higher payments to the 8.75 debt until it 's gone $ 100/mo extra and be done the first debt if you bump it to $ 50 will be paid in 147 months at $ 92 months everything you pay above the minimum goes right to the principal balance and gets you closer to paying it off   the debt snowball is not the ideal way to pay off your debt say i have one 24 credit card the bank was nice enough to give me a $ 20,000 line of credit on i also have 20 cards each with $ 1000 in credit all at 6 the snowball dictates that the smallest debt be paid first so while i pay the minimum on the 24 card the 6 cards get paid off one by one but i 'm supposed to feel good about the process as i reduce the number of cards every few months   the correct way to line up debt is to pay off the tax adjusted highest rate first as an extra $ 100 to the 24 card saves you $ vs 50 cents mo for the 6 cards i wrote an article discussing the debt snowball which links to a calculator where you can see the difference in methods i note that if the difference from lowest to highest rate is small the snowball method will only cost you a small amount more if by coincidence the balances are close the difference will also be small   the above aside it 's the rest of your situation that will tell you the right path for you for example a matched 401(k deposit should take priority over most debt repayment the $ 11,000 might be better for a house downpayment as that $ is student loan and wo n't count as the housing debt rather other debt and part of the higher ratio when qualifying for the mortgage if you already have taken this into account by all means pay off the 8.75 debt asap then start paying off the 3 faster keep in mind this is likely the lowest rate debt one can have and once paid off you ca n't withdraw it again so it 's important to consider the big picture first   are you depositing to a retirement account is it a 401(k and are you getting any matching from the company

if you want higher returns you may have to take on more risk from lowest returns and usually lower risk to higher returns and usually higher risk bank savings accounts term deposits on line savings accounts offset accounts if you have a mortgage fixed interest eg bonds property and stock markets   if you want potentially higher returns then you can go for derivatives like options or cfds fx or futures these usually have higher risks again but as with any investments some risks can be partly managed also cmc markets charges $ 11 commission up to $ 10,000 trade this is actually quite a low fee based on your $ 7,000 $ 22 for in and out of a position would be less than of course you might want to buy into more than one company so your brokerage would be slightly higher still this is way lower than full service brokerage which could be $ 100 or more in and then again out again what ever you decide to do get yourself educated first

the dutch tax office is pretty decent although slightly do n't expect a lot of help but they 're not generally known for making a lot of problems digital copies are fine for instance they will send you your first vat notice you probably would have known if your company would have been incorporated so i 'll assume you 're just trading as a natural person that means you still have to file vat returns but the business income is just filed annually as other income   for the vat part you 'll need to invoice your customers keep a copy of those invoices for your own bookkeeping and keep track of the matching customer payments together these form the chief evidence of your vat obligation you also have a vat deduction from your purchases it 's a value added tax after all again keep receipts the usual vat period is 3 months so you 'd pay vat 4 times a year but if you would pay less than euro you might not need to pay at all and just need to file annually the income part is easy with the receipts you had for vat purposes anyway dutch tax office vat in english

hey i hear ya on this situation i also graduated from a good school finance comp sci with a mediocre gpa and had difficulty securing a full time position in finance my best advice is to network the shit out of alumni you can connect to through linkedin or your schools alumni network homepage people are much more open to talking than you would typically think   like your friends said getting into ibd as an analyst is ideal as it gives you a great line on your resume shows you worked hard and has amazing training now comes the really shitty part of this conversation if you 've already graduated college it 's next to impossible to get into a bulge bracket as an analyst your best bet in this case would be to try to get into a mid cap or boutique ib and work your way from there again though networking means 100x more than anything else   now the good news investment research is very different from investment banking yes equity research is within an investment bank sell side and buy side but it is very different from investment banking see chinese walls it 's easier to make the transition into research without formal recruiting than it is to get into ib directly   couple things to keep in mind know the difference between sell side an buy side i 'm not talking about just one buys stuff the other tries to get you to buy it i 'm talking about conflicts of interest on the sell side personalities types of research what your role entails org structure etc sell side is extremely different than buy side buy side is much less flexible than sell side in recruiting also do you currently own stocks trade track stocks all day long etc if the answer is no to any of those buy side is really really hard they want people who live and breath investing markets news companies because that 's what they do also training is effectively non existent on the buy side due to the size of the shops some can have $ 10b with 10 people including admins    now lets talk sell side this is where i 'd recommend you put your resources if you 're really passionate about it they tend to hire people without experience more often into entry level jobs b c most are larger investment banks that use research to promote underwriting investment business also you need to have a pitch but not as extensive as on the buy side those 1 2 i talked about the best advice i can offer is to hop on a bloomberg tr capiq terminal if you can and just start finding email addresses of sell side analysts they publish them in their reports and start writing the analysts directly expressing your interest in the business and your desire to talk with them be frank about where you are in your career but show a true passion for research and that you are hungry attach your resume and keep the email short a few sentences with maybe some bullets about how you could help that company spend the time to it to that person follow up with a phone call in 1 2 weeks they will appreciate the and   you 'll find them to be very receptive   even if these analysts do n't have a job available right there if they like you they will pass you on to someone who might this is how networking works that guy might not have a job but someone is always hiring and its a tight community   the other option is to work for any finance firm in some role for 3 5 years then go back to get an mba with an mba from a top school you can basically transition into anything    pm me if you ever want to talk over im i 'd be happy to chat

i ca n't vouch for australian law but in the us there is actually a recognized mechanism for in family loans which ensures that it 's all fully documented for tax purposes including filing it as an official second mortgage just did that recently in my own family which is why i 'm aware of it we 're required to charge at least some interest there 's a minimum set currently around 0.3 and the interest is taxable income and it is wise to get a lawyer to draw up the paperwork there are a few services which specialize in this charging a flat fee of about us$ 700 if the loan is standard enough that they can handle it as fill in the blank but outside of that it 's pretty painless this can also be used as a way of shifting gift limits from year to year if you issue a loan and then gift the recipient with the payments each year including the payments you 've effectively spread the immediate transfer of money over multiple years of taxes of course it does cost you the legal paperwork and the tax in the interest which they 're still paying out of your gift but it can be a useful tool and it 's one that was n't well known until recently again this is all us codes posted only for comparison and for the benefit of us readers it may be completely irrelevant but it may be worth investigating whether oz has something similar

here 's an excerpt from the charles schwab website which i think will help evaluate your position the simple answer to your question is no the value of a gift of stock    for gift tax liability is not the donor 's cost basis but rather the    fair market value of the stock at the time the gift is given so let 's    say you purchased 100 shares of xyz stock at $ 50 a share your cost    basis is $ 5,000 now the stock is $ 80 a share and you give it as a    gift the value of your gift for gift tax purposes is $ 8,000 in 2015 you can give up to $ 14,000 to an unlimited number of    individuals each year without paying a gift tax or even reporting the    gifts if you give over that amount to any individual however you    must report the gift on your tax return but you do n't have to pay    taxes until you give away more than the current lifetime limit of    $ the amount above and beyond $ 14,000 per person per    year so in the example above there would be no gift tax liability    however if the stock happened to be $ 150 a share the value of the    gift would be $ 15,000 you 'd then have to report it and $ 1,000 would    be applied toward your $ lifetime exclusion you will need to pay a gift tax on the current value of the stock i 'm not familiar with the tax laws in india but if your brother was in the us he would n't pay taxes on that gift until he sells the stock the recipient does n’t have to worry about gift taxes it 's when the    recipient decides to sell the stock that the issue of valuation comes    up for income taxes and this is where things can get a bit more    complicated in general when valuing a gift of stock for capital gains tax    liability it 's the donor 's cost basis and holding period that rules    as an example let 's say you receive a gift of stock from your    grandfather he bought it for $ 10 a share and it 's worth $ 15 a share    on the day you receive it if you then sell the stock whether for a    gain or a loss your cost basis will be the same as your    grandfather ’s $ 10 per share sell it at $ 25 and you 'll pay tax at    the short- or long term rate depending on how long he owned the    stock on a gain of $ 15 a share sell it at $ 8 and your capital loss    will be $ 2 a share ultimately with a gift this large that also crosses international borders you really should hire a professional who is experienced with these types of transactions their fees commission will be completely offset by the savings in risk and paperwork

what you 're getting at is the same as investing with leverage usually this comes in the form in a margin account which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate invest the money and hopefully beat the interest rate   is this approach unwise that completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loan 's interest rate is the higher your loan 's interest rate the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate if you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations you have come out ahead and made a profit if you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest if not then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan   are there really are investments aside from stocks and such that i can try to use to my advantage with interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the us you 'll probably be hard pressed to find a savings account or cd that will return a higher interest rate than your loan 's if you 're nervous about the risk associated with investing in stocks and bonds as is healthy then know that they come in a wide spectrum of risk it 's up to you to evaluate how much risk you 're willing to take on to achieve a higher return

hey currently in treasury it 's good in some ways and bad in others every role has it 's pluses and minuses   some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company you get a cursory view of what everyone is doing all the time but you do n't really ever get in depth views of any one area it 's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies wo n't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department you get to look at bond and commercial paper markets if that 's interesting to you you get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important you 're the first to know if the company is gon na go bankrupt it 's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move but it 's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility it 's one of the only corporate finance roles that 's closer to front office than mid or back office   if you are just joining corporate treasury you 'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity after that you would move into bond stuff management corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk after that you 'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and m&amp;a activity which is the real cool shit    that 's what came off the top of my head do you have any specific questions

for the us government they 've just credited person b with a million usd and have n't gained anything afterall those digits are intangible and do n't really have a value imo two flaws in this reasoning the us government did n't do anything the receiving bank credited the recipient if the digits are intangible such that they have n't gained anything they have n't lost anything either in practice the role of governments in the transfer is purely supervisory the sending bank debits the sender 's account and the receiving bank credits the recipient 's account every intermediary makes some money on this transaction because the cost to the sender exceeds the credit to the recipient the sending bank typically receives a credit to their account at a correspondent bank the receiving bank typically receives a debit from their account at a correspondent bank if a bank sends lots of money eventually its account at its correspondent will run dry if a bank receives lots of money eventually its account at its correspondent will have too much money this is resolved with domestic payments sometimes handled by governmental or quasi governmental agencies in the us banks have an account with the federal reserve and adjust balances there the international component is handled by the correspondent bank(s they also internally will credit and debit if they get an imbalance between two currencies they ca n't easily correct they will have to sell one currency to buy the other fortunately worldwide currency exchange is extremely efficient

actually if you do n't care about paying a bit more either hire an accountant and dump the paper on them or may be cheaper but a bit more work spring for tax software modern tax programs can often download most of your data directly if you do n't care about claiming deductions you can skip a lot of the rest i 'm perfectly capable of doing my taxes on paper or in a spreadsheet but i spring for tax software every year because i find it a lot more pleasant   remember that most of the complexity does come from policies intended to reduce your taxes when you call for simplification you may not like the result it 's better than it was a decade or two ago i used to joke that the battle cry of the next revolution would be no taxation without proper instructions

amazon has 2 different cards you can apply for a store card and a credit card the credit card is through chase the deal is not a scam i can confirm this because i applied for their credit card and got $ 70 in the form of a digital gift card by giving customers free money for signing up for their cards they get more people who are willing to give it a try once you have a card you get benefits like 3 5 percent back on amazon purchases that will entice consumers to use the card amazon likely has an agreement with chase and they are hoping to get you hooked with the free money and benefits

having savings only in your home currency is relatively low risk compared with other types of low diversification this is because in a simple case your future cash outflows will be in your home currency so if the gbp fluctuates in value it will theoretically still buy you the same goods at home in this way keeping your savings in the same currency as your future expenditures creates a natural hedge against currency fluctuation this gets complicated for goods imported from other countries where base price fluctuates based on a foreign currency or for situations where you expect to incur significant foreign currency expenditures retirement elsewhere etc in such cases you no longer have certainty that your future expenditures will be based on the gbp and saving money in other currencies may make more sense in many circumstances diversification of the currency of your savings may actually increase your risk not decrease it be sure you are doing this for a specific reason with a specific strategy and not just to generally spread your money around even in case of a brexit consider what would you do with a bank account full of usd if the answer is convert it back to gbp when needed in 6 months 5 years 30 etc to buy british goods then i would n't call this a way to reduce your risk instead i would call it a type of investment with its own set of risks associated

there are two answers to this excluding central banks which are really just a banks to private banks   please note   this is an oversimplification and not accounting for the fact that banks operate in both categories now     banks are either depository institutions or financial service transaction providers     depository institutions are your typical retail bank regions boa retail wells fargo retail etc   they accept deposits from account holders and lend out via reserve lending to mortgages and business loans for their revenue generation     financial service transaction providers are better known as   you have your goldman sachs deutsche bank jp morgan morgan stanley etc   these have traditionally been banks that do not accept deposit accounts but revenue generation comes from financial services such as asset management and research or from financial transaction such as market making offering both buy sell quotes in capital markets   this is generally the role that banks have played historically from the medieval ages on they started out as being entities that provided access to connecting buyers and sellers of markets

first what 's the reason why do you have that much in cash at all are you concerned about market volatility are you planning to buy a house do you have tens of millions of dollars and this is your slush fund   are you a house flipper and this is part of business for you if you need the money for short term use ie you 're buying a house in cash next month then as long as you 're in a sound bank one of the big national ones for example it seems reasonable   you can never predict a crash like 2008 but it seems unlikely that chase or citibank will go under in the next few weeks if you like to have a cash position then split the money among multiple banks   buy a cd at one major bank with some of the amount   my in laws have a trust which is partially invested in cds and they use multiple banks for this purpose to keep their accounts fully insured   each separate bank you 're covered up to 250k so if you have $ 150k at chase and $ 150k at a local bank you 're covered   you 're also covered in a much larger amount up to 1mm potentially if you are married as you can have a separate account each for $ 250k and a joint account up to $ 500k otherwise why do you have that much in cash   you should invest it in something that will return more than inflation at a minimum edit post $ 350k is around my level of maybe maybe not   you 're risking $ 100k on a pretty low risk assuming this is n't a small local bank and even those are pretty low still   in order to remove that risk you have to do something active ie take 100k somewhere else open a new bank account etc which is n't exactly the hardest thing in the world but it does take effort   is it worth the 0.001 chance entirely made up you lose the 100k   that 's $ 10 if you agree with that risk chance   up to you it would n't be particularly hard though to open an account with an online bank deposit $ 100k in there in a 6 month cd then pay the irs from your other account and when the 6 month cd expires take the cash back into your active account   assuming you 're not planning on buying a house in the next six months this should be fine i 'd think and even then you 'd still have $ 150k for the downpayment up front which is enough to buy a $ 750k house w/o pmi additionally as several commenters note if you can reasonably do so and your money wo n't be making significant interest you might choose to pay your taxes now rather than later   this removes the risk entirely the likely small interest you earn over 3 months may be similar to the amount you 'd spend mostly of your time plus possibly actual expenses moving it to another bank   if you 're making 2 or 3 this may not be true but if you 're in a 0.25 account like my accounts are $ 100k 0.25 0.25 is $ after all

for political reasons almost all governments including the us spend more money than they get from taxes etc   there are a number of things a government can do to cover the difference most governments opt for selling bonds   the national debt of a country can be thought of as being the sum of all the bonds that are still paying interest and that the government has n't redeemed it can all go horribly wrong   if the government gets into a situation where it can not pay the interest or it can not redeem the bonds it has promised to then it may have to break its promise default on its payments   this makes the owners of the bonds unhappy and means potential buyers of future bond sales are less likely to want to buy the governments new bonds effectively meaning the government has to promise to pay more interest in the future   recent examples of this include argentina and may include greece soon the us is in the fortunate position that not many people believe it will default   therefore the new bonds it sells which it does on a regular basis are still in demand even though its interest payments and promises to redeem bonds are huge

any person at any time may produce their own currency one can even do so on the back of a paper napkin ripped beer coaster or whatever   this is not a banking privilege it is within the lawful ability of anyone capable of engaging in commerce it is called a negotiable instrument it gives the holder rights to a sum of money   notice that i say holder this is what distinguishes it from a non negotiable instrument the fact that you do n't need to redeem it from source you can pass it to another who then becomes the holder in due course and thus obtains the rights the rights over a sum of money or indeed other asset are themselves value do banks do this   yes all the time one of the simplest examples are cheques drawn against the bank which are considered as good as cash   usually they will be drawn out to the order of the person you wish to pay but can equally be drawn out to bearer   the only reasons they resist making out to bearer is but you can write your own at any time on any thing see the yet entertaining tale of the negotiable cow

based on what you wrote you would be better off with no position to start and then enter a buy stop 10 above the market and a sell stop 10 below the market both to open positions depending on which way the market moves if the market does n't move that 10 you stay flat however a long option straddle position requires that the market moves significantly one way or the other just so you recover the premium that you paid for the straddle if the market does n't move you will lose money on your straddle due to theta decay and a drop in volatility alternatively you could buy a strangle with a call strike 10 out and a put strike 10 out the premiums would be much much lower and these take the place of the stop entries personally i would never buy a straddle but i do sometimes sell them especially when implied volatility is very high

it 's important to distinguish between speculation and investing buying something because you hope to make money on market fluctuations is speculation buying something and expecting to make money because your money is providing actual economic value is investing   if person a buys 100 shares of a stock with the intent of selling them in a few hours and person b buys 100 shares of the same stock with the intent of holding on to it for a year then obviously at that point they both have the same risk the difference comes over the course of the year first person b is going to be making money from the economic value the company provides over the whole year while the only way person a can make money is from market fluctuation the economic value the company provides over the course of an hour is unlikely to be significant person b is exposed to the risk of buying the stock but that 's by the profit from holding the stock for a year while person a just has the risk second if person a is buying a new stock every hour then they 're going to have thousands of transactions so even though person b assumed just as much risk as person a for that one transaction person a has more total risk

thank goodness you replied again before i did i completely forgot to respond and that notification was a good reminder i m genuinely enjoying the conversation and sorry about the name calling most of my political and economic debates happen with family where name calling is not only accepted but expected lol     gt too many people walk into the emergency room uninsured or under insured they get emergent care that they are not covered for and the hospitals jack up the prices greatly in the hopes of getting a larger portion reimbursed by medicare   this link seems to contradict that i do nt know enough about the system to say you re wrong but it does nt sound very real to me    gt;again switzerland has lower tax rates than the us but they do n't even crack the top 20 when it comes to countries with low taxes   you re obviously not wrong but there are many places on that list i d love to retire in amongst the developed world from what i m seeing here has the 27th lowest individual income tax rate when it applies to there highest bracket now i use the term developed very loosely here as there are countries ahead of them on that list that clearly are nt part of the developed world but its not up to me to decide what the swiss rank is   gt;so you work in construction an industry in which commercial is notorious for a contract whether to government or to private and then running into unexpected that cause the job to go over schedule over budget   this is dangerously false the industry is nt known for and going over budget only really really really bad contractors do that what a lot of good contractors do is when you know a general contractor for a long time or you re trying to to build a relationship you do favors so they will say for instance hey man i do nt have the budget to pay you what you need so take a loss on this one and we 'll take care of you on the next one or they will find some money unaccounted for in the budget and throw it your way in the form of extra work done    gt;its not like the government just sits around and takes it i know of at least one federal contractor who went to federal prison for fraudulently winning contracts in my part of the country   in my line of work they really do just sit back and take it from what i ve experience you have to be super greedy and really fuck up to get their attention 1 job i did i was only there for 3 weeks total and in that 3 week period i saw all types of osha violations waste time waste and plenty of workers who did nt really know what they were doing checking on the job to make sure progress was being made    gt;it is because government has tremendous resources that they can throw at a problem   this is where we really do differ i see this as a bad thing i see it as them not spending money efficiently money that they got from me and my hard work look at the for instance it is now 3 times over budget from the projections for how much of an upgrade what s the point of a contract if someone can just go over budget 3 times over without anyone an eye why not just say get it done and bill us i understand your point of view completely i just vehemently disagree with it especially because i think the government source of revenue is based around theft

typically the cc company itself wo n't follow the customer very far upon a default though it certainly can act as its own debt collector or hire an agency for a fee to do the collection   what most often happens once they do that assuming they win the lawsuit they can do the following they can not force you into bankruptcy but they might make it so you have no better options if bankruptcy is less painful than the above which it often is   they certainly can and will report to the credit bureaus of course   for more information nolo has a decent help site on this subject different jurisdictions have slightly different rules so look up yours   here is an example this is from massachusetts not every debt is sued for of course particularly pay attention to the statute of limitations in your state   in mine it 's seven years for example   and it 's probably worth contacting someone locally a legitimate non profit debt relief agency or your state 's help agency if they have one to find local rules and regulations

you could sum the p e ratio of all the companies in the industry and divide it by the number of companies to find the average p e ratio of the industry   average p e ratio of industry   = sum of p e ratio of all companies in    industry number of companies in industry

close the account   the age does n't outweigh the fact that you have to pay for the card   it would be one thing if the credit line was a couple thousand but showing the credit bureaus that you are staying away from the $ does n't really make them think you are any more trustworthy with your available credit   utilization matters when you are staying away from much larger chunks of your available credit across all cards

the math on this only works if the workers who are choosing no income at all are being paid by something else   in first world countries humans can not live eat food or sleep in a bed etc without some sort of money   the only question is what else is paying them   government programs friends family support
