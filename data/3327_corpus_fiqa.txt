this is why we tell people not to co sign unless they are able and willing to risk that money becoming a gift or are able and willing to treat it as business rather than family unfortunately that advice is a bit late now to help you when you cosigned you promised the bank that you would make any payments he did n't the bank does n't care why he did n't they just want their money on time getting him to repay you for covering this is strictly between the two of you and unless you signed paperwork at the time establishing a contract other than the promise to cover his loan this becomes extremely messy first step is to make the payments so the loan does n't continue acquiring fees and hurting your credit rating and keep it from falling behind again then you have to convince him to repay the money you have effectively given him depending on your relationship and financial situations you may decide to carry him for a while and trust that he 'll pay you back when he can or sic a lawyer on him you need to make that decision recognizing that it may be a matter of how much family drama you are willing to tolerate

he was n't wrong that a mortgage would help your credit score assuming that this was a perfect world and everyone held up their end of the bargain however now that he has n't you are still legally obligated to pay the loan amount including his portion of it as for a lawsuit it would be hard to prove what he said verbally however it does n't hurt to call a lawyer for a free consultation

in addition to tax related benefits one answer may be that it helps them avoid being inundated with requests to support other foundations most charities have access to public records that indicate potential donors based on income and demographic they can use that info to solicit for donations hey nfl player you have lots of money and we have cute starving that really need your help here 's a blurb from foundation source about some of the benefits to starting your own foundation   get an immediate tax deduction but give later you get the tax deduction when the foundation is funded then make your charitable    gifts over time leave a lasting legacy foundations set up in perpetuity can your name far beyond your lifetime because gifts are made    from an endowment that generates investment revenue the total gifts    made by the foundation can far surpass the actual funding be taken more seriously as a philanthropist a foundation imparts a that causes people to take your philanthropy more seriously    due to the structured organized approach you employ for your giving sidestep unsolicited requests when you focus your foundation on specific giving areas your mission statement can be used to politely    turn down off target funding requests and focus your philanthropy whereas individual donors often spread their giving among as many causes as possible the formalized    structure of a foundation often encourages donors to narrow their    focus to specific causes build a better family as family members take on philanthropic research present their findings to the board participate in the    decision making process and track results they hone skills that will    serve them for years to come tax deductible grants to individuals in need a private foundation allows you to provide emergency assistance directly to individuals    using dollars for which you ’ve already received a tax deduction run charitable programs without setting up a separate nonprofit direct charitable activities are irs approved programs that permit    foundations to directly fund and carry out their own projects pay charitable expenses all legitimate and reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out the foundation ’s charitable mission can be    paid by the foundation and will count toward the annual minimum    distribution requirement provide loans instead of grants when used to support a charitable purpose private foundations can employ loans loan guarantees and    even equity investments which are paid back potentially with    interest so you can recycle your philanthropic capital for other    charitable causes there 's a similar list here on the website for an attorney that specializes in philanthropy and non profits i wo n't copy paste that list as it 's similar but i wanted to provide an additional source confirming the above benefits this link contains some disadvantages as well

there is a thing called the sharpe ratio this ratio takes return risk with risk being defined as the standard deviation of prices over time according to financial theory the investment with the highest best sharpe ratio is a market portfolio technically accepting the lower risk of a treasury is accepting an amplified lower sharpe would be 1 than sharpe would be at most   because of this unless there are liquidity do n't buy etfs with your payroll money duh you should always be in market funds otherwise you are leaving money on the table everything else is just speculation   now the real question is value or growth

you have heard the old adage buy low sell high right that sounds so obvious that you 'd have to wonder why they would ever bother such an expression it should rank up there with do n't walk in front of a moving car on the duh scale of advice well your question demonstrates exactly why it is n't quite so obvious in the real world and that people need to be reminded of it   so in your example the stock prices are currently low relative to what they have been so per that adage do you sell or buy when prices are low hint it is n't sell yes your gut is going to tell you the exact opposite thanks to the fact that our brains are unfortunately wired to make us susceptible to the loss aversion fallacy when the market has undergone a big drop is the worst time to stop contributing buying stocks   this example might help get your brain and gut to agree a little more easily if you were talking about any other non investment commodity cars for instance   your question equates to i really need a car but the prices have been dropping like crazy lately     maybe i should wait until the car dealers start raising their prices again before i buy one dollar cost averaging as littleadv suggested if you have an automatic payroll deduction for your retirement account you are getting the benefit of dollar cost averaging because you are investing the same amount on a scheduled interval you are buying more shares when they are cheap and fewer when they are expensive it is like an automatic buy low strategy is built into the account the alternative which you are implying is a market timing strategy under this strategy instead of investing regularly you try to get in and out of investments right before they go up drop there are two major flaws with this approach    1 your brain will work against you see above and encourage you to do the exact opposite of what you should be doing    2 unless you are this strategy is n't much better than gambling if you are lucky it can work but because of 1 the odds are stacked against you

the solution is most definitely not do you remember when skype used p2p to route its traffic through your home internet slowing your browsing and streaming imagine if youtube used p2p distribution this also does n't work for serving up new videos as you absolutely need an updating main page with dns in order to new content even if you 're going to share it via    there are no websites out there that work solely via p2p site hosting costs money youtube historically has been operating at a loss because of its massive hosting bills they 're providing a service for you to consume for free it 's naive to think that p2p solves this cost issue    even if you somehow implemented a site that used p2p dns and p2p web traffic it 'd still require the end user to pay money in order to host it it would just offset the costs from the website owner to the website user and create a ton of negative externalities your internet connection would be tied down by other people accessing content and you 'd likely see data caps instituted and your monthly isp bill would go up   we have a workable tradeoff at the moment and it 's taken popular sites a while to make it so ads pay for your web experience and they will continue to do so until the majority of users are comfortable with a site based subscription model

your question asked about a specific time the yield curve flattened or inverted   there are other times when the yield curve inverted or flattened   you also imply in your question that investors were flocking to long term bonds which lowered their yields   i do n't believe this is the case   i believe investors were fleeing from short term bonds causing the yields on short term bonds to rise to meet those of long term bonds the chart below shows the history of yields on us bonds over time   the areas are where the yield curve flattened or inverted   notice that after 1982 it is the short term yields that rise sharply to meet or cross the yields on longer term bonds   the yields on longer term bonds move little compared to the movement in yields on the short term bonds   thus it is investors moving out of short term bonds that cause the yield curve to or   these investors are not moving into longer term bonds since the yields on the longer term bonds do not move much at all at these times   in fact in 2006 the longer term bond market was only 25 of the total us public debt while short term bonds made up 75   it would take less money to move the yields on longer term bonds than it would on short term bonds yet the longer term yields did not move near as much as short term yields   so why are investors or banks moving out of short term bonds causing their yields to rise   i believe this happens for one of two reasons   they are moving into higher yielding investments or they need to raise cash to cover bad investments   charts and more information here

in most cases my preference would be to buy however if you intend to sell after just one year i would maybe lean towards renting you have n't included buying and selling cost into your equation nor any property taxes and as john bensin suggests maintenance costs if you were looking to hold the property for at least 5 years 10 years or more then if the numbers stood up i would go with the buy option you can rent it out after you move out and if the rent is higher than your total expenses in holding the property you could rely on some extra passive income

i 'd like to suggest a plan first i know you want to buy a house i get that and that is an awesome goal to work for you need to really sit down and decide why you want a house people often tell we that they want a house because they are throwing their money away renting this is just not true there is a cost of renting that is true but there is also a cost of owning there are many things with a house that you will have to pay for that will add little or no equity value now that equity is nice to have but make no mistake under no circumstance does every dime you put into your house increase its value this is a huge misconception there is interest fees repairs taxes and a bunch of other stuff that you will spend money on that will not increase the value of your home you will do no harm waiting a bit renting and getting to a better place before you buy a house with that out of the way time for the plan note i 'm not saying wait to buy a house i am saying think of these as steps in the large house buying plan get your current debt under control your credit score does n't suck but it 's not good either it 's middle of the road your going to want that higher if you can but more importantly than that you want to get into a pattern of making debt then honoring it the single best advise i can give you is what my wife and i did get a credit card you have one do n't get more and then get into a habit of not spending more on that credit card than you actually have in the bank if you have $ 50 in the bank only spend that on your credit card then pay it in full 100 every payday twice a month this will improve your score quite a bit and will in time get you in the habit of buying only what you can afford unless there has been an emergency you should not be spending more on credit than you actually have your car loan needs to get under control i 'm not going to tell you to pay it off completely but see point 2 your car debt should not be more than you have in the bank this again is a credit building step if you have in the bank and own on your car your ability to get a loan will improve greatly start envelope budgeting there are many systems out there but i like ynab a lot it can totally turn your situation around in just a few months it will also allow you to see your house fund growing breaking point so far this sounds like a long wait but it 's not it also sounds like i am saying to wait to actually buy a house and i 'm not i am not saying get your debt to 0 nor do i think you should wait that long the idea is that you get your debt under control and build a nice solid set of habits to keep it under control a look at your finances at this point now at this point you still have debt but your credit cards are at 0 and have been every payday for a few months your car loan still exists but you have money in the bank to cover this debt and you could pay it off it would eat your nest egg but you could you also have 15k set aside just for the house as you take longer looking for that perfect house that number keeps growing your bank account now has over $ 25,000 in it that 's a good feeling on its own and if you stick with your plan buy your house and put down $ 15k you still have plenty of wiggle room between credit cards that are not maxed out and a $ padding in case the roof falls in again it sounds like i 'm saying wait but i 'm not i 'm saying plan better all of these goals are very doable inside one year a rough year to be sure but doable if you want to do it comfortably then take two years in that time you 're looking searching and learning

the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated i use index funds in my retirement planning but do n't stick to just s&p 500 index funds suppose i balance my money 50/50 between small cap and large cap and say i have $ 10,000   i 'd buy $ 5,000 of an s&p index fund and $ 5,000 of a russell 2000 index fund now fast forward a year   suppose the s&p index fund has $ 4900 and the russell index fund has $    sell $ 150 of russell index fund and buy $ 150 of s&p 500 index funds to balance   repeat that activity every 12 18 months   this lets you be hands off index fund style on your investment choices but still take advantage of great markets    this way i can still rebalance to sell high and buy low but i 'm not stressing about an individual stock or mutual fund choice you can repeat this model with more categories i chose two for the simplicity of explaining

several actually maintenance costs as landlord you are liable for maintaining the basic systems of the dwelling structure electrical plumbing hvac on top of that you typically also have to maintain anything that comes with the space so if you 're including appliances like a w d or fridge if they crap out you could spend a months rent or more replacing them you are also required to keep the property up to city codes as far as unless you specifically assign those responsibilities to your tenant and in some states you are not allowed to do so and in many cases renters expect to come out of their rent one way or the other failure to do these things can put you in danger of giving your tenant a free out on the lease contract and even expose you to civil and criminal penalties if you 're running a real slum escrow payments the combination of property tax and homeowner 's insurance usually doubles the monthly housing payment over principal and interest and that 's if you got a mortgage for 20 down also because this is not your primary residence it 's ineligible for homestead act exemptions where available states like texas are considering extending homestead exemptions to landlords with the expectation it will trickle down to renters however mortgage interest and state taxes do count as rental expenses and can be deducted on schedule c as ordinary business expenses offsetting revenues income tax the money you make in rent on this property is taxable as self employment income tax you 're effectively running a sole proprietorship real estate management company so not only does any profit you are allowed to deduct maintenance and administrative costs from the rent revenues get added to whatever you make in salary at your day job you 're also liable for the full employee and employer portions of medicare medicaid ss taxes you are however also allowed to depreciate the property over its expected life and deduct depreciation the life of a house is pretty long and if you depreciate more than the house 's actual loss of value you take a huge hit if when you sell because any amount of the sale price above the depreciated price of the house is a capital gain though it can work to your advantage by depreciating the maximum allowable to reduce ordinary income then paying lower capital gains rates on the sale   legal costs the rental agreement typically has to be drafted by a lawyer in order to avoid things that can cause the entire contract to be thrown out though there are boilerplate contracts available from state landlords associations this will cost you a few hundred dollars up front and to update it every few years it is deductible as an ordinary expense advertising putting up a for rent sign out front is typically just the tip of the iceberg online and print ads an ad agency these things cost money it 's deductible as an ordinary expense add this all up and you may end up losing money in the first year you rent the property when legal advertising initial maintenance purchases to get the place tenant ready etc are first spent deduct it properly and it 'll save you some taxes but you better have the nest egg to cover these things on top of everything your lender will expect you to bring to closing assuming you do n't have $ 100k+ lying around to buy the house in cash

i believe your statement is mostly correct   all the expert recommendations are based on an inflexible conventional wisdom that presumes that all renters are relatively resource poor when you purchase a $ 50 electronic item at the store and are offered an extended warranty for $ 3 most people turn it down not only because they do n't think it 's worth it but also because in the event that the item fails between say years 1 and 3 they do n't worry enough about that $ 50 to care if they have to buy a new one or live without it the percentage of your net worth also matters for example if you had an entire loss tomorrow you 'd be out $ 20 k if you needed to re purchase your possessions 30 k minus 10 k in current coverage $ 20 k is approximately or 2.3 of your net worth if a catastrophe occurs and you only lose 2.3 of your net worth some might consider that lucky so from that point of view it is n't really a big deal but on the flip side if the extra insurance only costs you $ 50 more per year you may not even notice that dent in your net worth either i think for most people the value of items in their home may be their net worth or at least a much larger percentage of it in which case the insurance makes more sense for someone in your position it probably does n't make much difference either way if you had $ 300 k in valuables in your house perhaps your point of view would be different

the logic the interest rate on the mortgage was so low it did n't make sense not to buy is one reason the housing bubble happened the logic was that it made the house affordable even at high prices once the prices collapsed people still had affordable payments but were unable to sell because they were upside down on the mortgage if you can refinance to a 15-year mortgage or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage it can make sense you can save on the monthly payment and on the total cost of the mortgage but do n't buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity these can be false economies or things that ca n't be of course if nobody spends money the economy will stay poor as to hidden details only purchase housing you want to own for the long haul if you expect to flip it in a few years you might not be able to you might end up stuck as a long distance landlord

i 'm surprised people do n't bring this up more often if you add together not just our sovereign debt but public and private debt plus our contingent liabilities meaning fha student loans fannie mae freddie mac aig etc   that totals over $ 100 trillion dollars more than we could ever pay back meaning literally there is no amount of growth and taxes that could ever pay this money back cite my sources do a google search of james lecture it 's in the first few minutes   the reason you need to add all that together is because the economy ca n't grow if nobody has any money for investment etc there is n't much home equity left after the housing crisis retirement plans are n't holding as much etc there would n't be an easy way to grow this economy that 's why we have currency wars competitive devaluations to me we 're already over the cliff i do n't see us heading back but i 'm not saying that means we 're going to collapse just we 'll need to go back to some sort of standard where our currency is backed by something i.e. commodities or gold or something and there are going to be a lot of losses in the near term meaning i want out of dollars   combined with our lazy entitled generation do n't tell me creating some website where you can order artistic candy on a stick is going to save our economy we need to produce and innovate again to lower our trade deficit and so people actually bring their capital here and dwindling resources i 'd say it 's already game over the pieces just need to move into place

the forward curve for gold says little in my opinion about the expected price of gold the jan 16 price is 7.9 or so higher than the jan 12 price this reflects the current cost of money today 's low interest rates when the short rates were 5 the price 4 years out would be about 20 higher no magic there the site you linked to was in german so i looked and left i 'm certain if you pulled up the curve for platinum or silver it would have the identical shape that 7.9 rise over 4 years the yield curve on the other hand   is said to provide an indication of the direction of the economy a steep curve forecasting positive growth

gt they want to lower the standards we have for goods and services   their goal is regulatory but its not being done in a good publications its an attempt to sneak through a huge long long of bad ideas that would not fly in any kind of light of day and then make them permanent with special eternal domestic legal process background for multinational corporations so permanent that future elections can not change them nor can states individually protect people their laws would be to the extent that unaccountable trade can order huge fines against countries and states for merely doing their sites default files case documents because they upon   new suddenly materialized rights as perceived by the trade agreements almost nobody knows they are doing this often countries do nt realize that they have lost their rights to determine their policies and then countries usually lose   there are so many problems i do n't know where to begin    gt in part by opening up public services to private business   privatization often goes badly they are hiding that and privatization as the only possible future    well at the beginning the ftas nafta and gats mandated the privatization of most public services in countries that signed them with services everything you ca n't drop on your foot especially some of the add on documents to gats that was in 1995 it contains a they all do   which said that countries could not change anything if it was a move back towards public ownership and control in the case of services they frame that as bad as a theft from businesses   so typically says things like they can not create any new public services and if there was any money involved in the market sector at all that it would have to be files in tiny steps no going back to public services allowed    but of course people do nt know that and often do n't believe it when told for example do you believe me when i tell you that s the reason us health care is so     can you see how and why they might lie about what they politicians can do can do about things because they want to win elections by promising things like affordable health but also hide the ugly act that they gave away the programs starting in 1995    the ftas that we can read the early ones tried to do it by being to non they are so complicated and ambiguous only a few people really know what they demanded at least up until recently now they are top secret really secret only the 600 lobbyists have access    now a growing number of people especially in europe seem to realize this is really scary and a red flag but its not because the news was any help its because of the net the media especially in the us has been completely unhelpful they do nt cover this at all ttip is a huge controversy but i have a feeling the worst one is tisa which has remained largely out of the news except for wikileaks and the financial services chapter just one chapter is known and its an old version   now they want in tisa to greatly expand the scope of these ftas to millions of service watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 in a huge number of countries countries want things like the us wants to be able to charge more money for drugs and they want to force other countries to allow us companies into their markets for example insurance or financial instruments it seems that they are trying to deregulate banking when it should be re regulated to avoid a repeat of the 2008 gfc another thing the us wants is to limit generic drugs and make it easier for companies to open factories send contractors etc elsewhere   its not always a good thing to open markets up to   in many cases it could lead to substantial job losses as it has in central america after america crisis belies empty

not charging taxes on a money losing investment or business is much more than humanitarian it is common sense in general money that is used to invest has already been taxed as income or inheritance to the person making the investment so taxing that money again not just the profit would provide a disincentive for people to invest which would be bad for economic growth over the medium and long term as far as taxing a money losing businesses goes most businesses do n't make money in their couple of years and adding further tax burdens would be counter productive because it would provide a major hurdle for people wanting to start a business other have already mentioned that the money losing operation likely paid indirect taxes as well small businesses provide a majority of the economic growth and innovation so in short additional taxes on money losing investments and businesses would be both foolish and shortsighted

suppose you 're writing a put with a strike price of 80 say the asset price goes down to 70 so the holder of the put will exercise the option ie he has a right to sell a share worth 70 for rs 80 whereas a put option writer has an obligation to buy at rs 80 a share trading at rs 70 always think from the perspective of the holder if the holder exercises the option the writer will suffer a loss maximum loss he suffers will be the break even which is strike price reduced by the premium paid if he does n't exercise the option the writer will make a profit which can maximum be the put premium received

so in a sense i can think of the employees option holders as another investor    that makes sense but many of the examples i 'm finding online are still confusing me based on the example above it seems like option holders would be paying the same exercise price as the vc per this seems uncommon    gt the exercise price of employee options the price per share needed to actually own the shares is often less than the original issue price paid by the most recent investor who holds preferred stock     in reality would option holders receive say 40 using example above for their $ 6 m in exercise value due to receiving common stock with the founder being diluted to even further

in almost every circumstance high expense ratios are a bad idea i would say every circumstance but i do n't want backlash from anyone there are many other investment companies out there that offer mutual funds for far less than 1.5 ratio i could n't even imagine paying a 1 expense ratio for a mutual fund   vanguard offers mutual funds that are significantly lower on average than the industry certainly much lower than 1.5 but then again i 'm not sure what mutual funds you have stock bonds etc   here is a list of all vanguard 's mutual funds i honestly like the company a lot many people have n't heard of them because they do n't spend nearly as much money on advertisements or a flashy website but they have extremely low expense ratios you can buy into many of their mutual funds with a expense ratio some are higher but certainly not even close to 1.5 i do n't believe any of them are even half of that also if you were referring to etf 's when you mentioned index fund assuming that since you have etfs in your tag then 0.20 for etf 's is steep check out some identical etfs on vanguard i am not a vanguard employee soliciting their service to you i 'm just trying to pass on good information to another investor i believe you can buy vanguard funds through other investment companies like fidelity for a good price but i prefer to go through them

most financial advisors are actually financial product salesmen   their job is to sweet talk you into parting with as much money as possible either in management fees or in commissions kickbacks on high fee investment products which come from fees charged to you inside the investment   this is a cutthroat business for the salesmen themselves   realistically that is how they feed their family and i empathize but i ca n't afford to buy their product   i wish they would sell something else these people prey on people 's financial lack of knowledge   for instance you put too much importance on returns   why   because the salesman told you that 's important   it 's not   the market goes up and down that 's normal   the question is how much of your investment is being consumed by fees   how do you tell that and generally if you 're invested well   you compare your money 's performance to an index that 's relevant to you   you 've heard of   the s&p 500 that 's an index relevant to us investors   take 2015 the s&p 500 was $ on january 2 2015   it was $ on december 31 2015   so it was flat   it dropped 0.7 if your us investments dropped 0.7 you broke even   if you made less that was lost to the expenses within the investment or the investment performing worse than the s&p 500 index   i lost 0.8 in 2015 the extra 0.1 being expenses of the investment try 2013 s&p 500 was $ on december 28 2012 and $ on dec. 27 2013 that 's growth   that 's amazing but it also means is holding even with the market   if your salesman proudly announced that you made 18 problem all this to say when you say the investments performed poorly do n't go by absolute numbers find a suitable index and compare to the index   a lot of markets were down in 2015 16 and that is not your investment 's fault   you want to know if were down compared to your index    because that reflects either a lousy funds manager or high fees    this may leave you wondering where can i invest that is safe and has sensible fees   i do n't know your market but here we have discount brokers which allow self selection of investments charge no custodial fees and simply charge by the trade commonly $ 10   many mutual funds and etfs are index funds with very low annual fees 0.20 1 in 500 or even less     how do you pick investments look at any of numerous books starting with john bogle 's classic common sense on mutual funds book which is the seminal work on the value of keeping fees low   if you need the cool confident professional to hand hold you through the process a fee only advisor is a true financial advisor who actually acts in your best interest   they honestly recommend what 's best for you but beware many commission driven salespeople pretend to be fee only advisors   the good advisor will be happy to advise investment types and let you pick the brand fidelity vs vanguard and buy it in your own discount brokerage account with a password you do n't share frankly finance is not that hard   but it 's made hard by impossibly complex products that do n't need to exist and are designed to confuse people to conceal hidden fees   avoid those products   you just do n't need them   now you really need to take a harder look at what this investment is like i say they make these things unnecessarily complex specifically to make them confusing and i am confused   although it does n't seem like much of a question to me   1.5 a quarter is 6 a year or 60 in 10 years to ignore compounding if the market grows 6 a year on average so growth just pays the fees they will consume 60 of the $ 220,000 or $   as far as the $ 60,000 for that kind of money it 's definitely worth talking to a good lawyer because it sounds like they misrepresented something to get your friend to sign up in the first place   put some legal pressure on them that $ 60k penalty might get a lot smaller    for instance they 'll recommend which has a 5.25 buy in fee front end load and a 1.23 per year fee expense ratio compare to with zero load and a 0.20 fee   that front end load is kicked back to your broker as commission so he literally ca n't recommend there 's no commission his company would and should fire him for doing so

there are people that make up a small segment of the population that have an unsatisfied need to see the of other people 's houses   there 's also a segment of the population that do n't quite understand the big picture of how service professions work for example any group of friends going into a restaurant and requesting a table and sitting at it for over an hour but feel they do n't need to leave a tip because they only ordered or shared a desert   sure you 're paying for the service of a service professional but it should also include their time and resources you consume outside of the actual service but many do n't have that perspective   why should i pay you if you are n't providing your actual service to me even though i 'm consuming your time and resources that would be earning you your expected salary otherwise is their justification   so when you encounter an individual from both small segments of the population mentioned above the result is the problem your wife faces with perspective buyers i look at the agent buyer relationship from a different perspective when i encounter these no harm intended individuals   i do n't see it as the buyer is hiring the agent for if that was the case a contract of some sorts would be involved detailing the menu of services provided by the agent with associated costs the buyer would make selections from the menu pay the costs and services   rendered   but that 's not how it works   so its important to understand the perspective of the agent looking to hire the buyer you 're not paying the buyer to be your client but you are looking to select the prospective buyer that 's going to generate cash flow   in a commissions based work force that is also your main source of income you have to look at prospective clients as that simply prospects but who are a vital component of your salary   so when allocating your time and resources especially if you 're dealing with several prospects you literally have to turn away these cold leads who are just looking for design tips   and paint color pattern suggestions and you as their escort   if i was in the shoe making business i would n't hire a walk in give him access to materials and   work space with the assumption that if its to his liking it 'll generate profit towards my salary needs if the only thing he 's interested in doing is looking around at all the other shoes a behavior that requires my presence time and resources   you almost ca n't even justify it as looking at it as possible income in the future if it 's costing you revenue now whether its in the form of having to neglect actual buyers or you could be investing your time in things that would impact salary needs such as advance course work attending optional trainings offered by your broker or investing time finding more serious leads

i wrote retirement savings ratio some time ago and 15 seemed the sweet spot the 15 is 10 saved and 5 match in my mind the reason i link is to show a spreadsheet that shares my approach to the analysis   you list a huge number of things to think about all great i 'm near duff 's view although i shoot for 20x final   income so 4 of that is an 80 replacement there 's nothing magic about 80 if social security exists it actually drops the required 80 from you to the 60 or so duff lists so we align   the problems with my sheet no one gets exact 3 raises for 43 years so one can go in and change that maybe higher early on then slow it down returns are 8 every year so one must go to the sheet or their own plan and reassess how they are doing each year disclosure we are now at our income with a goal of 25 to replace 100 so we need a cumulative 80 growth as in s&p at 2500 or the years of deposits to get there i am nearing 50   let me pick one of your questions your expenses go down at retirement stay the same or go up this is the $ 64 k question the 80 is an average guess the general assumption is in this range if we downsized right after the kid goes to college we could retire on far less so to wrap up online calculators and spreadsheets only go so far your questions are dead on a planner should ask every one of these questions before assuming any ratio   edit on re read i am blown away by the list of questions you have here it 's great and it shows how there 's risk no matter what

a cd is guaranteed to pay its return on maturation   so if you need a certain amount of money at a specific time in the future the cd is a more reliable way of getting it   the stock market might give you more money or less   more is obviously ok   less is not if you 're planning to pay basic expenses with it e.g. food rent etc    most retirement portfolios will have a mix of investments   some securities stocks and bonds some guaranteed returns cds treasuries and some cash equivalents money market savings and checking accounts   cash equivalents are good for short term expenses and an emergency fund   guaranteed returns are good for medium term expenses   securities are good for the long term    once retired the general system is to maintain enough cash equivalents for the next few months of expenses and emergencies   then schedule cds for the next few years so that you have a predictable amount   finally keep the bulk of your wealth in securities   as you get older your potential emergencies increase and your need for savings decreases so the mix shifts more and more to the cash equivalents and guaranteed returns and away from securities    cds have limited use prior to retirement and the couple years right before retirement mainly saving up for a large purchase like a house car or major appliance   even there if you have the option of delaying the purchase that might allow you to use securities instead   perhaps some of your emergency fund in a short term cd that you keep rolling over    note that the problem is n't so much that securities will fall   it 's that they 'll fall right when you need the money   so rather than sell 1 of your securities to meet your needs you have to sell 2   that 's a dead weight loss of 1 that you have to deduct from your returns   that roughly matches the drop from the height of 2007 to the trough of 2009 of the s&p 500   and it was 2012 before it recovered   if in 2007 you had put the 1 of your portfolio in a two year cd you 'd be ahead even at zero interest in 2009

ror for options you bought is fairly easy current value initial cost gives you the actual return if you want the rate of return you need to annualize that number you divide the return you got above by the number of days the investment was in place and then multiply that number by the number of days in a year 365 if you 're using calendar days about 255 if you 're using trading days ror for options you sold is much more complex the problem is that ror is basically calculating the size of your return relative to the capital it tied up to earn it    that 's simple when you bought something the capital tied up is the money you put up    it 's more complex on a position like a short option where the specific transaction in question generates cash when it 's put on     the correct way to deal with this is to a bundle your strategy options stock and collateral into one ror where appropriate and b include any needed collateral to support the short option in the calculation so if you sell a cash secured put where you have to post the money that you 'd need to take delivery of the shares if they were put to you the initial cost is the total amount you 'd need to put the trade on    in this case it 's the cash amount less the premium you collected for selling the put   that 's just one example     but the approach holds more broadly   if you 're using covered calls your original cost is the cost of the stock less the premium generated by the sale of the call

would you say it 's advisable to keep some of cash savings in a foreign currency this is primarily opinion based   given that we live in a world rife with geopolitical risks such as brexit and potential eu breakup there is no way to predict what will happen in such large events for example if one keeps funds outside on uk in say germany in euro 's the uk may bring in a regulation and down all funds held outside of uk as belonging to government or tax these at 90 or anything absurd that negates the purpose of keeping funds outside there are example of developing under developed economics putting absurd capital controls whether uk will do or not is a speculation if you are going to spend your live in a country it is best to invest in country as normal diversification you can look at keep a small amount invested outside of country

your question is listed as how to invest 100k not how would i find someone without a hidden agenda so i 'll answer that it depends i believe the best choices available are essentially as follows if you are looking to pay for your childrens college it might be nice just to put the money in a roth ira and have that done right off the bat if you disciplined enough to keep the money invested in some type of stock indexed fund that might be good the stock market has often outperformed almost every other form of investment over the very long haul but if you could see yourself tapping it for things then you might not want this another option is to put the money against your house if that does n't pay it off refinance the remaining portion into a lower rate for less years obviously this knocks down a huge portion of the interest duh and gives you a nice cash flow you can use for investing also the money you 've put into a primary residence is pretty safe i believe in some cases safe even from bankruptcy but as you 've noted being underwater on the home you are essentially throwing that money away in some way or fashion and really all in all houses are terrible investments you never really get your money out of your primary home unless you downsize the money is essentially saved without an equity line this is a good choice if you 're not disciplined your choice depends on of course you can do any combination of these things and as dave ramsey is apt to remind his and you ought to have your emergency fund set before you do any of these things

as mentioned in several other answers the main reason for high rates is to maximize profit however here is another smaller effect the typical flow of getting money from an atm suppose you have a minute to consider the offer then in that time the currency may drop or rise which you can see from an external source of information therefore this opens a window for abuse for real major currencies these huge switches are rare but they do happen and when 1 or 2 minor currencies are involved these switches are more common just looking at a random pair for today to i immediately spotted a moment where the exchange rate jumped by more than 2 this may not be the best example but it shows why a large margin is desirable note that this argument only holds for when the customer knows in advance what the exchange rate would be for cases where it is calculated afterwards i have not found any valid excuse for such large margins except that it allows them to offer other services at a lower price because these transaction

if you have any non mortgage debt e.g. a credit card a line of credit a student loan or a car loan then i would pay that down first   the interest being paid on that kind of borrowed money likely exceeds what you could expect to earn in reasonable investments if you do n't have any non mortgage debt and your mortgage is large e.g. thinking about it keeps you up at night sometimes then go for the the extra mortgage payment   also go for the mortgage if you 're paying at a relatively high interest rate compared to what you could expect from investments if your mortgage is small e.g. it 's going to be paid off in a few years and at a relatively low interest rate then i would choose the rrsp or tfsa unless you 're in the top income tax bracket i would favor the tfsa over rrsp tfsas were only introduced this year and any balance there already is likely tiny compared to the rrsp for retirement i 'm aiming to have equal amounts of rrsp and tfsa money one option you have n't mentioned is an resp   if you have children under the age of 18 your bonus could also be used to make next year 's resp contribution and qualify for the 20 matching canada education savings grant cesg from the government

i would question whether your stated goal of strictly controlling your expenses is really the problem you should be tackling   in my opinion unless you 're under financial hardship where you can barely make ends meet you 're much better off using a budget as a high level descriptive tool rather than a low level tool this is what i would do in your situation after the first few months you can start to think about high level changes that you can make to your spending habits to get the most bang for your buck   i would n't worry about the little expenses unless they 're really adding up to a sizable chunk of your total expenses   instead i would look at things like eating out too often buying too many movies too many impulse buys over $ 100 etc identifying patterns like that will help you make lifestyle changes that will allow you to spend less money without having to micromanage every single expense   i have tried the micromanaged approach in the past and it simply does n't work for me   there 's too much overhead and eventually i start to feel that it 's just not worth it   think about it is it really worth the extra time and energy required to worry about where every dollar goes all month long just to save an additional hundred bucks over what you can do with this passive approach    i think that by focusing on the big picture you can get within a couple percentage points of the same amount of savings as if you had micro managed your expenses but with much less work and mental strain let 's put some numbers on this and see what the hourly returns are with each approach always being optimistic about the micromanaged approach and conservative on the passive approach    let 's assume you earn $   let 's also assume that if you micromanage all of your expenses you could manage to save $ beyond what you do now   and let 's say that with the passive approach you can get within 20 percentage points instead of the 2 i stated earlier for a savings of $   now what will your hourly returns look like   the following are based on how i would personally use both systems so your numbers may vary a bit micromanaged budgeting savings = $ 5000 per year = $ per month   time spent = 15 30 minutes per day = 7.5 15 hours per month   hourly return = $ $   passive budgeting savings = $ 4000 per year = $ per month   time spent = 1 2 hours per month hourly return = $ $ so clearly the passive approach gives a substantially higher hourly return even though it gives a lower absolute return   maybe more importantly though if passive budgeting opens up an extra 10 hours a month you could potentially put those hours into your job and make an extra 10 hours $ = $ 250 a month or $ 3000 per year assuming no extra pay for overtime   so that means that the passive budgeting approach would actually allow you to save $ 4000 + $ 3000 .75 = $ per year compared to the $ 5000 you would save by micromanaging if you 're in a situation where you ca n't put those hours into more work and you really need that extra $ per month to help make ends meet then by all means micromanage your expenses and try to save as much as possible   but if either of the previous conditions are not true for you you 're much better off in my opinion using a passive budget

if you use a room or other separately identifiable space within your apartment exclusively for your business then you might be able to recoup a fraction of your rent for that check the rules for home office at the irs and adopt a consistent and well documented approach i would pay your full rent out of your personal account and then do an expense report for the portion that 's legitimately business related but that 's not a unique approach other than that i agree with the answer by you can not reduce your tax by the full amount of your rent just by having the s corp pay and trying to do so is probably playing with fire   generally speaking do n't business and personal expenses like that

for a lease your payment is a function of sale price minus residual value if the car has a low residual value then the lease payments will be higher if it has a high residual value then lease payments will be lower but the purchase price at the end of the lease will be higher potentially even higher than the kbb of the car there is no gaming the system whether you buy now or lease now and buy later you will be paying for the entire car    calculate the payments in both scenarios with appropriate interest rates money factors sale price and residual value this will demonstrate there is no free lunch to be had here also do n't forget that financing the vehicle after a three year lease will probably mean a higher interest rate than if you were to finance it all now with a purchase now you will likely get more favorable financing terms and be able to talk them down on sale price leasing will not allow such flexibility generally    tldr no that 's not how it works if you plan on owning the car for the duration of a loan e.g. 5 years it will be cheaper to just finance now

i 'll start by saying accounts that require a certain number of transactions are a horrible place to put any savings and in fact i 'd stay away all together however you 've asked a lot of questions here and are clearly more in tune with this topic than most   if i was young again and just starting to try to pile some money together i would absolutely chase the highest interest rates by taking advantage of accounts like this   if you have the discipline to hit the transaction counts and maintain the minimum balance and leave your savings funds alone do it if for a single second you think you 'll go out one friday night and blow your emergency fund put it somewhere else    i used to keep really elaborate spreadsheets of my spending and savings with goals set and progress charts etc   i see the argument that the transaction count is not worth the gain in interest but you 've said you 're not dealing with big numbers and 5 of $ 5,000 is about $ 255 after a year   it 's not a lot but it 's 5x more than a normal no transaction hoops high yield savings account you get five years of interest each year   so yes this is an amount of money you could probably generate by starbucks less but presumably you 're already doing that   obviously you would keep this to an upper account balance of $ 5,000 and put the rest in a vanilla high yield savings then when administering the transactions becomes too much work close the account

it 's not like most of the people working there will care if obama loses his job the chief position of a government agency who is selected by potus often is n't a person liked by the rest of the agency and they could n't care less if he was changed in 2013   for example in the cia the director was always chosen by the president and thusly the rest of the cia usually do n't fully respect them since they are just some random person from outside the agency who was put into power for political reasons they do n't like the director and likewise do n't care if potus changes and the director gets fired by the new guy    my point is that entire government agencies are not lying and cheating just to keep obama in office just because the director was appointed by obama does n't mean the entire organization will lie to help obama    i mean what if romney gets elected will the entire agency and it 's hundreds thousands of employees now immediately do a 180 and lie and cheat to keep romney in power the same workers that were doing illegal things to help obama and now going to on a whim break laws to help romney    these agencies are not machines they are made of hundreds of real people each with their own views just because obama chose the director does n't mean all those people are now his slaves willing to lie and cheat to help him    what 's to stop one of them from leaking the story to the media i would think there has to be at least one republican working there if the director told everyone that this quarter they were all going to lie to help obama stay in power pretty sure any republicans in the agency would leak that to the media if that story got out obama would be    no way the entire agency would go forward with a lie to help obama

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

i actually just did that with my chase freedom card they rotate categories every 3 months and from april june it was 5 back at grocery stores   so i bought a ton of gas cards and got my 5 back   next i figured out i would be clever and buy a ton of store gift cards grocery gift cards right at the end of the quarter then use those in the future to purchase gas cards   well i just tried that a couple days ago and discovered the store refuses to sell a gift card if you 're paying with a gift card   so now i 'm stuck with $ 1,000 in grocery cards until i use them in actual grocery purchases haha one of the things about this grocery store is they partner with a gas station on their rewards program   they offer 10 cents off a gallon with every $ 100 spent in store and they double it to 20 cents off a gallon if you buy $ 100 in gift cards   then on the back of the receipt is a coupon for 10 cents off per gallon which they double on   unfortunately i think i 'm one of the only people that takes this much advantage of the program   side note i actually just changed the billing cycle of my chase freedom card to end on the 24th of the month   that way i can charge a bunch of rewards in the final 6 7 days of the quarter   and if i have a $ 0 balance on the 24th my bill is n't due for 7 weeks interest free   and chase freedom has never cared if you purchase gift cards with their quarterly rewards program   i also gave them a courtesy email giving the specific store and $ $ $ amount that was going to be charged and of course they still called me with a fraud alert

the biggest issue i can see is that in order to have your parents protected properly they 'll have to register an interest in the property ie the 25 i ca n't see the mortgage lender being too happy to have a second lienholder on the house for a total of 100 of the purchase price usually their conditions state that they 'll need to be informed of other debts secured on the house and might actually have a say in that another way of accomplishing this is putting your parents on the house 's deeds but that might also complicate matters with the lender and cause additional problems when it comes to selling the property not to mention that if anything bad happens to your parents their stake in your property would be counted as one of their assets and you might find yourself in the situation where you have to come up with 25 of the property value right now or you might find that you have to sell the property to the first bidder simply because you do need the money as quickly as possible personally i would n't do it especially without legal advice the legal structure can be a nightmare and you 'll just end up painted into a corner

you do n't need a book you need to dig into the business and understand what has changed how long has there been a struggle to make ends meet what seasonality exists for the business look at the period over period change for each product category as well as each line item expense and find correlations that may exist if it 's possible find similar insights about competition both brick and mortar as well as online    it 's important to analyze the results of the business to understand 1 the normal and flows of the jewelry store seasonality and 2 any erosion of the business to online or brick and mortar competitors the other important takeaway is that you have to identify any changes in the business expenses are utilities suddenly taking up more of a share of the profits or are the costs of raw materials on the rise   look at the cash flow to see where the money is going or if there is a revenue problem if business is down and revenue as a result you know where to start perhaps the answer is marketing or providing additional products or services that better match the needs of the clientele who are dropping off i.e. online ordering and free shipping or product pricing is elevated above the competition on the other side if expenses have gotten out of control you know where to apply controls keep in mind that these are not mutually exclusive and the business could have a revenue and an expense problem   if you 've studied economics you have the skills to understand the numbers and drive out the answers but this problem requires application and not philosophy sociology or economics no single book can give you the step by step process every business is unique and no one but your family can provide the insights necessary to analyze the results    best of luck reach out with any additional questions

expensing a transfer of funds is incorrect that will affect the profit loss income statement when you transfer it out and back in which you do not want at least for the principle the interest should be recorded as a interest income the general way to account for transferring money is to credit the originating account and debit the destination account this will only affect the balance sheet accounts for example transferring buying 10,000 worth of fix term bank deposits interest is paid the bank deposit reaches maturity so the principle is returned with the final interest payment the accounts checking account and fixed term bank deposit are asset accounts which show up on the balance sheet the interest income is an income account which will show up in the income statement this is how a fixed term cd is usually recorded in certain cases where the business must follow an accounting standard this may very well be insufficient but this situation will be unlikely if it 's a small private sports club having said that double check to make sure what you 've stated is indeed correct and look back into the past entries to see how it was dealt with before especially since you said this bookkeeping job is temporary i would strongly advise against changing non recent entries even if they are incorrect for the insurance payments that would depend on how the damaged assets were accounted for it 's a little hard to say without more the extent of the damage how the diminished value was accounted for in the books the cost of repair materials etc

tl;dr your best course of action is probably to do a soft pull check your own credit and provide that to the lender for an unofficial pre approval to get the ball rolling the long of it the loan officer is mostly correct and i have recent personal evidence that that a few months ago i looked into refinancing a mortgage on a rental property and i allowed 3 different lenders to do a hard inquiry within 1 week of each other i saw all 3 inquires appear on reports from each of the 3 credit bureaus eq tu ex but it was only counted as a single inquiry in my score factors but as you have suggested this breaks down when you know that you wo n't be purchasing right away because then you will have multiple hard inquiries at least a few months apart which could possibly have a minor negative impact on your score however minor it is you might as well try to avoid it if you can i have played around with the simulator on and have found inquiries to have the following effect on your credit score using the fico score 8 model with one inquiry your scores will adjust as such two inquiries three inquiries here 's a helpful quote from the simulator notes credit inquiries remain on your credit report for 2 years but fico scores only consider credit inquiries from the past 12 months of course take that with a grain of salt as myfico provides the following disclaimer the simulator is provided for informational purposes only and should not be expected to provide accurate predictions in all situations consequently we make no promise or guarantee with regard to the simulator having said all that in your situation if you know with certainty that you will not be purchasing right away then i would recommend doing a soft pull to get your scores now check your credit yourself and see if the lender will use those numbers to estimate your pre approval one possible downside of this is the lender may not be able to give you an official pre approval letter based on your soft pull i would n't worry too much about that though since if you are suddenly ready to purchase you could just tell them to go ahead with the hard pull so they can furnish an official pre approval letter interesting side note last month i applied for a new mortgage and my score was about 40 points lower than it was 3 months ago at first i thought this was due to my recent refinancing of property and the credit inquiries that came along with it but then i noticed that one of my business credit cards had recently accrued a high balance it just so happens that this particular business cc reports to my personal credit report most likely in error but i never bothered to do anything about it i immediately paid that cc off in full and checked my credit 20 days later after it had reported and my score shot back up by over 30 points i called my lender and instructed them to re pull my credit hard inquiry which they did and this pushed me back up into the best mortgage rate category yes i purposely requested another hard pull but it should n't affect my score since it was within 45 days and that maneuver will save me thousands in the long run

getting the line of credit would likely be a bit easier than the loan but realistically the best option is getting a mortgage through an indian bank   with a long term mortgage your monthly payments would be a small portion of your income maybe as low as $ 500 so currency fluctuations are likely to be minor that you can avoid by sending a few thousand to hold as a cushion for when exchange is unfavorable edit   please be advised that mortgages work differently throughout the world   while 10 down may be standard in the us in india 40 50 down seems to be the norm

they can sell a lower price call if they expect the stock to plummet in the near term but they are bullish on the longer term what they are looking to do is collect the call premium and hope it expires worthless   and then again hope that the stock will ultimately turn around so yes a lot of hoping   but can you explain what you mean by my brokerage gives premiums for prices lower than the current price do you mean you pay less in commissions for itm calls

your best course of action is to gather your paperwork ask around your personal network for a recommendation for a good cpa and pay that person to do your taxes business and personal   read through the completed package and have them walk you through every item you do not understand   i would continue doing this until you feel confident that you can file for yourself   even then the first couple of times i did my own i 'd pay them to review my work   assuming you find a cpa with reasonable fees they will likely point out tax inefficiencies in the way you do your business which will more than pay for their fees    it can be like a point of honor for cpas to ensure that their customers get their money 's worth in this way   not saying all cpas work this way but to me this would be a criteria for one that i would recommend

i do n't know of a guideline to how often you can ask for an increase you can ask as often as you like as for consequences refer to is there a downside to asking for a credit increase where the consensus is that aside from a possible temporary hard pull on your credit report there 's probably no risk to asking depending on your credit score history and especially in the current economy you may get no as an answer most often you can try talking to your card 's credit department or even customer retention department as they may have more leverage they may say yes or no or that they need to review your account when you do ask for an increase i would make sure to ask if there will be a hard pull on your report if there is any cost or downside to applying and to make sure that this would be an increase to your current credit line not a new account

these are the things to focus on do not put yourself in debt with a car there are other better solutions   1 get a credit card unless you already have one this and get the best cash back or points card you can get at the best rate   start with buying gas and groceries every month do not run the balance up pay the card off every single month this is important never carry a balance above 25 of your credit limit   every 8 months or so call your credit card company and ask for a credit line increase they should be able to do this without pulling your credit you are only looking for the automatic increment that they can automatically approve this will help increase your available credit and will help keep your credit utilization low only do this is you are successfully doing the other bullet points above   2 pay all of your bills on time this includes everything from water electricity phone bill etc never be late setup automatic payments if you can   3 minimize the number of hard credit inquiries is particularly important when you are looking for your mortgage lender do not let them pull your credit automatically you should be able to provide them your credit score and other information and get quotes from those lenders do not let them tell you then ca n't do this they can   plan when you close a credit line closing them will do two things lower your credit limit often times increasing your credit utilization and it may hurt your average age of credit open one credit card and keep it forever   note credit karma is a great tool you should check your score monthly and see how your efforts are influencing your score i also like citi credit cards because they will provide you monthly with your fico score which credit karma will only provide transunion and equifax   this is educational information and you should consider talking to a banker lender who can also give you more detailed instructions on how to get your credit improved so that they can approve you for a loan   many people can get their score above 720 in 1 2 years time going from no credit doing the steps described above it does take time be patient and do n't fall for gimmicks

yes there is an inverse relationship but that 's how it 's meant to work   debt creates money banks do lend out customers savings for return interest as the bank can make a profit rather than the cash just sitting there the process of lending pumps money into the economy that would n't be there otherwise so it creates money the banks will either have a cash deficit or surplus at end of each day and either need to borrow from other banks to balance their books or if in surplus lend to other banks to make interest because that 's more profitable than holding the cash surplus the overnight cash rate then determines interest rates we pay     high private debt occurs when lots of people are investing amp buying things so there is stimulation and growth in the economy a lot more tax is being paid in these periods so government debt is lower because they are getting lots of tax money also to stimulate the economy into this growth period the government usually sells off large cash bonds lowering their debt to release cash into the economy the more cash available the less banks have to borrow to cover deficits on overnight cash market and the lower interest rates will be lower interest rates = more borrowing and higher private debt    the government ca n't let growth get out of control as they do n't want high inflation so they do the opposite to slow down growth i.e buy up cash bonds and take money out of economy causing higher interest rates and less borrowing = more debt for government less for private

most funds keep a certain amount in cash at all times to satisfy outflows   net inflows will simply be added to the cash balance while net outflows subtract   when the cash gets too low for the manager 's comfort level depends on the typical pattern of net inflows and outflows as well as anticipated flows based on recent performance the manager will sell some of his least favorite holdings and when the cash gets too high he will buy some new holdings or add to his favorite existing holdings   a passive fund works similarly except the buys sells are structured to minimize tracking error

this question is calling for a somewhat subjective answer what i would recommend is liquidate now since it is a stock fund and stocks have performed very well this year no need to be greedy and hope that they do as well in 2014 since it is not an enormous amount of money put it in an interest yielding savings account which unfortunately are all sub 1 but the key here is since we can not predict the markets no investment is going to be safer you want the 18k to be there when you need it for the down payment if you invest it in a fund now you may not be able to get at least 18k at the time you are forcing yourself to liquidate a good rule for investing is never to have to sell to make a purchase because there is a high probability that you will be selling at a sub optimal price some savings accounts that have slightly higher yields

i 'm afraid you have missed a few of the outcomes commonly faced by millions of americans so i would like to take a moment to discuss a wider range of outcomes that are common in the united states today most importantly some of these happen before retirement is ever reached and have grave consequences yet are often very closely linked to financial health and savings not planning ahead long term 10 20 + years is generally associated with not planning ahead even for the next few months so i 'll start there the most common thing that happens is the loss of a job or illness injury that put someone out of work 6 in 10 adults in the us have less than $ 500 in savings so desperation can set in very quickly as the very next paycheck will be short or missing many of these americans have no other source of saved money either so it 's not like they can draw on retirement savings as they do n't have that either even if they are able to get another job or recover enough to get back to work in a few weeks this can set off a desperate cycle those who have lost their jobs to technical obsolescence major economic downturns or large economic changes are often more severely affected people once making excellent middle class or above wages with full benefits find they can not find work that pays even vaguely similarly in the past this was especially common in heavy labor jobs like manufacturing meat packing and so on but more recently this has happened in financial sectors and real estate construction during the 2008 economic events the more resilient people had padding switched careers and found other options the less resilient did n't especially during the 1970s and 1980s many people affected by large losses of earning potential became sufficiently desperate that they fell heavily or lost their functioning status into substance abuse including alcohol and drugs cocaine and being especially popular in this segment of the population life disruption made even more major by a lack of savings is a key trigger to many people who are already at risk of issues like substance addiction mental health or any ongoing legal issues another common issue is something more simple like loss of transportation that threatens their ability to hold their job and a lack of alternatives available through support networks savings family and public transit if their credit is bad or their income is new they may find even companies turn them away or even worse the most companies welcome them in with high interest and hair trigger repossession policies the most common cycle of desperation i have seen usually starts with banking over drafts and its associated fees people who are afraid and desperate start to make increasingly desperate short sighted choices as tunnel vision sets in and they are unable to consider longer term strategy as they focus on holding on to what they have and survival many industries have found this set of people quite profitable including high interest check cashing payday loans and title loans aka legal loan sharks and it is not rare that desperate people are encouraged to get on increasing cycles of loan amounts and fees that worsen their financial situation in exchange for short term relief as fees penalties and interest add up they lose more and more of their already strained income to stay afloat banks that are otherwise reputable and fair may soon blacklist them and turn them away and suddenly only the least reputable and most predatory places offer to help at all usually with a big smile at first and almost always with awful strings attached drugs and alcohol are often readily available nearby and their use can easily turn from recreational to addictive given the allure of the it offers especially for those made vulnerable by increasing stress desperation loss of hope isolation and fear those who have not been within the system of poverty and desperation often do not see just how many people actively work to encourage bad decision making with big budgets charm charisma and talent the voices of reason trying to act as to call people to take care of themselves and their future are all too easily drowned out in the of a smooth and enticing operation   i personally think this is one of the greatest contributions of the movement to build personal financial health and awareness as so many great people find ever more effective ways of pointing out the myriad ways people try to bleed your money out of you with no real concern for your welfare looking out for your own well being and not being taking in by the wide array of cons and bad deals is all too often fighting against a strong societal current as i 'm sure most of our regular contributors are all too aware with increasing desperation often comes illegal maneuvers often quite petty in nature those with substance abuse issues often start reselling drugs to others to try to cover lost income or get ahead with often debilitating results on long term earning potential if they get caught which can include cost barriers to higher education even if they do turn their life around   i think most people are surprised by how little and petty things can quickly cycle out of control this can include things like not paying minor parking or traffic tickets which can snowball from the $ 10 70 range into thousands of dollars due to non payment often escalating and adding additional penalties triggering traffic stops for no other reason etc arrest and more the elderly are not exempt from this system and many of america 's elderly spend their latter years in prison while not all are tied to financial desperation as i 've outlined above a deeper look at poverty crime and the elderly will be deeply disturbing some of these people enter the system while young but some only later in life rather than homelessness being something that only happens after people hit retirement it often comes considerably earlier than that if this occurs the outcome is generally quite a bit more extreme than living off social security some just die the average life expectancy of adults who are living on the street is only about 64 years of age only 2 years into early retirement age and before full retirement age which could of course be increased in the next 10 20 years even if life expectancy and health of those without savings do n't improve most have extremely restricted access to healthcare often being emergency only and have no comforts of home to rest and recuperate when they become ill or injured there are many people dedicated to helping yet the help is far less than the problem generally and being able to take advantage of most of the help scheduling where to go for food who to talk to about other services etc heavily depends on the person not already suffering from conditions that limit their ability to care for themselves mental conditions mobility etc there is also a shockingly higher risk of physical assault injury and death depending on where the person goes but it is far higher in almost every case regardless one of the chief problems in considering only retirement savings is it assumes that you 'll only have need for the savings and good financial health once you reach approximately the age of 62 if it is not raised before you get there which it has been multiple times to date as noted above if homelessness occurs and becomes longstanding before that the result is generally shortened lifespan and premature death the other major issue of health is that preventative care from simple dentistry to basic self care adequate sleep and rest a safe place to is often sacrificed in the scrambling to survive and limited budget those who develop chronic conditions which need regular care are more severely affected and injury related limb loss as one example are far more likely for those without regular support resources homeless destitute or otherwise other posters have done a great job in pointing out a number of the lesser known governmental programs so i wo n't list them again i only note the important that this may be quite a bit less in total than you think social security on average pays retired workers $ 1300 a month it was designed to avoid an all too common occurrence of simple starvation rampant homelessness and abject poverty among a large number of elderly no guarantee is made that you wo n't have to leave your home move away from your friends and family if you live in an expensive part of the country etc some people get a bit more some people get quite a bit less and the loss of family and friend networks especially to such at risk groups can be incredibly damaging note also that those financially desperate will be generally pushed to take retirement at the minimum age even though benefits would be larger and more livable if they delayed their retirement this is an additional cost of not having other sources of savings which is not considered by many well yes many can not retire whether they want to or not   i can not find statistics on this specifically but many are indeed just unable to financially retire without considerable loss social security and other government plans help avoid the most desperate scenarios but so many aspects of aging is not covered by insurance or affordable on the limited income that aging can be a cruel and lonely process for those with no other financial means those with no savings are not likely to be able to afford to regularly visit children and grandchildren give gifts on holidays go on cruises enjoy the best care or afford new technological devices to assist their aging especially those too new and experimental to be covered by the insurance plans they have   what 's worse but most people do not plan for either is that diminished mental and physical capacity can render many people unable to navigate the system successfully as we 've seen here many questions are from adult children trying to help their elderly parents in retirement and include aging parents who do not understand their own access to social security medicaid medicare resources or community help organizations   what happens to those aging without children or younger friend networks to step in and help well we do n't really have a replacement for that i am not aware of any research that just how many in the us do n't take advantage of the resources they are fully qualified to make use of and enjoy due to a lack of education social issues feeling embarrassed and afraid or inability to organize and communicate effectively a resource being available is not very much help for those who do n't have enough supportive resources to make use of it which is very hard to effectively plan for yet is exceedingly common without one 's own independent resources the natural aging and end of life process can be especially harsh elderly who are economically and food insecure experience far heightened incidence of depression asthma heart attack and heart failure and a host of other they are at greater risk for abuse accidental death life quality threatening conditions developing or worsening and more scare tactics are n't always persuasive and they do little to improve the lives of many because the people who need to know it most generally just do n't believe it but my hope here is that the rather highly educated and sophisticated audience here will see a little more of the harsher world that their own good decisions good fortune culture and position in society shields them from experiencing there is a downside to good outcomes which is that it can cause us to be blind to just how extremely different is the experience of others not all experience such terrible outcomes but many hundreds of thousands in the us alone do and sometimes worse it is not helpful to be unrealistic about this life is not inherently kind however none of this suggests that being co dependent or giving up your own financial well being is necessary or advised to help others share your budgeting strategies your plans for the future your gentle concerns and give of your time and resources as generously as you can within your own set budgets and ensuring your own financial well being and most of all do not so easily give up on your family and friends and count them as life long hopeless do wells let 's all strive to be good kind honest and offer non judgmental support and advice to the best of our ability to the people we care about it is ultimately their choice restricted by their own experiences and abilities but need not be fate people regularly but sometimes they surprise and delight take care of yourself and give others the best chance you can too

the right answer to this question really depends on the size of the transfer   for larger transfers $ 10k and up the exchange rate is the dominant factor and you will get the best rates from interactive brokers ib as noted by paul above or oanda listed by under $ 10k currencyfair is probably your best bet while the rates are not quite as good as ib or oanda they are much better than the banks and the transaction fees are less   if you do n't need to exchange the currency immediately you can put in your own bids and potentially get better rates from other currencyfair users below $ 1000 xe trade also listed by has exchange rates that are almost as good but also offers eft transfers in and out which will save you wire transfer fees from your bank to send or receive money to from your currency broker   the bank wire transfer fees in the us can be $ outgoing wires on the higher end so for smaller transfers this is a significant consideration you need to look into if you are receiving money in us ing direct and many brokerage accounts do n't charge for incoming wires but unless you have a commercial bank account with high balances expect to spend $ minimum for outgoing   european wire transfer fees are minimal or zero in most cases making currencyfair more appealing if the money stays in europe below $ 100 it 's rarely worth the effort to use any of the above services use paypal or whatever is easiest update   as of december 2013 currencyfair is temporarily suspending operations for us residents following our initial assessment of regulatory changes in the united states including changes arising from the dodd frank act currencyfair will temporarily withdraw services for us residents while we consider these requirements and how they impact our business model   this was a difficult and very decision but we are confident we will be able to resume services in the future the exact date of re activation has not yet been determined and may take some time we appreciate your patience and will continue communicating our status and expected return

i 've done exactly what you say at one of my brokers   with the restriction that i have to deposit the money in the right way and i do n't do it too often   the broker is meant to be a trading firm and not a currency exchange house after all   i usually do the exchange the opposite of you so i do usd > gbp but that should n't make any difference i put right in quotes not to indicate there is anything illegal going on but to indicate the broker does put restrictions on transferring out for some forms of deposits     so the key is to not ach the money in nor send a check nor bill pay it but rather to wire it in   a wire deposit with them has no holds and no time limits on withdrawal locations   my us bank originates a wire i trade at spot in the opposite direction of you usd > gbp wait 2 days for the trade to settle then wire the money out to my uk bank   commissions and fees for this process are low   all told i pay about $ 20 usd per and get spot rates though it does take approx 3 trading days for the whole process assuming you do n't try to wait for a target rate but rather take market rate

there is a large market where notes bills bonds are traded so yes you can sell them later   however if interest rates go up the value of any bond that you want to sell goes down because you now have to compete with what someone can get on a new issue so you need to discount the principal value of your bond in order for someone to want to buy it instead of a new bond that has a higher interest rate the reverse applies if interest rates fall although it 's hard to get much lower than they are now   so someone wanting to make money in bonds due to interest rate changes generally wants to buy at higher interest rates and then sell their bonds after rates have gone down   see my answer in this question for more detail why does interest rate go up when bond price goes down to answer is that good the answer depends on perspective

in the theater it 's a person who can afford to buy expensive pop corn cause he can buy the expensive movie ticket too also sitting at one place will make him feel hungry and buy something to eat so maximum chances are that in the theater that guy is your potential customer otherwise if the popcorn seller is somewhere outside the theater they may charge you less that 's because of a different target audience they would be targeting anyone who comes near the theater who would not be willing to pay for expensive snacks or movie tickets so very few customers around will be actually potential customers to maximize their profits they will keep the prices low and supply as much as they can i know this is going against the normal price elasticity of demand and supply graph but if the prices are low there will be high demand so if the is more than 1 the supplier should supply as much as they can to maximize profits its all based on the target audience that 's what i think should be the case of expensive popcorn in movie theaters

do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car in my opinion it depends on a lot of factors   if you have nothing to pay and are not planning to invest in something that cost a lot soon i.e an house etc then i see no problem in put that much down on the car remember that the more you pay at first the less you will pay interest on however if you are planning on buying something big soon then you might want to pay less and keep moneys for your future investment i would honestly not finance a car with the garage as i find their interest rate to high possibilities depends a lot of your bank accounts but what i would personally do is pay it cash using my credit margin with the bank which is only 2.8 interest rate garage where i live rarely finance under 7 interest rate you may not have a credit margin but maybe you could get a loan with the bank instead many bank keep an history of your loan which will get you a better credit name when trying to buy an home later on the other side having a good credit name is not really useful in a garage what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i do n't think it is possible to give a real answer to this as it change a lot around the world however i would recommend to simply compare with the interest rate asked when being loan by the bank

obviously there are many approaches i ’ll describe what we do and why we think it is successful i have seen many couples having disagreements and even divorce over money it seems that this is a typical reason to fight and sometimes fight badly the realization is that different people have different preferences what to spend their money on and if you are not rich it continuously leads to disagreements did you really need another pair of etc our solution is a weekly allowance first all our money goes into one pot and is considered equal many couples find that a difficult step but i never thought twice about it i trust my spouse and i share my life with her so why not my money from this we agree on an that is used to cover any non common cost this includes all clothing dining out buying things etc the amount was chosen to match about what we spent for those things anyway and then adjusted annually the main point is that there is no critique allowed about what this is spent on you can blow it all on shoes or buy books or wine and dine or gamble it away whatever we are doing this since 23 years now and we are very happy with the results we never have financial anymore disadvantages are the effort you need to keep track of it somehow either you use a separate credit card or hand it out in cash or have a complete accounting i do the latter because i want to regarding all other spend we use the accounting to plan ahead for at least a year on all cost and income that are expected and that shows us the available cash flow and where it might get tight it also shows you where the money goes and where you could cut if cutting is needed or wanted again there is some effort in collecting the data but it is worth it for us

the basic idea is that money 's worth is dependent on what it can be used to buy the principal driver of monetary exchange using one type of currency to buy another is that usually transactions for goods or services in a particular country must be made using that country 's official currency so if the u.s. has something very valuable let 's say iphones that people in other countries want to buy they have to buy dollars and then use those dollars to buy the consumer electronics from sellers in the u.s. each country has a basket of things they produce that another country will want and a shopping list of things of value they want from that other country the net difference in value between the basket and shopping list determines the relative demand for one currency over another the dollar might gain value relative to the euro and thus a euro will buy fewer dollars because europeans want iphones more than americans want bmws or conversely the euro can gain strength against the dollar because americans want bmws more than europeans want iphones the fact that iphones are actually made in china kind of plays into it kind of not apple pays the chinese in yuan to make them then receives dollars from international buyers and ships the iphones to them making both the yuan and the dollar more valuable than the euro or other currencies the total amount of a currency in circulation can also affect relative prices right now the american fed is pumping billions of dollars a day into the u.s. economy this means there 's a lot of dollars floating around so they 're easy to get and thus demand for them decreases it 's more complex than that for instance the dollar is also used as the international standard for trade in oil you want oil you pay for it in dollars increasing demand for dollars even when the united states does n't actually put any oil on the market to sell but basically think of different currencies as having value in and of themselves and that value is affected by how much the market wants that currency

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

it 's taken a while but many banks offer tokens although they tend to limit the accounts for which they will be issued all of the following issue tokens but there are many more citibank jp morgan union bank wells fargo bank bank of north dakota the river bank of wisconsin bank kansas bank in 2005 federal regulators stipulated that banks needed to get better with security for online banking customers but they did not endorse a particular technology tokens aka were endorsed the news was negatively received by the banks because putting more steps in the way of a customer drives the customer away see this 2005 report for more info   my guess is a tipping point was reached since then where customers became savvy of the risks and that the extra steps became less an issue than the extra security

i am pretty sure you could find a number of financial planners whom you could pay to give you a very accurate number but the rule of thumb i like best is save a dime of every dollar   10 savings means save for retirement not vacations here is a nice article from radio personality clark howard with some adjustments based on your age saving for retirement later in life   if you 're getting started saving for retirement later in life the    dime out of every dollar rule wo n't cut it for you so for you the    baltimore sun has crunched the following numbers has a particularly good and just as simple bit of math your retirement and financial planning should not end with a flat percentage   in fact the chances that any simple math formula is adequate are very low   my percentages or 's simple math are only starting places   if you are at the point where you are asking where do i start starting with this super easy no brainer approach is great because the key is starting and doing it

there 's no demand of course there 's demand demand is infinite in the sense that everyone wants things to make their lives better sure maybe there are some people that have maxed out their credit and physically ca n't buy any more stuff but they still need to buy food clothes housing the problem is not a demand problem it is a supply side problem central banks have over levered the system to a point where investors and entrepreneurs do not know what the govt is going to do next to try to fix it is there a huge tax increase on the horizon is more reactionary legislation going to be passed many established businesses have a hard enough time keeping up with the regulations that are already on the books and in many industries such as the financial industry it is physically impossible to get through an audit without paying fines for doing something wrong because no one can follow every single rule they ve written so yes the regulatory environment is far more uncertain than it was even a decade ago let alone 30 or 40 years ago

i think about debt as a good option for capital investments that offer a return in my opinion a house and clothes you need for that new job are good things to borrow for school is ok depending on the amount car is ok if it 's a 3 year loan the rest is not good you should try to carry as little debt as possible but do n't let it dominate your life if faced between the choice of paying ahead on your student loan and blowing $ 300 on an xbox you should pay the loan if the choice is between taking your kid to the zoo and paying the loan have fun at the zoo

easiest thing ever in fact 99 of people are loosing money if you perform worse then 10 annually in cash average over 5 10 years then you better never even think about trading investing most people are sitting at -5 annually they win some loose some and are being by inflation and commissions in fact fall of market is not a big deal stock indexes are often jump back in a few months if you rebalance properly it is mitigated your much bigger enemy is inflation if you think inflation is small look at gold price over past 20 years some people winners at first grow to + 10 get too relaxed and start to grow already lost position that one loose trade eats 10 of their portfolio only there that people realize they should cut it off when they already lost their profits and they start again with + 0 this is hard thing to accept but most of people are not made for that type of business even worse they think if i had bigger budget i would perform better which is kind of self lie

as you 've observed when you 're dealing with that amount of money you 're going to have to give up fdic guarantees that means that keeping the money in a bank account carries some risk with it if that particular bank goes bust you could lose most of your money there are a few options to stretch the fdic limit such as cdars but likely ca n't handle your hypothetical $ 800 million so what 's a lucky winner to do there are a few options including treasury securities money market funds and more general capital investments such as stocks and bonds which are best depend on what your goals are and what kind of risks you find acceptable money in the bank has two defining characteristics its value is very stable and it is liquid meaning you can spend it very easily whenever you want without incurring costs treasury securities and money market funds each focus on one of these characteristics a treasury security is a piece of paper or really an electronic record saying that the us federal government owes you money and when they will pay it back they are very secure in that the government has never missed a payment and will move heaven and earth to make sure they wo n't miss one in the future even taking into account recent political history you can buy and sell them on an open market either through a broker or directly on the treasury 's website the major downside of these compared to a bank account is that they 're not as liquid as cash you own specific amounts of specific kinds of securities not just some number of dollars in an account the government will pay you guaranteed cash on specified dates if you need cash on different dates you will need to sell the securities in the open market and the price will be subject to market fluctuations the other cash like option is money market funds these are a type of mutual fund offered by financial companies these funds take your money and spread it out over a wide variety of very low risk very short term investments with the goal of ensuring that the full value will never go down and is available at any time they are very liquid you can typically transfer cash quickly and easily to a normal bank account write checks directly and sometimes even use online bill pay like features they have a very good track record for stability too but no one is guaranteeing them against something going terribly wrong they are lower risk than a non fdic insured bank account since the investments are spread out across many institutions beyond those two somewhat cash like options there are of course other more general investments such as stocks bonds and real estate these other options trade away some degree of stability liquidity or both in exchange for better expected returns

this is where an insurance agent is very useful they will help you choose appropriate coverage based on local rebuilding costs the build quality of your house higher quality or historic semi historic construction requires a different type of coverage etc they can also help advise you on things like the need for flood insurance etc local rules can vary and the local agent will know about them for example we found out that my home was in a semi historic district which requires using higher cost materials for also our city separately licenses who tend to be unionized and thus more expensive had i just picked default coverages i would have been in a pickle in the event of a loss

first i would point you to this question   oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing with the $ 50k that you have inherited you have enough money to pay off all your debt $ 40k purchase a functional used car $ 5k and get a great start on an emergency fund with the rest   there are many who would tell you to wait as long as possible to pay off your student loans and invest the money instead however i would pay off the loans right away if i were you even if it is low interest right now it is still a debt that needs to be paid back pay it off and you wo n't have this debt hanging over your head anymore   your grandmother has given you an incredible gift this money can make you completely debt free and put you on a path for success however if you are n't careful you could end up back in debt quickly learn how to make a budget and commit to never spending money that you do n't have again

that 's because our financial sector is mainly an instrument to aggregate cash   rather than a way to foster innovation and growth they already have so much cash in their control that other sectors are starving   some worthwhile endeavors are not the ones that are going to make the greatest returns some will not show returns for a very long time typically these are are undertaken by the government but the government is being reduced to a blunt object used to secure resources and markets and to protect investments   so maybe we need a second tier investment sector that works with longer time lines and low immediate returns and perhaps even domestic micro loan grants

in a word no diversification is the first rule of investing   your plan has poor diversification because it ignores most of the economy large cap stocks   this means for the expected return your portfolio would get you would bear an unnecessarily large amount of risk   large cap and small cap stocks take turns outperforming each other   if you hold both you have a safer portfolio because one will perform well while the other performs poorly   you will also likely want some exposure to the bond market a simple and diversified portfolio would be a total market index fund and a total bond market fund   something like 60 in the equity and 40 in the bonds would be reasonable   you may also want international exposure and maybe exposure to real estate via a reit fund you have expressed some risk aversion in your post   the way to handle that is to take some of your money and keep it in your cash account and the rest into the diversified portfolio remember when people add more and more asset classes large cap international bonds etc they are not increasing the risk of their portfolio they are reducing it via diversification   the way to reduce it even more after you have diversified is to keep a larger proportion of it in a savings account or other guaranteed investment btw your p2p lender investment seems like a great idea to me but 60 of your money in it sounds like a lot

ok so greece and funding of the banks has added quite a bit of deficit over the past couple of years this has been problematic as countries become unwilling to ask for help to save the bank because of the poor public image that it carries no politician wants to increase the deficit in favor of bank expect americans lol additionally it has a negative impact on economy discussed below   this year ecb has agreed to allow direct of banks   this means that the spanish govt will not be responsible for bank funding when the bailout is established thus reducing the impact on spain 's economy there will not be an increase in deficit when spanish banks are   in the past with ireland and greece it was difficult because countries had to implement austerity measure and accept funding to bank weakened balance sheet of troubled countries drove up the cost of money making it more difficult to the banks which worked in a cycle direct has been implemented to limit this effect

as the other answers suggest there are a number of ways of going about it and the correct one will be dependent on your situation amount of equity in your current house cashflow primarily amount of time between purchase and sale if you have a fair amount of equity for example $ 50 k mortgage remaining on a house valued at $ 300 k i 'll propose an option that 's similar to bridge financing place an offer on your new house use some of your equity as part of the down payment eg $ 130 k use some more of your equity as a cash buffer to allow you pay two mortgages in between the purchase and the sale eg $ 30 k the way this would be executed is that your existing mortgage would be discharged and replaced with larger mortgage the proceeds of that mortgage would be split between the down payment and cash as you desire between the closing of your purchase and the closing of your sale you 'll be paying two mortgages and you 'll be responsible for two properties not fun but your cash buffer is there to sustain you through this when the sale of your new home closes you 'll be breaking the mortgage on that house when you get the proceeds of the sale it would be a good time to use any lump sum prepayment privileges you have on the mortgage of the new house   you 'll be paying legal fees for each transaction and penalties for each mortgage you break however the interest rates will be lower than bridge financing for this reason this approach will likely be cheaper than bridge financing only if the time between the closing of the two deals is fairly long eg at least 6 months and the penalties for breaking mortgages are reasonable eg 3 months interest you would need the help of a good mortgage broker and a good lawyer but you would also have to do your own due diligence remember that brokers receive a commission for each mortgage they sell if you wo n't have any problems selling your current house quickly bridge financing is likely a better deal if you need to hold on to it for a while because you need to fix things up or it will be harder to sell you can consider this approach

there are two totally different things there is your limited company and there is yourself   your limited company will absolutely have to pay 20 corporation tax on all its profits the profits are the income of the limited company you say it 's £ 5,000 a year minus all expenses usually you would pay yourself a salary which immediately reduces your profits and of course the payment to the accountant will reduce the profits   if the limited company is your only source of income the usual method is to pay yourself £ salary a year possible pay money into a pension for yourself which is tax free and reduces the company 's profits pay 20 corporation on the rest and pay yourself a dividend twice a year unless you have another job where you make a lot of money you should have paid all that money to yourself as income and paid zero corporation tax   and may i say that if you made £ 5,000 a year then there is most likely not enough going on to justify that an accountant charges you £ 600 you should be able to find someone doing it cheaper i can not imagine that he or she had to do a lot of work for this

i ca n't say i know everything about the underlying details but from what i understand your limit buy adds to the bid side of open orders and one possibility is that someone placed a market order to sell when the bid price for the stock fell to $ 10 which was matched to your open limit order so using your terminology i would say the spot bid price is what fell to $ 10 even if for a brief moment whether or not it is possible for your order to be filled when the limit buy price is deeper than the current bid price is beyond me it may have something to do with lot sizes

dollar cost averaging is a great strategy to use for investment vehicles where you ca n't invest it in a lump sum a 401 k is perfect for this you take a specific amount out of each paycheck and invest it either in a single   fund or multiple funds or some programs let you invest it in a brokerage account so you can invest in virtually any mutual fund or stock with annual or semi annual re balancing of your investments dollar cost averaging is the way to invest in these programs if you have a lump sum to invest then dollar cost averaging is not the best way to invest imagine you want to invest 10 k and you want to be 50 bonds and 50 stocks under dollar cost averaging you would take months to move the money from 100 cash to 50/50 bonds stocks while you are slowly moving towards the allocation you want you will spend months not in the allocation you want you will spend way too long in the heavy cash position you were trying to change the problem works the other way also somebody trying to switch from stocks to gold a few years ago would not have wanted to stay in limbo for months obviously day traders do n't use dollar cost averaging if you will will be a frequent trader dca is not the way to go   no particular stock type is better for dca it is dependent on how long you plan on keeping the investment and if you will be working with a lump sum or not edit there have be comments regarding dca and 401ks when experts discuss why people should invest via a 401 k they mention dca as a plus along with the company match many participants walk away with the belief that dca is the best strategy many articles have been written about how to invest an inheritance or tax refund many people want to use dca because they believe that it is good in fact in the last few years the experts have begun to discourage ever using dca unless there is no other way

first of all make sure you have an emergency fund   ideally this should be at least 6 months of living expenses in an easily accessible place do you have any credit card debt school debt or other debt   work towards becoming debt free especially of higher interest debt and debt on things that are only depreciating cars for example   if you have extra income consider putting it towards debt if you currently have access to a 403b you should begin investing immediately   if not look into a roth ira   the community has provided suggestions for good places to get one   with a roth ira you take post tax income money and invest it into this retirement account and when you reach retirement age you get it and all the interest as tax free income   you ca n't withdraw the principal until retirement age   you should put up to the legal limit into a retirement account if you ca n't do this at first work towards this goal after an emergency fund becoming debt free and fully funding your retirement save for goals such as a house or other things you are working towards the exact order of doing these things might vary but in general you need the emergency fund first

if the intention is after maturing to convert back the rupees into euro its not a good idea   generally the interest rate in euro and the interest rate in rupee are offset by the predicted exchange rate i.e. the rupee will fall compared to euro by similar rate the point at step 5 is generally what is expected to happen at times this can be less or more depending on the local global factors so on average you will not make money some times you will loose and sometimes you will gain plus i have shown flat conversion rates typically there is a buy rate and a sell rate for a pair of currencies there is a difference spread that is the margins of bank typically in the range of 2 to 4 depending on the currency pairs

first they do n't have an obligation to provide a service for a non customer   in theory the could even refuse this service to account holders if that was their business model although in practice that would almost surely be too large of a turn off to be commercially feasible   non account holders are n't paying fees or providing capital to the bank so the bank really has no incentive or obligation to tie up tellers serving them maybe as importantly they have a legitimate business reason in this case as stated   the fact that the bill passed whatever test the teller did does not of course ensure that the bill is real   they may or may not subject it to additional tests later that might be more conclusive   making you have an account helps ensure that in the event they do test it and it fails that a they know who you are in case the secret service wants to find you and b they can recover their losses by debiting your account by the $ 100   this is n't foolproof since any number of bad things could still happen identity theft closing account before they do additional tests bill passing later tests etc but it does give them some measure of protection

a stock is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it if it trades different values on different days that means someone was willing to pay a higher price or someone was willing to sell at a lower price   there is no rule to prevent a stock from trading at $ 10 and then $ 100 the very next trade or $ 1 the very next trade though exchanges or regulators may halt trading cancel trades or impose limits on large price movements as they deem necessary but this is beside the point i 'm trying to illustrate asking what happens from the close of one day to the open of the next is like asking what happens from one trade to the next trade someone simply decided to sell or pay a different price   nothing needs to have happened in between

putting debt out long means to borrow a sum of money paid back over a longer period of time than you could reasonably pay it back it should be important to note that this advice only applies for fixed rate loans meaning your rate ca n't change for the life of the loan without you explicitly changing it   the logic is that if you can borrow money when interest rates are really low there is a good chance you can find an investment that has a return higher than the interest rate on the loan it also means that when if interest rates go up in the future a simple savings account may even have a greater return than your loans interest the advice suggests to borrow over a long period so you are paying less interest per payment and gives you time to find a proper investment without having to pay too much interest during that time

from the irs page on estimated taxes emphasis added taxes must be paid as you earn or receive income during the year either through withholding or estimated tax payments if the amount of income tax withheld from your salary or pension is not enough or if you receive income such as interest dividends alimony self employment income capital gains prizes and awards you may have to make estimated tax payments if you are in business for yourself you generally need to make estimated tax payments estimated tax is used to pay not only income tax but other taxes such as self employment tax and alternative minimum tax i think that is crystal clear that you 're paying income tax as well as self employment tax to expand a bit you seem to be confusing self employment tax and estimated tax which are not only two different things but two different kinds of things   one is a tax and the other is just a means of paying your taxes self employment tax refers to the social security and medicare taxes that you must pay on your self employment income   this is an actual tax that you owe   if you receive a w-2 half of it is paid by your employer and half of it is paid by you in the form of visible deductions on your pay stub   if you 're self employed you have to pay all of it explicitly estimated tax does not refer to any actual tax levied on anyone   a more correct phrasing would be estimated tax payment   estimated taxes are just payments that you make to the irs to pay tax you expect to owe   whether you have to make such payments depends on how much tax you owe and whether you 've paid it by other means   you may need to pay estimated tax even if you 're not self employed although this would be unusual   it could happen for instance if you realized large capital gains over the year   you also may be self employed but not need to pay estimated tax if for instance you also have a w-2 job and you reduce your withholding allowances to have extra tax withheld that said if you earn significant income from self employment you 'll likely have to make estimated tax payments   these are prepayments of the income tax and social security medicare taxes you accrue based on your self employment income as pete b. mentioned in his answer a possible reason that your are low is because some taxes have already been withheld from the paychecks you received so far during the year while you were an employee   these represent tax payments you 've already made you do n't need to pay that money a second time but you may need to make estimated tax payments for your income going forward

in market cap weighted index there is fairly heavy concentration in the largest stocks the top 10 stocks typically account for about 20 of the s&p 500 index   in equal weight this bias towards large caps is removed the market cap method would be good when large stocks drive the markets however if the markets are getting driven by mid caps and small caps the equal weight wins historically most big companies start out small and grow big fast in a short span of time thus if we were to do market cap one would have purchased smaller number of shares of the said company as its cap weight would have been small and when it becomes big we would have purchased the shares at a higher price however if we were to do equal weight then as the company grows big one would have more share at a cheaper price and would result in better returns there is a nice article on this also gives the of the returns over a period of 10 years where equal weight index has done good it does not mean that it would continue

i have been careful here to cover both shares in companies and in etfs exchange traded funds some information such as around corporate actions and is only applicable for company shares and not etfs the shares that you own are registered to you through the broker that you bought them via but are verified by independent fund administrators and brokerage reconciliation processes this means that there is independent verification that the broker has those shares and that they are ring as being yours the important point in this is that the broker can not sell them for their own profit or otherwise use them for their own benefit such as for collateral against margin etc   1 since the broker is keeping the shares for you they are still acting as an intermediary in order to prove that you own the shares and have the right to sell them you need to transfer the registration to another broker in order to sell them through that broker this typically but not always involves some kind of fee and the broker that you transfer to will need to be able to hold and deal in those shares not all brokers have access to all markets 2 you can sell your shares through a different broker to the one you bought them through but you will need to transfer your ownership to the other broker and that broker will need to have access to that market 3 you will normally depending on your broker get an email or other message on settlement which can be around two days after your purchase you should also be able to see them in your online account ui before settlement you usually do n't get any messages from the issuing entity for the instrument until agm time when you may get invited to the agm if you hold enough stock all other corporate actions should be handled for you by your broker it is rare that settlement does not go through on well regulated markets such as european hong kong japanese and us markets but this is more common on other markets in particular i have seen quite a lot of trades reversed on the market recently that is not to say that is unsafe its just that i happen to have seen a few trades reversed recently

i am a flight attendant on a private jet and i hear a bank ceo    discussing a merger or a buyout i proceed to purchase that stock    before the announcement the ceo did not tell me to buy it i just    overheard him if you are a flight attendant on a private jet that is operated by one of the principals probably including a bank attorney consultant broker etc in the merger or buyout then you probably have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the information and are prohibited from trading please see you ’re a janitor at a major company you hear members of the company ’s    board outside the room you ’re cleaning and decide to hide in    the closet the board a deal to sell the company for a fat    premium to the current share price you load up on the shares illegal    insider trading definitely this is not a public place and you ’d be in a position to    understand that confidential information was being disclosed which    changes the calculus says andrew a chicago based    securities lawyer also see however between these two extremes of a bystander with no duty to the    corporation and a corporate officer with a clear duty to the    corporation stood a whole group of people such as printers lawyers    and others who were involved in non public transactions that did not    necessarily have a duty to the company whose securities they traded    to address this group of people the courts developed the    theory the theory covers people who    inside information and who are prohibited from trading on such    information because they owe a duty to a third party and not the    corporation whose securities are traded yours is the perfect example you owe a duty to your employer to operate in its best interests as for the broader more common example where you information in an elevator restaurant in line at the coffee shop etc trading on such information was found not to be insider trading in sec v.   in this case mr. overheard information at a track meet and traded on it with profits the court found   the information was inadvertently overheard by at the track meet rule does not bar trading on the basis of information inadvertently revealed by an insider on the basis of the above findings of fact and conclusions of law the    court orders judgment in favor of defendants

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

disclaimer i do n't work in the finance industry and simply took a few classes in corporate finance and management during my undergrad   it depends on what type of investing you 're talking about if you 're talking about building a portfolio of securities then capm is the basis for most valuation models generally capm will have you discount based on your best available risk free rate usually t bills or some other fixed income source with a reliable even after your valuation the basic theory of risk management for an investment portfolio is still to maintain a diverse basket of poorly correlated products   if you 're talking about corporate finance where a firm is considering an investment such as a new project then a determining a wacc and using it as a discount rate for your cash flow is a basic strategy    this is a basic strategy but there are better ones depending on the specifics of the investment this is where evaluating exposures is important to hedge counterparty risk you might discount by the estimated probability of non payment or buy trade insurance to hedge currency risk you might buy forwards options or look into a money market hedge to hedge political risks like repatriation or changes in tax laws or regulation you might buy political risk insurance to hedge exposure to a particular commodity price you can trade futures

a lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law if the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract   if a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative cheaper loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can if rates rise sharply in general due to unusual economic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble   for example the base rate in the uk and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties

this article is very one sided and it also pulls the struggles from one industry and uses that as a basis to declare resumes are a useless part of the hiring process in general what works for a tech start up does n't work for someone hiring a nurse or an accountant or a salesperson    most egregious is that this article completely ignores the point of a resume of course anyone using a resume to make a hiring decision will see poor results a resume is there to be able to down your candidate pool to see who you are interested to bring in for interviews and eventually assessments to learn more about them    it is also pretty easy to verify employment history with a single call or services like the work number you can provide assessments and ask interview questions to see if someone really knows the information they claim to know on a resume    in order to remove the resume from the hiring process you have to solve the issue of being able to easily and effectively narrow down a pool of applicants while having a tangible summary of education experience skills etc online methods of eliminating applications by keywords have shown to exclude highly qualified candidates until such a method is discovered the resume is still by far the best took to summarize a candidate and to decide who you want to learn more about

as i see it the two main considerations are   total amount of money received for which the key variable is life expectancy 0.8 = so at £ 86 week she would only be better off with the lump sum if she expected to live for less than years obviously none of us have a crystal ball but you could make some assessment based on her current health risk factors etc to see whether that seemed feasible also you do have to bear in mind that the value of £ 86 in 7 years time will be less than it is now but i guess the £ 86 would be inflation adjusted her need for income versus capital if she takes a lump sum and invests it in a house that is great but does n't provide any income at all if she has sufficient income from other sources and forecasts this other income to continue until her death then the lump sum might be more attractive but if not then she would need to be sure that she was n't tying up the money unnecessarily another option here would be using the lump sum to buy an annuity and it might be exploring this but i doubt whether the rates would be good enough to beat the £ 86 week she is being offered as an alternative another lesser consideration is her future entitlement to state funded care if needed in her later years if you have assets above a certain amount you are expected to fund your own care in which case having an expensive house might actually be more of a liability than a help

this seems like a huge advantage for a roth to the point where i ca n't    figure out why anyone would choose a traditional you are missing something called the time value of money this is the concept that a certain amount of money now has the same value as a bigger amount of money later basically you would n't be willing to give up an amount of money now and get the same amount of money later you need to get a larger amount later to be willing to exchange it for a certain amount now so that larger amount later has the same value to you than that smaller amount now this is the idea behind interest and investment returns when you make an investment and it earns interest or gains over a period of time in effect that final amount of money principal + interest has the same value as the principal when you started because that final amount was grown from the original principal so whether you are taxed on the principal in the beginning as in roth ira or on the principal + interest at the end as in traditional ira you are still taxed on the same value of money and if the tax rates are the same between now and in the future then you pay the same value in taxes in both cases roth would only be better than traditional if the tax rates are lower now than when you take it out and traditional would only be better than roth if the tax rates are higher now than when you take it out let 's consider a simple example to demonstrate that the two are equivalent if the tax rates assuming a flat tax because tax brackets introduce other complications are the same now and when you take it out in both cases you start with $ 1000 pre tax wages you invest it for 10 years in a place with guaranteed 5 returns per year adn then take it out there are no penalties for withdrawal and there is a flat 25 tax now and in the future note that you are left with the same amount of money in both cases this arises from the of multiplication note that roth ira has a higher effective limit than traditional ira because the nominal limit is the same for both but roth is post tax so if you contribute to near the limit where traditional can no longer match the value that roth can contribute then the comparison no longer applies the $ 1000 in this example is below the limit for both

from an article i wrote a while back dalbar inc. a boston based financial services research firm has been measuring the effects of decisions to buy sell and switch into and out of mutual funds since 1984 the key finding always has been that the average investor earns significantly less than the return reported by their funds for the 20 years ended dec. 31 2006 the average stock fund investor earned a paltry 4.3 average annual compounded return compared to percent for the standard poor ’s 500 index it 's one thing to look at the indexes but quite another to understand what other investors are actually getting the propensity to sell low and buy high is proven by the data dalbar publishes and really makes the case to go after the magic s&p 0.09 gotten from an etf

you need to hire a tax professional and have them sort it out for you properly and advise you on how to proceed next do n't do it yourself you 're way past the stage when you could you 're out of compliance and you 're right there are penalties that a professional might know how to mitigate and maybe even negotiate a waiver with the irs depending on the circumstances of the case be careful of answers like you do n't need to pay anything that are based on nothing of facts based on what you said in the question and in the comments it actually sounds like you do have to pay something and you 're in trouble with the irs already it might be that you misunderstood something in the past e.g. you said the business had filed taxes before but in fact that might never happened and you 're confusing business filed taxes with i filed schedule c or it might be the actual factual representation of things you did in fact filed a tax return for your business with the irs either form 1120 of some kind or 1065 in any case a good licensed cpa or ea professional will help you sort it out and educate you on what you need to do in the future

i read up on it and saw that the irs can charge the loan provider on    interest even if the loan provider does n't charge interest but this    is normally mitigated by the 0 interest being considered a gift and    as long as it 's below x amount your fine yes this sums it up x is the amount of the gift exemption the $ however you must differ between loan with no interest and loan with no paying back with loan with no interest you 're still giving a statutory gift of the irs mandated minimum interest however the principal is expected to be repaid to you and you must show that this expectation is reasonably fulfilled if you can not i.e. you gave a loan with no intention of it being paid back then the irs will recharacterize the whole amount as the gift and you 'll be on the hook for gift tax for the amounts above the exemption what defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the irs is it simply that    the loan will be paid back or is it only considered a loan if a    note is made as i said you must be able to show that the loan is indeed a loan even if it is with no interest i.e. it is being repaid it is treated as a loan by all parties and is not an attempt to evade gift tax promissory note is not a must but will definitely be helpful in showing that but without the de facto repayment of the loan it will be hard to argue that it is not a gift even if you have a promissory note that means you should make a loan in such a way that the borrower will begin repaying it reasonably soon so that you can show payment schedule being followed and money moving back to you reasonably soon is not of course defined in a statute so do consult with a ea cpa licensed in your state on how to structure the loan so that it will not appear as an attempt to evade the gift tax are there any limits on how big a loan can be no but keep in mind that even with statutory interest charges published by the irs monthly see the link with large enough loan you can exceed the gift tax exemption also keep in mind that interest is taxable income to you even if you gift it back i.e. the statutory interest

i 'm assuming you are buying bond mutual funds or bond etfs here not the actual bonds directly there are a significant variety of different types of bond funds reflecting the sort of bonds they invest in for example you can invest in risky non commercial grade bonds also known as junk bonds or you can invest in short term bonds which are much safer but return much less there 's no such thing as the average bond so let 's go for somewhere in the middle let 's go for 3 return after fees now it 's fairly simple math you want $ 3,000 a month or $ 36,000 a year to generate that sort of return you 'd need to invest $ if we are more optimistic we could go for a 4 return after fees that reduces your investment to $ 900,000 note that it would almost certainly not make sense to invest all that money in bonds instead you 'd want to invest in a mix of stocks and bonds this could likely reduce your risk while increasing your expected return

wow i 'm one of the two people who actually respond to your half baked idea and you jump down my throat    the example of changing majors is different because you 're talking about a share of lifetime income not a loan that will be paid off in the next 10 15 years with such a long term obligation as you mention the onus to get it right on your first major will be high possibly   as for probably have some penalty that 's what i 'm talking about you have n't even really considered the depth necessary to create a system such a vast and liquid system so you do n't really have any idea how massive the costs could be in comparison to such miniscule amounts of principal   and do n't flatter yourself i 'm not confusing your little five minute thought with the brothers impressive novel i mentioned it because it 's a valid parallel and while you may not be talking about corporations you are talking about creating securitized investments aka securities stocks on a massive scale   you 're talking about millions of individuals who need to be for risk and profitability who need to be verified double checked maybe interviewed bundled and approved by very nature of being securities they 'll need approval from people like the sec as well as listings on exchanges or somewhere all of this conforming comes with a great deal of fees by the time you 're done we 're at a similar complexity level to that of a corporation   i 'm sorry you felt the need to because you seem to be out of your league on this one next time maybe explaining your point in greater detail will help people understand what you 're saying

it bothers me how your being downvoted in a goddamn business sub like i get people like tesla and think it 's going to be a good company but as of right now this company does n't make money and is n't that the whole point of a business sure it might have huge and amazing potential but that 's all it is potential i like tesla as much as the next guy i 'm kicking myself for not buying the stock when i first saw it mentioned on reddit and i considered buying it that was at like $ 70    but there is a simple fact that the company may be overvalued it 's valued like a tech company when it 's currently operating like a car company sure you can argue they are really a tech company or will be in the future when if they dominate the battery market but then that means news like this should n't even make a dent on their price    you gave your simple and valid reasons for why you would n't buy tesla but obviously people do n't want to hear it and will downvote it instead of actually making a discussion from it     sometimes i think that marketing team has reddit completely figured out and is just abusing it

  k mart and sears merged under the direction of eddie lampert   supposedly it was partially a giant middle finger to the board of directors at sears who had not allowed eddie lampert to make changes he wanted to make to sears   he used his investment firm 's assets to buy up a sizable chunk of k mart while chairman of sears then had k mart and sears merge giving him a more controlling stake of the corporation   it seems he has not been able to deliver on the promise of the two stores to compete better in the modern economy though as the two parts continue to struggle as made obvious by these closures

the thing is corporate taxes are n't paid on revenues or costs they 're paid on net income    meaning no matter what happens any investment the company makes that improves their net income automatically means more money for the company     so let 's say 12 vs 14 tax    a 2 increase in tax means a 2 lower net roi on the investment     but so long as the incremental improvement to your bottom line is there the investment is sound with or without taxes    even at a 50 corporate tax rate    you hire one more person at $ 60k yr and they make $ 120k yr in net income for you    you still keep $ 30k of the profits     it 's an incremental increase regardless   and if that person does n't make you money   say the incremental benefit is 0    well your net income just dropped $    and you just paid $ 30k less in taxes    meaning the true cost of that hire is $ 30k to your bottom line   where it hurts business is that your retained earnings do n't build up as fast    it makes the next investment harder to make is all    and as a corporation if you 're not paying dividends you need to keep reinvesting your retained

your suggestion seems a bit too extreme handing auditing responsibility to a government body agency would just create its own set of problems and other conflicts of interest for example opinions could be subject to politics increased bureaucracy laziness due to monopoly hell if the government audited the statements they would have the power to authorize only accounting policies that maximized a company 's tax payout   the audit only firm proposal by the european commission seems to be the more reasonable solution to try to avoid conflicts of interest firms that audit companies are less likely to issue adverse qualified opinions on them since those companies were simply following the firms own consulting advice which seems to be the heart of the problem even though the sox nearly eliminated that but if the audit business was effectively separated from accounting firms other practices and audit only companies sprung up then other problems would arise audit only firms would still be unwilling to piss major clients off by issuing qualified opinions and lose future business also since the audit business is not really the present firms money maker costs to audit would only increase to ensure that audit only firms are profitable

this is based on my experience with chase and may not be applicable to other banks as you mentioned chase as one of the banks you do business with hopefully this will be helpful to you the money does come out of your account immediately if the check is n't cashed in a certain amount of time the check expires and you get the money credited back to your account once you have made a bill payment online you can check on the status of your check by looking at your payment activity finding the payment in question and following the proof of payment link    there is will provide you with information on your payment which you can submit to your payee to prove when you submitted the payment and which they can use to verify with the bank that you really did send the payment as you claimed   once the check is cashed this page will also contain images of the front and back of the cashed check so you can prove that the recipient really did cash it   you can see from this info that the check is being funded from a different account number than your own which is good for security purposes since per 2008 giving someone else your bank routing number and account number as found on your personal checks basically provides them with all they need to fraudulently of course clean out your account

if the company 's ownership is structured similarly to a typical start up then an 1 employee ownership in a company which sells for 1 million will yield far less than 10k due to various liquidation preferences of the investors different share classes etc   it 's pretty hard to get a specific number because it depends a lot on the details of earlier fundraising and stock grants     that said unless the company is circling the drain and the sale was just to avoid bk the share price you get should be higher unless the share class structure and acquisition deal are completely unfair

there are those who are knowledgable in real estate who offer rules of thumb do n't pay more that 50x the rent for the house here $ 972 x 50 is $ assume half the rent goes to expenses so from $ 972 you net $ and after that mortgage you have $ 111 in profit zillow usually assumes 20 down here $ 20k. so you are seeing a return on your 20k. plus appreciation and principal paydown   for the record i just bought a 3 family under renovation now expecting total cost to be $ 160 k and total rent $ 2500 i missed ratio a by a bit but $ 1250 to go toward a $ 120 k mortgage works out fine $ 550 profit mo on the 25 down $ 40 k by the way a turnover of tenants can cost a a month of no rent b a cost to the real estate agent if you use one and the cost to paint repair this is generally considered 10 so if the 50 of rent seemed high here 's 10 of it

first off the mortgage interest is tax deductible argument is a red herring   what tax deductible sounds like it means is if i pay $ 100 on x i can pay $ 100 less on my taxes   if that were true you 're still not saving any money overall so it does n't help you any in the immediate term and it 's actually a bad idea long term because that mortgage interest compounds but you do n't pay compound interest on taxes but that 's not what it actually means   what it actually means is that you can deduct some percentage of that $ 100 usually not all of it from your gross income not from the final amount of tax you pay which reduces your top line income subject to taxation   unless you 're just barely over the line of a tax bracket spending money on something tax deductible is rarely a net gain having gotten that out of the way pay down the mortgage first   it 's a very simple matter of numbers anything you pay on a long term debt is money you would have paid anyway but it eliminates interest on that payment and all thereof from the equation for the entire duration of the loan   so ignoring for the moment the possibility of extreme situations like default and bank failure you can consider it to be essentially a guaranteed risk free investment that will pay you dividends equal to the rate of interest on the loan for the entire duration of the loan the mortgage is 3.9 presumably for 30 years   the car loan is 1.9 for a lot less than that   not sure how long let 's just pull a number out of a hat and say 5 years if you were given the option to invest at a guaranteed 3.9 for 30 years or a guaranteed 1.9 for 5 years which would you choose   it 's a no brainer when you look at it that way

i do n't see how anyone could give you a hard and fast formula unless they know where to get some applicable statistics because several factors here are not a straight calculation if you do n't replace the tires but keeping driving the car what is the increased probability that you will get into an accident because of the bald tires how much will bald tires vs new tires affect the selling price of the car presumably the longer you drive the car after getting new tires the less increase this will give to the market value of the car what 's the formula for that if you keep the car what 's the probability that it will have other maintenance problems etc that said it 's almost always cheaper to keep your current car than to buy a new one even if you have maintenance problems it would have to be a huge problem to cost more than buying a new car suppose you buy a $ 25,000 car with what 's a typical new car loan these days maybe 5 years at 5 so your payments would be about $ per month if you compare spending $ 1000 for new tires versus paying $ per month on a new car loan the tires are cheaper within 3 months the principle is the same if you buy with cash to justify buying a new car you have to factor in the value of the pleasure you get from a new car the peace of mind from having something more reliable etc mostly intangibles

as has been said before going from nothing to something is an infinite percent increase it is not 100 maybe you had a dollar and now have $ 101 that is a 10000 increase quite remarkable i often work with percent changes like spc = 100 where i compute the percent with respect to the average first this is more stable as often measurements can have noise the average is more reliable   second advantage is also that this is so going from 95 to 105 is a 10 increase while going from 105 to 95 a 10 decrease of course you need to explain what you show

i 've never invested in penny stocks my 1 investing rule buy what you know and use   people get burned because they hear about the next big thing go invest to just end up losing everything because they have no clue in what they 're investing in from what i 've found until you have minimum of $ 5k to invest put everything in a single investment the reason for this as others have mentioned is that commissions eat up just about all your profits   my opinion do n't put it in a bond returns are garbage right now however they are safe because this is $ 1000 we 're talking about and not your life savings put it in a equity like a stock to try and maximize your return i aim for 15 returns on stocks and can generally achieve 10 15 consistently the problem is when you get greedy and keep thinking it will go above once you 're at 10 15 sell it sell it right away if it drops down -15 you have to be willing to accept that risk the nice thing is that you can wait it out i try to put a 3 month time frame on things i buy to make money   once you start getting a more sizable chunk of money to play around with you should start to diversify in canada at least once you have a trading account with a decent size investment the commissions get reduced to like $ 10 a trade with your consistent 10 returns and additional savings you 'll start to build up your portfolio keep at it and best of luck

that may become complicated depending on the state laws in some states california for example llcs are taxed on gross receipts so you 'll be paying taxes on paying money to yourself in other states this would be a no op since the llc is disregarded so you need to check your state law i assume the llc is not taxed as a corporation since that would be really stupid of course but if it is then it adds the complexity of the federal taxes on top as well corporate entity will pay taxes on your rent and you 'll pay taxes on your dividends to get the money back the best option would be to take that property out of the llc since there 's no point in it anyway if you 're the tenant

the fact that you are choosing index fund means you are surely not one of those investors who can correctly judge dips but buying on dips is still important you can use a method called dollar value averaging it is better than dollar cost averaging just make sure you apply a lower limit and an upper limit to be more predictable suppose you have 10000 to invest use limits like minimum 200 investment when index is high maximum 600 investment when index is down and when index gives normal returns invest 400 do this for about 2 years more than 2 years is not recommended i myself use this method and benefit a lot

i have read in many personal finance books that stocks are a great investment for the long term because on average they go up 5 7 every year this has been true for the last 100 years for the s&p500 index but is there reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely into the future it has also been wrong for 20 + year time periods during those last 100 years it 's an average and you can live your whole career at a loss there are many things to support the retention of the average over the next 100 years i think the is out of scope of your actual investment philosophy but basically there are many ways to lower your cost basis by reinvesting dividends selling options or contributing to your position at any price from a portion of your income and by inflation and by the growth of the world economy with a low enough cost basis then a smaller percentage gain in the index gives you a magnified profit

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

for bonds bought at par the face value of the bond like buying a cd for $ 1000 the payment it makes is the same as yield you pay $ 1000 and get say $ 40 per year or 4 if you buy it for more or less than that $ 1000 say $ 900 there 's some math not for me i use a finance calculator to tell you your return taking the growth to maturity into account i.e. the extra $ 100 you get when you get the full $ 1000 back obviously for bonds you care about whether the or municipality will pay you back at all and then you care about how much you 'll make when then do in that order for stocks the picture is different as some companies give no dividend but reinvest all profits think berkshire hathaway on the other hand many people believe that the dividend is important and choose to buy stocks that start with a nice yield a $ 30 stock with a $ dividend is 3.3 yield sounds like not much but over time you expect the company to grow increase in value and increase its dividend 10 years hence you may have a $ 40 stock and the dividend has risen to $ 1.33 now it 's 4.4 of the original investment and you sit on that gain as well

another reason and to me the main reason not to buy a house if you 're in your early 20s regardless of your income is mobility if you rent you can move pretty much whenever you want after the first year of your rental lease is up even before then in some cases if your finishes school and gets a great job offer in another city or state you can move there pretty quickly when you own a house that is much harder to do your having two kids makes it harder in either case but at this point in your lives you really do n't know where your future will take you geographically speaking and renting gives you the option of moving easily if you have to

best as i can tell the simple answer is the smartest approach to investing for dividends is to pick a company that is has and will continue to make a solid profits there are lots of them out there specifically companies with no debt a history of long term and steady growth and a stable market share will almost always recoup any drop in stock valuation due to a dividend payout and usually in short order this is why dividends were created as a mechanism for distributing profits back to investor without diminishing thier stake in the company the trick then is to find such companies with the best ratio between stock price and dividend payout and again there are a lot of good options out there   all the is justified however as many unscrupulous companies will try to pull investors in with high dividends as a means to simply generate capital these companies have few of the quality attributes mentioned above instead high debt fluctuating or negative profits minimal market share or diminishing growth present a very risky long term play and will be avoided by this conservative investor

i would give him some credit for not screwing up and over spending too much he has run up his secret service costs so they need more money that has n't shown up but that is really a drop in the bucket against the budget he has n't passed any legislation that effects the budget yet   and mid year really does n't matter they should have a pretty good prediction for the debt this year that would be a more telling number

a cpa or enrolled agent can be helpful especially if you have a complicated situation such as owning your own business the people at a lot of tax prep places do n't have many qualifications they are not accountants or enrolled agents or certified financial planners or anything else they are just trained to enter stuff into the computer in that case you can measure their value according to how much you prefer talking to typing but do n't expect them to get it right if your taxes involve any judgment calls or tricky stuff i think a good strategy is to try turbotax or whatever program and if you get stuck on any of the questions find a pro to help

for corporate finance you probably do n't need it you say you want to have a year of job experience after you get your degree but instead i would recommend getting an internship next summer before your senior year that would be a lot more helpful and if you do a good job it is likely whatever company you intern for will offer you a full time job after graduation    the cfa is more for people who want to work on wallstreet and such if you still want to take it my recommendation would be to try and take the first level test in college and try to find scholarships and help for it i had a friend who had the test and all the study material paid for by the university of arizona

theory of levered investing borrowing in order to increase investment exposure is a time honored and legitimate activity   it 's the optimal way to increase your exposure according to finance theory which assumes you get a good interest rate more on this later   in your case it may or may not be a good idea   based on the information in your post i believe that in your case it is not a good idea   consider the following concerns risk in finance reward comes with risk and in no other way   investing borrowed money means there is a good not small chance that you will lose enough money that you will need to pull significant wealth from your own savings in order to make up the difference   if you are in a position to do this and ok with that possibility then proceed to to the next concern   if losing a lot of money means financial calamity for you then this is a bad idea   you have n't described your financial situation so i do n't know in which camp you fall   if the idea of losing say $ 100 k means complete financial failure for you then the strategy you have described simply has too much risk make no mistake just because the market makes money on average does not mean it will make money or as much money as you expect over your horizon   it may lose money perhaps a lot of money make sure this idea is very clear in your mind before taking action rewards your post implies that you think you can reliably get on an investment this is not the case   there are many years in which a reasonable portfolio makes this much or more but on average you will earn less no ones knows the true long term market risk premium but it is definitely less than 10   a better guess would be 6.5 plus whatever the risk free rate is currently about 0   buying riskier investments means from the optimal portfolio meaning you took on more risk than is justified by how much extra money you expect to make   i never encourage people to invest based on optimistic or unrealistic goals   if anything you should be conservative about how you expect things to go   and remember these are averages any portfolio that earns also has a very good chance of losing 25 or more   people who sell or give advice on investments frequently get you charged up by pointing at times and investments that have done very well   unfortunately we never know whether the investments and time period in which we are investing will be a good one a bad one or an one   the reality of investing is well more realistic than what you have described costs i ca n't imagine how you could borrow that much money and only have an annual payment of $ 2000 as you imply that must be a mistake   no individual borrows at a rate significantly below 1   it sounds like it 's not a collateralized loan of any kind so unless you are some kind of prime loan customer your interest rate will be significant   subtract whatever rate you actually pay from 6.5 to get a rough idea of how much you will make if things go as well as they do on average   you will pay the interest whether times are good or bad if your rate is typical of personal loans there 's a good chance you will lose money on average using the strategy you have described   if you are ok with taking risk with a negative expected return consider a trip to las vegas   it 's more exciting ethics i 'm not one to make people feel guilty for doing things that are legal but of questionable morality   if that 's the case and you are ok with it more power to you i 'm not sure under what pretense you expect to obtain the money but it sounds like you might be crossing legal lines and committing actual crimes like fraud   make sure to check on whether what you intend is a white lie or something that can get you thrown in prison for example if you are proposing obtaining a subsidized education loan and using it for speculation i could easily see you spending serious time in prison and permanently ruining your life even if your plan works out   a judge and 12 of your peers are not going to think welfare fraud is a harmless twist of the truth summary i 've said a lot of negative things here   this is because i have to guess about your financial situation and it sounds like you may have unrealistic expectations of the safety and generosity of investing   quite frankly people for whom borrowing $ 250 k is no big deal do n't normally come and ask about it on stackexchange and they definitely do n't tend to lie in order to get loans   also $ 18 k a year does n't change their quality of life however i do n't know   if $ 250 k is small relative to your wealth and you need a good way to increase your exposure to the market risk premium then borrowing and investing may well be a good idea

simple math take the sale proceeds after trade expenses and divide by cost subtract 1 and this is your return for example buy at 80 sell at 100 = 1.25 your return is 25 to annualize this return multiply by 365 over the days you were in that stock if the above stock were held for 3 months you would have an annualized return of 100   there 's an alternative way to annualize in the same example above take the days invested and dive into 365 here you get 4 i suggested that 25 x 4 = 100 others will ask why i do n't say 1.25 ^ 4 = so the return is in other words compound the return a single day trade noon to noon the next day returning just 1 would multiply to 365 over a year ignoring the fact there are about 250 trading days but 1.01 ^ 365 is or a return for long periods the compounding makes sense of course the i hope to see should double my money in 9 years not 12 but taking the short term trades and compounding creates odd results of little value

basically do some math on the 2 schools let 's say you know it will take 4 years if you go the cheaper route at $ 8k yr plus the $ 300/month total cost $ if you for these purposes do not have to pay back new loans until school is completed and depending on the rate of those loans you would need approx $ 6k yr in loans plus the same costs $ 300/month + $ 8k yr to cover the other part of tuition let 's say the expensive school takes 3 years to complete which means you 're out of pocket $ and in debt an additional $ 18,000 totaling $ this means that to make the 2nd school worth it assuming your rates do n't kill you etc you should have an increased earning potential of at least $ after you get your degree if you can finish in 2 years your costs are $ + $ 12k and you do n't even have to change your earning potential to come out ahead other factors to consider are if you are n't following any of the math or want to post more information just comment back to me and i 'll try to explain further best of luck

as your main concern seems to be that you are not sure whether you can ever get a house and actually support the expenses it incurs when you have one here is a very simple answer   you say you are currently decreasing your creditcard debt by 2k per month at that rate it will be finished within 2 years try to pay it off completely if this succeeds in the next 2 years you can be confident that you can afford a 500k house paying back 50k high interest debt in 2 years is very roughly equivalent to back 500k low interest debt over 20 years a reasonable time period in my environment so just pay back the creditcard as fast as you can if two years sounds like a long time there is nothing stopping you to pay it back a little bit faster even   note this is written under the assumption that your student loan burden will not increase over time

my basic rule i tell everyone who will listen is to always live like you 're a college student if you could make it on $ 20k a year when you get your first real job at $ 40k eg put all the rest into savings to start 401(k ira etc gradually increase your lifestyle expenses after you hit major savings goals 3 + month emergency fund house down payment etc any time you get a raise start by socking it all into your employer 's 401(k or similar and repeat the above advice

it 's pretty simple   increase banks ability to lend for     a. mortgages     b. small businesses   banks have tremendous quantities of cash trapped on their balance sheets that should be deployed into the economy where it generates growth jobs and strengthens the middle class    improve infrastructure    our infrastructure is in and improving it will generate growth and something to show for the massive debt load we 've accumulated for our nation    repatriation holiday this capital needs to be working in our economy increase taxes   the massive flood of liquidity we 've seen from the fed what we should be seeing released from banks and then what we should see from corporations cash will need to move through the economy and and going to work then taxed reducing deficits and eventually liquidity raise interest rates   in that order    capital moves through the market at different rates and i 'm usually for lower taxes but it is n't always the solution    lower taxes reduced regulation and low interest rates are all different ways of increasing liquidity but should be increased reduced at different parts of the economic cycle    dimon is right about washington this is bullshit

line one shows your 1 m a return with a given rate and year end withdrawal starting at 25,000   so line 2 starts with that balance applies the rate again and shows the higher withdrawal by   in column one i show the cumulative effect of the 3 inflation and the last number in this column is the final balance k but divided by the cumulative inflation   to summarize if you simply get the return of inflation and start by spending just that amount you 'll find that after 20 years you have half your real value   the is a trial and error method as i do n't know how a finance calculator would handle such a payment flow i can load the sheet somewhere if you 'd like   note this is not exactly what the op was looking for if the concept is useful i 'll let it stand if not downvotes are welcome and i 'll delete

first do you understand why it dropped was it overvalued before or is this an overreaction to some piece of news about them or about their industry or arguably if you ca n't answer that you are n't paying enough attention to have been betting on that individual stock assuming you do understand why this price swing occurred or if you 're convinced you know better than the folks who sold at that price do you believe the stock will recover a significant part of its value any time soon or at least show a nice rate of growth from where it is now if so you might want to hold onto it risking further losses against the chance of recovering part or all of what is at this moment only a loss on paper basically if having just seen it drop you 'd still consider buying it at the new price you should buy it from yourself and go on from here that way at least you are n't doing exactly what you hope to avoid buying high and selling low heck if you really believe in the stock you could see this as a buying opportunity on the other hand if you do not believe you would buy it now at its new price and if you see an alternative which will grow more rapidly you should take your losses and move your money to that other stock or split the difference if you are n't sure which is better but can figure out approximately how unsure you are the question is how you move on from here more than how you got here what happened happened what do you think will happen next and how much are you willing to bet on it on the hand this is part of how the market operates risk and potential reward tend to be pretty closely tied to each other you can reduce risk by diversifying across multiple investments so no one company sector market can hurt you too badly and almost anyone sane will tell you that you should diversify but that means giving up some of the chance for big winnings too you probably want to be cautious with most of your money and go for the longer odds only with a small portion that you can afford to lose on if this is really stressing you out you may not want to play with individual stocks mutual funds have some volatility too but they 're inherently diversified to a greater or lesser extent they will rarely delight you but they wo n't usually slap you this way either
