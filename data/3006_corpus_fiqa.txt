congratulations on the little one on the way i 'd recommend saving outside of tax advantaged accounts   pay your taxes and be done with them i 'd recommend putting your old age fund first before shelling out a lot of money for college i 'd recommend not shelling out a lot of money for college   ideally none   there are ways today to get a four year degree for $ 15,000   not $ 15,000 per year   $ 15,000 total   check here   this is n't an affiliate link   they can pay for this themselves i 'd recommend making sure you hold the hammer   do n't let them party on your nickel i 'd recommend teaching your kids to fish as soon as possible   help them start a business   they could be millionaires by the time they 're teenagers   then they can make their own money   you wo n't have to give them a dime

saving for school is fundamentally no different than saving for any other major purchase in addition to some of the great answers already provided here are a couple other thoughts just to have the simplified numbers handy if you can increase that to $ after 18 years one final thought i would personally avoid the 529 plans because if your child decides to not go to school eg goes in the coast guard decides to be a farmer enters the peace corps etc you 're penalized on withdrawal whereas with any other savings investment methodology you wo n't have those penalties

i know this is a little off the wall but i bought a rental property for my son 's tuition the tenants pay down the mortgage for the next 12 years and it hopefully also appreciates in value worst case scenario is i come out with a rental and a kid with no education   he does n't go then there 's no skin off my back

others have given some good answers i 'd just like to chime in with one more option treasury i series bonds they 're linked to an inflation component so they wo n't lose value in theory you can file tax returns for your children paying taxes usually 0 on the interest while they 're minors so they appreciate tax free until they 're 18 some of my relatives have given my children money and i 've invested it this way alternatively you can buy the i bonds in your own name then if you cash them out for your kids education the interest is tax free but if you cash them out for your own use you do have to pay taxes on the interest

saving for college you have a couple of options   529 plans are probably the best bet for most people wanting to save for their kids college education you can put a lot of money away and you may get a state tax deduction the downside is if you 're kid does n't go to college you may end up eating the 10 penalty state specific prepaid tuition plans the upside is you know roughly the return you are going to get on your money the downside is your kid has to go to a state school in the state you prepaid or there are likely withdrawal penalties for the most part these really are n't that great of a deal any more   are also an option but they only allow you to contribute $ 2k year but you have more investment options than with the 529 plans traditional and roth ira accounts can also be used to pay for higher education i would n't recommend this route in general but if you maxed out your 401k and were n't using your ira contribution limits you could put extra money here and get more or really different flexibility than you can with a 529 account i doubt ira 's will ever be asked for on a fafsa which might be helpful another option is to save the money in a regular brokerage account you would have more flexibility but lower returns after taxes one advantage to this route is if you think your kid might be borderline for financial aid a year or two before he starts college you could move this money into another investment that does n't matter for financial aid purposes a few words of caution make sure you save for retirement before saving for your kids college he can always get loans to pay for school but no one is going to give you a loan to pay for your retirement also be cautious with the amount of money you give your adult child studies have shown that the more money that parents give their adult children the less successful they are compared to their peers

looked at the model quickly the most likely reason is you calculated a fcf lower than the market you have fcf decreasing due to shrinking margins over the model period your terminal value then has the fcf growing by 2.3 into perpetuity so that does n't really coincide i mean it could but i would n't use it i personally think the shrinking margin assumption going forward is a little much    for your terminal value calc do n't you want that to be the final model year cash flow times 1 plus the terminal growth rate     also i find it interesting that the risk free rate is the terminal growth rate any particular reasoning behind that   it works now at the 2.3 but probably would n't in a different interest rate environment

how do they turn shares into cash that they can then use to grow their business once a company issues an ipo or follow on public offer the company gets the money going over the list of question tagged ipo would help you with basics specifically the below questions how does a company get money by going public in an ipo why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market why would a stock opening price differ from the offering price   from what i 've read so far it seems that pre ipo an investment bank essentially buys the companies public shares and that bank then sells them on the open market is the investment bank buying 100 of the newly issued public shares and then depositing the cash equivalent into the companies bank account additionally as the stock price rises and falls over the lifetime of the company how does that actually impact the companies bank balance quite a bit on above is incorrect please read the answers to the question tagged ipo once an ipo is over the company does not gain anything directly from the change in there is indirect gain loss

such an offer has negative value so it 's hard to see how it would make sense to accept it the offer has two components one part that you gain and one part that you lose the gain is that half your losses are covered the cost is that half your profits are lost for that to be a net benefit to you you would have to expect that you will gain more from this than you will lose from it that is you must expect that the investment has negative value but if you expect that the investment has negative value why are you investing this also does n't really align incentives between the two parties the person choosing the investment is not incurring opportunity cost because they have no funds locked up while you are so they have an incentive to be conservative that you do not for example say i could make 1 in an ultra low risk cd the person choosing the investments has an incentive to put me in something that he only expects to make around 0.5 because he gets to keep half the profits and it costs him nothing whereas i 'd rather just put the money in a cd because i get to keep 1 instead just half of 0.5

if they leave the extra funds in the account the irs will consider it as employer match they were n't funds from your paycheck they were from the employers profits because they do n't have a formal matching program the extra funds will still keep then under the max match   there is one other explanation that needs to be considered if the last paycheck from 2011 was near the end of the year the last friday of 2011 was december 30th the 401 k funds from that final paycheck may not have been deposited into your 401 k until early january 2012 if you count contributions when looking at your 401 k statement it will look like one two many for 2012 but the irs only cares when it was deducted from your paycheck not when it was deposited into your account the department of labor only requires they be deposited by the 15th of the following month

as pointed out they usually mean libor or the ffr or for other countries the equivalent risk free rate of interest i will just like to add on to what everyone has said here and will like to explain how various interest rates you mentioned work out when the risk free rate moves for let 's denote the risk free rate by rf the savings account interest rate as rs a mortgage interest rate as and a term deposit rate with the bank as savings account interest rate when a central bank the overnight lending rate or the prime rate repo rate etc in some countries banks are not obliged to increase the savings account interest rate usually a downward revision will force them to lower it because they net they will be paying out = rf rs on the other hand if rf goes up and if one of the banks increases the rs then other banks may be forced to do so too under competitive pressure in some countries the central bank has the authority to revise rs without the overnight lending rate term deposits with the bank or certificates of deposit usually movements in these rates are more in sync with rf than rs is the chief difference is that savings account offer more liquidity than term deposits and hence banks can offer lower rates and still get deposits under them the higher interest rate offered by the term deposit as a liquidity risk premium generally interest rates paid by instruments of similar risk profile that offer similar liquidity will move in parallel otherwise there can be arbitrage sometimes these rates can move to anticipate a future change in rf mortgage loan rates or other interests that you pay to the bank if the risk free rate goes up banks will increase these rates to keep the net interest they earn over risk free (= = rf the same if rf drops and if banks are not obliged to decrease loan rates then they will only do so if one of the banks does it first wherever i have said they will do so when one of the banks does it first i am not referring to a but merely to the competitive market theory under such a theory the first one to cut down the profit margin usually has a strong business incentive to do so e.g. gain market share or eliminate competition by lowering profit margins etc others are forced to follow the trend

there are probably many correct answers to this question but for most people the main reason is qualified dividends to be a qualified dividend and therefore eligible for lower tax rates the dividend paying stock or fund must be held for more than 60 days during the period that begins 60 days before the ex dividend date since many stocks and funds pay out dividends at the end of the year that means it takes until to late february to determine if you held them and therefore made the dividend qualified brokerages do n't want to send out 1099s in january and then possibly have to send out revised versions if you decide to sell something that paid a dividend in december that otherwise would have been qualified

sure for starters you can put it in a savings account do n't laugh they used to pay noticeable interest you know back in the olden days   you could buy an i bond from treasury direct they 're a government savings bond that pays a specified amount of interest currently 0 i believe plus the amount of the inflation rate something like 3.5 currently i believe you do n't get paid the money the i bond grows in value till you sell it you can open a discount brokerage account and buy 1 or more shares of stock in a company you like discount brokerages generally have a minimum of $ 500 or so but will waive that if you set the account up as an ira trade for instance an ira in case you did n't know is a type of account that 's tax free but you ca n't touch it till you turn 59 1/2 it 's meant to help you save for retirement incidentally watch out of small account fees that some brokerages might charge you generally they 're annual or monthly charges they 'd charge you to cover their costs on your account since they 're certainly not going to make it in commissions that ira at trade is no fee speaking of commissions those will be a big chunk of that $ 100 it 'll be like $ to buy that stock a pretty big bite however many of these discount brokerages also offer some mutual funds for no commission those mutual funds in turn have minimums too but once again if your account 's an ira many will waive the minimum or set it low like $ 100

tragedy of the commons   the tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or that resource through their collective action the concept and name originate in an essay written in by the victorian economist william lloyd who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land then colloquially called the commons in the british the concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the in 1968 in this context commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere oceans rivers fish stocks or even an office refrigerator     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r finance about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

fundamentally these are my opinions i am expressing even though i try to remain as factual as possible and have significantly modified my opinion over the years as a result of apparently factual information it 's still technically just opinion   gt my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value   by the way when i say capital it 's not generally just finance capital but all operational capital goods which includes factories and all means of production a certain amount of financing is needed to keep it operational and more is needed to increase the means of production to grow overall wealth   have you ever heard of the 's wiki basically you ca n't really push this ratio very far if consumer demand dries up then production will get cut back to meat demand overproduction of stuff they ca n't sell is not what they are in business for likewise is demand exceeds the capacity of production to keep up it pushes inflation which drives up cost to reduce demand so this ratio remains very nearly a constant even though this ratio was at historic highs in the 1970s and historic lows today   what happens when you artificially dry up labor returns through excessive supply side policies is that demand for production falls hence production is cut back to meet that demand this of course reduces employment and increases job competition which puts more downward on wages exacerbating the situation only once labor cost fall low enough it effectively subsidizes inefficient production methods which limits the falling wages at a reduced overall productivity note that this is under present circumstances not those of the 1970s this adaptive matching between production and demand insures that the ratio is never too far off of its historical averages even if productivity is driven well below its potential   more or less the same effect occurs for the opposite reason if capital return ratios are too low though with opposite effects on the inflation rate and such when consumer demand is high enough capital will pay whatever labor cost is required to meet that demand so long as it remains profitable enough i.e. they get a reasonable ratio of the market return consumer demand with sufficient capital profit margins is what drives full employment not the sheer volume of capital returns as present policies essentially assume yet you ca n't have a broad based consumer demand to drive employment without sufficient labor returns as those labor returns is what finances that demand needed to drive employment   so not only does labour and capital returns need to be balanced economics does not allow it to be unbalanced at least for long even if balancing requires the economy to shrink productivity to fall etc that is exactly what it will do to remain balanced no choice given no matter how draconian the regulations to force it this is true under purely economies of the past pure communism and even this is why i am a capitalist because nature gives me no choice but acceptance of that fact does not require me to have an ounce of tolerance for cronyism   the only thing we can do is not push this balance in either direction to destructive levels because destruction is what will happen for the balance to remain because so much of our productive capacity has been in productivity gains since the 1990s and wages and demand have as yet not matched these productivity gains we have a huge latent wealth capacity that continues to grow as we fail to take advantage of it so far our supply side policies have n't so much destroyed wealth and productivity rather it has prevented us from seeing the potential gains from the latent productivity growth from technologies over the few decades     the last part you mention about wealth capital needing to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value you are absolute 100 entirely correct perhaps even more than you know ever heard of planned obsolescence or the light bulb light bulb that link is a documentary on the issue that will make you mad we could almost certainly pay a flat 90 tax rate on everything and still not come close to what this issue cost us that 's not the only means this issue imposes cost but it is extreme    of course just because an appliance still works does n't mean people will not replace it with newer better models but the trash pile insures there is a much more limited secondary market for poorer people consumption debt cost is also a far bigger issue than people recognize debt to finance capital goods for production is fine as this feeds productivity and wealth in a manner that itself even as the debt is paid consumption debt is an entirely different beast creating a significant section of the population that feeds on peoples income without producing a thing only to let allow people to consume income they have n't earned yet   this generally falls under the category of rent seeking behavior yeah the lack real value creation turns my stomach that people will knowingly spend money on temporary non essential and such is all fine and dandy but renting our base appliances for a certain number of uses is outrageous in my book

debt is nominal which means when inflation happens the value of the money owed goes down   this is great for the borrower and bad for the lender investing can mean a lot of different things   frequently it is used to describe buying common stock which is an ownership claim on a company   a company is not a nominally fixed asset by which i mean if there was a bunch of inflation and nothing else happened i.e. the inflation was not the cause or result of some other economic change then the nominal value of the company will go up along with the prices of other things based on the above i 'd say you are incorrect to treat debt and investment returns the same way with respect to inflation   when we say equity returns 9 we mean it returns a real 7 plus 2 inflation or whatever   if the rate of inflation increased to 10 and nothing else happened in the economy the same equity would be expected to return 17   in fact the company 's nominally fixed debts would be worth less increasing the real value of the company at the expense of their debt holders on the other hand if we entered a period of high inflation your debt liability would go way down and you would have benefited greatly from borrowing and investing at the same time    if you are expecting inflation in the abstract sense then borrowing and investing in common stock is a great idea inflation is frequently the result or cause of a period of economic trouble so please be aware that the above makes sense if we treat inflation as the only thing that changed   if inflation came about because opec makes oil crazy expensive millennials just stop working all of our factories got bombed to or trade wars have shut down international commerce then the value of stocks would most definitely be affected   in that case it 's not really inflation that affected the stock returns though

i can but it takes a significant amount of time    i 'll do a short version which might leave more holes than you like basically traders do n't want to barter because it is hard to find the person with precisely the goods you want who wants to trade for the goods you have thus the need for coupons that represent value in a marketplace then you need to decide who gets to create coupons if too many can issue them problems arise and no one trusts the coupons will be good later eventually you want one large bank nation trader to be able to issue them so everyone has the same level of trust in them and you do n't have the economic inefficiencies of many coupon issuers   next the number of coupons needs to be enough to facilitate trade if the amount of trade increases a lot and the number of coupons does n't increase similarly they become worth more and people start to hoard them this causes deflation which causes less investment which causes less growth which hurts everyone in the long run    if there are too many coupons added this causes inflation which causes people to spent them quicker instead of holding them for reasons i wo n't cover here slight predictable inflation is much better than deflation so remember inflation is slightly preferred note that inflation is often caused not by the number of coupons but by external price changes   now for a modern economy to do well has to watch the economy measure it carefully and add subtract coupons into the system as needed coupons like all money have no real value whatever that means but only have value because the holder expects to be able to trade them later for goods and services you can not eat coupons use them for shelter usually or wear them but you want to trade them for such needs the same is true for paper money gold stones or almost whatever money system one uses money in all these forms is merely an iou tradable for future goods   the fed is tasked among other things with making sure there is precisely enough coupons in the economy to keep trade functioning as well as possible this is very hard to do since there are external and internal shocks to an economy think disaster foreign shutting off resources rapid changes in people 's tastes etc    central banks such as the fed need to be independent of political control since empirical evidence has shown that politicians tend to add more money to the system than is needed because the short term gains give them votes but the long term consequences rapid inflation unemployment lower economic growth are bad for society this is why the fed is largely out of congressional control and large amounts of empirical evidence across hundreds of years and dozens of cultures shows this to be good   note another function of the fed is to be a lender of last resort to help prevent bank panics that were widespread in the 18th and early 19th century something that none of us now remember but it was a real problem i 'll skip that part for now   so now we 're at the point where the fed needs to add subtract coupons from society to do this part justice takes significant time to cover all the reasons why various rules are in place banking reserve requirements for example and you can not learn it from one pass of reading   but i 'll try instead of being like the majority of internet fools that rail against the system try to learn the why of all this and you 'll be much wiser and understand that it is all a pretty good system   one method they use is the interbank lending rate banks have a reserve requirement which is the ratio of coupons they need to have on hand as a ratio compared to the total coupons depositors lent them this is usually around 1:10 the amount deposited that they can lend goes to business loans school loans mortgage loans etc and helps economies grow now when a bank on a given day falls short due to too many withdrawals other banks or the fed offers an overnight loan to meet reserve requirements and the fed sets the interest rate which in turn drives other interest rates in the system   this does not change the money supply very much   secondly the fed sets the reserve requirement which vastly can change the amount of money available to society but they change this rate so rarely all the historical data is on the st. fed site among others that it is not usually an issue i 'll explain below how this can drastically change the money supply though the money multiplier   thirdly and this is the part the poster above seems upset about they conduct open market operations this is the primary means by which the fed exercises control over the number of coupons in play the government like businesses like individuals often needs to borrow money in theory to invest in wise causes like infrastructure or perhaps money making enterprises such as technology and i know what they often use the money for causes many to complain the government like companies offers the sale of various contracts such as bonds to investors who want a place to park some accumulated coupons for safety and they get a return plus some interest so the government sells bonds on the open market to investors banks pensions foreign governments basically to whomever wishes to purchase them at the market rate and the government like many individuals and banks uses these loans to perform day to day functioning and possible smooth out volatility in spending needs by law the fed can not purchase directly from treasury now once on the market these bonds are traded packaged resold etc since they have inherent value and since those owning them want to buy sell them perhaps before maturity date this liquidity ability to sell your goods is necessary fewer would purchase an item if they could not sell it when they desire thus bonds are bought sold and traded and their prices fluctuate based on what the market thinks they are worth just like any good   now the fed can buy sell these bonds on the open market like anyone else so when the fed wishes to increase the money supply they can buy bonds that are not spendable money and inject money into the system note they now hold a bond that had at the time of transaction the same value as the money they injected note investors freely bought these from treasury meaning the market thought at the time of purchase that this was a good it is not the government merely wishing more money into it is market forces that require more money for trades and is selling goods from the marketplace of presumably equal value to the fed this increases liquidity but takes valuable assets from circulation when the fed wishes to shrink the money supply they sell these bonds back into circulation basically by offering better terms than treasury in fact you can find graphs of the fed operations and see how every december they inject money for more christmas need more coupons for more trade and every january they extract some   so open market transactions buying and selling goods at market prices in the marketplace along with other traders is how the fed injects and removes money from the money supply this is the primary mechanism that the fed uses to control the number of coupons in the economy   finally a little about reserve requirements and the money multiplier since it affects so much of the number of coupons in play this also i must simplify drastically each bank needs to hold 1/10 of all deposits in cash the rest can be lent which lands in another bank which again can be lent etc thus each $ 1 deposited can result in loans totalling 9/10 + + + = 9 more dollars many people claim that banks are printing money which is nonsense since each also has an equal debt to pay to the person they borrowed from when all loans are paid back there is no net money gain   however this allows for each $ 1 the fed injects by buying bonds for there to be up to $ 9 in the economy if banks all loan to the fullest banks tend to want to loan since loaned money makes them profit banks used to loan too much and runs on the banks caused significant problems which is why laws were made to require all banks to have the same reserve requirement   now when banks get scared and stop loaning this 9 fold multiplier dries up and the fed has much less on being able to target the proper number of coupons to keep the economy smooth during the recent crash when banks stopped loaning as each dollar was paid back on debts there was significant of available money for transactions and this kills the economy this is the liquidity crisis    hope this helps as i said this is vastly simplified and i can not go into all the reasons and historical items needed to understand it fully it is a vastly complex and necessarily so and takes significant study to grasp the genius of it it 's similar to not being able to understand nuances of particle physics in one go but as you study and work at it you see why things go as they do and you learn all the failed methods the gold standard is one example that were thrown out for many good reasons   cheers

this is a great question considering that all of your expenses including maintenance etc are paid by a tenant your cash flow is $ 0 most people would stop and assume your investment is not performing and your only chance at making money is through appreciation your question eliminates appreciation so here are the returns you would get on your investment the math will probably surprise many that you are actually earning a return on your money    annual return = future per of periods   = $   as chris rea commented the that some would miss is that while income covers expenses exactly embedded in the expenses is actually a repayment of the loan principal and technically that 's not an expense so not all of the income is lost covering the expenses that repayment of principal portion of the rental income constitutes the return on the original capital invested

past results are not a predictor of future results there is no explicit upper bound on a market and even if individual companies values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term plus there 's been some   shift from managing companies for dividends to managing stocks for growth which will tend to increase the upward push trying to time the market to guess when it 's going to move in any particular direction is usually closer to gambling than investing the simplest answer remains a combination of buy and hold and dollar cost averaging buy at a constant number of dollars per month or whatever frequency you prefer and you will automatically buy more when the stock fund is lower less when it is higher that takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end personally i add a bit of contrarian buying to that i increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed since i had money i would n't need any time soon buy and hold and i was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that i was n't at significant risk of losing the investment that 's one of the things which causes me to be categorized as an aggressive investor even though i 'm operating with a very vanilla mix of mutual funds and not attempting to micromanage my money my goal is to have the money work for me not vice versa

it 's important to remember that upward trending things spend the vast majority of their time at all time highs intelligent well meaning people have been regularly saying the dow jones has been too expensive since about 2010 often because it was now at all time highs    sitting on the sidelines can end up just as expensive if not more so than avoiding big drops if you are worried about a large down swing straight after investing just drip it in over a period you feel comfortable with no one can really answer this better than that without more info on your risk tolerance and exactly what you want to invest in   worth noting that buying anything other than transaction free funds when split into small transactions also adds a lot more fees entry and exit in a uk isa for example split these over 12 months say and it will cost you £ 240 straight out of the gate 2 fund purchases per month for 12 months each and another £ 240 to exit before any holding fees from the isa platform that 's over 1 of your capital gone just to your stockbroker employing this strategy   both the products you mention are also quite high cost in ongoing charges so unless you have very high convictions about the management quality will also probably lag cheaper investment types over the long run as well due to the dire performance of virtually all higher cost active management over time

short answer liquidity well you have to see it from an exchange 's point of view   every contract they put up is a liability to them   you have to allocate resources for the order book the matching engine the clearing etc   but only if the contract is actually trading they start earning the big money now for every new expiry they engage a long term commitment and it might take years for an option chain to be widely accepted and hence before they 're profitable   compare the volumes and open interests of big chains versus the weeklies and you 'll find that weeklies can still be considered illiquid compared to their monthly cousins having said that like many things this is just a question of demand   if there 's a strong urge to trade july weeklies one day there will be an option chain   but personally i think as long as there are the summer there will be no rush to ask for jul and aug chains

excellent questions   asking such questions indicates something special about yourself   the desire to learn and adjust your beliefs will increase your chance of success in your life   i would use a wide variety of authors to increase your education   myself i prefer dave ramsey to clark howard but i think clark is very good the first thing you should focus on is learning how to do and live by a budget   often times adults will assume that you are on a budget because you are broke   it happens with my friends and my youngest child is older than you   nothing could be further from the truth   a budget is simply a plan on how you will spend your income so you do n't run out of money before you run out of month along with budgeting i would also focus on goal setting   this is the type of investing you should be doing at your age   for example if your primary goal was to become an engineer my recommendation is to hold off buying stocks mutual funds and using your current income to get through school with little or no student loans    another example might be to open your own hvac business   your best bet might be to learn the trade working for someone else and take night classes for business management most 18 year olds have very little earning power   your focus at this point should be increasing your income and learning how to manage the income you have    please keep in mind that most debt is bad   it robs you of your income which is your greatest wealth building tool   car loans and credit card debt is just plain stupid   often times a business case can be made for reasonable student loans   however why not challenge yourself to take none   how much further ahead could you be if you graduate with a degree when your peers are strapped with a 40 k loan keep up the good work and keep asking questions

this is probably exactly how this type of thing developed in the first place    it 's a relatively recent last 30 40 years accounting concept and was only really developed because like you said someone somewhere said wait a minute let 's break this down economically also the larger the company and more divisions more parts more countries varying tax codes etc the exponentially more complex this stuff gets   one example that comes to mind verizon 's back haul division operates at a huge loss because they charge so little to the cell division for line usage the cell division makes 100 of the companies profits although is technically a 40 minority shareholder which really complicates things because it 's costs are so low if verizon spun off the back haul division however the cell division would make a lot less    most likely verizon wants to lose money on back haul operations as it gives them political leverage pipes are full we need subsidies just thought you might find it interesting

in india the only way to short a stock is using f&o which i personally find to be sufficient for any shorting needs however futures can be generally sold for upto 3 months but options have more choices which are even upto 5 years you can buy a put of a longer duration and when you want to do buy back you can directly sell the same option by off the trade before expiry date you generally get approximately the same profit as shorting but you get to limit your risk

in the united states regulation of broker dealer credit is dictated by regulation t that for a non margin account 100 of a trade must be funded finra has supplemented that regulation with an rider rule rule which reads no member shall permit a customer other than a broker dealer or a designated      account to make a practice directly or indirectly of effecting transactions in a cash      account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities      no member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a      cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker dealer where      such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for a member transferring an      account which is subject to a regulation t 90-day freeze to another member firm shall      inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze it is only funds from sold equities that are prohibited from being used to purchase securities this means that an equity in one 's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds   once the amount required to purchase is in excess of the amount of settled funds no more purchases can be made so an equity sold by an account with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with the settled funds so long as the settled funds can fund the purchase margin a closed position is not considered a long or short since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss respectively thus to the market only to the creditworthiness of the clearing settling chain only open positions are considered longs or shorts a long being a possession of a security and a short being a liability because they are exposed to the market since unsettled funds are not considered longs or shorts they are not by previous trades thus only the reg t rules apply to new and current positions cash vs margin a cash account can not purchase with unsettled funds   a margin account can   this means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds   a cash account 's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds so once those are exhausted no more purchases can be made the opposite is true for cash accounts as well   unsettled securities can not be sold either in summation unsettled assets can not be traded in a cash account

the answer to your question is no unless you specifically ask to receive paper share certificates then brokers will hold your shares with a custodian company in the broker 's own nominee account   if you are able to receive paper certificates then the registrar of the company whose shares you own will have a record of your name however this is exceptionally rare these days   using a stockbroker means that your shares will be held in the broker 's nominee account a nominee company is a custodian charged with the safekeeping of securities it should be a separate entity from the broker itself in essence the nominee is the legal owner of the securities while you retain actual ownership as the beneficiary your broker can move and sell the securities on your behalf and gets to handle all the lovely paperwork but the assets still belong to you they ca n’t be claimed by the broker ’s creditors if things get messy the main reason for this kind of set up is cost and this is why brokers are able to offer relatively low dealing costs to their clients you can if you wish ask your broker for an account that deals with paper share certificates however few brokers will offer such an account and it will mean that you incur much higher dealing costs and may mean that you can not sell you shares without first submitting the paper certificates back to your stock broker    note that the stock exchange plays no role in recording ownership   nor does your broker 's account with the clearing house

so first good job on making a thorough checklist of things to look into and onto your questions is this a worthwhile process even independent of specific investing goals learning how to research is valuable if you decided to forgo investing in stocks directly and chose to only invest in index funds the same type of research skills would be useful not to mention that such discipline would come in handy in other fields as well what other 80/20 low hanging fruit knowledge have i missed while it may not count as low hanging fruit one thing that stands out to me is there 's no mention of what competition a company has in its field for example a company may be doing well today but you may see signs that it 's consistently losing ground to its competition while that alone may not dissuade you from investing it may give you something to consider   is what i 've got so far any good or am i totally missing the point your cheat sheet seems pretty good to me but a lot depends on what your goals are if you 're doing this solely for your education and experience i would say you 've done well if you 're looking to invest in a company that is involved in a field you 're passionate about you 're on the right track but you should probably consider expanding your cheat sheet to include things that are not low hanging fruit but still matter to you   however i 'd echo the comments that have already been made and suggest that if this is for retirement investments take the skills you 've developed in creating your cheat sheet and apply that work towards finding a set of index funds that meet your criteria   otherwise happy hunting

the forward curve for gold says little in my opinion about the expected price of gold the jan 16 price is 7.9 or so higher than the jan 12 price this reflects the current cost of money today 's low interest rates when the short rates were 5 the price 4 years out would be about 20 higher no magic there the site you linked to was in german so i looked and left i 'm certain if you pulled up the curve for platinum or silver it would have the identical shape that 7.9 rise over 4 years the yield curve on the other hand   is said to provide an indication of the direction of the economy a steep curve forecasting positive growth

the ponzi madoff schemes were closed loops so the only source of the so called interest on the money was the contributions of future investors the economy is more like a living thing and the availability of capital allows people to develop new ways to do things in a more productive way agriculture is a great example for most of human history the overwhelming majority of human labor was dedicated to producing food now that proportion is dramatically smaller the descendants of farmers 100 years ago are doctors and computer programmers professions that could not exist fractional reserve banking makes the economy more efficient by putting capital that would otherwise be hoarded in circulation money is a medium of exchange so the more it turns over the better it is and britain pioneered this concept centuries ago and were able to defeat larger rivals in large part because of the economic advantages that the practice brought to bear   that 's not to say that banking does n't come with its as well i 'd suggest reading a free nation deep in debt which does a good job of explaining how we got to where we are today

there could be a number of reasons the price hit your number $ but by the time your order hit the market the price had gone up perhaps the stock went up between when you placed the stop loss and when the order was executed a trailing stop loss will ratchet up very simply the trailing stop maintains a stop loss order at a precise percentage below the market price or above in the case of a short position the stop loss order is adjusted continually based on fluctuations in the market price always maintaining the same percentage below or above the market price

if the crash you worry about is a dissolution of the euro then the main thing you should concern yourself with is liquidity   for that purchase the most highly liquid gold etf or futures contract whichever is more appropriate for the total amount of money involved   any other way and you will lose a significant chunk of your assets to transaction costs if on the other hand the crash you were concerned about were the total collapse of the world economy and people around the world abandon all paper currencies and resort to barter as a method of trade then i can see buying several small pieces being a rational strategy although then i would also question whether you were a sane individual

you own a fractional share of the company maybe you should care enough to at least read the proxy statements which explain the pro and con position for each of the issues you are voting on that does n't seem like too much to ask on the other hand if you are saying that the people who get paid to be knowledgeable about that stuff should just go make the decisions without troubling you with the details then choose the option to go with their recommendations which are always clearly indicated on the voting form however if you do this it might make sense to at least do some investigation of who you are voting onto that board i guess as said you could just abstain but i 'm not sure how that is any different than just trashing the form as for the idea that proxy votes are tainted somehow the one missing piece of that conspiracy is what those people have to gain are you implying that your broker who has an interest in you making money off your investments and liking them would fraudulently cast proxy votes for you in a way that would harm the company and your return why exactly would they do this i find your stance on the whole thing a bit confusing though you seem to have some strong opinions on corporate governance but at the same time are n't willing to invest any effort in the one place you have any control over the situation i 'm just update per the following information from the sec website it looks like the meaning of a proxy vote can vary depending on the mechanics of the specific issue you are voting on my emphasis added what do for against withhold mean on the proxy card or voter instruction form    depending on what you are voting on    the proxy card or voting instruction    form gives you a choice of voting    for against or abstain or    for or withhold here is an    explanation of the differences election of directors generally    company bylaws or other corporate    documents establish how directors are    elected there are two main types of    ways to elect directors    vote and majority vote a vote means that the    winning candidate only needs to get    more votes than a competing candidate    if a director runs he or    she only needs one vote to be elected    so an against vote is meaningless    because of this shareholders have the    option to express with    a candidate by indicating that they    wish to withhold authority to vote    their shares in favor of the    candidate a substantial number of    withhold votes will not prevent a    candidate from getting elected but it    can sometimes influence future    decisions by the board of directors    concerning director nominees a majority vote means that directors    are elected only if they receive a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this case    you have the choice of voting for    each nominee against each nominee    or you can abstain from voting your    shares an abstain vote may or may    not affect a director 's election each    company must disclose how abstain or    withhold votes affect an election in    its proxy statement this information    is often found toward the beginning of    the proxy statement under a heading    such as votes required to adopt a    proposal or how your votes are    counted proposals other than an election of    directors matters other than voting    on the election of directors like    voting on shareholder proposals are    typically approved by a vote of a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this    situation you are usually given the    choice to vote your shares for or    against a proposal or to abstain    from voting on it again the effect    of an abstain vote may depend on the    specific voting rule that applies the    company 's proxy statement should again    disclose the effect of an abstain    vote

the financially best choice depends on which has a lower interest rate and what your other debts are if you have significant other debts with a higher interest rate it may make good sense to sign up for the longer term loan and use your extra money to pay those down first   then pay down your mortgage with large payments if you do n't have significant other debts then it is likely a good idea to take a shorter term loan because those tend to have lower interest rates in either case remember that the required loan payments are the minimum payments   you can always pay more and in many cases you should   the objective here is to pay as little interest over the course of your life as is feasible i do n't think it makes too much sense to gamble on whether or not interest rates will rise in the future   they may or may not over the life of your loan and you are not in a position to know which   they are low now so they can be compared to your existing loans   that is enough information to make rational decisions today

there are a couple of misconceptions i think are present here firstly when people say interest usually that implies a lower risk investment like a government bond or a money market fund some interest earning investments can be higher risk like junk bonds offered by near bankrupt companies but for the most part stocks are higher risk with higher risk comes higher reward but obviously also the chance for a bad year a bad year can mean your fund actually goes down in value because the companies you are invested in do poorly so calling all value increases interest is not the correct way to think about things secondly remember that roth ira fund does n't really tell you what 's inside it you could set up your fund to include only low risk interest earning investments or higher risk foreign stocks from what you 've said your fund is a target retirement date type fund this typically means that it is a mix of stocks and bonds weighted higher to bonds if you are older on the theory of minimizing risk near retirement and higher to stocks if you are younger on the theory of accepting risk for higher average returns when you have time to overcome losses what this means is that assuming you 're young and the fund you have is typical you probably have of your money invested in stocks stocks do n't pay interest they give you value in two ways they pay you dividends and the companies that they are a share of increase in value remember that a stock is literally a small ownership of the company so the value increase you see as the increase due to the increase in the mutual fund 's share price is part of the total interest amount you were expecting finally if you are reading about standard growth of an account using a given amount of contributions someone somewhere is making an assumption about how much growth actually happens either you entered a number in the calculator how much do you expect growth to be per year or it made an assumption by default probably something like 7 growth per year i have n't checked the math on your number to see what the growth rate they used was these types of assumptions can be helpful for general retirement planning but they are not rules that your investments are required by law to follow if you invest in something with risk your return may be less than expected

the problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow if we want to apply this approach to short selling we should look at the trade from another perspective we buy money and pay for this money with stock our investment to buy 50 $ in your example is 1 share   when closing the short position we effectively sell back our money 50 $ and receive 2 shares our profit on this position is obviously 1 share setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100    in reality we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share this is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit

i just want to point out something that seems to be generally true if you are supposed to report something to the irs and you do n't the irs will probably send you a letter assuming the maximum possible tax liability and it 's up to you to prove that scenario is incorrect in your case you obviously owe no tax but since you did n't report it the irs simply assumed that you do owe tax until you prove otherwise you 're one form away from fixing the issue i have first hand experience that this is also true if you forget to report an hsa distribution i received a letter considering my entire distribution as if it was for non eligible medical expenses this made the amount taxable and had an additional 20 penalty to boot of course i have medical receipts for all of the distributions which makes them not taxable and had i simply put the correct number on my return to begin with i would n't have had to fill out the additional form to correct my mistake

well to put things simply the government debt level has to do with the money spent by government vs the revenue the government collects the only tenuous connection between the stock market price and the capital gains tax collected at the end of the year granted there should be an increase in the cgt it would be on the actual transactions made that incurred in capital gains that is at best a drop in the bucket which trump by the way wants to reduce since over a year 100 of the shares are not exchanged this would not be even remotely close to the increase in stock market value    the government simply us no ownership over the stock market value the stock market also does not count into gdp so you could n’t use that to say your debt to gdp ratio declined    they are just so unrelated that it ’s senseless to link them

what if everyone decided to sell all the shares at a given moment let 's say when the stock is trading at $ 40 it would fall to the lowest bid price which could be $ 0.01 if someone had that bid in place here is an example which i happened to find online   notice there are orders to buy at half the market price and lower probably all the way down to pennies   if there were enough selling activity to fill all of those bids you see then the market price would be the lowest bid on the screen   alternatively the bid orders could be pulled cancelled which would also let the price free fall to the lowest bid even if there were few actual sellers bid stuffing is what hft high frequency trading algorithms sometimes do which some say caused the flash crash of may 2010   the computers stuff bids into the order book making it look like there is demand in order to trigger a market reaction then they pull the bids to make the market fall   this sort of thing happens all the time and nanex documents it quote stuffing defined i remember the day of the flash crash very well   i found this video on youtube of cnbc at that time   watch from the min mark on the video as jim talks about pg easily not being worth the price of the market at that time   he said who cares its not a real price $ bid for 50,000 shares if i were at my hedge fund   you can value a stock how you want but its only actually worth what someone will give you for it more examples petroleum which as we noted in today 's eod post lost $ 45 billion in market cap in 45 milliseconds a collapse rate of $ 1 billion per millisecond flash crashing from $ 90 all the way to an allegedly illegal stub quote of $ 0.01 how 10,000 contracts crashed the market a visual of last night 's e mini flash crash symantec flash crash destroys over $ 1.5 billion in less than a second this sort of thing happens so often i do n't pay much attention anymore

option a you sell the house and then use the money to pay off a portion of your second mortgage the return on that investment is 5.5 a year or $ 1925 net option b you rent it out that will bring   you $ 435 x 12 more than 2.5 times option a. that 's not counting any money going towards the principal of the loan given that you 'll be using a property management company you can be fairly certain that there wo n't be any unexpected expenses credit check security deposit should take care of that option c you invest the money somewhere else you 'll have to get 15 return in order to beat option b. i do n't think that 's sustainable   you should talk to a cpa about the tax implications but i 'm fairly certain that you 'll do better tax wise to rent it out since you can use depreciation to lower your tax bill   finally where do you think real estate prices will be in 4 years if you think they 'll increase that 's another reason to hold onto the property and rent it   finally finally if you plan to rent it out long term over 4 years it will be a good idea to refinance and lock the current interest rate

assuming that taxes were withheld when you received the options you would now only owe tax on the profit from the sale of the stock   the cost basis would be whatever you bought the stock for the strike price of the options in this case and the profit will be the total amount received from the sale minus the total cost of those shares since you bought the stock more than one year ago you will get taxed at the long term capital gains rate of 15 unless you are in the 39.6 tax bracket in which case the rate is 20 as with all tax advice on this site you need to check with a tax specialist when you actually file but that should give you a rough indication of what your tax liability is

depending on jurisdiction the fact that you made some payments might give you an ownership share in the house in your own right what share would be a complex question because you might need to consider both the mortgage payments made and maintenance your sister might also be able to argue that she was entitled to some for the risk she describes of co signing and that 's something that would be very hard to quantify but clearly you would also be entitled to similar in respect of that as you also co signed for the share your mother owned the normal rules of inheritance apply and by default that would be a 50 50 split as joetaxpayer said you imply that the loan is still outstanding so all of this only applies to the equity previously built up in the house prior to your mother 's death if you are the only one making the ongoing payments i would expect any further equity built up to belong solely to you but again the jurisdiction and the fact that your sister 's name is on the deeds could affect this if you ca n't resolve this you might need to get a court involved and it 's possible that the cost of doing so would outweigh the eventual benefit to you

while from a money saving standpoint the obviously right course of action is to make only the minimum payment on the 0 loan there are potentially legal reasons to try to pay off a car loan early with a mortgage you are the legal owner of the property and any action by the lender beyond imposing fees e.g. foreclosure requires going through the proper legal channels on the other hand in most jurisdictions you are not the legal owner of a car purchased on a loan and a missed or even lost payment can result in repossession without the lender even having to go to court so from a risk aversion standpoint there 's something to be said for getting rid of car loans as soon as you can

for this to work those who control the dilution must also control their salaries because the only way for them to be paid off when it 's the corporation itself selling is to gain access to the proceeds when a corporation sells newly issued equity the corporation itself owns the money   to at least have the appearance of the scammers must be paid those proceeds   both actions imply that the board is captured by the scammers there are many corporations that seem to do this even with persistently large market the key difference between this and pump and dump is that its a fraudulent group of investors selling in this case instead of the corporation itself a detailed simple example corporations are mandated by law to be little although republic is now becoming more appropriate with all of the new shareholder rights   a corporation is controlled at root by the board of directors who are elected by the shareholders   the board has no direct operational control as that is left to the king the ceo however the board does control what everyone wants access to the money board members have all sorts of legal qualitative mandates on how to behave and they 've fairly decently efficiently over the long run but there are definitely some bad apples boards are somewhat since it 's difficult to hold board elections and usually only specific board members are put up for election by a shareholder vote so a bad one has the potential to really get stuck in there   once a bad one is in there they do n't care because they know it will be tough to get them out so they run over the company 's purse only the board can take action on major funding such as the ceo 's operating budget board compensation financing investment etc some with shareholder approval some without   the corporation itself owns all of those assets but the board controls them in this example they scheme with most likely the top executive but a rubber stamp top executive could allow a lower rung to scheme with the board but the board is always constant until the law is changed because there 's no honor amongst thieves the board votes which can require some combination of executive and shareholder approval are taken very close together sell shares increase salaries to key executive increase board compensation   the trusting shareholders believe this is in the best interests of the company at large so go along so the money flows from existing new shareholders to the corporation now controlled by a malicious board and then finally to the necessary malicious executive and the vital malicious board

i would always presume that given a choice of doing what is in its own self interest verses in the customer 's interest a bank will always do the former rather than the latter banks are in the business of making money always presume that their policies processes and contractual terms will be slanted to maximize their ability to make money   it 's not being evil or anything it 's just business they are under no obligation to be altruistic or do what 's best for you at the expense of their profits so especially since it 's not exactly a hardship i would always make extra principal payments using a separate check and clearly mark it as an extra principal payment

limited price is probably equivalent to the current par value of a limit order markets move fast and if the commodity is seeing some volatility in the buy and sell prices if you place an ordinary buy order you may not get the price you were quoted a limit order tells your broker or whomever or whatever is making the order on your behalf that you will pay no more than x yuan while the market is below that price the trader will attempt to get you the quantity you want but if they ca n't get you your full order for an average price less than the limit the whole thing is rolled back you can set a limit at any price but a limit order of 1 yuan for a pound of sterling silver will likely never be executed as long as the market itself is functioning so you are being provided with a par value that they can guarantee will be executed in the current market prices are probably prices offered to the managers of trust funds a trust is simply a set of securities and/or cash which is placed under the nominal control of a third party who then must in good faith attempt to fulfill the goals of the actual owner of the securities with regards to growth or retention of value trustees almost never speculate with the money they control but when they do move money it 's often a chunk hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars instead of a few thousand dollars here and there so in return for the long term holdings large buys and sells and thus the reduced cost of maintaining a business relationship with the broker the broker may offer better prices to trust fund managers

does the 457(b plan allow for the rollover of other retirement funds into it and do you have very specific reasons for wanting to roll over your sep ira into the 457(b plan instead of into some other ira plan with a different custodian for example if you already have a traditional ira is there any reason why your sep ira should not be rolled over into the traditional ira with regard to the question about separate accounts once upon a time rolling over money from an employment retirement plan e.g. 401k into a traditional ira required establishing a separate account called a rollover traditional ira so that the rolled over money and the earnings were not commingled with standard traditional ira money resulting from personal contributions this was so that the account owner had the option of rolling over the separately kept money into a new employer 's retirement plan if such a rollover was permitted by the new 401k plan if one did not want to ever roll over money into a new employer plan one had to write a letter to the custodian telling them that commingling was ok you never wanted to put that money into another 401k plan the law changed some time later and the concept of rollover iras holding non commingled funds has disappeared   with that as my answer to your question is that perhaps the law did not change with respect to 457(b plans and so the money that you want to rollover into the 457(b plan needs to be kept separate and not commingled with your contributions via payroll deduction to the 457(b plan in case you want to ever roll over the sep ira money into another sep ira hence separate accounts are needed one to hold your sep ira money and one to hold your contributions via payroll deductions

here is a deliberately simple example of dollar cost averaging day 1 buy 100 shares at $ 10 total value = $ 1,000 average cost per share = $ easy day 2 buy 100 more shares at $ 9 total value = $ 1,900 average cost per share = $ notice how your average cost per share went from $ 10.00 to $ 9.50 now instead of hoping the stock rises above $ 10.00 a share to make a profit you only need it to go to $ 9.50 a share assuming no commissions or transaction fees it 's easy to see how this could work to your advantage the only catch is that you need buy more of a stock that is dropping people might think you 're crazy this could easily backfire if the stock continues to drop

gt;well first off the roads are more than just hobbies they really do go places a lot of the roads in my area would be unprofitable and people live down those roads what happens when a company decides that road is too expensive to maintain but decides to keep ownership the people have to move   yes if people want to live out somewhere that is inefficient other people who do not choose to live there should n't have to subsidize them i say this having grown up 17 miles from the nearest town in a completely rural environment   gt;it does n't have to but it 's unrealistic to expect that they wo n't take a profit from it but do you really think that if a company has a monopoly they 're going to charge you the bare minimum they can if you have no choice but to pay tolls or for driving passes for certain cities and you can only get them from a single company what motivation does that company have to keep them affordable and readily available they 're going to do like any company would and find that point of maximum profitability between cost of permit and number of permits   is this not a similar situation we currently have with electricity trash and various other pieces of our infrastructure people are not being because there is some level of regulation which is necessary for a functional society i 'm not necessarily advocating a completely free market as monopolies are dangerous i just think the government 's role is to big   gt;then there 's the whole reality that you will still pay for roads you do n't use if one company owns multiple roads they 're going to charge you enough money to expand roads to fix up other dilapidated roads etc more profitable roads will be used to offset less profitable roads etc basically if there 's a new neighborhood and they build a road to it if you 've been paying that company they 're using your money to build that road   not really i 'm paying to use a certain stretch of road right now what the company chooses to do with that money is their issue

day trading is an attempt to profit on high frequency signal changes long term investing profits on low frequency changes what is the difference high frequency signal = the news of the day this includes things like an earnings report coming out panic selling jim cramer pushing his buy buy buy button an oil rig blowing up in the ocean a terrorist attack in some remote region of the globe a government mandated recall the fed announcing an interest rate hike a competitor announcing a new product hurricanes cold winters a new health study on child obesity some other company in the same sector missing their earnings etc think daily red and green on cnbc up a buck down a buck low frequency signal = the long term effectiveness of a company to produce and sell a product efficiently plus the sum of the high frequency signal over a long period of time think 200 day moving average chart of a stock no fast changes just long term trends over time the high frequency changes tend to negate each other to me long term investing is wiser because the low frequency signal is dominated by a companies ability to function well over time that in turn is driven by the effectiveness of its leadership coupled with the skill and motivation of its employees you are betting on the company and its people pseudo random forces which you ca n't control play less of a role   the high frequency signal on the other hand is dominated by and unpredictable forces that typically ca n't be controlled by the company it has some of randomness about it trying to invest on that random component is not investing at all it is gambling akin to investing in that next coin flip coming up heads i understand the allure of high frequency trading look at the daily chart of a popular stock and focus on the up and down ticks mathematically you could make a killing if you could just stack all those on top of each other if only it was that easy

i do n't want to get involved in trading chasing immediate profit   that is the best part there is an answer in the other question where a guy only invested in small amounts and had a big sum by the time he retired there is good logic in the answer if you put in lump sum in a single stroke you will get at a single price but if you distribute it over a time you will get opportunities to buy at favorable prices because that is an inherent behavior of stocks they inherently go up and down do n't remain stable stock markets are for everybody rich or poor as long as you have money does n't matter in millions or hundreds to invest and you select stocks with proper research and with a long term view investment should always start in small amounts before you graduate to investing in bigger amounts gives you ample time to learn where do i go to do this   to a bank to the company most probably a brokerage firm any place to your liking check how much they charge for brokerage annual charges and what all services they provide compare them online on what services you require not what they provide ask friends and colleagues and get their opinions it is better to get firsthand knowledge about the products can the company i 'm investing to be abroad at the moment stay away from it unless you are sure about it because you are starting can try buying adrs like in us this is an option in uk but they come with inherent risk how much do you know about the country where the company does its business will i be subject to some fees i must care about after i buy a stock yes capital gains tax will be levied and stamp duties and all

similarly to buying property on your own reits can not get to good returns without leveraging if you buy an investment property 100 cash only chances are that 10 roi is a very very optimistic scenario if you use leveraging i.e. take out a mortgage you 're susceptible to interest rate changes reits invest in properties all around all the time they invest in mortgages themselves as well in the us that 's the only security reits can hold without being disqualified you ca n't expect all that to be cash only there have to be loans and financing involved when rates go up financing costs go up that brings net income down simple math in the us there 's an additional benefit to investing in reit vs directly holding real estate taxes reits pay dividends which have preferential if qualified taxation you 'll pay capital gains taxes on the dividends if you hold the fund long enough if you own a rental property directly your income after all the expenses is taxed at ordinary rates which would usually be higher also as you mentioned you can use them as margin and they 're much much more liquid than holding real estate directly not to mention you do n't need to deal with tenants or periods where you do n't have any or if local real estate market tanks while reits are usually quite diversified in kinds of real estate they hold and areas on the other hand if you own real estate you can leverage it at lower rates than margin with helocs etc and it provides some safety net in case of a stock market crash which reits are somewhat susceptible to you can also live in your property if needed which is something that 's hard to do with reits

you can ask your employer for anything that you want however most employers if they are contributing their own money into your hsa or you are contributing to your own hsa through payroll deduction only work with one hsa which is much easier for them to manage you are free to decline their hsa if you want   however if they are kicking in free money into your hsa i do n't recommend that you decline it   just pick the best option you have for investing as for the money that you are contributing if you do n't want to put your own money into your employer 's aetna hsa you can open up an hsa with any institution you like   you can even do this and still keep aetna hsa to take advantage of the employer 's contributions   however your annual limit is still the total of all contributions to all hsa 's in your name whether you make them or your employer makes them when deciding whether or not to use payroll deduction into the aetna hsa or to go your own way keep in mind that payroll deduction skips some payroll taxes

20 is almost certainly too high i agree with 2 as a very rough rule it will vary significantly depending on the industry i generally calculate an average of the previous 2 3 years working capital and deduct that from cash working capital is current assets less current liabilities current assets is comprised of cash prepaid expenses and significantly accounts receivable this means that ca is likely to be much higher than just cash which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted which reduces ev which makes the ev ebitda ratio look even more pricey as noted but a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter as such and because of seasonal effects it 's critical to smooth this by averaging several periods after calculating this for a few companies compare to revenue is it close to 2

it 's a statement that seems to be true about our tendency to believe we wo n't make the same mistake twice even though we do and that somehow what 's occurring in the present is completely different even when the underlying fundamentals of the situation may be nearly identical   it 's a form of self delusion and sometimes mass delusion and it has been a major contributing factor to many of our worst financial disasters if you look at every housing bubble for instance we examine the aftermath put new regulations and procedures into place theoretically to prevent it from happening again and then move forward   when the cycle starts to repeat itself we ignore the signals telling ourselves oh that ca n't happen again this time it 's different when investors begin to ignore the warning signs because they think the current situation is somehow totally different and therefore there will be a different outcome than the last disaster that 's when things actually do go bad the 2008 housing crisis was caused by the same essential forces that brought about similar albeit smaller scale housing disasters in the 80 's and 90 's greed caused banks and other participants in the housing sector to make loans they knew were no good an oversimplification to be sure but apt nonetheless and eventually the roof in on the market   in 2008 the essential dynamics were the same but everyone had convinced themselves that the markets were more sophisticated and could never allow things like that to happen again   so everyone told themselves this was different and they dove into the markets ignoring all of the warning signs along the way that clearly told the story of what was coming had anyone bothered to notice

the only way for a mutual fund to default is if it inflated the nav i.e. it reports that its investments worth more than they really are then in case of a run on the fund it may end up defaulting since it wo n't have the money to redeem shares at the nav it published when does it happen when the fund is mismanaged or is a scam this happened for example to the fund madoff was managing this is generally a sign of a ponzi scheme or embezzlement how can you ensure the funds you invest in are not affected by this you 'll have to read the fund reports check the independent auditors reports and check for clues generally this is the job of the sec that 's what they do as regulators but for smaller funds and private i.e. not public investment companies sec may not be posing too much regulations

i interned for about six months at a firm that employed a few technical analysts so i 'll try to provide what little information i can since the bulk of the intra day trading was decided technical analysts had two main functions this basically boils down to my answer to your question there are still enough people trading firms etc who believe in candlestick charting and other visually subjective patterns that if you notice a trend pattern etc before the majority of traders observing you may be able to time the market successfully and profit this is becoming increasingly dangerous however because of the steps i outlined above over time the charting patterns that have been proven effective often in many firms individually since the algorithms are all proprietary are incorporated into computer algorithms so the traders you 're competing with to see the pattern are increasingly low latency computer less than a few blocks from the exchange summary candlestick charting along with other forms of subjective technical analysis has its believers and assuming enough of these believers trade the standard strategies based on the standard patterns one could conceivably time the market with enough skill to anticipate these traders acting on the pattern and therefore profit however the marginal benefits of doing so are decreasing rapidly as computers take over more trading responsibility   caveats   i know you 're in australia where the market penetration of hf algo traders is n't as high as in the us so it might be a few more years before the marginal benefits cease to be profitable that being said if various forms of technical analysis proved wildly profitable in australia above and beyond profits available in other markets rest assured that large american or british trading firms would already have moved in   my experience is limited to one trading firm so i certainly ca n't speak for the industry as a whole i know i did n't address candlestick charts specifically but since they 're only one piece of visual technical analysis i tried to address the issue as a whole   this somewhat ties into the debate between fundamental or technical analysis which i wo n't get into investopedia has a short article on the subject as i said i wo n't get into this because while it 's a nice debate for small traders at large trading firms they do n't care they want to make profit and any strategy that can be vetted whether it 's fundamental technical or will be vetted   i want to add more information to my answer to clear up some of the misconceptions in the comments including those talking about biased studies and a lack of evidence for or against technical analysis and candlestick charts i 'll explore this relationship further down   it 's important to keep in mind that charting methods including candlestick charts are visually subjective ways of representing data and that any interpretations drawn from such charts should ideally represent objective technical indicators a charting method is only as good as the indicators it 's used to represent therefore an analysis of the underlying indicators provides a suitable analysis for the visual medium in which they 're presented   one important study that evaluates several of these indicators is foundations of technical analysis computational algorithms statistical inference and empirical implementation by lo and lest anyone accuse its authors of bias i should point out that not only is it published by the national bureau of economic research a highly reputable organization within economics and finance but also that the majority of its authors come from mit 's sloan school which holds a reputation second to none this study finds that several technical indicators e.g. head and shoulder double bottom and various rectangle techniques do provide marginal value they also find that although   human judgment is still superior to most computational algorithms in the area of visual pattern recognition technical analysis can be improved by using automated algorithms since this paper was published in 2000 computing power and statistical analysis have gained significant ground against human ability to identify and exploit for visual pattern detection like candlestick charts   second i suggest you look into david 's book evidence based technical analysis applying the scientific method and statistical inference to trading signals he finds similar results to the lo et al paper in that some technical indicators do add value to the investment process but those that do are those that can be represented mathematically and thus programmed directly into trading algorithms thus bypassing visual tools like candlestick charts   he describes how studies including lo et al have found that head and shoulders patterns are worse than random i.e. you would earn higher returns if you simply traded at random that point is worth than repeating if a day trader is using a candlestick chart and using head and shoulders patterns as part of their he 's rolling the dice when he uses that pattern and returns that come from its application come from chance this reminds me of that old story about a company that sends out predicting the results of sports games complete with strategies and data to back up the predictions the company sends out several versions of the every game each predicting a different winner given a large enough sample size by the end of the season there are a few people who have received a that accurately predicted the winner for every game and they 're convinced the system is perfect the others were n't so lucky however relying on candlestick charts and ta patterns that are from the pre computerized era is reassuring to some traders and gives them a sense of control and beating the market but how long will chance remain on your side this is why i maintain that visual tools like candlestick charts are a slowly dying medium they certainly still add value to some trading firms which is why bloomberg terminals still ship with this functionality built in but as more and more research shows automated algorithms and statistical indicators can provide more value it 's also important to think about whether the majority of the value added by visual tools like candlestick charts comes in the form of profit or a sense of security to traders who learned the field using them over the past few decades   finally it 's extremely important to realize that the actions of retail investors in the equities market can not begin to represent the behaviors of the market as a whole in the equities markets alone trading firms and institutional investors dwarf retail investors and the difference in scale is even more vastly pronounced in derivatives and currency markets the fact that some retail investors use candlestick charts and the technical indicators they hope them provides nothing but minor anecdotal evidence as to their effectiveness

that depends really generally speaking though roth iras are the place for stock market mutual fund investing all the off the wall or not so off the wall things like real estate investments or buying up gold or whatever other ideas you hear from people they may be good or bad or whatnot but your roth ira is maybe not the best place for that sort of thing   the whole philosophy behind iras is to deliberately set aside money for the future anything reasonable will work for this explore interesting investment ideas with today 's money not tomorrow 's money that being said at your age i would go for the riskier options within what 's available   if i were in your situation and i have been recently i would lean toward low fee mutual funds classified as growth funds   my own personal opinion this is not advice is that small cap international funds are the place to be for young folks that 's a generalized opinion based on my feel for the world but i do n't think i 'm personally competent to start making specific stock picks so mutual funds makes sense to me in that i can select the fund that generally aligns with my sense of things and assume that their managers will make reasonably sound decisions within that framework of course that assumption has to be backed up with reputation of the specific mf company and the comparative performance of the fund relative to other funds in the same sector as to the generalized question how else can you work toward financial stability and independence outside of your roth ira find ways to boost your earning potential over time and buy a house before the next bubble within the next 18 months i 'm guessing

my question is how income tax is calculated for partial redemption same as normal the redemption should always be treated as fifo say you are buying 10 units every month i know the units maybe in fraction and price would be different every month and you are investing fixed amount after say 9 months you have 90 units now when you sell say 45 units you are actually selling 10 units from first 4 months and 5 units from 5th month so calculate the price at which you purchased these units this becomes your cost now when you sell you know the price so subtract the sell price from cost price this is your taxable income short term capital gains is taxed as per your tax bracket so add this taxable income to your other income and calculate taxes accordingly you have to pay tax in advance and not wait till year end you can do this online as well

a lien is a mechanism to impede legal title transfer of a vehicle real property or sometimes expensive business equipment   that 's why title companies exist to make sure there are no liens against something before a buyer hands money to a seller the lien can be attached to a loan unpaid labor related to the item a mechanic 's lien or unpaid taxes and there are other scenarios where this could occur the gist of all this is that the seller of the vehicle mentioned does not have clear title if there is a lien   this introduces a risk for the buyer   the buyer can pay the seller the money to cover the lien in the case of a bank loan but that does n't mean the seller will actually pay off the loan so the title is never clear   this article recommends visiting the bank with the seller and getting title on the spot   however this is n't always an option as a local bank branch is n't probably going to have the title document available though the seller might be able to make some arrangement for a local branch to have the title available before a visit to pay off the loan the low risk approach is for the seller to have clear title before any money changes hands

this is an opinion but i think it has more to do with the market 's uncertainty about the long term future of the company without steve jobs   apple has n't released anything more than incremental upgrades to its existing product lines since jobs passed and while some people would argue about the apple watch jobs played a significant role in its development prior to his death so that does n't really count whether you like or hate apple you had to admire jobs passion and creativity and there 's real question as to whether the company can sustain its dominance in the market without the jobs vision over the long haul   my guess is that the market is leaning slightly toward the no column but only ever so slightly   the company continues to deliver fantastic results but how long will that last of their next products do n't wow consumers the way previous ones have   this skepticism manifests itself in a stock that trades at a lower p e than it deserves to but this is just my opinion    i hope this helps good luck

you are missing the fact that the company can buy back its own shares for simplicity imagine the case that you own all of the shares of xyz corporation   xyz is very profitable and it makes $ 1 m per year   there are two ways to return $ 1 m to you the shareholder 1   the company could buy back some fraction of your shares for $ 1 m or   2   the company could pay you a $ 1 m dividend after 1 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 2 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 1 the total number of shares would be fewer but saying you owned less of xyz would be like complaining that you are shorter when your height is measured in inches than in so indeed a buyback is an alternative to a dividend furthermore buybacks have a number of tax advantages over dividends to taxable shareholders see my answer in can i get a dividend free lunch by buying a stock just before the ex dividend date and selling it immediately after   that said it is important to recognize the shareholders who are less savvy about knowing when to accept the buyback by correctly valuing the company can get burned at the profit of the savvy shareholders   a strategy to avoid being burned if you are n't price savvy is simply to sell a fraction in order to get your pro rata share of the buyback in many respects simulating a dividend but still reaping some but not all of the tax advantages of a buyback

modern banking is operated under central banking which is critical for a stable economy   without central banking the economy is prone to the boom and bust cycle typical of early industrialization     our money is not backed by nothing it is backed by the faith and credit of the governments issuing them   private banks do n't issue anything   what fractional reserve banking does is say that for ever x amount of dollars you have in your vaults you can make y amount of loans   this ratio is set by the central bank in what is called the reserve ratio   if the fed sets the reserve ratio at 10 and they know the us economy has $ 10 trillion in circulation than $ 100 trillion dollars is going to eventually emerge through fractional reserve banking   this explains inflation   of course the central bank could also raise the reserve ratio forcing banks to call in existing loans   this is deflation    now if you 're a bank and have $ 1 million dollars in the bank a reserve ratio of 10 means you can make up to $ 10 million in loans without getting in trouble with the fed   if the bank makes $ 10 million in loans and only recuperate $ 9 million in loans than they fall below the 10 reserve rate ratio and become insolvent prior to 2008 these banks would go bankrupt but the fed has evolved it 's roll into either bailing a bank out for it to recover and learn from it 's mistakes or to let it go bankrupt   all people 's deposits at these banks however are safe up to $ 250,000 thanks to the fdic to protect from bank runs typical of the early century that boom and bust cycles     please do n't bring in the federal reserve into this unless you want me to prove how stupid you are even more   i 'm poor broke college student with nothing better to do with my time than to win internet arguments right now you ca n't win    too stupid did n't read banks need to make successful loans or they go out of business they do n't create anything out of thin air   they just listen to whatever the central bank tells them what to do

it sounds for the most part you are a buy and hold type investor and continue to contribute monthly   i follow the same philosophy and continue to contribute monthly as well   i use as my online broker for trading it costs a penny per share with a minimum cost of $ 4.95 so if you only buy 100 shares you will still pay $ 4.95 up to a maximum of $ per trade so if you buy 10,000 shares you only pay $ three trades at $ 4.95 per month across the year would be $   this is assuming you are trading less then share each trade   so switching to questrade would save you an additional $ per year   multiply over number of year before you retire plus compound interest which could accrue and that can quite a bit of extra savings you pay nothing else to questrade either   no management fees etc   you manage the accounts

diversifying but is n't that what mutual funds already do they diversify and reduce stock specific risk by moving from individual stocks to many stocks but you can diversify even further by selecting different fund types e.g. large cal small cap income bond funds international etc   your target date fund probably includes a few different types already and will automatically reallocate to less risky investments as you get close to the target date i would look at the fees of different types of funds and compare them to the historical returns of those funds   you can also use things like morningstar and other ratings as guides but they are generally very large buckets and may not be much help distinguishing between individual funds so to answer the question yes you can diversify further and probably get better returns and lower fees that a target date fund   the question is is it worth your time and effort to do so   you 're obviously comfortable investing for the long term so you might get some benefit by spending a little time looking for different funds to increase your diversification note that etfs do n't really diversify any differently than mutual funds they are just a different mechanism to invest in funds and allow different trading strategies trading during the day derivatives selling short etc

why would anyone ever get a 15 year instead of just paying off a 30 year in 15 years because the rate is not the same never that i 've seen in my 30 years of following rates i 've seen the rate difference range from .25 to .75 in march 15 the average rate in my area is 30yr 3.75 15yr 3.00 for a $ 150 k loan this puts the 15yr payment at $ with the 30 at higher rate paid in 15 years at $ 1091 this $ 55 difference can be considered a flexibility premium as it offers the option to pay the actual $ in any period the money is needed elsewhere   if the rate were the same i 'd grab the 30 and since i ca n't say invest the difference i 'd say to pay at a pace to go 15 unless you had a cash flow situation a spouse out of work an emergency that you funded with a high interest rate loan etc the advice to have an emergency fund is great until for whatever reason there 's just not enough   on a personal note i did go with the 15 year mortgage for our last refinance i was nearing 50 at the time and it seemed prudent to aim for a mortgage free retirement

edit quid identified the reverse split in may 2017   in a reverse split your shares are worth 7 times as much per share but you have the amount of shares   a share worth $ now was worth all else being equal $ a month ago    so a call with a $ 2.50 strike a month ago was well out of the money and would now be the equivalent of a call with a $ strike   a $ call with a $ underlying or a $ 2.50 call with a $ underlying would reasonably be worth only 5 cents so i now suspect that the quote is a stale quote that existed pre split and has n't been adjusted by the provider old answer i can find no valid reason why those calls would be so cheap   the stock price has been trending down from its onset in 2000 so either no one expects it to be above $ 2.50 in a month or it 's so illiquid that there 's not any real data to evaluate the options   they did pay some massive 30 dividends in 2010 and 2012 they 've been cash for the past 4 years at least and i have found at least on strong sell rating so there 's not much to be optimistic about   nasdaq does not list any options for the stock so it must be an otc trade    with an ask size of 10 you could buy calls on 1,000 shares for $ 0.05 so if you can afford to lose $ 50 and want to take a flyer you can give it a shot but i suspect it 's not a valid quote and is something that 's been manufactured by the option broker

this is based on my experience with chase and may not be applicable to other banks as you mentioned chase as one of the banks you do business with hopefully this will be helpful to you the money does come out of your account immediately if the check is n't cashed in a certain amount of time the check expires and you get the money credited back to your account once you have made a bill payment online you can check on the status of your check by looking at your payment activity finding the payment in question and following the proof of payment link    there is will provide you with information on your payment which you can submit to your payee to prove when you submitted the payment and which they can use to verify with the bank that you really did send the payment as you claimed   once the check is cashed this page will also contain images of the front and back of the cashed check so you can prove that the recipient really did cash it   you can see from this info that the check is being funded from a different account number than your own which is good for security purposes since per 2008 giving someone else your bank routing number and account number as found on your personal checks basically provides them with all they need to fraudulently of course clean out your account

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

i 'm not an attorney or a tax advisor the following is not to be considered advice just general information in the us putting your name on the deed would mean making you a co owner absent any other legal agreement between you e.g. a contract stating each of you owns 50 of the house both of you would then be considered to own 100 of the house jointly and in addition the irs would almost certainly interpret the creation of your ownership interest as a gift from your partner to you making them liable for gift tax the gift tax could be postponed by filing a gift tax return which would reduce partner 's lifetime combined gift estate tax exemption and if you sought to get rid of your ownership interest by giving it to your partner it would again be a taxable gift with the tax or loss of estate tax exemption accruing to you however it is likely that this is all moot because of the mortgage on the house any change to the deed would have to be approved by the mortgage holder and if so approved executed by a title company registered closing agent or similar depending on the laws of your state in my similar case the mortgage holder refused to add or remove any names from the deed unless i refinanced at a higher rate naturally making the new partners jointly liable for the mortgage we also had to pay an additional title fee to change the deed

first of all the deal specifically stated that giftcards were excluded   due to a bug in the system or more likely just negligent programming of the system they forgot to actually stop people from buying giftcards you were n't taking up on the offer because you were n't suppose to be able to buy giftcards   you are exploiting a bug in combination with cashiers who both did not notice the coupon excluded giftcards and did n't realize that giftcards should be excluded because of the abuse   secondly they also specifically limited the number of coupons you could print   again by them you are the system and exploiting the fact that they should 've put unique ids on each coupon printed   negligence on their part again but clearly the offer they were trying to extend did not include the ability to redeem 100 's of the coupon per person   finally from the article gt;when you have to start yourself visiting multiple cashiers and you get rejected but still keep trying an intelligent person would know that they are at the very least doing something wrong even if their conscience had n’t already told them that earlier

a system comparing students to themselves a year ago is what i think would work best therefore you are graded based off the students you have not the grade you are in   this would mean if i was in 2nd grade and read at a 1st grade level then went to 3rd grade and read at a 4th grade level then the teacher would receive higher marks this would of course be averaged out throughout the class with outliers left off because some students always get a 's and some not so much    its not a perfect system but its better than saying that the only performance indicators are not touching children and keeping your job long enough to get tenure

that article like almost any article written by a non expert and quoting only research from lobbying groups hugely misses the point the vast majority of orders that end up being cancelled are cancelled as a standard part of exchanges official market maker programs each exchange wants you and me to know that it has liquidity that when we go to buy or sell some stock there will be someone waiting on the other side of the trade   so the exchange pays via lowered fees or even rebates hundreds of registered market makers to constantly have orders resting in each product 's order book within a few ticks of the current nbbo or the last trade price   that way if everyone else should suddenly disappear from the market you and i will still be able to trade our shares for a price somewhat close to the last trade price but market makers who are simply acting in this backstop role do n't actually want to have their orders filled because those orders will almost always lose them money so as prices rise and fall as much as tens of times per second the market makers need to cancel their resting orders so they do n't get filled and add new ones at new prices so they meet their obligations to the exchange   and because the number of orders resting in any given product 's order book is vastly larger than the number of actual trades that take place in any given time period naturally the number of cancellations is also going to hugely outweigh the number of actual trades   as much as 97 to 3 or even more but that 's completely fine you and i do n't have to care about any of that   we almost never need the market makers to be there to trade with us   they 're only there as a backstop   there 's almost always plenty of organic liquidity for us to trade against   only in the rare case where liquidity completely dries up do we really care that the registered market makers are there   and in those cases ideally the market makers ca n't cancel their orders depending on how well the exchange has set up its market maker program so to answer your question the effect of standard order cancellation on a stock is essentially none   if you were to visualize the resting orders in a product 's book as prices moved up and down you would essentially see a gaussian distribution with mean at the last trade price and it would move up and down with the price   that movement is accomplished by cancellations followed by new orders p.s. as always keep in mind that your and my orders almost never actually make it to a real stock exchange anymore   nowadays they are almost always sent to brokers and big banks internal dark pools   and in there you and i have no idea what shenanigans are going on   as just one example dark pools allow their operators and for a fee other institutional participants access to a feature called last look that allows them to cancel their resting order as late as after your order has been matched against it regarding the question in your comment if alice is sending only bona fide orders that is only placing an order at time t if given all the information she has at time t she truly wants and intends for it to be filled then her cancellation at a later time actually adds to the effectiveness of and public perception of the market as a tool for price discovery which is its ultimate purpose in the following example imagine that there are no such things as trading fees or commissions or taxes let 's say alice offers to buy aapl at $ 99.99 when the rest of the market is trading it for $ 100.00   by doing so she is casting her vote that the fair value of a share of aapl is between $ 99.99 and $ 100.00 after all if she thought the fair value of a share of aapl was higher   say between $ 100.00 and $ 100.01 then she should be willing to pay $ 100.00 because that 's below fair value and she should expect that other people in the market will not soon decide to sell to her at $ 99.99 if some time later alice does decide that the fair value of aapl is between $ 100.00 and $ 100.01 then she should definitely cancel her order at $ 99.99 for exactly the reason discussed above   she probably wo n't get filled at $ 99.99 and by sitting there she 's missing out potentially forever on the possibility to make a profit through the simple act of cancelling her $ 99.99 order alice is once again casting a vote that she no longer thinks that 's aapl 's fair value   she is very slightly altering the collective opinion of the entire market as to what a share of aapl is worth   and if her cancellation then frees her up to place another order closer to her perceived fair value say at $ 100.00 then that 's another vote for her honest about aapl 's price since the whole goal of the market is to get a bunch of to figure out the fair value of some financial instrument or commodity or smart phone or advertising time etc cancellations of honest votes from the past in order to replace them with new better informed honest votes in the present can only be a good thing for the market 's effectiveness and perceived effectiveness it 's only when participants start sending non honest votes non bona fide orders that things start to go off the rails   that 's what was referring to in his comment on your original question

i like the answers others gave if it 's some substantial debt you definitely could go the bankruptcy route but it damages your future also it 's morally unethical to borrow all that money and not intend to pay second if you can pay off the entire balance and clear out the 23 interest than i 'd do that first one less bill to concern yourself with now let 's say you 've been making $ 100 payments monthly on each card my assumption for this examples sale now instead of paying $ 100 to the remaining cards balance each month and saving the other $ 100 pay $ 200 against the remaining credit cards balance by not taking home any money this way you are tackling the liability that is costing you money every month unless you have a great investment opportunity on that remaining $ 1000 or have n't created much of an emergency fund yet i 'd consider putting more of that money towards the debt gaining 0.01 on savings interest still means you 're eating in debt monthly if you 're able to i 'd venture out to open a zero interest card and do a balance transfer over to that new card there will be a minimal transfer fee but you may get some cash back out of it and also that zero interest for a year would help hold off more interest accruing while you 're tackling the balance

if you can qualify for two mortgages this is certainly possible   for this you can talk to a banker however most people do not qualify for two mortgages so they go a different route   they make offers on a new home with a contingency to sell the existing home   a good realtor will walk you through this and any possible side effects keep in mind that the more contingencies in an offer the less attractive that offer is to sellers   this is how cash buyers can get a better deal no contingencies and a very fast close   given the of your market a seller might reject your offer as opposed to first time home buyer that does not need to sell an old home   on the other hand they may see your contingency as low risk as the market is so hot    this is why you probably need a really good agent   they can frame the contingency in a very positive light

the central banks sets various rate for lending to banks and paying interest to banks on excess funds apart from these the central banks also sets various other ratios that either create more liquidity or remove liquidity from market   the cpi is just one input to the central bank to determine rate is not the only deciding criteria the cpi does not take into account the house price or the cost of renting in the basket of goods   one of the reasons could be that cpi contains basic essentials and also the fact that it should be easily over the period of time for example retail price of a particular item is easily the rent is not easily

taxing wealth is an easy idea but i do n't think it can ever work wealth is too easily hidden transformed or taxing actual cash flows works because two parties have to declare it taxing wealth would cause huge conflicts as to how wealth is measured that said i 'm a big fan of the idea that the estate tax should be massively increased and would only involve a single evaluation per taxpayer rather than every year taxing more measurable forms of wealth like stocks would cause wealth to flow from stocks into property which would then be valued as low as possible causing a general market crash and another great depression   i 'm most curious about a tax scheme which is where taxes are levied on un improved property per wikipedia based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves but that the economic value derived from land including natural resources should belong equally to all members of society    so most taxes in society would be generated by those who owned property as a speculation and did n't invest in it incentives would be to make all property held privately be as economically productive as possible

a lot sometimes called a round lot always refers to the quantity of physical good that you 're getting like a of eggs or a barrel of oil   the tricky thing in the case of forex is that the physical good also happens to be a currency a spot currency product trades in the denomination on the right hand side of the product name   so if you 're buying eur usd you are paying usd currency to get eur units and if you 're selling eur usd you are receiving usd by giving away eur units   the eur is the physical good in this case the way i remember it is to think of all products not just currencies as trading pairs   so aapl in my mind is aapl usd   when i buy aapl usd i am paying usd to get aapl units   when i sell aapl usd i am receiving usd by giving away aapl units the thing on the left is the physical good even if it happens to be money that you are exchanging and the thing on the right is the money that you are exchanging so when i buy a lot of aapl i am buying 100 shares at their current price in dollars similarly when i buy a lot of eur usd i am buying 100 k euros at their current price in dollars

tough spot i 'm guessing the credit cards are a personal line of credit in their name and not the company 's the fact that the business can be liquidated separately from your parents means they did at least set up an llc or similar business entity using personal debt to save a company that could have just been dissolved at little cost to their personal credit and finances was indeed a very bad move the best possible end to this scenario for you and your parents would be if your parents could get the debt transferred to the llc before dissolving it at this point with the company in such a long standing negative situation i would doubt that any creditor would give the business a loan which was probably why your parents threw their own good money after bad with personal ccs they might in the right circumstances be able to convince a judge to effectively transfer the debt to the corporate entity before liquidating it that puts the debt where it should have been in the first place and the cc companies will have to get in line that means in turn that the card issuers will fight any such motion or decision tooth and nail as long as there 's any other option that gives them more hope of recovering their money your parents only for this to happen is if the ccs were used for the sole purpose of business expenses if they were living off the ccs as well as using them to pay business debts a judge best case would only relieve the debts directly related to keeping the business afloat and they 'd be on the hook for what they had been living on bankruptcy is definitely an option they will re affirm their commitment to paying the mortgage and any other debts they can and under a chapter 13 the judge will then negotiations over what total portion of each card 's balance is paid over what time and at what rate to a mediator chapter 13 bankruptcy is the less damaging form to your parent 's credit they are at least attempting to make good on the debt   a chapter 7 would wipe it away completely but your parents would have to prove that they can not pay the debt by any means and have no hope of ever paying the debt by any means if they have any retirement savings anything in their name for grandchildren 's college funds etc the judge and cc issuers will point to it like a bird dog apart from that their house is safe due to florida 's homestead laws but furniture appliances clothing jewelry cars and other vehicles pretty much anything of value that your parents can not defend as being necessary for life health or the performance of whatever jobs they end up taking to dig themselves out of this are all subject to seizure and auction they may end up just selling the house anyway because it 's too big for what they have left or will ever have again i do not under any circumstance recommend you putting your own finances at risk in this you may gift money to help or provide them a place to live while they get back on their feet but do not give till it hurts for this it sounds heartless but if you remove your safety net to save your parents then what happens if you need it your parents are n't going to be able to bail you out and as a contractor if you 're effectively doing business as contracting you do n't have the debt shield your parents had it looks like housing 's again due to the news that the fed 's going to start backing off you could need that money to weather a double dip in the housing sector over the next few months and you may need it soon

i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that well this is n't a meaningful distinction the mutual fund may or may not be in an ira similarly the mutual fund may or may not be in a 401(k however so i 'm going to treat your question as if it 's why would a person get a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that in an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into the same mutual fund in a 401(k same mutual fund same amount of money narrowing your question to the difference between the two types of accounts as stated in your question 's title others have answered that to the extent that you really have no choice other than pick which type of account to use for a given bundle of money other than nobody having mentioned the employer match even if there were no other difference at all in tax treatment it 's pretty typical that 401(k contributions will be matched by free money from the employer no ira can compete with that but that 's not the only choice either many of us contribute to both the 401(k and the ira why because we can i 'm not suggesting that just anybody can but if you max out the employer matching in the 401(k or if you max out the tax advantaged contribution limit in the 401(k and you still have more money that you want to save in a tax advantaged retirement account this year you can do so the ira is available it 's not instead of the 401(k

in most cases an rent with option to buy is structured as follows the renter buyer will place a deposit premium not the same as a security deposit that purchases the option the right to buy the home at a future date at a specific price the renter buyer will often pay extra rent in addition to market rent   many times this additional rent is contracted to be applied to the purchase price of the home the risks to the renter buyer are as follows also something to note many people will recommend that you use the additional rents to be applied specifically towards the downpayment   be wary of this   there are no institutional lenders available today that will allow the additional rent money to be applied towards your downpayment   that means you must come up with the downpayment in cash before closing   the additional rent payments can   be used towards the price    hope that helps   good luck

the 10 k in savings and money market is equal to about 1.5 months of income for emergency funds you should add additional funds to this account over the next few years to let that increase to 3 to 6 months of monthly expenses this money should be kept secure so that it will be there when you need it growth is not the primary function for this account investment at this stage should be for retirement this means take advantage of 401 k matching if it is available you will have to determine if roth or regular makes the   most sense for you in general the lower your current tax bracket the more sense roth makes for you if you want an ira again decide which type also remember that you have until the tax deadline to make a contribution so you can decide to use a refund to fund the ira iras and 401ks are just account types with some rules attached they can be invested in everything from cd 's to individual stocks depending on how aggressive you want to be

so betas are not found on a company 's financial statements beta is essentially a measure of the covariance of an asset and the overall market return in relation to the variance of the market 's return   a beta of 1 is to describe an asset whose daily returns mimic the returns of the overall market a beta of gt;1 describes an asset whose returns are greater than the market return and a beta describes an asset whose returns are less than the market return   to the extent that the asset you are comparing to the market index is a share of common stock the beta you are looking at is levered if the company has debt or preferred stock   the technique your professor is alluding to is the process of betas of two different companies that may have similar underlying operating assets but because of different capital structures have different betas when using their common stock returns this adjustment makes comparing different betas between companies agnostic of the capital structure used

i would put about a month 's worth of expenses in the highest paying savings account that you find convenient to access for the rest i recommend ally 's high yield cds specifically the 5-year option normally 5 years would be way too long to commit short term savings to a cd however the ally cds allow you to break them for a penalty of only two months worth of interest if you look at the graph below from when the rates were apy you can see the effective interest rate at every possible time you break the cd early doing the math if you can keep your savings in the account for at least four months it will outperform any other current fdic backed investment that i am aware of for the length of time the money was invested   credit

to be honest all that they might be able to tell you is to keep saving   your income seems like it will vary week to week thanks to commission and i 'm still very curious how at 18 you found a job making $ 96,000 a year at minimum   right now because you have no savings start stacking that up    you 're going to want an emergency fund on the side as well    even though now you may still live with parents you still may run into issues where you 'll need money on hand   it 's much better to dig into an emergency fund than get a loan   plus when moving out you wo n't be living paycheck to paycheck   best rule of thumb for this is to keep an emergency fund of roughly 3 6 months of expenses   right now because you 're so young with so little money there is n't a large reason to really open up an ira or any sort of investment account   unless you 're actually guaranteed $ 2,000 a week then things are different

do developing country equities have a higher return and/or lower risk    than emerging market equities   generally in finance you get payed more for taking risk   riskier stocks over the long run return more than less risky bonds for instance   developing market equity is expected to give less return over the long run as it is generally less risky than emerging market equity   one way to see that is the amount you pay for one rupee lira dollar euro worth of company earnings is fewer rupees lira and more dollars euros when measured in the emerging market 's currency   this makes this question interesting   risky emerging currencies like the rupee tend to devalue over time against less risky currencies euro dollars yen like where most international investment ends up but the results are rather wild   think how badly brazil has done recently and how relatively well the rupee has been doing    this adds to the returns roughly based on interest rates of foreign stocks from the point of view of a emerging market investor on average but has really wild variations do you have data for this over a long timeframe decades ideally for multiple countries not really unfortunately   good data for emerging markets is a fairly new phenomenon and even where it does exist decades ago it would have been very hard to invest like we can now so it likely is not comparable does foreign equity pay more or less when measured in rupees or other    emerging market currency probably less on average theoretically and empirically all things included though the evidence is not strong but there is a massive amount of risk in a portfolio that is 85 in a single emerging market currency   think about if you were a brazilian and needed to retire now and 85 of your portfolio was in the real   international goods like gas would be really expensive and your local currency portfolio would seem paltry right now   if you want to bet on emerging markets in the long run i would suggest that you at least spread the risk over many emerging markets and add a good chunk developed to the mix as for investing goals it 's just to maximize my return in inr or maximize my risk adjusted return that is up to you but the goal i generally recommend is making sure you are comfortable in retirement   this usually involves looking for returns are high in the long run but not having a ton of risk in a single currency or a single market   there are reasons to believe a little bias toward your homeland is good as fees tend to be lower on local investments and local investments tend to track closer to your retirement costs but too much can be very dangerous even for countries with stronger currencies say greece

no one can really answer this for you   it is a matter of personal preference and the details of your situation   there are some really smart people on here when placed in your exact situation would do completely different things   personal finance is overall personal if it was me i 'd never borrow money in retirement   if i had the cash i 'd use it to help fund the purchase   if i did n't i simply would n't   for me wealth retention in your case is surprisingly more about behavior than math even though i am a math guy   you are simply creating a great deal of risk at a season in your life with a diminished ability to recover from negative events   in my opinion you are inviting tales of woe to be part of your future if you borrow others would disagree with me   they would point to the math and show how you would be much better off on borrowing instead of pulling out of investments provided a sufficient return on your nest egg   they may even have a case as you might have to pay taxes on money pulled out magnifying the difference in net income on borrowing versus pulling out in a lump sum   here in the us the money you pulled out would be taxed at the highest marginal rate   to help with a down payment of 50 k you might have to pull out to pay the taxes and have enough for the down payment the third option is to not help with a down payment or to help them in a different way   perhaps giving them a few hundred per month for two years to help with their mortgage payment   maybe watch their kids some to reduce day care costs or help with home improvements so they can buy a lower price home   those are all viable options   perhaps the child is not ready to buy a home having said all that it really depends on your situation   say your sitting on 5 million in investments your pensions is sufficient to have some disposable income and they are asking for a relatively small amount   then pull the money out and do n't be concerned   you nest egg will quickly recover the money

i 'm glad you did n't say they were the only causes of the bubble and i hope you did n't mean to   but i wo n't argue that those were not partially to blame   i also wo n't say i personally was not partially to blame   now i certainly do n't want to defend the banks at least not a lot of them but i disagree with some of your assertions for one thing they are getting blamed for making loans to readily available and now they are being blamed not by you for not making the money readily available     have you financed any homes   if so did you just go to a bank and get a loan   i 'm sure some people do that but i do n't know anyone who ever has   i go to a loan agent and get a much cheaper loan   and i think part of the problem is that many of these agents have only one overriding objective to enable you to qualify for a loan so they can get their commission   they know all the rules and reasons people get turned down so they play the system and get people loans who should not get them   i do n't really think the banks are as they allow this and in many cases know about it unofficially   but i do n't think it 's a conspiracy by the banks i think the banks were simply naive and thought that the past was a good indicator or the future so the loans were safe because they would get the house if the owner defaulted and the house would be worth at least the value of the equity the owner had after the down payment   lots of people made mistakes on both sides   you can call it a conspiracy if you want but i 've found that most conspiracy theories were simply not real     other than that i totally agree with you

a long put you have a small initial cost the option premium but profit as the stock goes down you have no additional risk if the shock rises even a lot short a stock you gain if the stock drops but have unlimited risk if it rises the call mitigates this by capping that rising stock risk the profit loss graph looks similar to the long put when you hold both the short position and the long call   you might consider producing a graph or spreadsheet to compare positions you can easily sketch put call long stock short stock and study how combinations of positions can synthetically look like other positions often when a stock has no shares to short the synthetic short can help you put your stock position in place

is there more on where dalio gets his definitions for the short term debt cycle 5 8 years or so and deleveraging and the long term debt cycle 75 100 years or his evidence that separates the two   at one point he says the difference is that in a deleveraging interest rates hit 0 and can no longer go lower but i do n't know if that works as a definition per se   there are other things that central banks do when interest rates hit 0 like buy up assets which he does mention and include in the print money category of things that can be done during a deleveraging   and one of the he cites england in the 1950s according to wikipedia was due to difficulty in transitioning out from war production and according to this excel statistics documents rates from the bank of england on historical rates it does n't say interest rates went to 0 at that time unless dalio is referring to another point in history when he cites 1950s england     his definition of a depression is when debt restructuring or defaults happen   interesting   what i learned was that there is n't really a hard and fast definition for recessions and depressions e.g. a recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row and a depression is just a bad long recession   and i do n't think i recall in the past an attempt to define what a deleveraging event of an economy is     is debt reduction and redistribution of wealth deflationary   i think it depends on how much the debt reduction or redistribution hurts the spending of the lender or wealthy versus how much it helps the spending of the borrower or the poor   both are actually similarly giving some from the haves to the have nots and especially redistribution of wealth is similar to fiscal spending which is mentioned as a valid inflationary way to try to help the economy   are deflationary methods say austerity needed to balance out the inflationary methods central bank buying assets and fiscal spending   are n't central bank interest rates quantitative easing and the government fiscal policy still the main things that move inflation or deflation   i would think that debt reduction and redistribution of wealth are good when needed but i would n't think you would do those things mainly for their supposed see above for my doubts deflationary effects     still a very interesting video and one of the best presented videos on a difficult subject

the answer is actually very simple the cost of data seriously call the cboe tomorrow and ask yourself they have two big programs   1 the penny pilot program where options trade at penny increments instead of 5 cent increments this is only extended to a select few symbols because of the amount of data this can generate is too much for the data vendors data vendors store and sell historical data the exchanges themselves often have a big data vending business too 2 the weekly options program where only select symbols get these chains because of the amount of data they will generate liquidity and demand are factors in determining if the cboe will consider enabling those series on new issues although they have to give the list of which symbols are on these programs to the sec

first do you get charged a commission or other fee for reinvesting    second why would capital gains and dividends be grouped together if the broker charges you for that run away as joe explained it is done as a courtesy does n't this mean if i sell the stock the profit will be used to buy    that stock right back no this is only the capital gains distributions of funds lastly there are two additional checkbox options i was hoping    somebody could explain all equity positions currently held in this    account and future equity purchases transfers and deposits to this    account all equity positions means your selection will be valid for all the positions you already have future positions means it will only affect future positions not the ones you already have for example follow up looking around some people suggest not doing this for    taxable accounts because it complicates cost basis reporting is this    a valid concern does n't the brokerage handle that and send you the    information when you sell the stock yes because you end up with tons of positions and you need to track the cost basis for each brokers are required to report cost basis on 1099-b now so its less of a problem but before 2011 you 'd have 10 's of positions each year if you have a monthly dividend for example each with different cost basis and you 'd usually sell them all at once go figure the gain so the new 1099-b reporting regulations help a little on this but it only kicks in for everything starting of 2013 iirc fortunately for some investments mutual funds mainly you may chose averaging but it has drawbacks as well

i 'm going to assume that you want to be invested all the time and each trade consists in selling a security and buying another one similar to your example how much commissions you are willing to pay depends on several factors but one way to think about it is as follows you have a position in stock a and you want to switch to stock b because you think it will perform better if you think there 's a good chance > 50 that b will outperform a by more than x% then you can happily pay up to commissions and still make money over a long time horizon if you like formulae one way to express it is where example if you tend to be right 51 of the time hit rate and gain 110 more than you lose on average win loss ratio you can see that your expected profit is 5.1 commissions so you could pay 2.5 commissions on entering and closing the position and still make money*. unfortunately common sense statistics and numerous studies tell us a sad truth on average people have a hit rate of 50 and a win loss ratio of 100 which means that their expected profit per trade is 0 commission based on that crude observation unless you can prove to yourself that you are better than average you should aim at reducing commissions paid to your broker as much as possible through 51 and 110 are not random numbers they correspond to the results of the top 15 professional managers in a research paper using a sample of funds managing $

you need to do a bit more research and as @littleadv often wisely advises consult a professional in this case a tax layer or cpa you are not allowed to just pull money out of a property and write off the interest   from deducting mortgage interest faqs if you own rental property and borrow against it to buy a home the    interest does not qualify as mortgage interest because the loan is not    secured by the home itself interest paid on that loan ca n't be    deducted as a rental expense either because the funds were not used    for the rental property the interest expense is actually considered    personal interest which is no longer deductible this is not exactly your situation of course but it illustrates the restriction that will apply to you   elsewhere in the article it references how if used for a business the interest deduction still will not apply to the rental but to the business via schedule c.   in your case it 's worse you can never deduct interest used to fund a tax free bond or to invest in such a tax favored product   putting the facts aside i often use the line do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog borrowing in order to reduce taxes is rarely a wise move if you look at the interest on the 90 k vs 290 k you 'll see you are paying in effect on the extra 200 k due the higher rate on the entire sum elsewhere on this board there are members who would say that given the choice to invest or pay off a 4 mortgage paying it off is guaranteed and the wiser thing to do i think there 's a fine line and might not be so quick to pay that loan off an after tax 3 cost of borrowing is barely higher than inflation but to borrow at over 5 to invest in an annuity product whose terms you did n't disclose does seem right to me borrow to invest in the next property that 's another story

but simple economics also proves that if you have no savings most millennials do not these days at least in canada and you have no income then you have no entertainment or more importantly no shelter and food i would understand taking a cashier job instead of store manager job because of the fewer hours and responsibility but does no income not mean you go hungry if that is true where are they getting their food from

it 's repeated all the time and is horrible accounting the only things going in that analysis are the self fulfilling prophecy of preventing default and then default not happening heck the government made money goldman made money berkshire made money that crisis was great we should do it again that 's not a return on investment
