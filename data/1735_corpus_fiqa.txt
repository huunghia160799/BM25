just for clarification my perspective on education background is from a front office associate at a bb that interacts with the traders and analysts at other bb 's and hf 's daily many of whom have become good friends   take it for what you will   it 's not my role to tell you which is right for you but i can definitely give an honest perspective of which is far more common    gt there were people who passed l3 last year    does n't take into account the number of these that were already mba holders quite a larger percent as mba has become less competitive and a cfa is required to demonstrate the quantitative capacity of a mba holder   this is a huge factor in the skew of your numbers as mba 's have become dime a dozen mba holders are now being expected to hold a ms or get a cfa to establish that their quantitative skills are qualified for working on modern day wall st front office roles   gt and became charter holders   wrong   passing l3 does n't automatically make you a charterholder   you need the 48 months of approved experience in portfolio management investment analysis or market research   these roles are becoming more and more exclusive to target graduates and mba holders so the likelihood of a cfa charterholder already having a mba is actually increasing   gt now lets just take the top 25 mba programs that 'd be 460 people class graduating to reach this number actual numbers are much lower than this   clearly you do n't realize the graduate enrollment levels at target schools   lets take a look at full time enrollment meaning 1/2 graduates each year for the top 10 for finance   wharton     nyu   columbia mit   stanford   harvard   uc   ucla   750 northwestern     that 's averaging graduates year per school at the top 10 schools for finance   to argue that there are no graduates from unc duke usc cornell dartmouth yale rice etc on wall st would be ignorance in its form   gt trust me i 'm a big fan of the cfa    you might be a fan but clearly you do n't know much about the exam keep reading and you 'll see why   gt but i know some really dumb people who are charter holders because they learned to memorize a test   memorize a test   you can def argue that for l1 not for l2 or l3   there 's a reason there 's such a collective failure amongst candidates that pass 1 and move on to l2 and l3   l2 requires critical scenario understanding of the concepts more than the formulas itself   it tests your ability to understand complex and unique fra such as repatriated foreign delta 's on cash flows not just memorizing a formula and regurgitating   l3 is even more removed from just formulas as requiring detailed essay responses   3 hour section with 10 15 essay questions yeah sounds like formula memorizing /s   gt these same people would never get admitted to a top 10 no less 25 mba program   this is an irrelevant point   there are plenty of top 10 and top 25 mba program grad 's that would n't pass the cfa either   both emphasize different skillsets   front office wall st is becoming more and more geared towards ms holders and cfa charters many mba 's holders and mba programs lack the quantitative focus to take these roles and are being denied   gt;one thing i will give you there are way too many mbas in general partially because of all the part time night time executive ones but an mba is very different then a cfa in that its banded by school and category   absolutely   that reinforces my entire point that mba 's are dime a dozen   what are we arguing about again   mba 's are very different than a cfa in that even within target schools they each emphasize on entirely different skills   mit finance mba grads are far more likely to possess strong quantitative than say a harvard mba   the reason is that the cfa is a standard qualification that focuses entirely on quantitative capacity it is like a ms in the sense that its a mile deep and a foot wide whereas mba 's are a foot deep and a mile wide   gt everyone with a cfa has the same cfa however a wharton degrees sure carries a lot more clout than a one   you 're right   but a cfa is n't meant to be comparable and interchangeable with a wharton degree   the cfa 's closest comparison is a ms in quantitative computational finance   so if you 're trying to say cfa is less valuable than a mba it 's apples and oranges   you never will see a job require a mba or cfa the cfa will always be listed on a job role as preferred ms cfa   try comparing cfa against a ms from columbia or carnegie mellon grad and you might have valid results

i think it depends a lot on your idea of how you should relate to your neighbors personally i think that i should be allowed to do just about whatever i want with my property and i grant my neighbor the same right if my neighbor wants to paint his house purple with orange stripes and fill his front lawn with pink i think that 's his right if i do n't like it i do n't have to look at his house i would draw the line at things that i can not avoid by simply looking the other way like running jet engines in his back yard at 2 in the morning as i could not avoid the noise or dumping toxic waste on the street as it will cause health problems etc others think it is their business what their neighbor does with his property and want to be able to control it they want someone who has the authority to force everyone in the neighborhood to paint their house in colors deemed acceptable to meet certain requirements for yard work and that 's what home owners associations are for to require that everyone in the neighborhood maintain their property according to a standard set by the hoa which should theoretically represent the wishes of the majority of course the price you pay for giving you the right to tell your neighbor what kind of fence he is allowed to have is that now your neighbors can tell you what kind of fence you can have advocates of often say that they are necessary to protect property values personally i think this is something of a circular argument i must have the right to prevent my neighbor from doing something that in my opinion makes his house ugly not because i necessarily have no choice but to stare out my window at his house all day and be by it but because someday i may want to sell my house to someone who will have no choice but to stare out the window at his house all day and be by it and so will not want to buy my house of course if we all just minded our own business this would n't be an issue okay this was pretty much an anti hoa post but i did try to state the other side of it

i 'm not positive my answer is complete but from information on my broker 's website the following fees apply to a us option trade which i assume you 're concerned with given fee in dollars and the mention of the options clearing corporation they have more detail for other countries see for north america   use the sub menu near the top of the page to pick europe or asia the brokerage charged commission for this broker is as low as $ 0.25 per contract with a $ 1.00 minimum   though i 've been charged less than $ 1 to an options position as well as less than $ 1 to btc an options position so not sure about that minimum regarding what i read as your overall underlying question why are option fees so high in my research this broker has one of the cheapest commission rates on options i 've ever seen   when i participate in certain discussions i 'm routinely told that these fees are unbelievable and that $ $ or even $ are considered low fees    i 've heard this so much and discussed commissions with enough people who 've refused to switch brokers that i conclude there just is n't enough competition to drive prices lower   if most people wo n't switch brokers to go from $ to $ 1 per trade there simply is n't a reason to lower rates

another way to look at this is if we separate the owner 's account from the business 's account   at the start of the year the owner puts $ 9 into the business account to get the business started at the end of the first day the business account has $ 10 and at the end of the second day the business account has $ 11   the owner does n't need to add any more of his own money into the business account at the end of the day the business will have $ which is $ 365 profit + $ 9 investment   assuming the business has no other expenses the business will calculate profit for the year like this the author is making a strange point the two numbers he is talking about are two different quantities the business owner 's return on investment is $ 365 $ 9 =   but the business 's profit margin is $ 365 $ = 10   both are useful numbers when running the business i disagree with the author 's that a business is doing something tricky when calculating profit margin remember that in addition to the business owner 's monetary investment he worked every day for a year to earn that $ 365

this is automation a goal that businesses are going to head for no matter how much people about it   as long as we have an economy that demands profits as soon as it becomes viable to use a machine over a human it will     it 's not a new trend either   machines replace humans all the time   it 's been happening since the industrial revolution   this is just the latest iteration in a long running cycle   the correct response to automation replacing human labor is not to fight automation though it happens every time and always loses in the end but rather to embrace the new technology and ensure the displaced workers have other jobs or failing that the ability to retrain or train for higher paying jobs   this is an argument for a better more comprehensive welfare system more funding for public education maybe even something as horrific as a basic income system that ensures not only are our most vulnerable able to survive but those that want are given the opportunity to thrive instead of forcing them to work a low wage job for eternity

that 's incredible i 'm a second year college student taking macro economics class a lot of these technical things are all news to me    thank you for the wealth of information    1 that 's an interesting thought does that basically translate to less tax on poor wealthy since there are a lot more of them in numbers to promote entrepreneurship    2 someone pointed that very thing out rich using money to grow their own wealth but would n't that mean as a byproduct jobs will be made i probably made another dangerous assumption here    3 i do n't think i understand this one at all what is compensation will you rephrase it for me   4 i hear that effective tax rate can be very misleading to the general public i learned how to calculate the average tax rate a few weeks ago and understood what the folks were talking about i did hear from my professor and the educational videos he had shown us that the capital   tax is one of the highest among the other oecd nations my question for that would be why ca n't we just close loop holes instead of choosing to slash capital tax i feel like the majority will be more than okay with closing the loopholes   5 i think citizens of the country aligning with the county 's companies without asking questions is a terrible and a dangerous idea asian depression in the mid 90 's really it for me since our family was practically evicted from korea major conglomerates held all the power and the federal government was really just a puppet i think it 's in each company 's best interest to further their own agenda and that agenda usually means bad for the majority let me know if i 'm way off base here but one person 's spending is another 's income so using that logic the company ca n't make money unless i spend money so we have a conflict of interest here because as a consumer i want to get the best deals be thrifty company wants to charge me as much as they can to maximize profits    thank you in advance for your time

in the short term this question is pretty simple are occasional use grid scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators   home solar is an amazingly good deal now economically the question is n't whether it 'll take over most home power generation it 's how fast that will happen   currently at least where i live the grid is still a good deal for backup power if that changes then people will stop using it   you can get a gas generator to cover a normal sized home installed for in places with gas the price for running the generator looks comparable to grid power per kwh   so no i would n't pay triple the price for grid power or buy a ton of extra storage i 'd get a natural gas generator and handle solar downtime locally

security in the merchant services system is mainly handled in two ways 1 before transactions are done the business itself must go through an application process similar but not identical to getting a loan   some high risk businesses must pay higher fees due to the increased likelihood of customer complaints 2 when a customer disputes a transaction that 's a mark against the business   get too many of these disputes and your of accepting credit cards will be revoked meaning you wo n't be able to again it 's in the merchant 's best interest to verify customer 's identity because disputes cost them money directly   it 's in the servicer 's best interest to verify the businesses integrity because fraud drives up the cost for everyone else as a whole it 's quite a reactionary system yet in practice it works remarkably well

from what you 've described your spouse is a non resident alien for us tax purposes you have two choices use the nonresident spouse treated as resident election and file as married filing jointly since your spouse does n't have and does n't currently qualify for an ssn he she will need to apply for an itin together with the tax filing note that by becoming a resident alien your spouse 's worldwide income the whole year would be subject to us taxes and would need to be reported on your joint tax filing though he she will be able to use the foreign earned income exclusion to exclude $ 100k of her foreign earned income since he she will have been out of the us for 330 days in a 12-month period or file as married filing separately you write nra for your spouse 's ssn on your tax return as a nonresident alien if your spouse does n't have any us income he she does n't have to file a us tax return and does n't need to apply for an itin which one is better is up to you to figure out

here is another way to look at it does this debt enable you to buy more car than you can really afford or more car than you need if so it 's bad debt let 's say you do n't have the price of a new car but you can buy a used car with the cash you have you will have to repair the car occasionally but this is generally a lot less than the payments on a new car the value of your time may make sitting around waiting while your car is repaired very expensive if like me you can earn money in fine grained amounts anywhere between 0 and 80 hours a week and you do n't get paid when you 're at the mechanic 's in which case it 's possible to argue that buying the new car saves you money overall debt incurred to save money overall can be good compare your interest payments to the money you save if you 're ahead great and the fun or joy or potential of your new car is simply gravy now let 's say you can afford a $ 10,000 car cash there are new cars out there at this price but you want a $ 30,000 car and you can afford the payments on it if there was no such thing as borrowing you would n't be able to get the larger car and some people suggest that this is bad debt because it is helping you to waste your money you may be getting some benefit such as being able to get to a job that 's not served by public transit or being able to buy a cheaper house that is further from your job or saving time every day from the first $ 10,000 of expense but the remaining $ 20,000 is purely for fun or for showing off and should n't be spent   certainly not by getting into debt well that 's a philosophical position and it 's one that may well lead to a secure retirement think about that and you may decide not to borrow and to buy the cheaper car finally let 's say the cash you have on hand is enough to pay for the car you want and you 're just trying to decide whether you should take their cheap loan or not generally if you do n't take the cheap loan you can push the price down so before you decide that you can earn more interest elsewhere than you 're paying here make sure you 're not paying $ 500 more for the car than you need to since your loan is from a bank rather than the car dealership this may not apply in addition to the money your cash could earn consider also liquidity if you need to repair something on your house or deal with other emergency expenditures and your money is all locked up in your car you may have to borrow at a much higher rate as much as 20 if you go to credit cards and ca n't get it paid off the same month which will wipe out all this careful math about how you should just buy the car and not pay that 1.5 interest more important than whether you borrow or not is not buying too much car if the loan is letting you talk yourself into the more expensive car i 'd say it 's a bad thing otherwise it probably is n't

i deleted my previous comment here 's an illustration   let 's say you 're betting in a horse race this horse race allows anyone who 's willing to take bets during the race to do so   so you bet on horse a another guy bets on horse b   your horse a runs the race normally   the guy on horse b however notices his horse will lose but that c is going to win   so he sends a bunch of his friends to the ticket counter ahead of time then when he wants to be on c he just has a friend bet for him he can do that while you 're stuck at the back of the line    in the market they can distribute the orders among each other in the same way the friends are just servers but they let everyone know when the orders are coming in they do n't know before he places the order but once he does they 're already in line faster than you can be in line

the title of your question is quite different then the content   the term rat race was coined in the 70 's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more   fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness   just because one works does not mean they are participating in the rat race and i would recommend the following when i think of rat race i picture a a bumper to bumper of people struggling to get to work   for others it might be different but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities   some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel   sure one can like nice things but do we have to have everything that madison ave is trying to sell us   no   pick some nice things and pay cash debt especially consumer debt causes a person in effect to work for a bank   avoiding debt will remove those feelings saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings   there is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow   once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead       above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person 's financial life   it causes one to be humble and recognize that most people in this world are less fortunate that us   it avoids provide that justifies purchases that we can not afford    so yea you can avoid the rat race and still work

i had the same thing happen to my house i bought it in 2011 for which was the same as the fha appraised value because fha wo n't guarantee a loan for more than their appraiser thinks its worth january of last year i get the letter from the tax office and see that my house has been assessed at only i was shocked too until i read a similar document that phil told you to read the short of it is no matter what the tax assessor calls their calculation it is an assessment it was mass produced along with everyone else 's in your neighborhood by looking at its specs on paper house square footage age beds and by driving by your home to see its general condition the fact that your lawn may be less well kept than the last time they drove by could have affected the decision a little it 's very unlikely to have been a major determinant of the assessment the assessment value affects taxes and taxes only it is in most states a matter of public record and so it could be used by a potential buyer to negotiate a lower price however everyone in the housing business knows that the assessed value is not the market value and the buyer 's agent will be encouraging their client to make a more realistic bid this assessed value is not an appraisal value an appraisal is done by someone actually walking into and through your home the general condition inside and out to try to make a fair evaluation of what the home is actually worth that number is almost always going to be more than the assessment value because it takes into account all the amenities of the home the current fixtures the well kept or recently replaced flooring the energy efficient hvac and hot water system etc etc it also takes into account recent comparables what have other houses with the same general statistics the same amenities relatively close in location sold for recently that will still generally be different from the true market value of the home that value is nothing more or less than what a potential buyer will pay to have it at the time you decide to sell it and that in turn depends 100 on your potential buyers myriad situations someone may lowball even the assessed value because they 're looking for a deal and hoping you 're desperate you just reject the offer someone may be looking at comparables indicating the house is maybe overpriced by $ 10k you can counter and try to come to an agreement or your potential buyer could work five minutes from your house and be willing to pay at or above your asking price because the next best possibility is another 10 miles away since you are n't looking to sell the home none of this matters except to determine any escrow payments you might be making towards property taxes just keep making your mortgage payment and do n't worry about it if you really wanted to you could petition the state for a second opinion but you think the value should be higher if they agree with you they 'll raise the assessed value and you 'll pay more in taxes why in the world would you want to do that

i used for forex trading a couple years ago i am in the us but i think it 's available in the uk as well at the time they had no commissions and their spreads were comparable or better than other brokers the spreads would just quite considerably when a big event like a fed meeting or the unemployment figures come out but i suspect that that is the same everywhere or they have constant spreads and reject trades   they did not push the high like other brokers were at the time i considered this to be very reputable because though the profits to be gotten through leverage are great advertising the reality is that one unexpected spike and a newbie would lose a bunch of money in a margin call

i 've been in a similar situation before while contracting sometimes the recruiting agency would allow me to choose between being a w2 employee or invoicing them via i already had a company set up s corp but the considerations are similar typically the rate was higher than the w2 rate to account for the extra 7.65 fica taxes and insurance but there were a few times where the rate offered was identical and i still choose because it enabled me to deduct many of my business expenses that i would n't have otherwise been able to deduct in my case the deductions turned out to be greater than the fica savings your case is slightly different than mine though in that i already had the company set up so my company related costs were sunk as far as my decision was concerned for you though the yearly costs associated with running the business must be factored in for example suppose the following due to these expenses you need to make up $ in tax deductions due to the llc if your effective tax rate on the extra income is 30 then your break even point is approximately $ 8 k in deductions = > x = $ so with those made up numbers if you have at least $ 8 k in legitimate additional business expenses then it would make sense to form an llc otherwise you 'd be better off as a w2 other considerations

gt i think people should prevent themselves from being homeless by developing skills to work   you are right of course let me try to rephrase my question   if someone 's problem is that they do n't have the skills to work and you put pressure on them is it not more likely that they will try to resolve the pressure quickly with the skills they have rather than endure the pressure while learning a new skill   for example if someone is too unreliable to get a job and you tie his next meal to getting and keeping a job is n't that person much more likely to start stealing food rather than learning to be reliable while being hungry   gt do you think it 's moral to steal from someone who worked hard smart and give it to someone who did n't and is now homeless   i object to the word steal the bottom line is that some of the hard smart worker 's money is going to go handling the homeless person whether it be feeding him or hiring police to handle the crimes he commits

if you go to a grocery store and purchase retail gift cards along with other products and you pay with a credit card your credit card company generally does not know what you spent the money on they do n't get an itemized receipt if this is the case with your rewards card then yes you would get the cashback reward on the gift cards because all the credit card company knows is that you spent $ 100 at the grocery store they do n't know or care really that $ 50 of it was for an olive garden gift card this of course should be fairly easy to test   buy the gift card wait for your statement and see if they included the purchase when calculating your rewards note i do n't have an american express card but from some quick googling i see that it is possible that american express does actually receive itemized billing details on your purchases from some merchants   if your grocery store is sending this data to amex it is possible that the gift cards could be excluded from rewards   but again i suggest you just test it out and see

the only really good reason to open a line of credit is that you want to buy something that you do n't have money for that 's got its own risks see plenty of other places to see warnings about not borrowing too much the only other reason is that you might want to use a line of credit as your emergency fund the usual way of doing this is to keep the money in an easily savings account but such accounts usually pay rather now interest and there is an argument for instead investing your emergency money in a higher interest but less accessible fund and using a line of credit to tide you over until you can extract the money i 'm worried about the comment that you can deduct my interest on my tax returns that is usually only possible if you are borrowing money to invest it sounds as if your banker is going to persuade you to not only open a line of credit but then invest that money in something be aware that this kind of leveraging is much higher risk than investing money you already own

i think that there is insufficient infrastructure to support a company the size of gm selling only electric cars they would be making a huge assumption that people actually want what they 're offering and that the vast majority of the us will have the infrastructure to support it in a meaningful way   imagine if intel said you know what we 're only going to make cell phone processors from now on cell phones are the future and they 're more energy efficient so that 's all we 'll be making in 5 years   do you really think that so many people will stay loyal to the brand rather than jumping to amd or some other competitor who actually makes full size processors that their business will stay afloat at its current size   i 'm also going to guess that the segment of people who buy american and are loyal to general motors as a company has a pretty small overlap with people who want a glorified golf cart what about all the people that need big work trucks with hauling power that can run all day sounds like they 're being left out in the cold and i 'm sure ford would be thrilled to pick them up with the gas trucks they can produce throwing away an entire segment of your customer base is n't a very strong move when you 're trying to keep a business afloat hydrogen fuel cells sound nice but i have n't seen any proof that the technology has been developed enough to actually run a car in normal day to day they 're making a promise that nobody has delivered on   electric cars are a fine offering in addition to the internal combustion engines that still run the world but to replace them completely they 're nowhere close to that and the expenses to get that sort of project into full swing would bankrupt gm even if poor sales do n't   i think the big mistake is that people are looking at tesla 's success and attributing it to a huge consumer thirst for electric cars rather than to the savvy marketing and hype that formed around elon musk it 's a cult of personality people want a tesla because it 's cool they do n't want a leaf because it 's so darned economical gm obviously does n't get that

the answer depends on what else you 'd do with that 2   but first let 's look at some actual numbers for simplicity 's sake let 's say you have a £ 100k mortgage outstanding your payment is £ 1000 per month and you want to pay £ 1000 extra per month   2 interest compounded monthly for simplicity so = per month   your interest is probably compounded daily but this simplifies the math and is n't too far off of it if you do n't pay it off early then first month you 'll owe £ minus £ 1000 so £   second month £ after interest then £ after payment   so on and so forth   after 24th month 2 years you 'll owe £ after that 24th payment   so you 've paid off £ 20,000 of balance at the cost of £ 24,000 total interest paid £ if you do pay off another £ 1000 so you put a total of £ 2000 in per month which is penalized .02 each payment for a total of £ 48,000 paid over the 24 months   after that 24 months you have a balance of £ so a bit over £ 44k paid off at the cost of £ 48k total interest and fees paid £ so at the end of the 24 month period you 've paid an extra £ 24 in interest fees than you would have otherwise   you of course have a lower loan balance at the end but you have n't saved any money overall and if you 're just refinancing at this point into a new loan you 're no better off and very slightly worse off even assuming the money will just sit in your bank account and do nothing   i think with daily compounding interest it will be around the same or slightly better but it 's not a significant amount now there is a third option perhaps pay £ so after penalty £ on the first month   this is that whole extra £ 1000 per month all up front where it makes the most difference for interest this does help some you pay £ in interest around £ 450 less   sounds good to me right   except you might be able to make more than £ 450 with that £ 24,000   £ 450 is of £ 24,000 meaning you just need to make a 2 return on your money to beat out this option and in fact that 's not surprising given the 2 interest rate   investing in the market even conservatively is likely though not guaranteed to be beneficial over a 2 year period it 's fairly risky though if you can think over 5 10 years it 's very likely to be substantially better   even a 4 5 return well below long term market averages will be quite a bit better and the market 's down quite a bit right now so it might be even better than that though it 's still a risk you can make a term deposit looks like fixed rate bond is the term even and at least break even right now it looks like 1.9 is common for a 2 year term deposit in the uk in total my recommendation would be against paying off the mortgage early particularly in this 2 interest rate period   2 is around inflation levels meaning you 're not really paying any real interest from one point of view   once the rates are higher then it may be worth considering    the exception here basically the standard exception to these questions is if you are otherwise going to spend the money on luxuries   in that case you 're better off prepaying the mortgage at least from a personal finance perspective if you can do so up front but not if you 're going to do it monthly   what is better for you personally in this regard is a question only you can answer of course

a company has 100,000 shares and 100,000 unexercised call options company issued share price and strike price both at $ 1 what country is this related to    i ask because in the us most people i know associate a call option with the instrument that is equivalent to 100 shares    so 100,000 calls would be 10,000,000 shares which exceeds the number of shares you 're saying the company has    i do n't know if that means you pulled the numbers out of thin air or whether it means you 're thinking of a different type of option perhaps you meant incentive stock options meant to be given to employees   each one of those is equivalent to a single share   they just are n't called call options in the rest of my answer i 'm going to assume you meant stock options i assume the fact that these options exist will slow any price increases on the underlying shares due to potential dilution i do n't think the company can just create stock options without creating the underlying shares in the first place   said another way a more likely scenario is that company creates 200,000 shares and agrees to float 50 of them while reserving the other 50 as the pool for incentive employee stock   they then choose to give the employees options on the stock in the incentive pool rather than outright grants of the stock for various reasons   one of which is being nice to the employees in regards to taxes since there is no us tax due at grant time if the strike price is the current price of the underlying stock an alternative scenario when the company shares are traded is that the company simply plans to buy back shares from the market in order to give employees their shares when options are exercised   in this case the company needs the cash on hand or cash flow to take money from to buy those shares at current prices anyway in either case there is no dilution happening when the options get exercised   any dilution happened before or at the time the options were created    meaning the total number of shares in the company was already pre set at an earlier time   as a result the fact that the options exist in themselves will not slow price changes on the stock however price changes will be impacted by the total float of shares in the company or the impact to cash flow if the company has to buy shares to redeem its option commitments    this is almost the same thing you 're asking about but it is technically different as to timing if this is the case can this be factored into any option pricing models like black scholes you 're including the effect just by considering the total float of shares and net profits from cash flow when doing your modelling

i 'm not aware that any us bank has any way to access your credit rating in france especially as you basically do n't have one in the us banks are not the only way to get finance for a home   in many regions there are plenty of owner financed or owner will carry homes   for these the previous owner will provide a private mortgage for the balance if you have a large downpayment   no strict lending rules no fancy credit scoring systems just a large enough downpayment so they know they 'll get their money back if they have to foreclose   for the seller it 's a way to shift a house that is hard to sell plus get a regular income often this mortgage is for only 3 10 years but that gives you the time to establish more credit and then refinance   maybe the interest rate is a little higher also but again it 's just until you can refinance to something better or sell other assets then pay the loan off quick for new homes the builders developers may offer similar finance for both owner will carry and developer finance a large deposit will trump any credit rating concerns   there is usually a simplified foreclosure process so they 're not really taking much of a risk so can afford to be flexible make sure the owner mortgage is via a title company trust company or escrow company so that there 's a third party involved to ensure each party lives up to their obligations

bonds are valued based on all of this using the concept of the time value of money simply stated money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later case in point let 's say the par value of a bond is $ 100 and will mature 10 years from this date these are common terms for most bonds though the u.s. treasury has a variety of bonds with varying par values and maturation periods with a 0 coupon rate nothing 's paid out prior to maturity if the company or government issuing the bonds needs one million dollars and the people buying the bonds are expecting a 5 rate of return on their investment then each bond would only sell for about $ 62 and the bond issuer would have to sell a par value of $ million in bonds to get its $ 1 m now these numbers are based on equations that calculate the future value of an investment made now and conversely the present value of a future return back to that time value of money concept money now that you 're paying to buy the bond is worth more than money later that you 'll get back at maturity so you will expect to be returned more than you invested to account for this time difference the percentage of rate of return is known as the yield or the discount rate depending on what you 're calculating what else you take into consideration when defining the rate like inflation and whom you talk to now that $ m in par value may be hard for the bond issuer to swallow the issuer is effectively paying interest on interest over the lifetime of the bond instead many issuers choose to issue coupon bonds which have a coupon rate determining the amount of a coupon payment this can be equated pretty closely with you making interest only payments on a credit card balance each period in which interest is compounded you pay the amount of interest that has accrued to avoid this compounding effect   from an accounting standpoint the coupon rate lowers the amount of real monies paid the same $ 1 m in bonds maturing in 10 years with a 5 expected rate of return but with a 5 coupon rate now only requires payments totalling $ 1.5 m and that half million in interest is paid $ 50k at a time annually or $ 25k semi annually but from a finance standpoint because the payments made in the first few years are worth more than the payments made closer to and at maturity the present value of all these coupon payments plus the maturity payout is higher than if the full payout happened at maturity and so the future value of the total investment is higher   coupon rates on bonds thus allow a bond issuer to plan a bond package in less complicated terms if you as a small business need $ 1 m for a project which you will repay in 10 years and during that time you are willing to tolerate a 5 interest rate on the outstanding money then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ 1 million worth to mature in 10 years and a 5 coupon rate now whether the market is willing to accept that rate is up to the market right now they 'd be over the moon with that rate and would be willing to buy the bonds for more than their face value because the present value would then match the yield they 're willing to accept as in any market system you as the seller will sell to the highest bidder to get the best price available if however they think you are a bad bet they 'll want an even higher rate of return and so the present value of all coupon and maturity payments will be less than the par value and so will the purchase price

when the inflation rate increases this tends to push up interest rates because of supply and demand if the interest rate is less than the inflation rate then putting your money in the bank means that you are losing value every day that it is there so there 's an incentive to withdraw your money and spend it now if say i 'm planning to buy a car and my savings are declining in real value then if i buy a car today i can get a better car than if i wait until tomorrow when interest rates are high compared to inflation the reverse is true my savings are increasing in value so the longer i leave my money in the bank the more it 's worth if i wait until tomorrow to buy a car i can get a better car than i would be able to buy today also people find alternative places to keep their savings if a savings account will result in me losing value every day my money is there then maybe i 'll put the money in the stock market or buy gold or whatever so for the banks to continue to get enough money to make loans they have to increase the interest rates they pay to lure customers back to the bank there is no reason per se for rising interest rates to consumers to directly cause an increase in the inflation rate inflation is caused by the money supply growing faster than the amount of goods and services produced interest rates are a cost if interest rates go up people will borrow less money and spend it on other things but that has no direct effect on the total money supply except you may note i put a bunch of in that paragraph in the united states the federal reserve loans money to banks it creates this money out of thin air so when the interest that the federal reserve charges to the banks is low the banks will borrow more from the feds as this money is created on the spot this adds to the money supply and thus contributes to inflation so if interest rates to consumers are low this encourages people to borrow more money from the banks which encourages the banks to borrow more from the feds which increases the money supply which increases inflation i do n't know much about how it works in other countries but i think it 's similar in most nations

it is important to consider your overall financial goals especially in the 3 5 year range if you have another financial goal which can not be met without that additional money then meeting that financial goal might take priority over what i am about to say your mortgage rate is another important factor to consider when answering this question extra mortgage payments are equivalent to investing that money in a very low risk investment with an equivalent yield of the mortgage rate because you will be paying that much less per year in interest actually when you consider that mortgage interest is often tax deductible the equivalent yield should be reduced by your income tax rate typically it is not possible to find such a low risk investment with a yield as high as your mortgage rate for example current mortgage rates are over twice as high as the yield of a one year cd   also keep in mind that additional mortgage payments help you build equity this equity will most likely be applied to your next home purchase if so their effect will be in place throughout the life of your next mortgage too

there are way too many details missing to be able to give you an accurate answer and it would be too localized in terms of time location anyway the rules change every year and your local taxes make the answer useless to other people instead here 's how to figure out the answer for yourself use a tax estimate calculator to get a ballpark figure and keep in mind that these only provide estimates because there are still a lot of variables that are only considered when you 're actually filling out your real tax return there are a number of calculators if you search for something like tax estimator calculator some are more sophisticated than others fair warning i used several of these and they told me a range of $ 2k $ 25k worth of taxes owed for a situation like yours here 's an estimator from turbotax it 's handy because it lets you enter business income when i plug in $ 140 k $ 70 40 hours 50 weeks for business income in 2010 married filing jointly no spouse income and 4 dependents i get $ 30 k owed in federal taxes that does n't include local taxes any itemized deductions you might be eligible for ira deductions etc you may also be able to claim some expenses as business deductions that will reduce your taxable business income so you 'd net $ 110 k after taxes or about $ $ 110k 50 40 of course you could get an answer from the calculator and congress could change the rules through the year you might come out better or worse depending on the nature of the rule changes that 's why i stress that it 's an estimate if you take the job do n't forget to make estimated tax payments edit some additional info if you plan on doing this on an ongoing basis i.e. you are going into business as a contractor for this line of work there are some tax shelters that you can take advantage of most of these wo n't be worth doing if you are only going to be doing contract work for a short period of time 1 2 years these may or may not all be applicable to you and do your research into these areas before diving in i 'm just scratching the surface in the notes below

there is n't a single rate that works in both directions   there are two rates one for each direction   so if $ 1 = inr you may find that 100 inr = $    in fact it 's even worse than that   the rates are just the average values at which transactions occur   what happens in the real world is that someone presumably your bank in this instance offers to sell 100 inr for some amount perhaps $   other traders may either accept this price or refuse to trade   if they refuse to trade the bank may accept one of their offers perhaps $    anyway the answer to your question is that whomever does the actual conversion keeps the difference   of course they may then lose that money if the value falls before they sell   more either your bank or your friend 's bank could do the conversion itself   either or both could hold balances in various currencies so that they do n't have to rely on the of the exchange market   this is called a money market account and banks let their customers invest in them    it is a bit more likely to be your bank that gets the money than your friend 's bank   your friend 's bank does n't actually need to know that your account is in usd   they just transfer the amount in inr   it 's your bank that has to convert that into usd to deposit in your account

i think a larger issue is that you 're trying to do market timing whether you had a large or small amount of money to invest no one wants to put the money in to watch it go down   you ca n't really predict if prices in a market or security will go up in six months in which case you want to put all your cash in now of if it will go down in which case you 'd want to wait until the bottom or if it will around in which case you 'd want to only buy at the bottoms   of course if you 're magic enough to nail all of those market conditions you 're a master finance trader and will quickly make billions if you 're really concerned with protecting your money and want to take some long positions i 'd look into some put options you 'll of course pay the fees for those put options but they 'll protect your downside   much of this depends on your time horizon at the age of 35 someone can expect to see ~6 more recessions and perhaps ~30 more market corrections before retirement with that big of a time range it 's best to avoid micro optimizing since that tends to hurt your performance overall because you wo n't be able to time the market correctly most of the time   one thing that 's somewhat reasonable if you have the stomach for it is to not buy at somewhat obvious market highs and wait for corrections this is n't fool proof by any means but as an example many people realized that us equities basically were on a ~5 year up run by december 2014 many people cashed out those positions expecting that a correction would be due and around late summer of 2015 that correction came for those with patience they made ~15 with a few mouse clicks   of course many others would have been waiting for that correction since 2010 and missed out on the market increases   boiled down

in the us and in most other countries dividends are considered income when paid and capital gains losses are considered income loss when realized this is called in accounting recognition we recognize income when cash reaches our pocket for tax purposes so for dividends it is when they 're paid and for gains when you actually sell assuming the price of that fund never changes you have this math do to when you sell of course the capital loss gain may change by the time you actually sell and realize it but assuming the only price change is due to the dividends payout it 's a wash

we do n't seem to have expats or australians on the site yet but i 'll share what i have learned   i 'm taking advantage of your profile information listing you as a software developer    a friend of mine is currently doing a study of national it professional societies for his mba project one of his goals is to understand which funding models are effective in the absence of mandatory licensing   consider most developers do n't need to be a member of an organization in order to practice such organizations you or others may be familiar with are the british computer society the canadian information processing society or in the u.s. the association for computing machinery and computer society cs to the point my friend told me recently that the australian computer society acs makes money by assisting the australian government in determining immigration eligibility   so i went to the acs site and started digging   the australian computer society acs    is the designated professional    assessing authority for persons    seeking to apply for skilled migration    as it computing professionals see acs 's pre application skills assessment page   that page also links out to the australian government 's department of immigration and citizenship in particular to a document titled general skilled migration pdf   here are some interesting points i discovered relating just to fees the government recommends if you do want professional help to use a registered migration agent   there will be fees for such an agent   see what does it cost to use an agent   currently or ~ £ 850 ~ £ there will be a fee for the immigration application process itself see professionals and other skilled migrants visa charges outside australia   currently total of aud or ~ £ also you also need to have your skills    assessed by the relevant assessing    authority as suitable for working in    your nominated occupation   page 7 and you need to do that before you even apply   the acs costs and charges page shows a cost of aud 400 or ~ £ 225 for the general application so i think the answer is yes you 'd certainly want to have ample savings to cover the red tape stuff perhaps ~ £ 6000 judging from the above alone   add your travel moving and living expenses etc best of luck   australia sounds exciting   have you considered canada

unless a study accounts for whether the users are following a budget or not it is irrelevant to those who are trying to take their personal finances seriously i can certainly believe that those who have no budget will spend more on a credit card than they will on a debit card or with cash under the right circumstances spending with cards can actually be a tool to track and reduce spending if you can see on a monthly and yearly basis where all of your money was spent you have the information to make decisions about the small expenses that add up as well as the obvious large expenses   debit cards and credit cards offer the same advantage of giving you an electronic record of all of your transactions but debit cards do not come with the same fraud protection that credit cards have so i and many people like me prefer to use credit cards for security reasons alone cash back and other rewards points bolster the case for credit cards over debit cards it is very possible to track all of your spending with cash but it is also more work the frustration of accounting for bad and every transaction multiple times is worth discussing too as a reason that people get discouraged and give up on budgeting my point is simply that credit cards and the electronic records that they generate can greatly simplify the process of tracking your spending i doubt any study out there accounts for the people who are specifically using those benefits and what effect it has on their spending

the difference is that for the one year time frame the data is represented based on daily data and the sma is 20 days whilst for the 5 year timeframe the data is automatically represented as weekly data with the sma represented by 20 weeks not 20 days anymore this happens due to daily data on this chart being too much data to represent over a 5 year period so the data defaults to weekly data over such a long period if the chart is represented as weekly data then any indicators will also have to be represented in weekly data if you use a more sophisticated charting program you can actually select to see daily or weekly data over longer periods such as 5 years or more

you raise a good point about the higher marginal rates for 401 k but things will be different in retirement than they are for you now   first off you are going to have a boat load of money   like probably a multi millionaire   also your ability to invest will probably increase greater than the maximum allowable to invest   for this money you might choose to invest in real estate debt payoff or non qualified mutual funds    so fast forward to retirement time   you have a few million in your 401 k you own your house and outright and maybe a couple of rental properties   for one your expenses are much lower   you do n't have to invest pay social security taxes or service debt   clothing gas dry cleaning are all lower as well    you will draw some income off of non qualified plans   this might include rental real estate business income or equity investments   you can also draw social security income   for most of us social security will provide sustenance living   enough for food medical transportation etc   add in some non qualified income and the fact that you are debt free or nearly so and you might not need to draw on your 401k.    plus if you do need to withdraw you can cherry pick when and what amount you withdraw   compare that to now your employer pays you your salary   most of us do not have the ability to defer our compensation   with a 401 k you can for example lets say you want a new car where you need to withdraw from your 401 k to pay for it    in retirement you can withdraw the full amount and pay cash   part of this money will be taxed at the lowest rate part at higher rates   car price dependent in retirement you can take a low interest or free loan and only withdraw enough to make the payments this year   presumably this will be at the lowest rate now you only have one choice   using your top marginal rate to pay for the car   it does n't matter if you have a loan or not

as a follow up i was able to find a bank that gave me a loan i just called several banks listed on yelp and one ended up working with me it is also possible that the previous banks misunderstood me and assumed i was 1099 and not w2 i made it very clear to this guy that i was w2 and there was absolutely no problem also it turned out the recruiter i work for has special paperwork their employees can give to lenders to verify w2 employment so i have been in my condo since january and the condo was a little under $ 250k. anyway i still think it 's absolutely ridiculous that banks would not give a loan to a web developer who is in super high demand and making well over 100k year even if i am 1099 i have never ever in my life been late on a single payment for anything and i have an 800 credit score to even question that i could not make payments is ludicrous whenever i put my resume on just one web site i receive about 20 phone calls daily and i am not exaggerating even slightly

debt is nominal which means when inflation happens the value of the money owed goes down   this is great for the borrower and bad for the lender investing can mean a lot of different things   frequently it is used to describe buying common stock which is an ownership claim on a company   a company is not a nominally fixed asset by which i mean if there was a bunch of inflation and nothing else happened i.e. the inflation was not the cause or result of some other economic change then the nominal value of the company will go up along with the prices of other things based on the above i 'd say you are incorrect to treat debt and investment returns the same way with respect to inflation   when we say equity returns 9 we mean it returns a real 7 plus 2 inflation or whatever   if the rate of inflation increased to 10 and nothing else happened in the economy the same equity would be expected to return 17   in fact the company 's nominally fixed debts would be worth less increasing the real value of the company at the expense of their debt holders on the other hand if we entered a period of high inflation your debt liability would go way down and you would have benefited greatly from borrowing and investing at the same time    if you are expecting inflation in the abstract sense then borrowing and investing in common stock is a great idea inflation is frequently the result or cause of a period of economic trouble so please be aware that the above makes sense if we treat inflation as the only thing that changed   if inflation came about because opec makes oil crazy expensive millennials just stop working all of our factories got bombed to or trade wars have shut down international commerce then the value of stocks would most definitely be affected   in that case it 's not really inflation that affected the stock returns though

on most of the consumer electronics it would not make much sense to get insurance mostly these are not priced right are typically priced higher ie there is no study to arrive at equivalent claim rates as in motor vehicle further on most of the items there is adequate manufacturing warranty to take care of initial defects and on most it would make sense to buy a newer model as in todays world consumer electronics are not only getting cheaper by the day but are also have more function features

the formula you need is     m = r pv 1     m = monthly payment $ 350   r = interest per period 12 =   n = number of periods 36 months   pv = present value or here your max loan amount given m     therefore   $ 350 = pv 1 1 +    the denominator on the right ends up equal to ~ when you do the math in your calculator carry that over to the by multiplying both sides of the equation by     this results in $ = pv     divide $ by to get pv = $ roughly     hope this helps explain it

ah yes the report that makes some very strange assumptions such as the following   people drive less than 100 miles per week miles per year or just over 14 miles a day   people are moving at all times while driving and at a constant speed the factories making the batteries are entirely powered by fossil fuels   your non electric vehicle had zero emissions during its own production you do n't have a lead acid battery in your non electric vehicle your non electric vehicle took no emissions to reach the lot where you bought it   with a narrow enough constraint a person can make anything appear true however once those constraints are themselves examined the silliness of it becomes quite clear

it 's probably advantageous to stop depositing into a 401(k when one is no longer receiving payroll deductions into them other than that why would you want to give up the benefits remember 401(k is just the kind of account most offer a variety of investment options within them and let you move money between those so you can rebalance to suit your currently preferred risk return tradeoffs without having to break them open you might sometimes want to reduce your contribution for a while if you have immediate cashflow needs elsewhere but try to avoid doing that compound returns are a good thing and the earlier the money goes in the more you get back from it

why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way     down because if you sell shares out of your own portfolio by definition you are not selling short at all if you sell something you own and deliver it then there is no short involved a short is defined as a net negative position i.e. you sell shares you do not have selling shares you own is selling shares you own no short involved you must borrow the shares for a short because in the stock market you must deliver you can not deliver shares you do not own the stock market does not work on promises the person who bought the shares expects ownership of them with all rights that gives them so you borrow them to deliver them then return them when you buy them back

well the first one is based on the formula for continuously compounded present value while the second one is the periodically compounded variant   typically the continuously compounded models represent the ideal as the compounding period of time valued money shrinks towards zero and the discount rate or interest rate if positive stays constant over the time period examined the periodic equation 's results approach that of the continuously compounded equation those two assumptions a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest that allow simplification to the continuous form are usually incorrect in real world finance virtually all financial institutions accrue interest monthly for a variety of reasons including simpler bookkeeping and less money paid or owed in interest they also unless prohibited by contract accrue this interest based on a rate that can change daily or even more based on what financial markets are doing most often the calculation is periodic based on the average daily balance and an agreed rate that if variable is based on the average daily rate over the previous observed period so you should use the first form for fast calculation of a rough value based on estimated variables you should use the second form when you have accurate periodic information on the variables involved stated alternately use the first form to predict the future use the second form in retrospect to the past

the hard and fast rule is to pay off high interest loans first but each individual 's situation is different so there are some things to consider student loan interest is tax deductible up to $ 2,500   will your student loan interest exceed $ 2,500 for the year   if so i would try to pay down the student loan first to bring down the total interest for the year so that you get as much interest back as possible on your tax return   also it may be beneficial to pay off the car first to close that account so that you are only left with the 1 loan   once you have the car loan payment out of the way you can dedicate that amount to paying off the student loan i 'm in almost the same situation as you   i currently have a mortgage and car payment   in 6 months my grace period will be over and my student loan payments will start   i have $ 100k in student loan debt   so i will have a $ 1,100 mortgage payment $ 1,100 student loan payment and $ 700 car payment car loan is 0   i do n't want to have 3 loans active so i will pay off my car loan in a 2 3 months to get that out of the way   then i will pay down my student loan by paying $ 700 extra every month

if i have a asset a with expected return of 100 and by standard deviation 1 and asset b with expected return of 1 and risk 100 would it be rational to put asset b into the portfolio in the capital asset pricing model capm investors are rational and have access to perfect information asset a sounds like an excellent investment   b like a lousy one b is probably very far from the efficient frontier investors know this so a 's market capitalization will be high b 's low according to the capm you should then do the same rational thing everyone else is doing which is to buy a lot of a and very little of b each in proportion to its market capitalization of course the capm is just a model and like any model it is only as good as its assumptions however i think this particular application of the model gives a pretty reasonable common sense answer to the question

what you should do is called re characterization see the instructions for form 8606 for details that is also the form to use to report the incident see example 3 you made a contribution to a roth ira and later part    or all of it to a traditional ira report the nondeductible    traditional ira portion if any on form 8606 part i. if you did not    recharacterize the entire contribution do not report the remaining    roth ira portion of the contribution on form 8606 attach a statement    to your return explaining the recharacterization if the    recharacterization occurred in 2012 include the amount transferred    from the roth ira on form 1040 line form 1040a line or    form 1040nr line if the recharacterization occurred in 2013    report the amount transferred only in the attached statement and not    on your 2012 or 2013 tax return you re characterize it back to traditional ira contribution which will not be deductible you then convert it back to a roth ira basically you end up at exactly the same place except that if you already had some gains on that amount you 'll have to pay tax on them now for the conversion since because of the re characterization it will now be gains in a traditional ira you should of course contact your broker to do the re characterization of the amount and its gains from a roth ira account to a traditional ira account

your question contains two different concepts fractional reserve banking and debt based money   when thinking of these two things i think it is important to analyze these items separately before trying to understand how the whole system works fractional reserve banking as others have pointed out fractional reserve banking is not a ponzi scheme   it can be fraudulent however   if a bank tells all its depositors that they can withdrawal their money at any time i.e. on demand and the bank then proceeds to loan out some portion of the depositors money then the bank has committed fraud since there is no way they could honor the depositors requests for their money if many of them came for their money at one time   this is true regardless of what type of money is deposited dollars gold etc   this is how most modern banks operate debt based money historically the fed would introduce new money by buying us treasuries   this means federal reserve notes are backed by us treasuries   i agree that this seems strange   does this mean if i take my frns to the fed i could redeem them for us treasuries   but us treasuries are promises to pay frns in the future   this makes my head hurt   reminds me of the definition for see here is an experiment   what if we wanted to recreate frns today and none existed   the us government would offer a note to pay 100 frns in one year and pay 5 interest on the note   the fed would print up its first 100 frns to buy the note from the us government   the us government would spend the frns   the first 100 frns have now entered into circulation   at the end of the note 's term the fed should have 105 frns since the government agreed to pay 5 interest on the note   but how is the us government going to pay the interest and principal on the note when only 100 frns exist   i think this is the central point to your question    i can come up with only two answers 1 the fed must purchase some assets that are not debt based 2 the us government must continue to issue debt that is purchased by newly printed frns in order to pay back older debt and interest   this is a ponzi scheme the record debt levels seem to indicate the ponzi scheme option was chosen

other answers here cover some of the basics but this is also a great time to start establishing a credit history and developing good financial habits to carry throughout your life in addition to opening a free checking account with the local credit union establish an overdraft line of credit on that account never close this account or this line of credit as it will work to increase the average age of your accounts when you apply for credit later in life if you are disciplined with your use of credit cards you may also want to apply for a low limit credit card through the same credit union for the same purpose as above never carry a balance on this card but make minor purchases with it each month never more than 20 of the balance maybe just buy gas with it start tracking all of your spending and make a monthly budget there are a lot of online tools that make this very easy establishing the habit now will help you make informed financial decisions in the future open a roth ira and put at least 10 of your money away for retirement in the future your income may increase enough to put you in the 25 tax bracket if that ever happens open a regular ira and put the money there instead also when you have employers that offer 401k matching do the same thing with a roth 401k account keep your money invested in a low cost index fund

a free $ 50 looks too good to be true as others already pointed out these offers are common to many cards that want you to build loyalty towards a particular company e.g. airlines cards give lots of mileage for a decent initial spend should i get this card for the $ 50 why and/or why not how much do you spend on amazon or are planning to do so in future this offer has been around for ages earlier they used to offer much smaller amounts of $ 20 for signing up and you never saw it so probably you wo n't be really using the site frequently in that case its just a matter of whether $ 50 is worth the hassle for you to sign up and then later cancel if you do n't want to manage another new card the hit to credit score is likely to be minimal unless you do such offers often as such for a person who rarely buys on amazon i would n't advise you to sign up for this card there are better rewards cards that are not as tied to a particular site such as chase freedom discover etc if however you are a regular shopper but just never noticed this prompt earlier then it is worthwhile to get this or even consider the prime version which you will get or be automatically upgraded to if the account has prime membership that gives 5 back instead of 3 on amazon

another way to look at this is that pure insider trading is an activity with the aim to use secret information to make personal profit or let others make personal profit at the expense of the company shareholders or investors in buybacks it is not company managers to get personal gain in this would be insider trading the end winners in this case are the shareholders so there is nothing inherently bad in buying back stock moreover it is a general practice to buy shares back as opposed to paying dividends when the company sees its shares being undervalued of course provided that it has the cash borrowing ability to implement this since it creates shareholders value thereby maximising shareholder wealth which is one of the primary tasks of the company managers

no something does n't seem right here   there would be virtually no time value to the option 10 minutes before market close on the expiration day what option is it and what is the expiration edit it appears you were looking only at the ask price it was $ however the bid price was only $ 1.35 and the last transaction was $ 1.40 so the true value is right about $ 1.35 to $ 1.40 at this second   this is a pitfall that tends to occur when you trade options with almost no volume for instance the open interest in that option is only 1 contract assuming that is yours so the bid and the ask can often be very far apart as they are only being generated by computer traders or the result of outdated irrelevant human orders

let 's define better the situation and then analyze it start with end with process so b has the same amount of money just in a different bank account but a and c changed states a now does n't have money and c does as the result of the transaction between a b and c. the gift tax issue i see is the transfer of money from a you to c your brother if you 're a us tax resident then you have $ 14 k exemption from gift tax per person per year £ 20 k is more than that so it will be subject to the tax the fact that a third person was involved as an intermediary is irrelevant for the purpose of gift tax there 's no distinction between using a bank for transfers or a private party keep in mind that paying tuition directly to the institution on behalf of your brother may help you mitigate your gift tax liability tuition payment made on behalf of your brother is exempt from gift tax but it has to be made directly to the institution it can not pass through your brother

currencies that are pegged or fixed require that foreign currencies are held by the central issuer at a proportional amount this is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from in the form of its own currency we will continue with this analogy if the central bank says these shares are worth $ 1 but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $ 0.80 and decreasing then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank 's solvency people will know the $ 1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services especially when it comes to imports shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor which happens no matter what the government 's are for doing so swiss national bank central bank did this in early 2015 as it experienced volatility in the euro which it had previously been trying to keep it 's currency pegged to it became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own the central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve such as selling a lot of foreign currency x buying more of currency y. they can and do take losses doing this swiss national bank is maintaining a large loss they can also flood their economy with more of their currency diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent this is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds people colloquially call this printing money but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools the good and service goes onto the central bank 's balance book and the company entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash another reading is that the bond is as good as cash the bond did n't previously exist until the central bank said it did and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds bond monetization also called quantitative easing is practiced by the federal reserve in the united states bank of japan european central bank and now the central bank of the republic of china

suppose the stock is $ 41 at expiry the graph says i will lose money i think i paid $ for net debit at this price i would make money not lose what am i missing the ` net debit does n't have anything to do with your p l graph your graph is also showing your profit and loss for now and only one expiration your trade has two expirations and i do n't know which one that graph is showing that is the mystery behind that graph regardless your puts are mitigating your loss as you would expect if you did n't have the put you would simply lose more money at that particular price range if you do n't like that particular range then you will have to consider a different contract it was originally a simple covered call i added a put to protect from stock going lower your strike prices are all over the place and has a contract at every whole number there is nothing simple about this trade you typically wo n't find an always profitable combination of options also changes in volatility can distort your projects greatly

if you are a permanent resident and it was n't taken away or abandoned then you are a resident alien for u.s. tax purposes one of the two tests for being a resident alien is the green card test being a resident alien means all your worldwide income is subject to u.s. taxes regardless of where you live or work that does n't necessarily mean you need to actually pay taxes on your income again if you 've already paid it you may be able to use the foreign tax credit to reduce your taxes by the amount already paid to a foreign government but you need to report it on u.s. tax forms just like income from the u.s. and you can then apply any tax credits that you may qualify for as a resident alien you file taxes using form 1040 you are required to file taxes if your income for a particular year is above a certain threshold this threshold is described in the first few pages of the 1040 instructions for each year for 2013 for single filing status under 65 it is $ 10000 the only way you can legally not file is if your income the whole year was below this amount you should go back and file taxes if you were required to but failed to having filed taxes when required is very important if you want to later on it is also one component of demonstrating you 're maintaining residency in the u.s. which you 're required to do as a permanent resident being outside the u.s. for a long time or else you 'll lose your permanent residency even filing taxes might not be enough as your description of your presence in the u.s. shows you only go there for brief periods each year not really living there you 're lucky you have n't lost your green card already any time you go there you run a great risk of them noticing and taking it away

my experience with owning a home is that its like putting down roots and can be like an anchor holding you to an area   before considering whether you can financially own a home consider some of the other implications once you own it you are stuck for awhile and can not quickly move away like you can with renting   so if a better job opportunity comes up or your employer moves you to another office across town that doubles your commute time you 'll be regretting the home purchase as it will be a barrier to moving to a more convenient location    i along with my fiancée and two children are being forced to move out of my parents home asap   do not rush buying a home   take your time and find what you want   i made the mistake once of buying a home thinking i could take on some diy remodeling to correct some features i was n't fond of   life and finding extra time for diy house updates does n't come easy especially with children    speaking of children consider the school district when buying a home too   often times homes in good school districts cost more   if you do n't consider the school district now then you may be faced with a difficult decision when the kids start school    if you are confident you wo n't want to move anytime soon and can find a house you like and want to jump into home ownership there are some programs that can help first time buyers but they can require some effort on your part   fha has a first time buyer program with a 3.5 down payment   you will need to search for a lender that offers fha loans and work with them   fha covers this program by charging mortgage insurance every month that 's part of your house payment fannie mae has the program where first time home buyers can purchase a foreclosed home from their inventory for as little as 3 down and possibly get up to 3 from the seller to apply toward closing costs   private mortgage insurance pmi is required with this program too   their inventory of homes can be found on the website there is also which requires attending workshops and creating a detailed plan to prove you 're ready for homeownership   this might be a good option if they have workshops in your area and you want to talk with someone in person

section 8 housing at least these days is a scam meant to funnel poor and into shitty areas and shitty housing away from the wealthy affluent areas that have decent jobs and services int he 70s people on assistance which includes lots of minorities were entering into middle class or better white neighborhoods and making racists and angry so then they decided people on section 8 were spending too much money on rent and instead moved them to cheaper section 8 housing blocks of course areas purposefully concentrated with people all on government assistance would never flourish economically but it does make the surrounding land cheaper thus you can build and cram even more section 8 people into that area and get paid by the government to do it   unsurprisingly you do n't have a flourishing economy in an area mainly composed of poor people with the cheapest and shittiest housing they can legally make no businesses want to move there so crime rates go up and desirability keeps going down

note i am in the uk i do n't know specifically about australia but i expect the general principles will be much the same everywhere what banks want is to be confident that you have a steady income stream that will continue to pay the until it completes   in general employed are fairly easy to assess most employed people will have a steady basic pay that increases through their career will usually seperate out basic pay overtime and bonuses there is little to cook the books the self employed are harder to assess income can be and there are far more for cooking the books to make it look like you are earning more than you really are so banks are likely to be far more careful about lending to the self employed they will likely want to see multiple years of buisness records so that any bursts whether natural due to the and flows of buisness or created to cook the books average out and they can see the overall pattern a large deposit will help because it reduces the risk to the bank in the event of a default similarly not being anywhere near your limit of affordability will help

assuming a person knows how to use and invest their money wisely would it still be a bad idea to entirely disregard a 401k plan yes a 401k like an ira is a qualified plan and as such enjoys certain legal protections   for a roth 401k the taxes are paid now and the interest accumulates tax free and withdrawals will be tax free doing it on your own means that your own savings will have interest taxed as you earn it   for a traditional 401k current savings are deducted from current earnings and the withdrawals will be taxed doing it on your own loses the deferral of tax at this time    generally 401ks and iras are highly resistant to judgements in civil lawsuits if you file for bankruptcy protection at any time in your working career the assets in these accounts are immune in most states from being used to pay off your creditors if you do it on your own that savings account will be emptied to pay off creditors in bankruptcy and also will be assets that can be taken from you in civil judgements for example you get in a car accident and they sue you you might never be sued nor file bankruptcy in your entire life but you are unnecessarily exposing yourself to risks anything might happen in the next 50 years what you will lose in such circumstances far outweighs any perceived benefits you could possibly earn by rolling your own if you are the sort of person who can max out your 401k and ira contributions each year and still have a significant sum to set aside for savings you should contact an investment advisor and attorney to see about protecting your assets

the stock market 's principal justification is matching investors with investment opportunities   that 's only reasonably feasible with long term investments   high frequency traders are not interested in investments they are interested in buying cheap and selling expensive   holding reasonably robust shares for longer binds their capital which is one reason the faster paced business of dealing with options is popular instead   so their main manner of operation is off actually investments by letting the investors pay more than the recipients of the investments receive by now the majority of stock market business is indirect and tries guessing where the money goes rather than where the business goes for one thing this leads to the stock market 's evaluations being largely inflated over the actual underlying committed deals happening   and as the commitment to an investment becomes rare the market becomes more volatile and it 's money running in circles fast trading is about running in front of where the money goes anticipating the market   but if there is no actual market to anticipate only people running before the imagination of other people running before money the net payout to zero as the ratio of serious actual investments in tangible targets declines by and large high frequency trading to a ponzi scheme and you try being among the winners of such a scheme   but there are a whole lot of people competing here and essentially the net payoff is close to zero due to the large volumes in circulation as opposed to what ends up in actual tangible investments it 's a completely different game with different rules riding on the original idea of a stock market   so you have to figure out what your money should be doing according to your plans

while many answers correctly cite the effect of monopoly power there is a cost issue that no one has yet posted   i first recall seeing this cost effect in a managerial econ textbook perhaps 's    the theater must clean up the popcorn mess   the sales of popcorn elsewhere does not usually include the costs of disposal because that cost is not borne by the vendor    in a theater the cost of disposal which is a variable cost depending on the amount and type of sold is borne by the vendor who must pay employees to clean up between shows and at the end of the night   while most people are responsible with popcorn there is a long tail of more and more costly messes left by the customer   and if the theater the cost of cleaning the messes then rats with long tails will bite into future customer demand for tickets whether this cost effect is as large as the monopoly power effect and the synergy in willingness to pay between entertainment and is not clear   all of these effects may be in operation

they close accounts to render them   they never delete accounts because they want to retain the data to inform any future decision to give you credit      also 99 of the time if a customer demands their account be deleted it 's because of adverse credit marks and the angry customer wants this accurate information to stop burning their credit report the answer in this case absolutely must be heck no   that pretty much precludes any valid reason to delete an account   as such their business systems are not built in a way to make account deletion really possible even if you got a job with the company 's data processing department and had direct query write to the databases you would find it technically to remove the specific data without risking serious damage to the entire db   and it would still be in transaction logs so not gone forever    another reason to keep your account alive is to give you online access to statements   after all the irs can audit you 5 years after the fact so it 's real nice to be able to go back that far   most places the statue of limitations is 6 7 years so again defending yourself in a lawsuit here 's raw data from an independent third party that you could n't have faked   strictly from a customer service pov that means you can self serve on requests like that instead of having to involve expensive staff time      i totally get the annoyance of having yet another login password you do n't want to have out there in the breeze potentially exposed to a but given that the account is closed it 's probably not going to cause you much trouble   if anything change the password to one outside your normal choices perhaps even one you do n't know retain as long as you retain the email you have tied to the account you can always reset the password on the off chance you ever need to get back in    speaking of that do n't rely on your isp 's or or get a gmail account i have a dedicated gmail account just for stuff like that

i think by definition there are n't generally speaking any indicators as in chart indicators i assume you mean   for fundamental analysis off the top of my head i ca n't think of one chart indicator that i would n't call technical even though a couple could possibly go either way and i 'm sure someone will help prove me wrong but the point i want to make is that to do fundamental analysis it is most certainly more time consuming depending on what instrument you 're investing in you need to have a micro perspective company specific details and a macro perspective about the industry it 's in if you 're investing in sector etfs or the like you 'd be more reliant on the macro analysis if you 're investing in commodities you 'll need to consider macro analysis in multiple countries who are big producers consumers of the item there 's no cut and dried way to do it however i personally opt for a macro analysis of sector etfs and then use technical analysis to determine my entry and/or exit

first i do n't claim to have all the answers but can appreciate the dialogue and question you 're posing   as you stated you love the overall advertising experience and i 'm assuming sales generation from those experiences since that is how you 'll generate revenue   integrated marketing to me has always seemed like an especially narrow subject matter i do n't mean that it is simply or easy by any means but rather you become a story teller in the advertising world and your story is to impact your target audience in a particular way i 'll use myself as an example i am a former college athlete and currently work in sales marketing supply chain i watch a lot of sports with my two sons and saw the recent gatorade ad about in order to win you have to lose that ad has stuck in my head because i know that commitment from to school to work it 's a brilliant concept that has me hooked to me that is what is all about a concept that was tailored to tell a story of success through failure and having athletes that repeat that story a truly hand crafted product that now has me opt for a gatorade when leaving the gym    when i consider marketing as a whole i do n't think of these types of tailored situations but rather the whole puzzle marketing and its counterpart analytics create a solid shape for a business to thrive your personal sales lines and how your sales people are performing are a part of your marketing potential customer service to build relations and increase your net promoter scores technical applications to develop products that are in line with customer demand and in turn the supply chain foresight to deliver on said products all of it is marketing    hope this helps

as other answers and comments suggest you are trying to do something odd to say the least no one wants to use a credit card to finance a checking current account because you are creating a debt on that credit card unless you are in the odd situation where the card is in credit that will immediately start accruing interest at a rate probably in excess of 10 per annum that is not a clever thing to do what you really need to do is find an account that one of you owns that has a positive balance and use an internet banking service to transfer part of that positive balance onto the debit card the other solution is not to use the debit card at all but use the credit card to complete the purchases you are trying to manage with the debit card the reason that bofa and amex customer support ca n't help you is that no one would ever do what you want to do they would either move existing money from another account or ask for a bank loan

if you go through the web pages of some online brokers you will find out that some of them allow you to manage friends relatives accounts from your account as a that should really solve your underlying problem you will need only one login etc example if i understand it right it will even allow you to make one trade splitting the cost and returns among the other accounts but you would have to verify that anyways that will save you a lot of trouble and your broker can probably help you with the legal necessities

not sure if you are serious golf courses require a large number of people working on it jobs created    property development including building of the golf course creates a large number of temporary jobs and long term jobs upkeep services and the opportunity for new local businesses to open the rich folk moving in will probably want to keep their house clean services their yard kept landscaping service their cars maintained auto shop services their dogs pets cared for pet care services their organic food food markets etc in addition by having the rich folks there the mid to luxury store front brands might decide to open up locations in the area a smart developer would build a small open air mall to complement their housing this creates jobs it might not seem like much but when your family is barely making ends meet a few extra hundred dollars each week can make a huge difference    in addition the new business generates taxes for the city

the details of credit score calculation tend to change periodically but the fundamentals are mostly consistent   pay your bills keep your average account age high overpay your credit card minimums and keep your overall debt low   and do soft pulls on your credit report to see what 's happening first the simplest route pay all your bills early or on time   automatic deduction may be useful in this regard especially for bills with predictable amounts   a corollary to this tip is to never leave an unpaid bill   what often happens to young people is in the course of moving around they leave the final bill unpaid and it gets reported to collections   make sure you follow up online with all bills even after canceling the service second average account age and oldest account age matter   open an account like a credit card and never close it so you 'll have an older account hopefully a zero fee card   try to keep other accounts open rather than closing them no need to cancel a zero fee credit card so your average account age stays higher   a card that works on internal systems like a gift card is not going to show up on a credit report a card that works like any visa mc is likely going to show up   the rule of thumb is if they need your ssn to run a credit check for the application then the card will appear on a credit report   you can pull your credit report to find out if the card is listed you may have to allow time for lag before the card appears but i 'm not sure how long that might be    third a tip for extra credit score is to pay more than the minimum required on credit card bills   you can achieve this by either using your credit card at least once a month or by leaving a small hanging balance each month so there 's always something to overpay next month   credit card reporting will be either unpaid underpaid minimum paid or overpaid   minimum payment helps your score and overpayment helps more   if you can use your credit card every month that will give you something to overpay every month   otherwise you can leave a small debt left on the card but still pay over the monthly minimum   however your total debt load especially debt carried on your cards counts against your score aim for less than 10 of your limit finally of course is to pull your credit report periodically   you need to know what others are seeing   since debt load utilization matters make sure the reported card maximum is correct on your credit report   talk to your bank or account issuer if the limit is wrong   if a collection appears then you need to handle it   often you can negotiate with the collector but be careful to negotiate how they will report the resolution   you want them to agree to remove any negative information either in exchange for payment or because of a mistake   failing that you want them to mark it paid in full or satisfied in full letting them your score that you only partially paid is what you want to avoid since it most signals someone with cash flow problems and credit issues   they control their reporting to credit bureaus so if the person on the phone ask to speak to their supervisor or someone with negotiating authority   try to get any agreements in writing remember that your total debt load is a factor in your credit score   home loans and student loans do affect credit score   if you take on a smaller home loan then it will affect your credit less harshly and leave you with smaller monthly payments

like most forms of insurance health insurance is regulated at the state level so what is available to you will depend greatly upon which state you live in you can probably find a list of insurance companies from your state 's official website many states now provide insurance of last resort for individuals who ca n't get insurance through private insurance companies you can try looking into professional and trade associations some offer group insurance plans comparable with cobra coverage meaning you 'd get a group discount and benefits but without the benefit of an employer paying 30 80 of your premiums as a software developer you may qualify for membership in the or which both offer several forms of insurance to members the also offers insurance though they do n't provide much information about it on the public portions of their website these organization offer other benefits besides insurance so you may want to take that in to consideration the national federation of independent business also offers insurance to members you may find other associations in your specific area credit unions and the local chamber of commerce are all possible avenues of finding lower cost insurance options if you are religious there are even some faith based non insurance organizations that provide medical cost sharing services they depend upon the generosity and sense of fairness and obligation of their members to share the burden of medical expenses so their definitely not for everyone

are you talking long term institutional or retail investors long term retail investors look for orderly markets the of hft business models which have a direct correlation between market volatility and profits to a lesser extent some dumb do as well hft firms tout they supply liquidity into markets when in fact the opposite is true   yes hfts supply liquidity but only when the liquidity 's benefits runs in their that is they are applying the part of the liquidity definition that mentions high trading activity and conveniently ignoring the part that simultaneously requires easily buying or selling an asset   if hft 's are the new exchange floor then they need to be formalized as such and become bound to market maker if they are actually supplying liquidity like real designated market makers in the nyse for example they become responsible to supply a specified liquidity for specified ticker symbols in exchange for their informational advantage on those tickers the fact is that hft can not exist at their current profit levels without the information advantage they gain with preferential access to tick by tick data unavailable to investors who can not afford the exchange fees $ 1 m per exchange 10 years ago more now restrict the entire market including hfts to only second by second price data without the tick by tick depth and they wo n't do so well   do n't get me wrong i 'm not knocking hfts per se i think they are a development so long as they really do supply liquidity right now they are n't doing so and especially in an orderly manner if you want retail investors to keep out of the water as they are doing now by all means let hft and regulatory capture and a whole host of other financial service industry run as they are there are arguments to be made about only let the professionals play the market where there is no role for retail and anyone who does n't know how to play the long term investment game needs to get out of the kitchen but if you are making such an argument come out and say so

as you point out the main benefits of a pension retirement account over a traditional cash taxable account are the legal and tax benefits   most western countries establish a specific legal definition for an account which is often taxed less or not at all relative to taxable accounts and which contains some protection for the owner in case of a bankruptcy   the typical drawbacks for investing within such structures are limited investment choice limited withdrawal rights either in terms of age or rate of withdrawal and maximum contributions   the benefits are usually very clear and your decision whether or not to open a pension retirement account should depend on a careful weighing of the benefits and drawbacks as to whether you may end up with less than you started that depends on what you invest in   as with all of finance you must take more risk to get more return   although the choices inside a pension retirement account may be worded somewhat differently they are usually fundamentally no different than some of the most popular investments available for ordinary taxable accounts

there are many different reasons to buy property and it 's important to make a distinction between commercial and residential property historically owning property has been part of the american dream for multiple reasons   but to answer your questions value is not based on the age of the building however it can be in a historic district in addition the price of something and it 's value may or may not be directly related for each individual buyer owner because that becomes subjective some buildings can lose there value as time passes but the depends on multiple factors area condition of the building overall economy etc so it 's not that easy to give a specific answer to a general question   before you buy property amongst many things it 's important to determine why you want to buy this property what will be it 's principal use for you that will help you determine if you should buy an old or new property but that pales in comparison to if the property will maintain and gain in value also if your looking for an investment look into reit real estate investment trust these can be great why because you do n't actually have to carry the mortgage which makes that ideal for people who want to own property but not have to deal with the everyday ins and outs of the responsibility of ownership like rising cost it 's important to note that the cost of purchase and cost of ownership are two different things but invariably linked when buying anything in the material strata of our world you can find publicly traded reits on the major stock exchanges hope that helps

the trend in etfs is total return where the etf automatically reinvests dividends   this philosophy is undoubtedly influenced by that trend the rich and retired receive nearly all income from interest dividends and capital gains therefore one who receives income exclusively from dividends and capital gains must fund by withdrawing dividends and/or liquidating holdings for a total return etf the situation is even more limiting income can only be funded by liquidation the expected profit is lost for the dividend as well as liquidating since the dividend can merely be converted back into securities new or pre existing   in this regard dividends and investments are equal one who withdraws dividends and liquidates holdings should be careful not to liquidate faster than the rate of growth

you do n't want to set up your investment account as a savings or spending budget account   there are a couple of reasons   first investment account balances change daily based on the market   if you set it up as a budget account then your budget category balances would need to have money added or removed from them daily as the market value changes   second because you are investing for retirement this money will be untouchable for many years there is no need to include that in your spending budget instead enter your monthly investment amount as an expense transaction not a transfer to another budget account   if for example you are sending $ 400 per month to your retirement account just enter that as a monthly $ 400 expense out of your checking account assigning it to a retirement category   that money then leaves your budget if you want to see the value of your investment account in ynab so that your net worth is accurate add the account as an investment account   the value will not affect your budget categories but it will affect the net worth on the all accounts page   either set it up as an online account so that the balance will update automatically or add it as a manual account and simply update the balance manually when you get your monthly statement

which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover emergency funds are for emergencies which to me means expenses that are unanticipated and ca n't be covered out of normal cash flow   oil changes are not an emergency and should be part of your normal budget   car house repairs and doctor visits might be an emergency depending on the severity and the urgency e.g. do i need to fix this now or can i save up and fix it for known predictable expenses that are infrequent christmas birthdays car insurance home insurance taxes if it 's not part of your mortgage payment i use an escrow account   i calculate how much i 'll need for all of those things put together over the year and set aside a fixed amount each paycheck to ensure that i have enough to cover each item   you could do something similar for minor doctor visits car repairs etc   estimate how much you might spend and set aside some money each month if you find you 're spending more than you thought just increase the amount   you can use envelopes for each type of expense have a separate checking account for those whatever   the point is to set it aside and make sure you have enough left over to cover your known expenses the whole point of an emergency fund is to be able to pay cash for emergencies rather than borrowing to pay them and dealing with interest late fees etc

is this even legal how can a bank refuse to deposit legal tender in    the united states legal for all debts public or private does n't mean quite what i used to think either   per the fed this statute means that all united states money as identified above is    a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when to a    creditor there is however no federal statute mandating that a    private business a person or an organization must accept currency or    coins as payment for goods or services private businesses are free to    develop their own policies on whether to accept cash unless there is a    state law which says otherwise yes they can refuse loose change also they are n't refusing your deposit just requiring that it be rolled what do i do with my change i do not want to spend the time rolling    it and i am not going to pay a fee to cash my change there are n't many other options change is a nuisance i believe coinstar machines reduce remove their fee if you exchange coins for gift cards so that might be the best option for convenience and retaining value

it does n't sound fishy at all to me just seems like you may be dealing with a company that has relatively light trading volume to begin with meaning that small trades could easily make the price drop 8 which is n't much if you 're talking about a stocks in the $ 5 or less range if someone sells at the bid and the bid happens to be 8 lower than the current price that bid is now the price hence the drop the bid moving up afterward just means that someone is now willing to place a higher order than what the last trade was to try to get in

the benefit is that your earnings in the 401k are not subject to income tax until you make withdrawals this allows you to grow your money faster than if you made equivalent investments in a taxable account and had to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains along the way also the theory is that you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement and thus you will pay lower taxes overall if this is not true especially if you will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement then there may not be any advantage for you to contribute to a 401k one advantage over the traditional ira is the higher contribution limit some 401k plans also allow you to take loans from the plan i do n't think this is possible with a traditional ira an alternative to both the 401k and traditional ira is the roth version of either plan with a roth you pay taxes up front but your withdrawals during retirement are tax free

dividend rate is dividend per share over a specified time period usually a year so in the first example if the company paid a $ 1/share dividend over the year before the stock dividend the shareholder would receive $ 100 while if it paid the $ 1/share the year after the stock dividend the shareholder would receive $ 105 the company could have achieved the same thing by paying total dividends of $ which is what the last phrase of the last quoted paragraph is saying here 's an investopedia page on dividend rate also what you 're calling payout ratio is really dividend yield payout ratio is how much of the company 's net earnings are paid out in dividends that 's all in the us i could see the terms being used differently outside the us

hopefully i can make this quick since your time is    no one is happy working 40 hours a week and quite honestly i do n't think people are even happy working 30 hours a week people generally do not like labor especially if it is something they do not find fulfilling a majority of americans and those abroad only work as a means to survive wage chattel slavery has never nor will it ever be a positive attribute to any society    also although automation will cut down the time spent working i.e. no longer required to work 40 hours a week i am afraid that americans will find themselves in trouble if those who are currently working 40 hours a week now can not afford basic healthcare and necessities of life then god forbid we witness a reduction in the hours of labor this will exacerbate the social services medicare medicaid snap social security etc that the country is currently having difficulties of dealing with as we speak which will create a recipe for disaster    by the way i am always willing to chat with people of varying ideas and beliefs

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

i am glad they are going away malls are an environmental tragedy    are the product or maybe even part of the cause of suburban sprawl they encourage car usage and by virtue of their need for large open areas to be constructed are often far from where most people work and live as a result patrons have to drive large distances from their houses jobs to the shopping centers    2 the parking lots are tremendous waste of space and hugely damage the studies environment transportation parking environmental impacts development policies research roundup     3 online shopping is much better for the environment as the product can be shipped directly to the consumer    4 once they are built and then closed the space where the centers sat is basically abandoned and turns into blight depending on the businesses that were housed in the mall and the businesses that were supported by the mail especially gas stations these sites could be toxic    i am sure there are more reasons why malls are environmentally harmful but those are a few off the top of my head

you can do a direct transfer from one fund to another within fidelity very easily you will have to see if the two funds have any sales or redemption fees if you want to leave fidelity they should be able to transfer the funds directly to the other ira custodian you do n't want the money to go to you instead you want to send them send the money directly to the other firm the new custodian will be more than happy to help facilitate the transfer the only fee for doing so should be if the funds you are investing in have fees for buying or selling shares there are many options that do n't have these transaction costs both with fidelity and with other companies

personal finances are not intuitive for everyone and it can be a challenge to know what to do when you have n't been taught   congratulations on recognizing that you need to make a change the first step that i would recommend is what you 've already done assemble your bank statements so you can get an accurate picture of what money you currently have   keep organized folders so you can find your bank statements when you need them in addition to the bank statements for your checking and savings accounts you also need to assess any debt that you have   have you taken out any loans that need to be paid back   do you have any credit card debt   make a list of all your debts and make sure that you have folders for these statements as well hopefully you do n't have any debts   but if you are like most people you owe money to someone and you may even owe more money than you currently have in your bank accounts   if you have debts fixing this problem will be one of your goals no matter what your debt is you need to make sure that from now on you do n't spend more money than you take in as income   to do this you need to make a budget a budget is a plan for spending your money   to get started with a budget make a list of all the income you will receive this month   add it up and write that amount at the top of a page   next you want to make a list of all the expenses you will have this month   some of these expenses are more or less fixed rent utility bills etc   write those down first   some of the expenses you have more control over such as food and entertainment   give yourself some money to spend on each of these   you may also have some larger expenses that will happen in the future such as a tuition or insurance payment   allocate some money to those so that by the time that payment comes around you will have saved enough to pay for those expenses if you find that you do n't have enough income to cover all of your expenses in a month you need to either reduce your expenses somewhere or increase your income until your budget is at a point where you have money left over at the end of each month after you 've gotten to this point the next step is figuring out what to do with that extra money left over   this is where your goals come into play   if you have debt i recommend that one of your first goals is to eliminate that debt as fast as possible   if you have no money saved you should make one of your goals saving some money as an emergency fund   see the question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing for some ideas on what order you should place your goals doing the budget and tracking all of your spending on paper is possible but many people find that using the right software to help you do this is much easier   i have written before on choosing budgeting software   all of the budgeting software packages i mentioned in that post are from the u.s. but many of them can successfully be used in europe   ynab the program i use even has an unofficial german users community that you might find useful one of the things that budgeting software will help you with is the process of reconciling your bank statements   this is where you go through the bank statement each month and compare it to your own record of spending transactions in your budget   if there are any transactions that appear in the statement that you do n't have recorded you need to figure out why   either it is an expense that you forgot to record or it is a charge that you did not make   record it if it is legitimate or dispute the expense if it is fraudulent for more information look around at some of the questions tagged budget   i also recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey which will provide more help in making a budget and getting out of debt

firstly if a stock costs $ 50 this second the bid ask would have to be   if the bid ask were the stock would cost $ 51 this second   what you 're likely referring to is the last trade not the cost   the last trading price is history and does n't apply to future transactions to make it simple let 's define a simple order book   say there is a bid to buy 100 at $ 49 200 at $ 48 500 at $ 47   if you place a market order to sell 100 shares it should all get filled at $ 49   if you had placed a market order to sell 200 shares instead half should get filled at $ 49 and half at $ 48   this is of course assuming no one else places an order before you get yours submitted   if someone beats you to the 100 share lot then your order could get filled at lower than what you thought you 'd get   if your internet connection is slow or there is a lot of latency in the data from the exchange then things like this could happen   also there are many ecns in addition to the exchanges which may have different order books   there are also trades which for some reason get delayed and show up later in the time and sales window but to answer the question of why someone would want to sell low the only reason i could think is they desire to drive the price down

should i use the money to pay off student loans and future grad expenses for me yes   the main drawback to student loans is that they can not be gotten rid of except by paying them off other than extreme circumstances such as death or complete disability   a mortgage car loan or other collateralized loans can be dealt with by selling the underlying collateral   credit card loans can be discharged in bankruptcy stop borrowing for college pay for it in cash then decide what to do with the rest make sure you have a comfortable amount saved for emergencies in a completely liquid account not a retirement account or cds and continue to pay off with the rest   you might also consider putting some away for your kids college so   i want to get my older son into a private middle school for 2 years they have a endowment and may offer us a decent need based scholarship if we look worthy on paper i have a hard time getting behind this plan with a k mortgage   if you want to apply for scholarships that 's great but do n't your finances to look like you 're poor when you have a quarter million dollar house   if you want to save some for private school then do that out of what you have   otherwise either your priorities so you can afford it or private school might not be in the cards for you that while it was a blessing to be able to pay off the second mortgage and credit cards your to pay off the student loans makes me wonder if you will start living within your means after the loans are paid off   my concern is that your current spending levels that got you in this much debt in the first place will put you back in debt in the near future and you wo n't have another inheritance to help pull you out i know that was n't your question but i felt like i needed to add that to my answer as well

other than the fact that treasury can not sell to the fed by law your theory is nice you forget the step where the open market buys from the treasury since they desire bonds to invest in and the fed can buy only from the open market   secondly the fed does not give cash to the treasury the mint a branch of the treasury not the fed prints cash   so it seems your understanding of how the money system works is quite wrong yet since this is the economy subreddit instead of the economics subreddit i expect you to get upvotes for saying what is popular even though it is incorrect   you seem to not like cash that was not even existing previously all cash was not existing previously how do you expect people to make transactions barter   you call them interest free loans but above claimed they will never be paid back but then the fed is making a profit on them it seems you contradict yourself with all that   it would be interesting for you to explain how and why money not cash gets added and removed to the economy    yay for ignorance

currency lives no more then 50 years us currency did not expire in last 100 years but it was few times last one was 2009 note that currency is not just what you hold in your hand currency is system of relations of money supply currency is not money but we forced to use standard terminology banking rules and government policy currency exists as long as government wants it to in 2009 for example us government decided it needs new currency and just printed whole new money supply so us dollar is now counting as partially fresh new currency it was not expired but today 's dollar is totally different from 90s and will it be accepted after 200 years yes probably but most likely at that time there will be totally new us dollars and new euros new pounds and so on currency is method of transfer you can have that physical coins you have but as economic agent it will die very quickly it is not only related to inflation in fact inflation is the least of your worries if you count all currencies in the world which ever existed most of them 99.99 are completely dead by now with governments which supported it not even single one currency which lived more then 100 years us dollar was in 1860 1907 1930 1973 1987 2009 and   in fact it is not single currency but dozen which were allowed to be used for compatibility reasons

one rule of thumb is that having regular activity on at least three different revolving accounts will improve your score i agree that it may not be a great idea to have too many open credit accounts trade lines reporting on your credit report but if you do n’t have enough active accounts it will   prevent you from being approved for a home mortgage both conventional fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage loans and government loans such as fha and va require that you have a minimum number of reporting trade lines that are active or have been active within the most recent 24 month period of time an example of meeting the mortgage loan requirement is having a revolving account credit card that has been reporting activity for the past 24 months plus 2 other trade lines that have had activity reported for 12 months each both within the past 24 months

the reason you would want to report to all three is because lenders do n't usually query all three thus it may be that your negative mark will be missed by a future lender because that lender did n't query the agency you chose to report to generally it is cheaper to report to more agencies than to query more agencies and since those reporting are also those it is in their best interest to continue reporting to all agencies and expecting others to do the same each agency calculates the score independently based on the information reported to that agency thus only reporting a negative item to experian will mean that transunion and equifax scores for the same person will be higher

if you are doing this because you are interested this is one thing but a degree in economics is probably not going to help you find a job    before going into it research available opportunities in the field first is it worth the cost of the degree to study it are you going into it because your employer wants you to have this knowledge   the answer to the question about math is yes there is a lot of math in economics   a good idea is to get the course catalog for the degree at the university where you would be going and see which classes are required to get the degree is completely correct money and banking one of the classes required for an eco degree is something that helps you know why the president of the us is doing what he is doing but really does not apply much to you personally and employers will not care   i urge you and anyone else who plans to go to school please research if there are jobs in the field of your study i have seen so many people study things they were interested in and then later graduate and were not able to find jobs   good luck

people do not take the time to get to know you and find out what you know or not before hiring you   they are lazy   and they are   they will hire only someone who appears to have the right credentials got it   there is no reason for them to put themselves on the line by telling corporate they have a hunch you 'll be a good employee   almost not to happen   you have to make it easy for the person to hire you   and that means you got ta get the degree

gt there are more types of ads than banner ads you see in the margins of websites and they ca n't be blocked by ad blockers its a huge industry saying it 's going to die is pretty naive   it 's difficult to formulate a polite response my message inbox is flooded with people who obviously have no idea what they 're talking about telling me about how my ad blockers are n't blocking the ads which i know they are blocking and this account is new which means i ca n't respond to everyone without waiting unreasonable numbers of minutes so i want to make one response that 's really good instead   i am willing to bet that i have more knowledge and experience with the internet technology and computers than everyone in this thread combined so you go on thinking i 'm naive or whatever but really you are the naive one for underestimating my expertise on the subject   i am absolutely aware of what sort of ads are blocked by my ad blockers and what sorts are nt i belong to the class of people who taught you all how to use this stuff all of the advertising that google and facebook use for their revenue is blocked when you pay for ads on reddit i do n't see those when you pay for adwords links on search engines i do n't see those when you pay for video ads on youtube content i do n't see those the only things that get through are things which can not be detected such as spam posts posing as real content but because i am a smart person i am capable of recognizing when an article is trying to sell me something that is what you are getting at unless you 're completely wrong and just being stupid but i 'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and while that tangent is true it 's irrelevant to the meat of the conversation which is that the traditional methods of advertising things like pay per click and number of impressions things like adwords and facebook 's boosted posts all of that is going away if you rely on those things for your revenue stream you better start looking for other sources of income today because in a few years those streams will be completely dried up   you can listen to me because i am an expert on this technology and this culture which i have been using for 26 years or you can convince yourself that you know better even tho we both know you do not i do n't know why it hurts your pride to get advice from someone who knows better than you but that 's my guess at why you and others are so defensive about this particular subject that and because it 's your bread and butter i 'm warning you now is the time to look for other income generators not 5 years from now when the entire advertising model is dead 5 years is a guess it could be sooner it could be later it will be   i suspect you 're also afraid that you wo n't be able to find a new revenue model but i think that fear is unfounded people are creative and have been inventing new ways to make money since money was invented i 'm telling you now is the time to do that you should be thanking me

aside from the market implications victor and jb king mention another possible reason is the dividends they pay usually the dividends a company pays are dependent on the profit the company made if a company makes less profit the dividends turn out smaller this might unrest among the shareholders because this means that they get paid less dividends which makes that share more likely to be sold and thus for the price to fall

just a word of warning most of the companies that promise to repair your credit are scams or close to them   you could just as easily do yourself what they are going to charge you for essentially they write a letter to the credit agencies disputing most or all of the bad stuff on your credit report when you do that the credit agency sends an inquiry to the company that reported the negative information requiring them to justify it if that company does n't respond within x days they remove the item from your credit report these companies depend on the fact that some companies are n't going to hit that deadline or even respond perhaps they are just too busy to hassle with providing backup documentation for a $ 20 late payment they are banking on getting a few of these cheap outs to your benefit and charging you for what amounts to sending out a bunch of form letters if you do n't mind writing a bunch of letters then you can save a lot of money and get the exact same results these companies want to pretend they have some insider knowledge or fancy lawyers that know special credit magic but they generally do n't the only option i 'd consider legitimate and not a waste of your time is a referral from the non profit national federation for credit counseling they are n't going to fix your credit but will give you advice on budgeting and repairing your credit on your own

the short answer is your employer should typically deduct enough every paycheck so you do n't owe anything on april 15th and no more the long answer is your employer may make an error in how much to deduct particularly if you have more than 1 job or have any special deductions income calculate your estimated total taxes for the year by estimating all your income and deductions on a paper copy of a tax return i say paper copy so that you become familiar with what the income and deductions actually are whereas plugging into an online spreadsheet makes you blind to what 's actually going on compare that with what your employer deducts every paycheck the number of paychecks in the year this tells you how much extra you will pay be refunded on april 15th as accurately as you can estimate your income and deductions

due to the fact that months have gone by since the item was shipped to you it will be hard to resolve by sending it back   the collection agency is now only interested in getting as much of the money as they can from you they may have sent a percentage of the debt to the original company when they bought the debt they may also be working on a commission therefore they are not interested in having everybody happy with the result they need to follow the law but they do n't care if you are a happy customer   the longer you wait to resolve it the longer it will remain on the credit report the fact that it went to collections has already hurt your score   yes make sure that they update your credit file to reflect that you have paid the debt get it in writing also check with your health insurance company to see if this is at least partially covered by insurance they generally wo n't cover the $ 12 in fees from the collections company but they might cover part of the original bill depending on the item it might also be an allowable expense for your fsa flexible spending account or your hsa health spending account

i used to work for one of the three ratings agencies awhile ago first there are lots of different ratings the bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance so senior debentures fixed income and general obligations e.g. tax free muni bonds respectively ratings agencies are not paid by the investment banks they are paid by the corporations   or state that is issuing debt the investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market   for mortgage backed securities collateralized debt cdo clo 's all of which are fancy structured securitizations well that is a different matter those   transactions are the ones where there is an close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies and those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems   ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what was their traditional business corporate and municipal bond ratings as far as i know    what said was 100 correct s&amp;p 's fees were paid by investors the people who were purchasing the bonds until about 50 years ago around the same time that hill purchased s&amp;p in 1966 they from that model and started charging the bond issuers for ratings i do n't know if that decision was driven by hill or not though   one more thing not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers one of the 10 's a designation given by the is jones their revenue comes from the investors bond purchasers not the companies issuing bonds unlike the moody 's business model so there is an alternative which i consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair   edit what mentions is also totally accurate the part about roubini who is a professor at or columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high sort is consistent with my impression as for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by roubini yes i guess it would but i do n't know if the government would do that it would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different less conflicted payment incentive model   keep in mind too that many of the provisions of dodd frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities this is the scary part though there is n't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies not at the moment as far as i can tell eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative but that has n't happened yet which is better not requiring ratings at all or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings which a false sense of confidence i do n't know
