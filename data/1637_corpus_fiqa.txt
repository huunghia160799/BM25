you probably have enough math to satisfy a program as an incoming student however gmat will matter a lot the and their equivalents are going to have more applicants with perfect and higher math backgrounds than they can take if you ca n't distinguish yourself with connections from well published professors who can write good letters for you then they 're probably out of reach which means almost surely that you wo n't get a job at an ivy or equivalent as they are pretty incestuous    basically if you go on the market without a top tier publication before you go out or without a huge endorsement from a big name your best outcome is to land at a school that is the same level as the one from which you receive your degree and you had better have at least 1 decent pub or or a presentation at a top conference with a good pipeline to hope for that   more likely outcome is you have a good job market paper decent pipeline maybe a few conference presentations but no pub or in which case the most likely outcome for you is a step down from the tier of school you were at so if you were at a flagship state program then you will end up in the second tier state programs the worse your portfolio on the market the farther you fall   so if your goal is a flagship state program then you need to be aiming as high as absolutely possible and the chances of getting into those programs are progressively smaller the higher you shoot the flagship state schools like ut and the ivy equivalents like harvard etc will get hundreds if not thousands of applicants ones with backgrounds in working finance or econ or worse i had two physics phd holders start in my cohort with me so you have no chance to compete with that kind of math and programming experience perfect and great recommendations it is very hard but you ca n't win if you do n't play i suppose i would wager that the average number of applications to programs sent by applicants is around 50 so why not aim a few of those applications high and see if anything sticks    computer language proficiency is a good thing to highlight but wo n't win you any big awards by the time you get out of your first year every student should have proficiency in either stata r sas and have some python perl c etc depending on what area of research you go for so you have a head start but not for long    your best shot to improve your chances are good recommendations from professors you know that are research active and big names in their sub fields and in the finance field as a whole next up would be to have an active interest in a research area and be able to discuss write about why you want to research that area do n't just think about it go look up papers that do that sort of research and see what they do and how they do it so that you will know the limitations of that sort of research when i interview a prospective student and they say i am interested in international finance research or any other sort of general field i know they have n't got a clue what they 're interested in which puts them behind again

the issue is that housing price increases ca n't sustain themselves indefinitely in comparison to the rental market increases drive people back to the rental market which brings the rental market up   also just as a airbnb would drive property prices to go up it also allows people who would otherwise not be able to buy a house to make the house purchase example is a mortgage lender that will give you a cheaper loan if you put your house on airbnb. that enables people to purchase a home when they otherwise would n't be able to so over time many years the market should work itself out   in the short term airbnb can definitely cause market fluctuations for example it might enable people to continue to own their homes during a depression which would cause a supply shortage    the only factor that affects ownership prices differently than rental prices in the long term would be regulation here 's a good seattle builds apartments but vancouver bc builds about that aspect specifically

bitcoin prices are likely rising as a result of the simple issue of supply and demand   supply is constrained as there are n't much in the way of new bitcoins coming into existence and demand is high right now as a result of various events for example this reuters article goes into some detail as to some current influences   mostly crypto hedge funds are buying a lot of bitcoins as a speculative move i.e. believing the price will continue to rise    the evidence suggests that few of the users are buying bitcoin to use it as a means of exchange but are speculating to increase their capital many describe the bubble as similar to the tulip craze in century from the same reuters article it ’s got all the of your tulip bubble chart but that tells you nothing about where that price line could go depending on the number of people who wish to own it standard life ’s head of investment strategy andrew said on wednesday who is to say it does n’t reach $ 100,000 you can see in the volume chart from that the trading volume for bitcoins has really increased and if you look at the market price you see a very similar movement however if you look at the number of transactions per day that number is basically constant meaning the actual uses of bitcoins by people just buying or selling goods or services is n't really changing much but the dollar amount is   that 's indicative of a speculation caused bubble below is a graph i made from the data from above that price with trading volume you can see clearly the increase in volume and increase in price are nearly simultaneous   bitcoin itself has some actual utility mostly for black market sellers and similar people participating in activities that are less than legal not ethically bad for example people in nations with oppressive regimes that limit contact with the outside world or try to restrict foreign currency purchases   it 's unlikely that the degree of adoption so far however has driven it to this level and the fact that bitcoin can be broken up into very small chunks means that the big boom in price of individual bitcoins causes the demand side pressure from the actual use of bitcoins to be as there is now 1/10th the demand for bitcoins from people who use them for non speculative reasons

pre qualification is only a step above what you can do with a rate payment calculator   they do n't check your credit history and credit score they do n't ask for verification of your income or verify that you have reported your debts correctly they also do n't guarantee the interest rate but if you answer truthfully and completely and nothing else changes you have an idea of how much you can afford factoring in the down payment and estimates of other fees taxes and insurance you can get pre by multiple lenders then base your decision on rates and fees   you want to get pre approved they do everything to approve you you can even lock in a rate you want to finalize on one lender at that point because you will incur some fees getting to that point then knowing the maximum amount you can borrow including all the payments taxes insurance and fees you can make an offer on a house once the contract is accepted you have a few days to get the appraisal and the final approval documents from the lender they will only loan you the minimum of what you are pre approved for and the appraisal minus down payment also do n't go with the lender recommended by the real estate agent or builder they are probably getting a kick back based on the amount of business they funnel to that company

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

before you decide on moving into trading whether you have experience or not you need to sort out a couple of questions how much do you really understand about the markets   how much money you have and what would be the maximum loss you may be able to take   what supporting eco system you have to help you in terms of trading i.e. hardware software research connections who can provide you with solid information and sorts of it are you really prepared to take on institutions who have billions to spend and take losses i.e. amounts which might break you will be peanuts for them i am assuming you are in us so this website   may help you a bit trading websites where you can open an account   even if you reply in affirmative to the above questions you should still be wary about making money by trading it is a field where even the best people have been in the face without any mercy and above all do n't expect any person will take mercy on your hard earned cash they will take you to the cleaners if they have to there are some websites which allow you to participate in trading not involving real money try that out and see where you get to that should give you some pointers on where you are headed   and realize that it is human nature to assume when you hear news that such and such trader make loads of money in such and such trades trading is easy unless you do it for yourself the truth is such traders would be on their desk for 18 20 hours at a stretch 6 7 days a week without a life to make such money and they have loads of support staff i.e. analysts it guys who makes it easier for them do you have such help if no then look the other side   but giving up without trying at all will be but do it in limits which you can bear and not to get carried away when things are good

there are many reasons which other answers have already discussed i want to emphasize and elaborate on just one of the reasons which is that it avoids double taxation especially on corporate earnings   generally for corporations its earnings are already taxed at around 40 for the us including state income taxes when dividends are distributed out it is taxed again at the individual level the effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain i believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the us for a simplistic example say there is a c corporation with a single owner the company earns $ 1,000,000 before income taxes it pays 400,000 in taxes and has retained earnings of $ 600,000 to get the money out the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself or sell her stake to another person either choice leads to $ 600,000 getting taxed at another or so at the individual level depending on the state if we calculate the effective rate it is above 50 many people invest in stock including mutual funds and the dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates individual tax returns that contain no wage income often have very low average tax rates for this reason however the investments themselves are continuously paying out their own taxes or accruing taxes in the form of future tax liability

it seems ideal to have the employment be all about both income and ethics but the problem is that for most people in the industry more often at one point or another they will have to choose between their income or their ethics    ethics should always hold supremacy over personal gain because ethics maintain the relationships formal and informal between entities involved in the markets without those long term relationships there is no room for trust and therefore no reason to be willingness for entities to exchange with one another   if you do n't have a overall fair financial markets on the long term it will hurt the overall economy why because people will have no trust in buying equity prices there will be no trust in prospects   people will save most of their money in cash and outright avoid anything or everything about investing   if there are less clients there is less capital for the entire industry   the trust of the aggregate non active investing clients with the capital range between million matters and to make it common knowledge to hold personal gain above them is not a good way to have them keep their money in the markets

while you would reduce risk by diversifying into other stock etfs across the world developed market returns and emerging markets to a lesser extent are generally highly correlated with another correlation of 0.90 this implies that they all go up in bull markets and go down together in bear markets you are better off diversifying into other asset classes given your risk tolerance such as government bonds as you have mentioned alternatively you can target a portfolio owning all of the assets in the universe assuming you 're trading in frankfurt a combination of something similar to and but with higher volumes and/or lower fees a good starting resource would be the bogleheads wiki

1 the risks are that you investing in financial markets and therefore should be prepared for volatility in the value of your holdings 2 you should only ever invest in financial markets with capital that you can reasonably afford to put aside and not touch for 5 10 years as an investor not a trader even then you should be prepared to write this capital off completely no one can offer you a guarantee of what will happen in the future only speculation from what has happened in the past 3 do n't invest it is simple keep your money in cash however this is not without its risks interest rates rarely keep up with inflation so the spending power of cash investments quickly diminishes in real terms over time so what to do extended your time horizon as you have mentioned to say 30 years reinvest all dividends as these have been proven to make up the bulk of long term returns and drip feed your money into these markets over time this will benefit you from what is known in as   dollar cost averaging and will negate the need for you to time the market

i 'm a bit surprised that nobody talked about the impact of multiple inquiries on a loan since op is concerned with credit building probably an answer as opposed to a comment is justified yes in fact when you shop for auto loan you are expected to have your credit score report be pulled by different banks credit unions and/or the financing arm of the car manufacturer or the dealership so that you can hopefully get the best rate possible this is especially true if the dealer is requesting quotes on rates on your behalf as they would probably use a batch process to send out applications to multiple financial institutions all at once yes and a bit unusual your dealer pulled your report twice on the same day presumably they are not getting any new information on the second pull maybe a fat finger regardless you should not worry about this too much to be explained below i would say do n't bother the idea behind hard inquiries lowering credit score is that lenders see the number of hard inquiries as your desire for credit too high a number is often viewed as either desperate for credit or unable to qualify for credit   but as explained above it is very common for a person to request quotes for multiple financial institutions and thus to have multiple hard inquiries in a short period of time when shopping for loans to account for that the credit bureau 's model would usually combine hard inquiries for a same type of loan auto mortgage etc within 30 days hence a person sending quote request to 3 banks wo n't be rated higher for credit than if he were to request quotes from 5 banks   therefore in your case your credit profile is not going to be different if you had been pulled just once my credit score goes down for 15 points i 'm assuming you are talking about the credit score provided by credit karma the score ck provided is the score lenders care about is fico they are well correlated but still different google these two terms and you should be able to figure out the difference quickly you can also refer to my answer to a different question here equifax credit score discrepancy in 1 month why

also almost by definition rebalancing involves making more trades    than you would have otherwise would n't the additional trading fees    you incurred in doing so reduce the benefits of this strategy you forgot to mention taxes rebalancing does or rather can incur costs one way to minimize the costs is to use the parts of the portfolio that have essentially zero cost of moving these generally are the funds in your retirement accounts in the united states they can be in iras or 401ks they can be regular or roth selling winners withing the structure of the plan does n't trigger capital gains taxes and many have funds within them that have zero loads   another way to reduce trading fees is to only rebalance once a year or once every two years or by setting a limit on how far out of balance for example do n't rebalance at to get back to 60/40 even if it has been two years   given that the ratio of investments is often rather arbitrary to begin    with how do i know whether i 'm selling high and buying low or just    sticking with a losing asset ratio the ratio used in an example or in an article may be arbitrary but your desired ratio is n't arbitrary you selected the ratio of your investments based on several criteria your age your time horizon your goals for the money how comfortable you are with risk as these change during your investing career those ratios would also but they are n't arbitrary   these decisions to rebalance are separate from the ones to sell a particular investment you could sell computer company x because of how it is performing and buy stock in technology company y because you think it has a better chance of growing that transaction would not be a re balancing selling part of your stock in domestic company a to buy stock in international company b would be part of a re balancing

robert is right saying that options prices are affected by implied volatility but is wrong saying that you have to look at the vix index for two reasons   1 the vix index is for s&p500 options only if you are trading other options it is less useful 2 if you are trading an option that is not at the money your implied volatility may be very different and follow a different dynamics that the vix index   so please look at the right implied volatility   in terms of strategy i do n't think that not doing anything is a good strategy i accept any point of view but you should consider that option traders should be able to adjust positions depending on market view   so you are long 1 call suppose strike 10 suppose the underlying price at the time of entry was 10 so the call was at the money now it 's 9   1 you still have a bullish view buy 1 call strike 9 and sell 2 calls strike 10 this way you have a bull call spread with much higher probability of leading to profit you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations   2 you become bearish you can sell 1 call strike 9 this way you end up with a bear call spread again you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations 3 you become neutral buy 1 call strike 8 and sell 2 calls strike 9 this way you end up with a call butterfly you are almost delta neutral and you can wait until your view becomes clear enough to become directional at that point you can modify the butterfly to make it directional   these are just some opportunities you have there is no reason for you to wait options are eroding contracts and you must be fast and adjust the position before time starts eroding your capital at risk   it 's true that buying a call does n't make you loose more than the premium you paid but it 's better to reduce this premium further with some adjustment is n't it   hope that helps

the short answer probably not much   unless you have a controlling interest in the company   if at least of the shareholder votes are in favor of the dilution then it can be done   there are some sec rules that should protect against corporate looting and theft like what the side is trying to make it appear as happened however it would appear that did something stupid   he signed away all of his voting right to someone who would use them to make his rights basically worthless   had he kept his head in the game he could probably have saved himself   but he did n't if your average startup started issuing lots of stock and devaluing existing shares significantly then i would expect it would be harder to find investors willing to watch as their investment dwindled   but if you are issuing a limited amount stock to get leverage to grow bigger then it is worth it   in the .com bubble there were quite a few companies that just issued stock to buy other companies   eventually most of these companies got delisted because they diluted them selves to much when they were overvalued any company not just a startup can dilute its shares   many if not most major companies issue stock to raise capital   this capital is then generally used to build the business further and increase the value of all shares   most of the time this dilution is very minor < .1 and has little if any impact on the stock   there are rules that have to be followed as listed companies are regulated by the sec   there are less regulations with private corporations   it looks like the dilution was combined with the buyout of the florida company which probably contributed to the legality of the dilution      with options they are generally issued at a set price   this may be higher or lower than the reported sell price of the stock when the option is issued   the idea is over time the stock will increase in value so that those people who hold on to their options can buy the stock for the price listed on the option   i worked at an isp start up in the 90 's that made it pretty well   i left before the options were issued but i had friends still there that were issued an option at $ 16 a share the value of the stock at the time of the issue of the option was about 12   well the company diluted the shares and used them to acquire more isp 's unfortunately this was about the time that dsl and cable internet took off so the dial up market tanked   the value eventually fell to .10 they did a reverse split and when they did the called in all options   the options did not have a positive cash value at any time   had ever made it big then the options could have been worth millions   there are some people from ms and yahoo that were in early that made millions off of their options   this became a popular way for startups to attract great talent paying peanuts   they invested their time in the business hoping to strike gold   a lot of it people got burned so this is less popular among top talent as the primary compensation anymore

a lot of your questions are probably best directed towards your payroll department who have no doubt done this sort of thing before   but i can answer about the cross border banking question   of the big five canadian banks the one with the largest presence in the u.s. is almost certainly td   td stands for toronto after all   td canada trust the canadian version of the bank seems to offer a range of services for cross border banking   i would recommend calling the canadian bank and asking what they can do for you   trying to get things set up from the u.s. side is likely to lead to frustration   canadians needing to do financial stuff in the u.s. is much much more common than americans needing to do financial stuff in canada and the bank staff on each side of the border will probably be proportionately helpful

my grandma left a 50 k inheritance you do n't make clear where in the inheritance process you are   i actually know of one case where the executor a family member not a professional distributed the inheritance before paying the estate taxes   long story short the heirs had to pay back part of the inheritance   so the first thing that i would do is verify that the estate is closed and all the taxes paid   if the executor is a professional just call and ask   if a family member you may want to approach it more   or not    the important thing is not to start spending that money until you 're sure that you have it    one good thing is that my husband is in grad school and will be done in 2019 and will then make about 75k yr with his degree profession be a bit careful about relying on this   outside the student loans you should build other expenses around the assumption that he wo n't find a job immediately after grad school   for example we could be in a recession in 2019   we 'll be about due by then     paying off the $ 5k other debt is probably a no brainer   chances are that you 're paying double digit interest   just kill it    unless the car loan is zero interest you probably want to get rid of that loan too   i would tend to agree that the car seems expensive for your income but i 'm not sure that the amount that you could recover by selling it justifies the loss of value   hopefully it 's in good shape and will last for years without significant maintenance    consider putting $ 2k your monthly income in your checking account   instead of paying for things paycheck to paycheck this should allow you to buy things on schedule without having to wait for the money to appear in your account    put the remainder into an emergency account   set aside $ 12k 50 of your annual income expenses for real emergencies like a medical emergency or job loss   the other $ 16k you can use the same way you use the $ 5k other debt borrowing now for small emergencies   e.g. a car repair    make a budget and stick to it   the elimination of the car loan should free up enough monthly income to support a reasonable budget   if it seems like it is n't then you are spending too much money for your income   do n't forget to explicitly budget for entertainment and vacations   it 's easy to overspend there    if you do n't make a budget you 'll just find yourself back to your paycheck to paycheck existence   that sounds like it is frustrating for you   budget so that you know how much money you really need to live

i am going to add just one more item to what are some very well thought out answers the element of cash out if you are taking out 80 of the value of the home that you already own free and clear the bank considers this a cash out transaction meaning you would effectively walk away from closing with a check for 80 of your home 's value so in a hypothetical situation you have a $ 200,000 home value you would be handed a check for $ 160,000 with which you could do anything that you wanted granted you are likely going to do something responsible with it and purchase another home but big but the bank ca n't control what you do with it and that is the part they do n't like and therefore they treat these types of transactions with a higher degree of scrutiny it is all about control if the property you are downsizing to fits their rules for lending they may actually loan you a higher loan to value on that purchase than they would on your cash out refinance transaction on your current home   with the purchase loan the money you get goes immediately to the purchase of a new home   in the cash out transaction it goes to a check with which you could do anything you want   and then not pay the loan back   i know no one here would do that but there are some folks that would and this is one of the reasons cash out loans are not nearly as easy as they once were to get

following up on 's answer if you can find a less expensive loan you can refinance the car and reduce the total interest you pay that way or if your loan permits it not all do talk to the bank which holds the loan read the paperwork you did n't look at you may be able to make additional payments to reduce the principal of the loan which will reduce the amount and duration of the loan and could significantly reduce the total interest paid at the cost of requiring you pay more each month or pay an additional sum up front returning the car is not an option a new car loses a large portion of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer 's lot and it ceases to be a new car you ca n't return it you can sell it as a recent model used car but you will lose money on the deal so even if you use that to pay down the loan you will still owe the bank money given the pain involved that way you might as well keep the car and just try to refinance or pay it off next time read and understand all the paperwork before signing   if you had decided this was a mistake within 3 days of buying you might have been able to take advantage of cooling down period laws to cancel the contract if such laws exist in your area a month later is much too late

is there more on where dalio gets his definitions for the short term debt cycle 5 8 years or so and deleveraging and the long term debt cycle 75 100 years or his evidence that separates the two   at one point he says the difference is that in a deleveraging interest rates hit 0 and can no longer go lower but i do n't know if that works as a definition per se   there are other things that central banks do when interest rates hit 0 like buy up assets which he does mention and include in the print money category of things that can be done during a deleveraging   and one of the he cites england in the 1950s according to wikipedia was due to difficulty in transitioning out from war production and according to this excel statistics documents rates from the bank of england on historical rates it does n't say interest rates went to 0 at that time unless dalio is referring to another point in history when he cites 1950s england     his definition of a depression is when debt restructuring or defaults happen   interesting   what i learned was that there is n't really a hard and fast definition for recessions and depressions e.g. a recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row and a depression is just a bad long recession   and i do n't think i recall in the past an attempt to define what a deleveraging event of an economy is     is debt reduction and redistribution of wealth deflationary   i think it depends on how much the debt reduction or redistribution hurts the spending of the lender or wealthy versus how much it helps the spending of the borrower or the poor   both are actually similarly giving some from the haves to the have nots and especially redistribution of wealth is similar to fiscal spending which is mentioned as a valid inflationary way to try to help the economy   are deflationary methods say austerity needed to balance out the inflationary methods central bank buying assets and fiscal spending   are n't central bank interest rates quantitative easing and the government fiscal policy still the main things that move inflation or deflation   i would think that debt reduction and redistribution of wealth are good when needed but i would n't think you would do those things mainly for their supposed see above for my doubts deflationary effects     still a very interesting video and one of the best presented videos on a difficult subject

in many cases the expenses are not pulled out on a specific day so this would n't work on the other hand some funds do charge an annual or quarterly fee if your investment in the fund is larger than the minimum but lower than a small balance value many funds will reduce or eliminate this fee if you signup for electronic forms or other electronic services some will also eliminate the fee if the total investment in all your funds is above a certain level for retirement funds what you suggest could be made more complex because of annual limits though if you were below the limits you could decide to add the extra funds to cover those expenses as the end of the year approached

the real value of a share of stock is the current cash value of all dividends the owner will receive plus the current cash value of the final liquidation if any   since people with different needs may judge the current cash value of an income stream differently there would be a market basis for people to buy and sell stocks even if everyone could predict all future payouts perfectly if shareholders knew that a company would n't pay any dividends until it was liquidated in the year it would pay $ then each share would in 2016 effectively be a fifty year zero coupon bond with a $ 2000 maturity value   while some investors would be willing to trade in such an instrument the amount of money a company could charge for such an instrument would be far lower than the money it could charge for one with payouts that were more evenly distributed through time since the founders of most companies want their companies to be around for a long time that would mean that shareholders would have no expectation of their shares ever yielding anything of value within any foreseeable timeframe   even those who would be more interested in share price appreciation than dividends would n't be able to see share prices rise if there was n't any likelihood of the stock being bought by someone who wanted the dividends

i think the real problem here is dealing with the variable income the envelope solution suggests the problem is that your brother does n't have the discipline to avoid spending all his money immediately but maybe that 's not it maybe he could regulate his expenses just fine but with such a variable income he ca n't settle into a normal spending pattern without any savings any budget would have to be based on the worst possible income for a month this is n't a great it means a poor quality of life and what do you do with the extra money in the better than worst months while it 's easy to say plan for the worst then when it 's better save that money that 's just not going to happen no one will want to live at their worst case standard of living all the time someone would have to be a real miser to have the discipline to not use that extra money for something you can say to save it for emergencies or unexpected events but there 's always a way to rationalize spending it i 'm a musician so this new is a necessary business expense or maybe the car is broken surely this is a necessary expense but do you buy a $ 1000 car or a $ 20000 car there 's always a way to rationalize what 's necessary but it does n't change financial reality with a highly variable income he will need some cash saved up to fill in the bad months which is replenished in the good months for success you need a reasonable plan for making that happen one that includes provisions for spending it other than please try not to spend it i would suggest tracking income accurately for several months then you will have a real number not a guess of what an average month is then you can budget on that you will also have real numbers that allow you to calculate how long the bad stretches are and thus determine how much cash reserve is necessary to make the odds of going broke in a bad period unlikely having that you can make a budget based on average income which should have some allowance for enjoying life of course initially the cash reserve does n't exist but knowing exactly what will happen when it does provides a good motivation for building the reserve rather than spending it today knowing that the budget includes rules for spending the reserves reduces the incentive to cheat of course the eventual budget should also include provisions for long term savings for retirement medical expenses car maintenance etc you can do the envelope thing if that 's helpful the point here is to solve the problem of the variable income so you can have an average income that does n't result in a budget that delivers a soul crushing decrease in quality of living

cash price is $ 22,500 financed it 's the same thing 0 interest but you pay a $ 1500 fee = 6.6 basically the apr for your loan is 1.1 per year but you are paying it all upfront opportunity cost if you take the $ 22,500 you plan to pay for the car and invested it could you earn more than the $ 1500 interest on the car loan according to google as of today you can get 1 year cd 1.25 so yes it 's likely that interest rates will be going up in medium term so you can potentially earn even more   insurance cost if you finance you 'll have to get comprehensive insurance which could be costly however if you are planning to get it anyway it 's a brand new car after all that 's a wash which brings me to my main point why do you have $ 90k in a savings account even if you are planning to buy a house you should have that money invested in liquid assets earning you interest   conclusion take the cheap money while it 's available you never know when interest rates will go up again

in my mind these are quite different though maybe there is some vague analogy in meta space that is escaping me   this is n't about manipulating scarcity or demand it 's about manipulating pricing i guess the common thread is that it 's about manipulating   the motivation is to skirt the commercial code requirement that you ca n't charge people by ability to pay by dividing the market into a high end and a low end and giving the people who ca n't pay as much a less desirable product   in this case producing the high end product is easily possible to do for everyone but if you put it at the high price you 'd get too few buyers and if you put it at the low price you 'd leave money on the table   similar schemes have been used in airlines to charge businesses more by assuming they have to plan things last minute and making the high price be around of tickets and assuming vacations are planned longer out and are really being sold to a market of people with less money to spend   by controlling the character of the sale in a situation where delivery of the product costs about the same you maximize the revenue   it used to be though no longer is that phone calls were done this way too   you got better pricing off hours even though the phone lines were there 24/7 because it was assumed that the only people who must have phone calls especially long distance were businesses who could afford steeper prices   by calling off hours calling a different product you could charge less for it and thus do the only thing you really wanted which is to get maximal amounts of money out of business and non business people based on their ability to pay but by a dodge that caused the products to be differentiated so that it could n't be said you were charging based on ability to pay

i hate to say it and i will probably be downvoted to oblivion but i do n't think you can do anything   i 'm not an expert so i might be wrong but if greece or any euro country for that matters decides to exit the euro the currency will be dead within the week that from what i 've read in various newspapers will be an incredibly bad news for the european economy which will collapse in a very short period of time then the collapse would propagate more or less slowly more or less significantly to other economies especially china and us possibly middle east too   at that point you well we have a major economic would it really matter if you had a tiny bit more money than your neighbour if production stops goods do n't move that much anymore and your country is generally in such a deep shit that the potato famine will look like a day in   i agree with what other people are saying they will not allow the euro to fall they sounds like hidden but even if european leaders have taught us that we can expect the worse from them 2 world wars in the last centuries are just the quicker reminder of their stupidity there 's the americans the and so on   i think the worst thing you or anyone else in europe can do is panicking and moving their money around if the exchange rate with the euro is not fixed and nothing is you still have a chance to lose a significant amount of money in the short medium run in a worst case scenario   chill relax if you 're really desperate and think that things will go bad try turning a hobby into another job especially if you can do it online and can bring you a steady income eventually   tl dr if the world economy collapse you will still lose money live happy chill

gt;i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   gt;the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages    the law should not force any party to sit at any table that violates a party 's contract liberty   gt;the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits   that 's nice that you think you know what 's better for other people than they do for themselves but that does n't give you a right to force them to any table a right to contract freedom means the right to dismiss any offer or refuse to even negotiate with a party   gt;if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that   then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   gt;i'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   sorry i do n't have time to dig up citations now if i have time later i 'd be happy to do so all i could find now is an inverse correlation between the state of a country 's credit market and the rate of child labor     is an abundance of indirect empirical evidence discussed below concerning   the role of credit constraints and educational   however and   2002 test the hypothesis directly   they estimate a basic model of child labor determination for a panel of countries for the years 1950 60 1970 1980 and 1995     gt;&gt;the credit constraint variable is by the share in gdp of private credit issued by 10 deposit money banks   they find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of credit in gdp is associated with a 10 percent standard deviation decrease in child labor they conclude that families with access to credit are considerably less likely to put   children to work during a period of economic volatility than parents without access to credit   educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers    if there are efficient financial markets that allow parents to borrow money against the expected future increase in earnings from their children being educated then yes   in less developed economies these markets have not developed and the choice is often between death and child labor    gt;they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries    studies have shown that by and large parents act towards their children and only put them to work if it is in the children 's best interest e.g. page 32     together the evidence so far presented it   appears that the data are consistent with a model where the returns from child   labor do not accrue to the parents parents redistribute entirely these returns to their children in the form of lower labor supply and higher schooling plus possibly increased consumption 47   laws against child labor therefore will generally do more harm than good   gt;what 's the solution here   the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   gt;this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none   a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   gt;i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford   why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so   the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   gt;i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes   a general effect happens gradually over a course of decades and happens in the aggregate not in every case it will not be apparent in the short run and will not be manifested in every case in other words that unionization did not result in immediate bankruptcy of your industry does not prove that unionization does not have a negative effect over the average long term performance of industries and average long term increase in wages

in finance a lot say corporate tax is the original sin   corporate taxes make debt financing more attractive so every company 's debt ratio is much higher than it would be if there were no corporate tax which makes them more vulnerable to shocks in cashflow and at higher risk of default in a downturn   a slight downturn can snowball into a larger one because companies are so heavily debt financed they end up unable to service their debt and end up in worse situations than if they were more equity financed subsequently banks become much more important in the economy because everyone is more leveraged and more company value is tied up in bank debt balances   of course the voting public does n't generally want to lower the corporate tax rate because the general population believes this is how they get their pound of flesh out of corporate america however that is rarely the case

for a two year time frame a good insured savings account or a low cost short term government bond fund is most likely the way i would go depending on the specific amount it may also be reasonable to look into directly buying government bonds the reason for this is simply that in such a short time period the stock market can be extremely volatile imagine if you had gone all in with the money on the stock market in say 2007 intending to withdraw the money after two years take a broad stock market index of your choice and see how much you 'd have got back and consider if you 'd have felt comfortable sticking to your plan for the duration since you would likely be focused more on preservation of capital than returns during such a relatively short period the risk of the stock market making a major or even relatively minor downturn in the interim would should be a bigger consideration than the possibility of a higher return the return of capital not return on capital rule if the stock market falls by 10 it must go up by 11 to break even if it falls by 25 it must go up by 33 to break even if you are looking at a slightly longer time period such as the example five years then you might want to add some stocks to the mix for the possibility of a higher return still however since you have a specific goal in mind that is still reasonably close in time i would likely keep a large fraction of the money in interest bearing holdings bank account bonds bond funds rather than in the stock market a good compromise may be medium to high yield corporate bonds it should n't be too difficult to find such bond funds that can return a few percentage points above risk free interest if you can live with the price volatility over time and as you get closer to actually needing the money shift the holdings to lower risk holdings to secure the capital amount yes short term government bonds tend to have dismal returns particularly currently it 's pretty much either that or the country is just about bankrupt already which means that the risk of default is quite high which is reflected in the interest premiums demanded by investors but the risk in most countries short term government bonds is also very much limited and generally when you are looking at using the money for a specific purpose within a defined and relatively short time frame you want to reduce risk even if that comes with the price tag of a slightly lower return and as always never put all your eggs in one basket a combination of government bonds from various countries may be appropriate just as you should diversify between different stocks in a well balanced portfolio make sure to check the limits on how much money is insured in a single account for a single individual in a single institution and for a household you do n't want to chase high interest bank accounts only to be burned by something like that if the institution goes bankrupt generally the sooner you expect to need the money the less risk you should take even if that means a lower return on capital and the risk progression ignoring currency effects which affects all of these equally is roughly short term government bonds long term government bonds or regular corporate bonds high yield corporate bonds stock market large cap stock market mid and low cap yes there are exceptions but that 's a rule of thumb

have her pay something like a friendly monthly rent this should be less than half of the monthly mortgage cost since you are assuming the risk and benefits of a mortgage and closer to the rent of similar places near you for when you get married and she is to have half the apartment have a pre agreed way to calculate a lump sum that she needs to provide to match your own contributions up to that time as if you two had equal contributions from the beginning the financially precise way to do it would be to have her pay more than the mere sum of the amount since she will be providing the amount at a later time than you but i would be generous and skip this in your place if the difference is not too big if you break up she will have payed what would be a fair amount of rent as if you two were renting so in this sense it is fair that she would not have a claim on the apartment in case that you two would like that she keeps the apartment you can just sell it to her having her pay this same amount as above and assume responsibility for the rest of the mortgage

look at a broader diversification something like for physical gold i 'd look at a mix of gold coins and bullion study the pricing model for coins you 'll probably find that the spreads on small coins make them too expensive there are a few levels of risk with storing in a vault the practical risk is that your government will close banks in the event of a panic and your money will be inaccessible you need to balance that risk with the risk to your personal security that comes with having lots of gold or cash in your home my recommendation is to avoid wasting time on the mad max scenarios if the world economy collapses into utter ruin we 're all screwed a few gold coins wo n't do much for you

the irs has been particularly vague about the substantially identical investment part of the wash rule   many brokers schwab for instance say that only identical exactly the same etf matter for the wash rule in their internal calculations but warn that the irs might consider two etfs over the same index to be substantially identical   in your case the broker has chosen to call these a wash despite even having different underlying indices   talking to the broker is the first step as they will report it to the irs   though technically you have the final say in your taxes about the cost basis   discussing this with the irs could be rather painful first though it is probably worth checking with your broker about exactly what happened   there are other wash sale triggers that frequently trip people up that may have been in play here

not necessarily especially if your business model is founded on a free internet    take netflix in the short term they might make enough in tax breaks to pay for the fast lanes that isps want to charge but what happens when the isp decides to just bar netflix entirely because they are a competitor   they do n't even have to block them they could just intentionally throttle netflix to a degree where the service is unusable    so consumers are sitting there with crappy quality coming from netflix but that spectrum app is expanding and streams just swell    that 's where it is headed if net neutrality is killed if netflix does n't see this then they are blind and it is n't just netflix either it 's any service that competes with an isp 's other companies    in order for these tech companies to continue to enjoy success they need net neutrality or failing that a legal requirement that all isps can not have other businesses besides being an isp or true competition in all marketplaces for high speed internet

i 'd lean toward using the $ 3,000 from the emergency fund although depending on your monthly bills a $ 2,000 emergency fund or even a $ 5,000 one may be a bit small but here are a couple of other options for you zero interest balance transfers if you have cards and have a zero balance on them your credit card companies are keen to see you put a balance on them find out if they 're offering any 12 months no interest on balance transfers offers or if any of their rivals is since of course the car loan is an outstanding balance you can transfer you 're not asking them for cash put the $ 3,000 on that zero balance transfer option get rid of the car and pay the $ 300/mo to pay down the balance on the card 10 months later two months before the end of the free period you 're at zero again   without dipping into your emergency fund you 'll also now have a history with that card company of paying back which may lead them to attempt to entice you to go into more debt which you 'll resist of course by increasing the limit if you do n't want a higher limit just tell them to reduce it again a $ 3,000 unsecured loan with no pre payment penalty provided the math works out the interest may be expensive unless you find something with a teaser rate for the first x months but if you find an option do the math on it to see if it 's actually more expensive than carrying the car payments insurance etc on a depreciating asset it may not be as expensive as the 20 rate or whatever makes it sound but again do the math and if you apply your $ 300/mo to it within say 11 months you 're clear again   with a nice little paid back loan on your credit report both of these ensure that you still have your emergency fund at your disposal and both capitalize on the fact that right now you 're probably a good credit risk if you dip into your emergency fund and an emergency happens like loss of a job and you find yourself short of funds you may have trouble securing further credit at that point to cover the gap in your emergency fund

a short sale will be pretty bad for your credit report it will for 7 years   this may ruin your opportunity to buy in the new area on the other hand you need to run the numbers the last i looked into this the bank will look at rent and discount it by 25 so the shortfall of $ 800/mo after adjustment will reduce your borrowing power if you rent it out   in general this is the idea you rent for a year and buy into the new area if you short sell after this while your credit is trashed you still have your new home and $ 50 k less debt   disclaimer there are those who question the ethics of this a willing short sale i am offering a purely business answer and making no judgment either way i owed $ 90 k on a condo where others were selling for $ 20k. i paid until it came up enough that a lump sum got me out upon sale the bank got its money in full   an article on the differences between foreclosure and short sale

because an equity option can be constructed at essentially any price by two willing counterparties on an exchange there are not enough to represent the entire i.e. infinite option chain for even a single stock on a single expiration date   as a result are not generated for each individual possible options contract   instead the isin is used only to refer to the underlying symbol and a separate formula is used to refer to the specific option contract for that symbol so that code you pasted is not an isin but rather the standard us equity option naming scheme that you need to provide in addition to the isin when talking to your broker note that and formulas for referring to option contracts in other countries can behave quite differently   also there are many countries and markets that do n't need because the products in question only exist on a single exchange   in those cases the exchange is pretty much free to make up whatever id scheme it wants p.s. now i 'm curious how option chains are identified for strike prices above $   i looked up the only stock i can think of that trades above that price brk.a but it does n't seem to have an option chain or at least google does n't show it

as for refinancing many institutions charge up front fees when doing any type of vehicle loan typically this is in the neighborhood of 1 the value of the loan with a floor of $ 100 although this may vary by lender however for the loan the be secured by the vehicle the principle value must be less than the collateral value in your case this means there is a collateral shortfall of $ 4,000 when working with a traditional bank you would have two options pay the difference up front reducing the principle value of the loan or obtaining a separate loan for the difference this separate loan would often have a higher interest rate unless you have some other form of collateral to secure it with i doubt carmax would do a separate loan all that being said if you plan on selling the vehicle within the next months do n't bother refinancing it wo n't be worth the hassle

i think it 's a silly statement if you are prepared from the start that you might lose it then you should n't invest you invest to earn not to lose most often losses are a result of fear   remember you only lose when you sell lower than you bought for   so if you have the patience you will probably regain i ask my clients many times how much do they want to earn and they all say as much as possible last time i checked that 's not an objective and therefore a strategy ca n't be built for that   if there is   a strategy then exiting a stock is easy   without a strategy you never know when to exit and then you are exposed to   losses i 've successfully traded for many years with large amounts of money i made money in the fc and in the bubble both times it was n't because i was prepared to lose but because i had an entry and exit strategy if you have both the idea of investing what u are prepared to lose has little value

how so if i sell short then i make a profit only if the price goes down so i can buy back at a lower price yes but if the price is going up then you would go long instead shorting a stock or any other asset allows you to profit when the price is going down going long allows you to profit when the price is going up in the opposite cases you lose money in order to make a profit in either of those situations you have to accurately assess which way the price will trade over the period of time you are dealing with if you make the wrong judgment then you lose money because you 'll either sell for a lower price than you bought if you went long or have to buy back at a higher price than you sold for if you went short in either case unless the trader can live with making a short term loss and it later one needs a good stop loss strategy

well first off good luck getting many rational responses to a hypothetical economics question this sensitive lol    so in the interest of a purely academic exercise and expressly not any form of recommendation or road map for application let 's dig in   you would need to clarify a few things in order to assess the economic impact of adding slaves to your society   1 is the supply of slaves limited   2 is the ownership of slaves limited to a small sector of society or available at large to a wide portion of society   3 do your slaves represent a net increase to population or are you some percentage of your population   4 does the nature of work that slaves are capable of compete directly with or effect the employment levels of your population   5 is the level of and relative cost of automation robotics and artificial intelligence in your society advanced to the point where slaves would even be beneficial   6 does your society have the means of enforcement security and technological or otherwise to control a population of slaves over the long term   7 are other countries namely your trading partners also introducing slaves   8) what are the costs of acquiring housing feeding and maintaining slaves they are not zero cost   its not possible to answer the question without those answers but note that the addition of slaves is most likely deflationary in economic terms as you are increasing productive capacity at an assumed lower cost at the same time you are most likely some percentage of conventional paid workers thereby increasing unemployment which if the phillips curve still applies edges us towards lower inflation or deflation

great question but i 'm thinking you 'll want to get a professional who can look at your specific situation and do it right   i would n't go solely on advice here   having said that though my decidedly non professional advice the other alternative is to take a bit of a profit hit and demand that the seller pay cash   then the transaction becomes much easier and quicker but again i urge you to have a pro look at this

the usual rule of thumb is that you should start considering refinance when you can lower the effective interest rate by 1 or more if you 're now paying 4.7 this would mean you should be looking for loans at 3.7 or better to find something that 's really worth considering one exception is if the bank is willing to do an in place refinance with no closing costs and no points sometimes banks will offer this as a way of retaining customers who would otherwise be tempted to refinance elsewhere you should still shop around before accepting this kind of offer to make sure it really is your best option most banks offer calculators on their websites that will let you compare your current mortgage to a hypothetical new one feed the numbers in and it can tell you what the difference in payment size will be how long you need to keep the house before the savings have paid for the closing costs and what the actual savings will be if you sell the house in any given year or total savings if you do n't sell until after the mortgage is paid off remember that in addition to closing costs there are amortization effects in the early stages of a standard mortgage your money is mostly paying interest the amount paying down the principal increases over the life of the loan that 's another of the reasons you need to run the calculator refinancing resets that clock

great question there are two ways to increase the amount of money you have it 's difficult to decrease your expenses past a certain point and your question is focused on the first aspect anyway but it 's worth noting that controlling spending is a significant part of accumulating wealth you need to make more money and there 's no trick to it ask for a raise sure that ca n't hurt but also think about what you need to do to get a higher paying job there 's a lot to think about does you current job have growth potential are you doing everything you can do to maximize that potential if you 're just it in and collecting your paycheck that 's not going to make you much more money but if you 're working hard learning new skills and have an opportunity to grow into more responsibilities and more money that 's a good start in my experience the biggest paycheck increases have come from looking for new opportunities and switching jobs btw i 'm not suggesting quitting your job you need to always have the new job locked up before quitting the old job the wealthiest people i know are self employed and they worked hard to build up their companies do you work in an industry where you can build your skills to a point where you can go out on your own does entrepreneurship interest you either way focus on your job skills and maximizing your income potential be your own advocate make sure your boss knows what a good job you 're doing if you need to start looking for other options take your time and start looking the often quoted line the harder i work the luckier i get is appropriate

we do n't have a good answer for how to start investing in poland   we do have good answers for the more general case which should also work in poland   e.g. best way to start investing for a young person just starting their career this answer provides a checklist of things to do   let 's see how you 're doing    match on work pension plan you do n't mention this   may not apply in poland but ask around in case it does   given your income you should be doing this if it 's available    emergency savings you have plenty   either six months of spending or six months of income   make sure that you maintain this   do n't let us talk you into putting all your money in better long term investments    high interest debt you do n't have any   keep up the good work    avoid pmi on mortgage as i understand it you do n't have a mortgage   if you did you should probably pay it off   not sure if pmi is an issue in poland    roth ira not sure if this is an issue in poland   a personal retirement account in the us    additional 401k a reminder to max out whatever your work pension plan allows   the name here is specific to the united states   you should be doing this in whatever form is available    after that i disagree with the options   i also disagree with the order a bit but the basic idea is sound   one time opportunities emergency savings eliminate debt maximize retirement savings   check with a tax accountant so as not to make easily avoidable tax mistakes    you can use some of the additional money for things like real estate or a business   try to keep under 20 for each   but if you do n't want to worry about that kind of stuff it 's not that important   there 's a certain amount of effort to maintain either of those options   if you do n't want to put in the effort to do that it makes sense not to do this    if you have additional money split the bulk of it between stock and bond index funds   you want to maintain a mix between about 70/30 and stocks to bonds   the index funds should be based on broad indexes   they probably should be european wide for the most part although for stocks you might put 10 or so in a polish fund and another 15 in a true international fund    think over your retirement plans   where do you want to live   in your current apartment   in a different apartment in the same city   in one of the places where you inherited property   somewhere else entirely   also do you like to vacation in that same place    consider buying a place in the appropriate location now or keeping the one you have if it 's one of the inherited properties   you can always rent it out until then   many realtors are willing to handle the details for you    if the place that you want to retire also works for vacations consider short term rentals of a place that you buy   then you can reserve your vacation times while having rentals pay for maintenance the rest of the year    as to the stuff that you have now    look that over and see if you want any of it   you also might check if there are any other family members that might be interested   e.g. cousins etc   if not you can probably sell it to a professional company that handles estate sales   make sure that they clear out any junk along with the valuable stuff    consider keeping furniture for now   sometimes it can help sell a property    you might check if you want to drive either of them   if not the same applies check family first   otherwise someone will buy them perhaps on consignment they sell for a commission rather than buying and reselling    there 's no hurry to sell these   think over whether you might want them    consider if they hold any sentimental value to you or someone else   if not sell them   if there 's any difficulty finding a buyer consider renting them out   you can also rent them out if you want time to make a decision   do n't leave them empty too long   there 's maintenance that may need done e.g. heat to keep water from freezing in the pipes    that 's easy just invest that    i would n't get in too much of a hurry to donate to charity   you can always do that later   and try to donate anonymously if you can   donating often leads to spam where they try to get you to donate more

eh a fico change is more important than you think   underwriting almost always include minimum fico scores this only really becomes important when you get into securitization and the standards both and private label required for mbs issuance because of course an underwriter can originate a loan and then hold it it on the books this is very prevalent in non conforming jumbo loans   that said if you want to sell the whole loans to a or private label they have to meet underwriting requirements reps amp warranties    to your original answer you 're right that it probably wo n't make a difference but not because fico does n't matter moreso because there are only 9 million potential borrowers affected and that 9 million most likely does n't constitute any real demand for mortgages   this also ignores the possibility that fico requirements in underwriting standards adjust to fico 9 but i really doubt that they will

this is what your car loan would look like if you paid it off in 14 months at the existing rate you 'll pay a total of about $ in interest    if you do a balance transfer of the $ 10,000 at 3 it 'll cost you $ 300 up front and your payment on the remaining $ 5,000 will be $ to pay it off in the 14 month period   your total monthly payment will be $ $ 5,000 amortized at for 14 months plus $ 10,300 divided by 14 $ +   your interest will be about $ $ 300 from the balance transfer and $ 92 from the remaining $ 5,000 on the car loan at even if your lender does n't credit your additional payment to principal and instead simply credits future payments you 'd still be done in 15 months with a total interest expense of about $   so this additional administration and additional loan will save you maybe about $ 55 over 14 or 15 months

gold is a commodity   it has a tracked price and can be bought and sold as such   in its physical form it represents something real of value that can be traded for currency or   a single pound of gold is worth about dollars it is very valuable and it is easily transported as opposed to a car which loses value while you transport it   there are other metals that also hold value platinum silver copper etc as well as other commodities   platinum has a higher value to weight ratio than gold but there is less of a global quantity and the demand is not as high   a gold mine is an investement where you hope to take out more in gold than it cost to get it out    just like any other business   high gold prices simply lower your break even point tips protects you from inflation but does not protect you from devaluation   it also only pays the inflation rate by the treasury   there are experts who believe that the fed has understated inflation   if these are correct then tips is not protecting its investors from inflation as promised    you can also think of treasury bonds as an investment in your government   your return will be effectively determined by how they run their business of governing   if you believe that the government is doing the right things to help promote the economy then investing in their bonds will help them to be able to continue to do so   and if consumers buy the bonds then the treasury does not have to buy any more of its own

when they make the most money off of charging interest on late payments this is incorrect do you have any data to back this in the past decade there was a tendency by financial institutions to make money from late payments and there were certain rewards incentives for people who paid late however the bubble cracked soon enough and there were huge losses in the card industry today most of the revenue for card companies is from margins on customers who pay on time and growth avenues are promoting to pay every transaction by card why do they actively seek people who pay their bills on time as evidence by requiring good credit scores to get approved for a card instead of they opposite as indicated above remember if one customer defaults it wipes out margins made by tons of customers in spite of giving credit to people with good credit score the average credit card debit an us individual holds is still quite high

they are purchasing the company is this correct yes this is correct if i purchase a company here in australia i also purchase its assets and liabilities yes that is correct how can it be nil how can it be legal the value of shares or shareholders is assets liabilities generally a healthy company has assets that are greater than its liabilities and hence the company has value and shareholders have value of the shares in case of ten the company has more liabilities even after all assets are sold off there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors hence the company is in administration i.e. it is now being managed by regulated australian authority the job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal in case of ten the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of cbs will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative as the company is separate legal entity they ca n't recover the negative from shareholders even the current creditors may not be paid in full and may get a pro rated due and may lose some money

in to your questions as @joetaxpayer said you really should look into a solo 401(k in 2017 this allows you to contribute up to $ 18k year and your employer the llc to contribute more up to $ year total subject to irs rules 401(k usually have roth and traditional sides just like ira i believe the employer contributed funds also see less tax burden for both you and your llc that if that same money had become salary payroll taxes etc you might start at and go from there roth vs. pre tax you can mix and match within years and between years figure out what income you want to have when you retire any year you expect to pay lower taxes low income kids deductions etc make roth contributions any year you expect high taxes bonus high wage taxable capital gains etc make pre tax payments i have had a uniformly bad experience with target date funds across multiple 401(k plans from multiple plan they just do n't perform well a common problem with almost any actively managed fund you probably do n't want to deal with individual stocks in your retirement accounts so rather pick passively managed index funds that track various markets segments you care about and just sit on them for example your high risk money might be in fast growing but volatile industries e.g. tech aerospace medical your medium risk money might go in total market or s&p 500 index funds and your low risk money might go in treasury notes and bonds the breakdown is up to you but as an 18 year old you have a ~50 year horizon and so can afford to wait out anything short of another great depression and maybe even that so you 'd want generally you want more or your money in the high risk high return   category rebalancing to lower risk investments as you age diversifying into real estate foreign investments etc might also make sense but i 'm no expert on those

i would not sell unless the stock is starting to fall in price if you are a long term investor you can review the weekly chart on a weekly basis to determine if the stock is still up trending regarding hd below is a weekly chart for the last 4 years   basically if the price is making higher highs hh and higher lows it is up trending if it starts to make lower lows ll followed by lower highs then the uptrend is over and the stock could be entering a downtrend with hd the price has been up trending but seems to now be hitting some headwinds it has been making some followed by some hls throughout the last 2 years it did make a ll in late august 2015 but then recovered nicely to make a new hh so the uptrend was not broken in early november 2016 it made another ll but this time it seems to be followed by a in mid december 2016 this could be clear evidence that the uptrend may be ending the final confirmation would be if the price drops below the early november low of $ the orange line if price drops below this price it would be confirmation that the uptrend is over and this should be the point at which you should sell your hd shares you could place an automatic stop loss order just below $ so that you do n't even need to monitor the stock frequently another indication that the uptrend may be in trouble is the divergence between the of the price and the peaks of a momentum indicator in this case the macd the two sloping red lines show that the price made in april and august 2016 whilst the momentum indicator made at these peaks in the price as the lines are sloping in different directions it is demonstrating negative divergence which means that the momentum of the uptrend is slowing down and can act as an early warning system to be more cautious in the near future so the question you could be asking is when is a good time to sell out of hd or at least some of your hd to rebalance why sell something that is still increasing in price only sell if you can determine that the price will not be increasing anymore in the near to medium term

the biggest red flag is the fact that your parents may lose their house there are multiple parts of the decision   the red flag comes in because you are stretching your finances to the max to afford the house you are interested in buying down the interest rate makes some sense depending on how long you plan on staying but not a a way to afford house x.   of course a bigger down payment will also influence the size of the house you are also buying something in case your parents need a place to live what happens if that never occurs you now have something bigger than you need you are mixing investments and housing there is no guarantee that you will even break even on the house as a investment it can take several years to make back the closing costs involved in buying and selling a house based solely on stable price and your monthly payments if the price drops you might never make the money back   you might be better off renting what you need now or waiting until the current house is lost and then renting what you need then

why do banks charge a significantly lesser rate for a 15 yr fixed mortgage than a 30yr though they know it will not earn them the same amount of money   a simplistic model of where banks get the money to lend to borrowers is that they borrow money from investors that want to earn a return on the money that they provide   the actual mechanics of that process are much more complicated but the gist is that if those investors want to tie their money up for a longer period they expect to get a higher return thus 30-year mortgages require a higher interest rate than 15-year mortgages   in addition the usual consensus in the market is that interest rates will rise in the future so interest rates for longer term loans are higher   while it 's true that the bank gets more money overall from a higher rate mortgage the fact that that additional money does n't come until several years into the loan and that money loses value over time due to inflation makes a lower rate 15 year mortgage roughly equivalent to a higher rate 30-year mortgage

with no written agreement in place the right rate is whatever both parties can agree to i could argue that i could have invested the money in s&p 500 index funds and made about 9 annually over the last 15 years and the 15,000 would have been over 40,000   the fair rate would be whatever rate of return could have been expected from whatever your father would have done with the money otherwise keep it in a bank account pay off debt invest in the market start a business whatever   your father has the benefit of hindsight to know what would have been a good use of the funds over 15 years using the rate of inflation results in effectively a zero percent loan in real interest terms meaning no profit was made just accounting for the time value of money both parties need to either decide on an amount or equivalent rate or decide if squeezing the other for a few thousand euros is worth the strife

from my understanding as a seller and having read through amazon 's 8 page calculation methodology document the default is the ship to address however the seller still has the option to charge the tax or not only charge the state rate and local city county district etc or even set their own self determined default tax rate   in other words the seller has a lot of control in determining what rate they use and the billing and shipping addresses may not even matter   just remember that whatever tax you pay to amazon your state will probably still hold you responsible for calculating and reporting any additional use tax based on your location   and if the seller does overcharge for tax you may have a right to request a refund from them

well that 's the whole point of this issue and why there 's a debate    and concerning the analogy whether retail and manufacturing can be the same entity or not and whether as a retailer you can push only your own brands is also up for debate   it 's called regulation it 's meant to prevent monopolies and cartels from forming among other things we 've seen this happen elsewhere too transportation electricity water healthcare etc businesses do not have the right to do whatever they want    i also think what has not been is that internet provision is effectively a cartel in the us with different isps holding monopolies in different parts of the country which has been allowed to continue    anyways i 'm not in the us so i 'm not affected by this where i live has confirmed net neutrality and anti monopoly legislation is important and anyways there 's isp competition so this bullshit can not be applied unless they work together but i think if this goes through the us internet will end up even more like the us cable industry to the detriment of users i 'm also worried about the knock on effects this will have with the rest of the world

to answer your question yes it 's often worth it to have investments that produce income do a google search for income vs growth investing and you 'll get a sense for two different approaches to investing in equities in a nutshell growth stocks think netflix etc do n't pay dividends but are poised to appreciate in price more than income stocks think banks utilities etc that tend to have less volatile prices but pay a consistent dividend in the long run decades growth stocks tend to outperform income stocks that 's why younger investors tend to pick growth stocks while those closer to retirement tend to stick with more stable income producing portfolio but there 's nothing wrong with a mixed approach either i agree with pete 's answer too

ignoring the complexities of a and regulated market a futures contract is simply a contract that requires party a to buy a given amount of a commodity from party b at a specified price the future can be over something tangible like pork or oil in which case there is a physical transfer of stuff or it can be over something intangible like shares the purpose of the contract is to allow the seller to lock in a price so that they are not subject to price fluctuations between the date the contract is entered and the date it is complete this risk is transferred to the seller who will therefore generally pay a discounted rate from the spot price on the original day in many cases the buyer actually wants the stuff futures contracts between farmers and manufacturers being one example the farmer who is growing say wool will enter a contract to supply 3000 kg at $ 10 per kg of a given quality etc there are generally price adjustments detailed for varying quality with a textile manufacturer to be delivered in 6 months the spot price today may be $ 11 the farmer gives up $ 1 now to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the manufacturer when the strike date rolls around the farmer delivers the 3000 kg and takes the money if he has failed to grow at least 3000 kg then he must buy it from someone or trigger whatever the penalty clauses in the contract are for futures over shares and other securities the principle is exactly the same say the contract is for 1000 shares of xyz stock party a agrees to sell these for $ 10 each on a given day to party b. when that day rolls around party a transfers the shares and gets the money party a may have owned the shares all along may have bought them before the settlement day or if push comes to shove must buy them on the day of settlement notwithstanding when they bought them if they paid less than $ 10 they make a profit if they pay more they make a loss   generally speaking you ca n't settle a futures contract with another futures contract you have to deliver up what you promised be it wool or shares

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

here in the u.s. a realtor can act as a seller 's agent or a buyer 's agent i think what you are calling a broker in the u.s. we call a buyer 's agent and this may just be a difference in terminology from your post it sounds like the concept is the same i am answering from a u.s. perspective please let me know if something does n't make sense in the israeli context here each typically gets 3 to 3.5 of the sale price at least in my part of the country so yes the buyer 's agent has an incentive to get a higher price even though this is contrary to the interests of the person he is supposed to represent on the other hand the buyer 's agent has a strong incentive to find a house at a price that you consider acceptable if the absolute most you are willing to pay is say and he keeps showing you houses that cost he 's just wasting his time he 's wasting your time too of course but let 's assume he does n't care about that i do n't know what housing prices are in israel today just making up numbers suppose he has two houses that he can show you one in your price range and one not if he shows you the first you may buy it and we will very quickly get his commission if he shows you the second you probably wo n't buy it and he 'll get zero if he keeps showing you houses above your price range he 's doing a bunch of work for which he will never be paid the worst case from your point of view is if you 're thinking that you 're expecting and prepared to pay say to and you tell the broker that his incentive is to concentrate on the upper end maybe even push it a little but still if he shows a house that 's well within your range so you 'll quickly buy he can get today versus trying to push you to go higher so he can maybe get in a few months is the extra worth several months of extra work probably not personally i 've never had a problem with a realtor trying to push me to buy a house more expensive than i said i was prepared to pay at least not that i noticed maybe they were very skillful at it and i did n't realize they were doing it like showing me houses that were totally run down dumps until i decided i was willing to pay more as to your specific suggestion i do n't know if a realtor would be willing to negotiate an alternative deal from their standard contract i 've never tried to do such a thing yes this would give him an incentive to find the lowest possible price arguably this would create a perverse incentive to show you houses of very low quality just because they 're cheap and there would be the problem that he 'd have no incentive to show you houses at or just over your stated maximum as his commission would be zero negative if it goes over slightly what i did on my last house was tell the realtor i want to start by looking at houses costing under if i ca n't find anything i like i 'll go a little higher by not telling the realtor my maximum i discouraged her from immediately going for the maximum at least that was my theory

short answer it depends it should generally be cheaper to get a loan directly from a bank but often a mortgage broker can find you deals that you might not be able to get with a local bank   if you are refinancing the cheapest option of all is usually to go through the bank that holds your existing mortgage as for how mortgage brokers make their money there are two ways   the first is on the front end through fees origination fees especially that go directly to them   the second and less obvious is on the back end   this is where they make money by giving you a loan at a slightly higher rate than the lender was willing to give you   so let 's say they find a lender that will give you a loan at 5.25   they offer that loan to you at 5.5 and pocket the extra .25 when the bank takes it over

your comment to james is telling and can help us lead you in the right direction my work and lifestyle will be the same either way as i said    this is all about how it goes on the books emphasis mine as an independent consultant myself when i hear something like the work will be the same either way i think here be dragons   let me explain if you go the independent contractor route then you better act like one   the irs and the cra for canadians does n't take lightly to people claiming to be independent contractors when they operate in fact like employees since you 're not going to be behaving any different whether you are an employee or a contractor and assuming you 'll be acting more like an employee i.e. exclusive etc then the irs may later make a determination that you are in fact an employee even if you choose to go on the books as an independent contractor if that happens then you may find yourself retroactively denied many tax benefits you 'd have claimed and owe penalties and interest too   furthermore your employer may be liable for additional withholding taxes benefits etc after such a finding so for those reasons you should consider being an employee   you will avoid the potential headache i outlined above as well as the additional paperwork etc of being a contractor if on the other hand you had said you wanted to maintain some flexibility to with other clients build your own product on the side choose what projects you work on or do n't maybe hire subcontractors etc then i 'd have supported the independent contractor idea   but just on the basis of the tax characteristics only i 'd say forget about it on the financial side i can tell you that i would n't have become a consultant if not for the ability to make more money in gross terms i.e. before tax and expenses   that is your top line revenues ought to be higher in order to be able to offset many of the additional expenses you 'd incur as an independent   imho the tax benefits alone   would n't make up for the difference one final thing to look at is form mentioned at the irs link below   if you 're not sure what status to choose the irs can actually help you   but be prepared to wait and wait   additional resources

to start trading at a minimum you need 3 things bank account this again is not must but most preferred to transact quite a few broker would insist on this demat account this is must as all shares on nse are held electronically the custodians are or both government entities these do n't offer services directly to customer but via other financial institutions like banks and large brokers broker account this is required to buy or sell securities if you are only buying in ipo this is not required as one can directly participate in ipo and broker is not involved however if you want to buy and sell on nse you would need a broker account quite a few financial institutes offer all 3 services or 2 services demat broker the fee structure and online service etc are you can take a look at options and decide the best one to use

joetaxpayer 's advice is solid reallocating to your target asset allocation is the right move   you should have an investor policy statement that maps out your financial objectives risk tolerance liquidity constraints etc   from the you can determine your target asset allocation and rebalance accordingly   a few more comments it sounds like 100 of your 401k is in us stocks   you might have other accounts that make your overall portfolio globally diversified but if not you want to make sure to set a target asset allocation for a global portfolio    your statement if this were in my brokerage account i 'd probably cash out some of the profits and hold onto it and buy more shares as the market eventually comes back down but this being a 401k which has semi monthly deposits from my paycheck do i just leave it is a bit counterintuitive   if you are going to try to time the market a very hard task it is better to use a retirement account so you do n't have to realize capital gains   timing the market is probably a bad idea but if you engage in market timing it is probably better to use a retirement account than a brokerage account if you would like to tilt your asset allocation based on the market valuation i recommend researching shiller 's adjusted price to earnings ratio

both a trust and an estate are separate legal entities just like any individual income earned by the trust or estate property e.g. rents collected from real estate is income earned by the trust or the estate who is liable for taxes on income earned by a trust depends on who receives or retains benefits from the trust who is liable for taxes on income received by an estate depends on how the income is classified i.e. income earned by the decedent income earned by the estate income in respect of the decedent or income distributed to beneficiaries generally trusts and estates are taxed like individuals general tax principles that apply to individuals therefore also apply to trusts and estates a trust or estate may earn income and may deduct certain expenses each is allowed a small exemption $ 300 for a simple trust $ 100 for a complex trust $ 600 for an estate however neither is allowed a standard deduction the tax brackets for income taxable to a trust or estate are much more compressed and can result in higher taxes than for individuals in short the trust should have been paying taxes on its gains all along when the money transfers to you it will be taxed as ordinary income

at a minimum i would save 20 30k because you need to have both a safety net and some money for home repairs   very few people move into a house and then do zero repairs painting usually at a minimum and there 's almost always something that comes up pretty soon after   even if you 're buying a condo you 'll want to be sure you can fix anything that needs fixing within that first year or two beyond that you have to decide based on your risk tolerance and your other details like your income   taking a smaller mortgage means a guaranteed 3 to 4 return right now   that 's not quite what you 'll probably get on the market over the long term but how did your investments do last year   my 401(k was down slightly   in order to do better than that 3 4 you 're going to have to invest in stocks or etfs or similar meaning you could have swings potentially year over year which if that 's your only extra 50k might be more than you can tolerate if you 're very risk tolerant and mostly looking to make money over the long term then it may be worth it to you   but if a larger mortgage makes it harder to pay the monthly payments a meaningfully smaller buffer or if your job is such that you might end up having to sell those investments at a loss to cover your mortgage for a few months because you did n't make laid then you may want the smaller mortgage to make that less of a risk though still setting aside the safety net in something minimally risky

follow the instructions on the w-4 it says exactly how you are supposed to calculate the number of allowances you should n't have to figure out how to get the right number just follow the instructions the only part at all complex is if you have large deductions in that case you 're supposed to subtract a standard amount from your actual deductions for 2017 $ if married filing jointly divide by $ 4,050 and then add the result to the number of allowances in general following the instructions on the w-4 should result in slightly more tax being withheld from your paycheck than you actually owe so that you get a modest refund next april 15 in the long run it does n't matter if you have too much withheld as you 'll get it all back eventually anyway i suppose the withholding could be so high that it does n't leave you enough to live on while waiting for your refund but that should n't normally be the case if you pay too little you could be subject to penalties and interest so you really want to avoid that

quote driven markets are the to the modern securities market before electronic trading and hfts specifically trading was thin and onerous   today the average investor can open up a web page type in a security and buy at the spread permitted by regulators with anyone else who wants to take the other side before the lines between market maker and speculator became blurred to a market maker was one who was contractually obligated to an exchange to provide a bid and ask for a given security on said exchange even though at heart a market maker is still simply a trader despite the obligation   a market maker would simultaneously buy a large amount of securities privately and short the same amount to have no directional bias exposure to the direction of the security and commence to making the market   the market maker would estimate its cost basis for the security based upon those initial trades and provide a bid and ask appropriate for the given level of volume   if volumes were high the spread would be low and vice versa market makers who survived crashes and spikes would forgo the potential profit in always providing a steady price and spread ie increased volume otherwise known as revenue to maintain no directional bias   in other words if there were suddenly many buyers and no sellers hitting the market maker 's ask the mm would raise the ask rapidly in proportion to the increased exposure while leaving the bid somewhere below the cost basis   eventually a seller would arise and hit the mm 's bid bringing the market maker 's inventory back into balance and narrowing the spread that particular mm could provide since a responsible mm 's ask could rise very high very quickly if a lack of its volume relative to its inventory made inventory too costly   this was temporarily extremely costly to the trader if there were few market makers on the security the trader was trading or already exposed to market makers prefer to profit from the spread bidding below some predetermined price based upon the cost basis of the market maker 's inventory while asking above that same predetermined cost basis   traders profit from taking exposure to a security 's direction or lack thereof in the case of some options traders because of electronic trading liquidity rebates offered by exchanges not only to contractually obligated official market makers but also to any trader who posts a limit order that another trader hits and algorithms that become better by the day market making hfts have supplanted the traditional market maker and there are many hfts where there previously were few official market makers   this speed and diversification of risk across many many market making hfts have kept spreads to the minimum on large equities and have reduced the same for the smallest equities on major exchanges orders and quotes are essentially identical   both are double sided auction markets with bids and asks   the difference lies in that non market makers specialists etc orders are not shown to the rest of the market providing an informational advantage to mms and an informational disadvantage to the trader   before electronic trading this construct was of no consequence since trader orders were infrequent   with the prevalence of hfts the informational disadvantage has become more costly so order driven markets now prevail with much lower spreads and accelerated volumes even though market share for the major exchanges has dropped rapidly and number of trades even though the size of individual trades have fallen the worst aspect of the quote driven market was that traders could not directly trade with each other so all trades had to go between a market maker specialist etc   while this may seem to have increased cost to a trader who could only trade with another trader by being arbitraged by a mm et al paying more than what another trader was willing to sell these costs were dwarfed by the potential absence of those market makers   without a bid or ask at any given time there could be no trade so the costs were infinite in essence a quote driven market protects market makers from the competition of traders   while necessary in the days where paper receipts were from brokerage to brokerage and the trader did not dedicate itself to round the clock trading it has no place in a computerized market   it is more costly to the trader to use such a market explaining quote driven markets rapid exit

before answering specific question you are liable to pay tax as per your bracket on the income generated i work with my partner and currently we transfer all earning on my personal bank account can this create any issue for me if you are paying your partner from your account you would need to maintain proper paperwork to show the portion of money transferred is not income to you alternatively create a join current account move funds there and then move it to your respective accounts which sort off account should be talk and by whose name can be any account savings current if you are doing more withdrawls open current else open savings it does not matter on who s name the account is paperwork to show income matters from tax point of view what should we take care while transfering money from freelance site to bank nothing specific is there any other alternative to bank there is paypal etc however ultimately it flows into a bank account what are other things to be kept in mind keep proper record of actual income of each of you along with expenses there are certain expenses you can claim from income for example laptop internet mobile phone etc consult a ca he will be able to guide and it does not cost much

others have already explained why lotteries have negative expected value so in that sense it is never wise to buy a lottery ticket   i will provide an alternative view that it is not always unwise to buy a lottery ticket even though the expected value of the lottery ticket is lower than its cost i.e. a loss the question is what you mean with wise a not completely unlikely scenario is one where your life financially suck and even if you saved the cost of the ticket instead of buying it your life would still suck even if you saved the cost for a ticket every week for 10 years your live would not be essentially better you could maybe afford a tv or a new car in 40 years but if you were to quantify the happiness of your life it would still be essentially crappy but winning the lottery would significantly improve your life and make you happy so in this scenario there are two choices either save the money for 0 chance of a happy life or spend it on a ticket for a extremely small chance of a good life yes the expected value of saving the money is higher than when buying the ticket but expected happiness is higher when buying the ticket non zero   this is clearly an extreme example but variants of this might apply the essence is that your valuation of the money is non linear 1 million will make you more than 1000 times as happy as 1000

the standard answer i have heard is that if you were to purchase term life insurance and invest the difference between the cost of the policies your investments would grow larger than the cash value of the insurance also when you take cash out of the insurance value drops by a like amount so you ca n't have your cake and leave it to your heirs too either you get the cash value or they get the insurance value hopefully there could be some of both although i believe the philosophy of that answer i have two issues with it first you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month i can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance second for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value my life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period hmm maybe there is n't a one size fits all solution if you need a large amount of insurance term life will certainly be more affordable however considering this as an investment i would not expect that to be a deciding factor good luck with your decision it is great that at such a young age you are concerned about investments

as mr. money money mustache once said if you have credit card debt you should feel like your hair is on    fire student loan debt is different than credit card debt   rather than having spent the money on just about anything it was invested in improving yourself and probably your financial future   this was probably a good decision however unlike most credit card debt if you ever have to file for bankruptcy your student loans will not be erased   they will follow you forever pay your debts off as quickly as you can   while it may be true that long term return on the stock market is about 7 you can not assume that this will always be the case especially in the short term   what if you had made this assumption in 2007 to assume that your stocks will beat a 6.4 guaranteed return over the next few years is not really investing   it 's gambling

yes the penalty is the tax you pay on it again when you withdraw the money the withdrawal of the excess contribution is taxed as your wages but no penalty excess contribution can not be added to the basis or considered after tax hence the double taxation note that allowing you to keep the excess contribution in the plan may lead to disqualifying the plan so it is likely that the plan administrator will force you to remove the excess contribution if they become aware of it otherwise you may end up forcing early 401(k withdrawal on all of your co workers more on this irs web page and this one

this is another version of an old scam let me have a check deposited in your account because i ca n't open one for some reason and i 'll share some of the money with you   here the scammer is promising to start a business with you as a way to gain your confidence and trust the first danger sign is that you only know this person from online   they are not someone you are friends with in the real world   they could be anybody    they used the name of a big company as a way to make what they 're doing sound legitimate but it 's all a fraud   they could be depositing a faked exxon check into your account which could land you in huge trouble here 's the thing the only way exxon or any other company can deposit money in a bank under someone 's name is if that person provides the account and routing numbers to an account that already exists   no company can just create an account in another person 's name   that 's hollywood movie stuff but it 's not how banking works   to open an account the bank would need identification on the account holder so your friend already has an account if exxon has allegedly deposited money   further exxon is n't going to take back money that has already been deposited   in fact they ca n't take it back   if the account is in his name they ca n't do anything to the account or with the account    this is a situation you should run away from and never look back   nothing about this story sounds right or legitimate but this is one of the oldest scams out there since the beginning of the internet you would be well advised to stay very far away from your supposed friend because they 're anything but your friend   you are being scammed   do n't be a victim   stop communicating with this person immediately and don't give them any personal information of any kind   they 're crooks i hope this helps good luck

i 'm assuming the tag of united states is accurate yes the remaining amount is tax free at the current price   if you sell at exactly the original price there is no capital gain no capital loss   so you 've already payed the taxes if you sell and there is a capital gain of $ 3000 then you will pay taxes on the $ 3000   if 33 is your marginal tax rate and if you held the stock for less than a year then you will keep $ 7000 and pay taxes of $ 1000   somehow i doubt your marginal tax rate is 33 if you hold the stock for a year after etrade sold some for you to pay taxes then you will pay 15 on the gain or $ 450 etrade sold the shares to pay the taxes generated by the income   yes those shares were considered income   if you sell and have a loss well life sucks   however if you sell something else you can use the loss to offset the other gain   so if you sell stock a for a loss of $ 3000 and sell stock b at a gain of $ 4000 then you pay taxes on the net of $ 1000

in this case she had claimed that remaining in would result in from because her husband had hidden in rather than join the army in fact he had served in the army   but the point here is that this was a lie made during the immigration process not the naturalization process during the naturalization process she claimed that she had never given false information to a government official during immigration proceedings of course this was also a lie and hence a crime under 18 u. s. c. 1015   but now there ’s a question does having lied about lying constitute procuring naturalization contrary to law   the supreme court says not on its own specifically   u. s. c. most naturally read strips a person of citizenship not when she committed any illegal act during the naturalization process but only when that act played some role in her naturalization   gt   gt;when the underlying illegality alleged in a prosecution is a false statement to government officials a jury must decide whether the false statement so altered the naturalization process as to have influenced an award of citizenship    now it ’s entirely possible that the lie in this case meets that requirement the court ’s decision however is based on the fact that the jury did not make such a determination rather they were instructed that any lie would be grounds for a guilty verdict hence the court determined that   was not convicted by a properly instructed jury of contrary to law her naturalization

gt;if you know that a company called toyota with no access to any retained earnings   okay we are talking at cross purposes here    i take it as axiomatic that speculative ventures by private actors is mostly a net good thing e.g. grocery stores buying produce before the customer has handed over the gold car makers designing and building cars before they have been paid for end to end etc even if a lot of them fail i take it as axiomatic that we would not have things like laptop computers and fresh oranges year round and non iron shirts without that kind of speculative investment    i also take it as axiomatic that such speculative investment could not would not exist without or publicly issued promissory notes e.g. i do not think anyone would ever have made the first laptop computer if doing so required directly handing previously acquired gold coins to everyone involved in the design and construction    a with no money but infinite time could have built his own macbook pro with display like everything else we have it was dug up out of the ground by people no stronger than you or i. all the functionality is just ingenuity and machining it 's just stuff dug up and re combined by people not necessarily smarter than anyone else the fact that it has been done by human beings means by definition that it can be done by human beings    ergo a could have done it could have placed a man on the moon or built himself a 60 tv or an ipod or a nuclear bomb or a ferrari or sent a satellite past the solar system anything at all we do n't have anything that he did n't have just ingenuity and whatever we dig up out of the ground    but more realistically the difference between us and is   we have a historical record and the accumulated ingenuity of millions of individual insights and   we have an economy based on credibility and promises that allows things to be invented tested and made before they are paid for   i suggest that it is axiomatic that for example ipads would not exist if physical gold had to change hands at every step of development and manufacturing before it could occur or at the instance of there is just no sane scenario where a product like that comes into existence without promises and speculative investment and loan guarantees    same with fresh lettuce in winter or plumbing or electricity or cable tv   you ca n't just trade a grain of gold for every gallon of water that comes out of your shower in real time to a wet bill collector or stick some gold in the cable jack for every minute of internet    someone is promising something without having produced it yet whether you paid in advance or they bill your the service later value has changed hands on credit and promises it 's not a sane proposition that every transaction be a closed loop pay as you go thing especially when you get into commercial transactions    the modern world would not exist without credit markets and credit markets can not exist without something like fractional reserve banking demanding that everyone instantly reconcile every value exchange with a physical transfer of gold or some such is not a sane proposition    would your cell phone company pay someone to follow you around and collect grains of gold for every call if so would that person in turn be followed by the cell tower owner and so on    offering to pay in advance does n't negate the conundrum they still have to provide service which may or may not be covered by your gram of gold it 's still a credit market no matter which way the faucet runs and a credit market means facto that more money is in circulation than has been printed

with the standard i am not a lawyer disclaimer consider this question if you and your girlfriend split up sometime after purchasing the house but before getting married would you expect her to repay you for the closing costs and downpayment   that is if you write her a check for $ 5k and 6 months after she signs the papers for the house one of you decides to break up with the other would you expect her to write you a check for $ 5k in return    that is the difference between a gift and a loan disguised as a gift   if the answer is no you do n't expect it back then everything is fine and you 're in the clear it 's perfectly legal to give someone money   if the answer is yes you would want to be paid back then it 's not a gift and you run the risk of running afoul of the regulations    with respect to a previous answer about gifting money that is not taxed in the us one person can give another up to $ 14,000 without worrying about gift taxes and even in the event that you exceed that amount the excess would simply eat into the lifetime exemption of $   individual states may have different rules and exempt amounts that would apply to state taxes    please also consider the income issue for your rental agreement   your gf would be expected to declare that amount and pay income tax on it as a business   she might also declare part of that amount as expected income for purposes of securing the loan but that may run into its own issues you 're not a roommate and presumably the home is not a duplex or set up as apartments and presumably she would not offer a similar deal to someone other than you

prop proprietary traders trade using huge amounts of a bank 's money i.e. other people 's money so the reason why they have such low commissions and they certainly do is that the firms for which they work negotiate low commissions as the quantities and volumes as they also trade very frequently will be high and so the total commission will be very high there is no such thing as a prop trading account unless you are a big bank with a very large bank roll tens of millions of usd so you can not open one to enjoy those benefits unless you have enough money that you can negotiate your commission with brokers 25k cad is definitely not enough money to even start a conversation about those sorts of commissions note prop traders are generally banned from trading intraday with their own money by their employers and the law as it is a massive conflict of interests those who do and get caught face lengthy prison sentences

i know that both lowes and home depot in canada at least will offer a 6 month deferred interest payment on all purchases over a certain dollar amount iirc $ 500 + and sometimes run product specific 1 year deferred interest specials this is a very effective way of financing renovations details you 've probably seen deferred interest it 's very commonly used in furniture sales no money down no interest do not pay for 1 full year   personally i think it 's a plot by the point manufacturers it works like this typically i manage these types of purchases by dividing the principal by 6 and then adding 5 and paying that amount each month   pay close attention to the end date because you do not want to pay 22 interest on the entire amount    this also requires that you watch your card balance carefully   all payments are usually put to current purchases i.e. those not under a plan first before they are applied to the plan balance   so if you are paying 250 a month on the new floor and run up another $ 150 on paint you need to pay the entire new balance and then the $ 250 floor payment in order for it to be applied correctly   also < shameless plug > < plug >   consider doing it yourself

i assume that with both companies you can buy stock mutual funds bonds mutual funds etfs and money market accounts they should both offer all of these as iras roth iras and non retirement accounts   you   need to make sure they offer the types of investments you want most 401 k or 403b plans only offer a handful of options but for non company sponsored plans you want to have many more choices to look at the costs see how much they charge you when you buy or sell shares also look at the annual expenses for those funds each company website should show you all the fees for each fund take a few funds that you are likely to invest in and have a match in the other fund family and compare the benefit of the retirement accounts is that if you make a less than perfect choice now it is easy to move the money within the family of funds or even to another family of funds later the roll over or transfer does n't involve taxes

released census data reveals nearly 110 million americans more than one third of the country are receiving government assistance of some kind   gt;*the number counts people receiving what are known as means tested federal benefits or subsidies based on income this includes welfare programs ranging from food stamps to subsidized housing to the program most commonly referred to as welfare temporary assistance for needy families   the end of 2012 according to the stats million were on food stamps while 83 million were collecting medicaid with some benefiting from multiple programs   the programs were created to help those in need some analysts worry that the way they ’re designed is increasingly incentivizing people not to work they note that when recipients combine several government assistance programs in many cases they pay better than going to work   gt;*the cato institute ’s michael said that in the eight most generous states the benefits can be tantamount to a $ 20 minimum wage which would exceed the $ 7.25 minimum wage in most states   in many cases people could actually do better on welfare than they could in an entry level job said   cross post from /r maconservative

the scenarios you describe are obviously easy to catch it is reasonably defined in tax law but more needs to be done to exert the spirit of the rules the problem is that when international businesses are cross charging   there is limited information the tax offices have to argue the toss for example a uk tax office can not audit the accounts of its us parent in order to decide whether a cross charge representing license fees and marketing costs is fair but these types of transaction are one of the primary mechanism for avoiding taxes these are inferred by the uk companies accounts but not in the open in the sense that they can be easily challenged with accurate information and that is why it happens people know about it but it is still not easy to stop

i would open a taxable account with the same custodian that manages your roth ira e.g. vanguard fidelity etc then within the taxable account i would invest the extra money in low cost broad market index funds that are tax efficient unlike in your 401(k and roth ira you will now have tax implications if your funds produce dividends or realize a capital gain that is why tax efficient funds are important to minimize this as much as possible   the portfolio is a popular choice for taxable accounts because of simplicity and the tax efficiency of broad market index funds that are part of the three fund portfolio the portfolio normally consists of depending on your tax bracket you may want to consider municipal bonds in your taxable instead of taxable bonds if your tax bracket is 25 or higher   another option is to forgo bonds altogether in the taxable account and just hold bonds in retirement accounts while keeping tax efficient domestic and international funds in your taxable account then adjust the bond portion upward in your retirement accounts to account for the additional stocks in your taxable accounts this will maintain the asset allocation that you 've already chosen that is appropriate for your age and goals

withdrawals from a traditional 401(k plan are always treated as cash income and the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates even if the money was held in stocks within the 401(k plan and the amount withdrawn is equal to whatever capital gains you made by selling the stock within the 401(k plan if your plan permits you to take the distribution as stock shares transferred to your taxable brokerage account then for tax purposes it is treated as if you took a distribution of cash equal to the market price of the shares as of the day of the distribution and promptly bought the same number of shares in your brokerage account   and yes if the 401(k plan assets in your ex employer 's plan consists solely of pretax contributions and the earnings then the entire distribution is ordinary taxable income regardless of whether you sold the stock within the 401(k plan or took a distribution of stock from the plan and promptly or after a few days sold it the capital gains or losses if any from such a sale are of course outside the 401(k plan and taxable accordingly finally the 10 penalty for premature withdrawal from a traditional 401(k will also apply if you are not 59.5 years of age or older or maybe 55 since you are separated from service and it will be computed on the entire distribution

what you may be looking for are multi manager etfs these invest in a basket of diversified funds to get the best out of all of the funds the problem with multi manager funds is of course that you pay fees twice once to the fund itself and once to each of the funds in the fund the low fees on etfs mean that it is not very profitable to actively maintain one so there are not many around googling returns very few noting that historic success does n't guarantee future success and that fees are being applied to fees these funds only really benefit from diversification of manager performance risk partial source of information and an example of a non outperforming multi manager etf

having worked in insurance i can give you a few pointers firstly state that you may have to complain insurers hate complaints because they really complicate matters are loads of work and must be tracked i would advise not actually escalating it to a complaint until later as this may cause a delay as the actual process is quite convoluted mentioning the possibility of complaint sometimes makes people a bit more active try and resolve the issue and if you are n't getting anywhere then make a complaint maintain a friendly polite if you get angry and aggressive you 'll not likely get far remember that the people on the end of the phone are both human and more knowledgeable about insurance than you you want them on your side not against you make notes if you can record calls if you are recording calls you will likely legally need to give them the option of not being recorded so make sure you mention that you 're recording each individual call as soon as you start speaking to the handler   refer to your notes and make sure you carry out actions you say you will if you spend a few days sending something you said you 'd email over that day and you then chase them a few days after that they may not have had the document through their workflow yet it also urgency if you 're acting promptly and suggests that you do n't really care if you 're taking your time   get names this is an important step as this gives the handler someone to talk to who may be familiar with your case you may end up speaking to the same people more than once so try and build a rapport if you do i like this guy may lead to a bit more effort being put in and a potentially better outcome in my experience can be a bit slow to respond to things so you 'll likely have to chase them up if you chase them up and say i called on x date discussing y with z and z said they would do a b and c. has this been done yet it looks better than saying i called about a week ago and spoke to one of your colleagues who said he 'd do something for me he 's not done it what 's going on as to a plan of action i would split this into two points mis sold policy and definition of commuting mis sold policy if they truly gave your wife two options then they messed up the standard 3 offered by are social domestic and pleasure and and business use other companies sometimes roll commuting into as standard on the comparison sites however there are usually the three separate options and if you used one to set the policy up and clicked only then you may be in trouble   social domestic and pleasure only does not include commuting whilst it is your responsibility to thoroughly check any documentation that comes through it could be argued that if given two options between business use and then a reasonable person could be considered to assume that definition of did include commuting therefore they need to prove to you that there were three options offered and that your wife specifically excluded commuting if they ca n't then you should be able to argue that only two were offered and that commuting could have reasonably been assumed to be included use that term reasonable person btw it 's used in a lot of internal literature at least at the insurer i worked at not commuting firstly clarify their definition of commuting if your wife was on her way to work afterwards then they may well consider she was commuting for instance at present i drive from my house to my son 's then to my wife 's work and finally to mine my commute could be argued to be 1 minute my workplace is probably a minutes drive from my wife 's but i ca n't park in her car park but if i were to have an accident between my house and my son 's ~15 mins drive the insurers would probably consider that commuting   if she was not on her way to work afterwards and assuming your wife arranged her visit via text or whatsapp fb messenger or similar you should easily be able to show that your wife had driven from a friends house to the if she was on a holiday day or was not working on that day then that 's also something you should be able to prove either with proof of her working pattern or proof of her holiday if she does n't have a job at all then again that 's something that 's provable proof reigns king in claims so if you can prove certain key facts then you should be on to a winner

when property changes hands the sale prices may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of the property and they may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of other properties because of the nature of the transaction you already have an existing business relationship the local government is likely to ignore the data point provided by your transaction when determining values of similar properties they have no idea if there was some other factor used to determine the price they will also not include in the calculation transactions that are a result of foreclosure becasue the target price is the loan value not the true value   california and some other jurisdictions do add another wrinkle you will need to determine if the transaction will trigger a of the property value in some states the existing laws of the state limited the annual growth of the assessment but that could now be recaptured if the jurisdiction rules that this is a new ownership california board of equalization change in ownership frequently asked questions how does a change in ownership affect property taxes each county assessor 's office reviews all recorded deeds for that    county to determine which properties require under the    law the county assessors may also discover changes in ownership    through other means such as taxpayer self reporting field    inspections review of building permits and newspapers once the    county assessor has determined that a change in ownership has    occurred proposition 13 requires the county assessor to reassess the    property to its current fair market value as of the date ownership    changed since property taxes are based on the assessed value of a property at    the time of acquisition a current market value that is higher than    the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base year value will    increase the property taxes conversely if the current market value    is lower than the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base    year value then the property taxes on that property will decrease only that portion of the property that changes ownership however is    subject to for example if 50 percent of the property is    transferred the assessor will reassess only 50 percent of the    property at its current fair market value as of the date of the    transfer and deduct 50 percent from any existing proposition 13 base    year value in most cases when a person buys a residence the entire    property a change in ownership and 100 percent of the    property is to its current market value

unfortunately not even if the credit card balance is positive i.e. customer has overpaid the credit card account you can not withdraw cash for free as any cash withdrawal is subject to interest even if repaid in full at the end of the month the clarity credit card is one of the best cards for overseas spending as its load free no fees for purchases abroad and it gives near perfect exchange rates if your balance is positive you start at £ 0 then fund that credit card account from your bank account £ 500 you can then spend on your credit card and when your next bill is due at the end of the month they will use that extra £ 500 sitting in your account first and ask for the remainder from you i.e.     scenario 2 it is better in my opinion to set up a direct debit to always clear out the full amount on your credit card that way you have cash in your bank account for emergencies getting £ 500 back from a credit card will take a few days to process as opposed to having the ability to withdraw cash from the 24/7 and once the direct debit is paid automatically at the end of the month there are no fees voila your credit card is almost like a debit card spend on it when you like it gets paid automatically no hassle no worries this approach does take a careful mindset though as you need to know your credit limits and also you need to ensure your bank account has enough to pay off the direct debit at the end of the month otherwise those darn fees will get you and hurt your credit rating for cash spending you will want to either take cash with you check online here for best rates get the money well in advance to avoid fees also in some countries the exchange rate is better there than in the uk google will help you here if you do nt like the idea of carrying large sums of cash with you can use a prepaid card like which is one of the better ones out there the other well known ones are fairfx and travelex cash passport

i do n't give companies that much credit i think they did n't realize the value of good customer service until they fucked it up and started loosing sales as a result just look at amazon they have had awesome customer service for years and that is what draws a lot of people to shop there

my interpretation of that sentence is that you ca n't do the buying selling of shares outright sans margin because of the massive quantity of shares he 's talking about   so you have to use margin to buy the stocks however because in order to make significant money with this sort of strategy you probably need to be working dozens of stocks at the same time you need to be familiar with portfolio margin   since your broker does not calculate margin calls based on individual stocks but rather on the value of your whole portfolio you should have experience handling margin not just on individual stock movements but also on overall portfolio movements for example if 10 by value of the stocks you 're targeting tend to have a correlation of with the price of oil you should probably target another 10 by value in stocks that tend to have a correlation of + 0.8 with the price of oil   and so on and so forth   that way your portfolio can weather big or even small changes in market conditions that would cause a margin call on a novice investor 's portfolio
