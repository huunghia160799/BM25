after doing some investigating my employers contract with the credit card company has a clause that basically specifies that despite my name being on the credit card and bills being sent to me all liability is on the company additionally the employer reserves the right to garnish wages in the event of a balance on the card so it looks like it wo n't affect my credit score i appreciate all of the advice

according to an article on bankrate.com from 2011 yes it can hurt your credit with individual liability accounts the employee holds all responsibility for the charges even if the company pays the issuer directly joint liability means the company and employee share the responsibility for payments says author of the survey in both cases if the card is n't paid and the account becomes delinquent it will pop up on the employee 's credit report and dent his or her credit score says barry consumer affairs manager at it does n't matter if the company was supposed to make the payment the repercussions fall on the employee it will impact your score no differently than if you were late on one of your own accounts says usually with corporate credit cards the employee is liable along with the employer for charges on the card   the intent is to provide the employee with an incentive not to misuse the card   however this can be a problem if your company is late in paying bills in the distant past i had a corporate credit card   i was not supposed to have to pay the bill but i did receive a bill in the mail every month   and occasionally the payment was late   in my case these late payments never showed up on my credit report   i ca n't remember now whether or not this card was reported on my credit report at all   and i remember being told when i got the card that i was jointly responsible for the card with the company however your experience may be different   do the on time payments show up on your credit report   if so that may be an indication that a late payment might appear

the interest rate offered by a bond is called the nominal interest rate   the so called real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation if inflation is equal to or greater than the nominal rate at any given time the real interest rate is zero or negative we 're talking about a ten year bond it 's possible for the real interest rate to be negative for one or two years of the bond 's life and positive for eight or nine   on the other hand if we have a period of rising inflation as in the 1970s the inflation rate will exceed the original interest rate in most years meaning that the real interest rate on the ten year bond will be negative over its whole life people lost serious money on bonds and loans in the 1970s in such situations the borrowers make out that is they borrow money at low rates earn inflation plus a little more pay back inflated dollars and pocket the difference for them the money is free

the previous answers have raised very good points but i believe one facet of this has been neglected while it 's true that the total accessible supply of gold keeps rather slowly as was mentioned earlier the fact remains that gold like oil is a non renewable natural resource so at some point we are going to run out of gold to mine due to this fact i believe gold will always be highly valued of course it can certainly always fluctuate in value in fact i expect in the reasonably near future to see a decline in the price of gold due to investors selling it en masse to re enter the stock market when the economy has recovered more substantially

there are many technical answers above but the short story to me is that very few active fund managers consistently beat the market look at the results of actively managed funds depending on whose analysis you read you will find out that somewhere between 80 90 of fund managers in a given year do not beat passive index funds so go figure how you will do compared to a mutual fund manager who has way more experience than you likely have so that in itself is moderately interesting but if you look at same manager performance over several consecutive years it is rare to find anyone that goes beats the market for more than a few years in a row there are exceptions but go pick one of these guys good luck getting in and out of the market is a loser this is because there is no way to see market spikes and down turns there are many behavioral studies that have been done that show people do the wrong thing they sell after losses have occurred and they buy after the market has gone up missing an up spike and not being in before the spike is as devastating as missing a down turn and not getting out in time there is another down side if you are trading in a personal account rather than a tax deferred account going in and out of stocks has tax complications in short a broad based equity index will over time beat about anything out there and it will do it in a tax efficient manner   exchange traded funds etfs are a wonderful way to obtain diversification immediately at very low cost

the whole concept of spending a fraudulent check is misleading both in practice and legally there are two separate transactions you not receiving funds by depositing a fraudulent check and you sending a cash transfer further on regarding the fraudulent check generally your bank is responsible in the sense that it 's their responsibility to recover the money from you it will not receive any money from the bank that supposedly issued the fake check and if they give it to you you spend all that money and are unable to pay it back that 's their problem and not of the other institutions regarding the cash transfer from the bank point of view it 's solely your responsibility it was really you who made that payment you explicitly authorised instructed the banks to deliver money to the recipient and none of those banks have the duty to return it you have been defrauded by the recipient of this payment and may attempt to recover the money from the fraudster but that 's not particularly likely to happen even in the case of a successful arrest and conviction   very fast reaction with involvement of police may block the vendor 's account before they are able to withdraw the money if that is the case you might be able to recover your money or part of it

best strategy that has worked for me is to remember first of all that you hardly ever need anything right now try this if you see something you want to buy leave it for at least two weeks better yet a month if after that time you have hardly thought about it then you almost certainly do n't need it but if you 've thought quite a lot about owning it and how it will be beneficial then perhaps it 's worth picking up you will probably find that a small percentage of things you 'd like to buy make it through that screening period

any deductable expense will reduce your taxable income not your tax payable your example 1 above is correct and gives you 100 deduction it is like having a business where your sales are $ 100,000 and your expenses in making the sales is $ 40,000 the expenses are your tax deductions and reduce your profits on which you pay tax on to $ 60,000 if your example 2 was correct then the situation above would change that you would pay say $ 30,000 tax on $ 100,000 sales then apply your deductions or expenses of $ 40,000 so that you would pay no tax at all and in fact get $ 10,000 back in your return in this case the government would not be collecting any taxes but paying out returns to everyone your example 2 is incorrect

i did read the article i 'm very surprised that such a simple and alternative idea was poorly received but i have a feeling it 's because you did n't read my response carefully enough the 3 5 years which you took to mean the training time was presented as the commitment in return for free training which i expected would take around 6 12 months the candidates suggested would already have master 's degrees in other fields and so it 's to be expected they 'll need around 30 60 hours to train them to an academic level full time this should only take a year    an h1-b visa takes around 6 months to process and when you factor in the amount of time it takes someone to actually move from a foreign country it can easily be faster to train than transport in any case you could do both while you transition to a training process   here 's an article on the processes that i am discussing where peter is interviewed by the wharton business school the gist of it is that because companies control every aspect of the hiring and job creation process it is a large part of the fault on their shoulders when they ca n't find the right person      thanks for playing

the legalization of marijuana has led to higher wages for unskilled workers people who would normally work in fast food or the restaurant industry is a good example of this instead of taking a minimum wage job these marijuana companies are offering higher wages to work for them these jobs tend to be a less stressful and pay more than working in a restaurant so more and more unskilled workers are going into this field   in fact this has created a shortage of jobs in the restaurant industry colorado literally can not find enough people to work in their restaurants   i 've worked in the coal industry for 3 years but i ca n't comment on the coal situation since i 've been out of that market for a while all i can say is nuclear is our future

banks do of course incur costs on currency transactions but they 're not as high as the fee charged to the customer most banks in most places lose a lot of money on operating bank accounts for customers and make the money back by charging more than their costs for services like currency exchange if you do n't choose to pay those fees use an online service instead but bear in mind that if everyone does so then banks will be forced to charge higher fees for current accounts

there are 2 different things as per it act one can get medical reimbursement upto rs 15,000 which is tax free the way it is supposed to work is an employee submits bill and employer will reimburse upto rs 15,000 so if one does not submit any bills he does not get any money if the employer has given the employee rs 15,000 without any bills it would have been taxed as per the tax bracket in practise all employer factor the rs 15,000 in the salary to the employee if bills are submitted then its tax free if bill are not submitted partially submitted the difference is paid as allowance and hence becomes taxable apart from above there is section that provides additional rebate upto rs 15,000 when health insurance is taken upto rs 5,000 for health checkup hence if you submit the details to your employer you will get rebate in tax on rs 5,000 it would be rs you would not get reimbursement i should mention 20,000 under medical expenses nope both are under different section as such you should declare these separately

there are a few potential downsides but they are minor if you forget to make the payment the interest hit the following month could be significant with many cards the new charges will be charged interest from the start if the previous payment was late missed just make sure you do n't forget to pay the entire bill if the $ 5 k in monthly bills is a large portion of the credit limit for that credit card you could run into a problem with the grace period during the three weeks between when the monthly bill closes and the payment is due new charges will keep rolling in plan on needing a credit limit for the card of 2x the monthly bills of course you do n't have to wait for the due date just go online and pay the bill early if the monthly bills are a significant portion of the total credit limit for all credit cards it can decrease your credit score because of the high utilization rate   the good news is that over time the credit card company will increase your credit limit thus reducing the downsides of the last two items also keep in mind you generally ca n't pay a credit card bill or loan with a credit card but many of the other bills each month can be handled this way

i 'm not familiar with the model i 'll have to take a look at it sounds cool though   i think that all arbitrage free models are incomplete in the sense that they do n't say this is a price that does n't imply any arbitrage opportunities anywhere but instead say this is a price that does n't imply any arbitrage opportunities within a specific set of securities   what set you 're using will vary from one model to another and i 'd say although other people might reasonably disagree that taking a volatility structure as given is as much no arbitrage as taking a term structure as given   as a side note i 'd say that what theoretically distinguishes an equilibrium model is that you 're supposed to know the parameters not guess at them or observe them from the real world   by that definition a really complete capm or black scholes would explain how to derive the correct beta or volatility from fundamental analysis   also i 've upvoted you elsewhere for some really good comments you made about intrinsic value

it helps to put the numbers in terms of an asset say a bottle of wine costs 10 dollars but the price rises to 20 dollars a year later the price has risen 100 and your dollars have lost value whereas your ten used to be worth 100 of the price of bottle of wine they now are worth 50 of the risen price of a bottle of wine so they 've lost around 50 of their value divide the old price by the new inflated price to measure proportionally how much the old price is of the new price 10 divided by 20 is 1/2 or .50 or 50 you can then subtract the old price from the new in proportional terms to find how much value you 've lost 1 minus 1/2 or 1.00 minus .50 or 100 minus 50

the details of credit score calculation tend to change periodically but the fundamentals are mostly consistent   pay your bills keep your average account age high overpay your credit card minimums and keep your overall debt low   and do soft pulls on your credit report to see what 's happening first the simplest route pay all your bills early or on time   automatic deduction may be useful in this regard especially for bills with predictable amounts   a corollary to this tip is to never leave an unpaid bill   what often happens to young people is in the course of moving around they leave the final bill unpaid and it gets reported to collections   make sure you follow up online with all bills even after canceling the service second average account age and oldest account age matter   open an account like a credit card and never close it so you 'll have an older account hopefully a zero fee card   try to keep other accounts open rather than closing them no need to cancel a zero fee credit card so your average account age stays higher   a card that works on internal systems like a gift card is not going to show up on a credit report a card that works like any visa mc is likely going to show up   the rule of thumb is if they need your ssn to run a credit check for the application then the card will appear on a credit report   you can pull your credit report to find out if the card is listed you may have to allow time for lag before the card appears but i 'm not sure how long that might be    third a tip for extra credit score is to pay more than the minimum required on credit card bills   you can achieve this by either using your credit card at least once a month or by leaving a small hanging balance each month so there 's always something to overpay next month   credit card reporting will be either unpaid underpaid minimum paid or overpaid   minimum payment helps your score and overpayment helps more   if you can use your credit card every month that will give you something to overpay every month   otherwise you can leave a small debt left on the card but still pay over the monthly minimum   however your total debt load especially debt carried on your cards counts against your score aim for less than 10 of your limit finally of course is to pull your credit report periodically   you need to know what others are seeing   since debt load utilization matters make sure the reported card maximum is correct on your credit report   talk to your bank or account issuer if the limit is wrong   if a collection appears then you need to handle it   often you can negotiate with the collector but be careful to negotiate how they will report the resolution   you want them to agree to remove any negative information either in exchange for payment or because of a mistake   failing that you want them to mark it paid in full or satisfied in full letting them your score that you only partially paid is what you want to avoid since it most signals someone with cash flow problems and credit issues   they control their reporting to credit bureaus so if the person on the phone ask to speak to their supervisor or someone with negotiating authority   try to get any agreements in writing remember that your total debt load is a factor in your credit score   home loans and student loans do affect credit score   if you take on a smaller home loan then it will affect your credit less harshly and leave you with smaller monthly payments

i have no idea where you are getting your years from   millennials are typically defined as being born between 1980 and 1996   gen x ends around 1979 and the not yet generation z perhaps suggested by some starts around 1997   of course there is n't full agreement on the start year as you even quoted but it 's typically early 1980s i 've seen 1979 1982 your given start year of 1993 makes no sense   the end year is more up for debate 1996 is very common but i 've seen as early as 1995 and as late as 2000 depending on who you talk to   one common definition of millennials is people who are too young to be gen x but old enough to remember the september 11 attacks   the 18 to 34 range that you quoted was probably written a couple years ago or at least from the mindset of a couple years ago when that would have been accurate   and quoting wiki millennials not that it is a definitive source   gt researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the to early 2000s as ending birth years

generally if you watch for the detail in the fine print and stay away from non fdic insured investments there is little difference so yes pick the highest you can get the offered interest rate is influenced by what the banks are trying to accomplish and how their current and desired customer base thinks some banks have customer bases with very conservative behavior which will stick with them because they trust them no matter what so a low interest rate is good enough the disadvantage for the bank is that such customers prefer brick and mortar contact which is expensive for the bank or maybe the bank has already more cash than they need and has no good way to invest it other banks might need more cash flow to be able to get stronger in the mortgage market and their way of getting that is to offer higher interest rates so new customers come and invest new money which the bank in turn can then mortgage out they also may offer higher rates for online handling only overall there are many different ways to make money as a bank and they diversify into different niches with other focuses and that comes with offering quite different interest rates

from 26 cfr if a taxpayer sells or transfers shares of stock in a corporation that the taxpayer purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot the taxpayer purchased or acquired to determine the basis and holding period of the stock from 26 cfr i where the stock is left in the custody of a broker or other agent an adequate identification is made    a at the time of the sale or transfer the taxpayer specifies to such broker or other agent having custody of the stock the particular stock to be sold or transferred and so if you do n't specify the first share bought for $ 100 is the one sold and you have a capital gain of $ 800 but you can specify to the broker if you would rather sell the stock bought later and thus have a lower gain this can either be done for the individual sale no later than the settlement date of the trade or via standing order 26 cfr a standing order or instruction for the specific identification of stock is treated as an adequate identification made at the time of sale transfer delivery or distribution

disputing the remark seems unlikely to move your score since it is just that a remark   it 's hard to say whether the scoring models can do read the remarks and incorporate them somehow into the scoring metric itself disputing the revolving account that should be reported as closed is a different matter   the question there would be what the status of that account is was   in other words is it showing as an open collection or some other status which would indicate the creditor still has a pending claim   if so disputing it might have some effect although nobody would be able to tell you for certain or even how much your score might be affected if as you say that account should have been part of the bankruptcy package then getting that corrected could be important enough to achieve what you 're looking for   you can try it and see but even if the effect is minor you still want your credit report to be a true reflection of the facts i hope this helps good luck

there is no general theory to support the notion that larger companies will be more profitable than smaller companies   economies of scale are not always positive one can have of scale too    it is more common to talk about an optimal firm size even going back to 's the economies of scale   intuitively if economies of scale extended indefinitely then natural monopolies would dominate all industries in the long run a profit ratio unfortunately would n't quite get at scale economies   consider for example that the denominator of your metric would be and that you are trying to get at the cost reduction that derives from scale   then you are measuring the size of a company by the exact metric that should be reduced if scale economies exist so the calculation would be a bit it is my understanding that such assessments are usually conducted at the industry level by determining whether the industry is becoming increasingly concentrated among fewer firms over time again see    if concentration is increasing there is an implication that at current firm sizes there are economies of scale in the industry

you can claim a deduction only if all of your business is conducted from the home i.e. your home is your principal place of business not just if you work from home sometimes the cra canada revenue agency has pretty strict guidelines listed here but once you 're sure you qualify for a deduction the next step would be to determine what portion of your home qualifies    you can not attempt to deduct your entire mortgage simply because you run your business out of your home   the portion of your mortgage and other related allowable home expense deductions has to be pro rated to be equal to or less than the portion of your home you use for business   simply put if your business is operated out of a 120 sq ft self contained space and your home 's total square footage is 2400 sq ft you can deduct 5 of your expenses = 0.05 hope this helps

in the us section of the uniform commercial code sets the rules for how any confusion in checks or other business transactions is handled if an instrument contains contradictory terms terms prevail over printed terms handwritten terms prevail over both and words prevail over numbers   if there was any ambiguity in the way you wrote out the amount the institution will compare the two fields the written words and the courtesy box digits to see if the ambiguity can be resolved   the reality is that the busy tellers and atm operators typically are going to look at the numeric digits first so even if they happen to notice the traditional and missing it seems highly unlikely that such an would cause enough ambiguity between these the two fields to reject the payment common sense dictates here i would n't worry about it

it depends on what you paid for but usually audit support is an unrelated engagement to the return preparation if the accountant made a professional mistake you can request correction and compensation from that accountant other than that any accountant can help you with audit regardless of who prepared the return the original accountant would probably be better informed about why you reported each number on the return and how it was calculated but if you kept all the docs it can be recalculated again that 's what happens in the audit anyway

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

if the check is written as a check to bigco it is less clear how jack can compensate himself for the equity sale it is as if the equity was owned by the corporation not by jack this is correct   if the check is written to bigco then it is bigco issuing new shares   jack does n't compensate himself for the equity sale as he did n't sell anything   the company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion   in the long term the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $ 200,000 no interest loan to the company    if the value of the company before investing $ 250,000 is $ 1 million then the value after investing is $ 1.25 million   so $ 250,000 is 20 of the value of the company   bigco should not give the buyer 25 of bigco but only 20 in that example   if it does give 25 the buyer is getting a $ stake for only $ 250,000    with the other example jack sells 25 of the company for $ 250,000 from his personal shares   this does n't change the assessed value of the company just jack 's stake   jack then loans the company $ 200,000   this also does n't change the assessed value of the company at least in theory   it gains $ 200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $ 200,000   in net that 's no change   assets and liabilities balance the same    so if you know that the assessed value of the company is $ 1 million and that the buyer is paying $ 250,000 for a 25 stake at that same valuation then you know that the check is being written to jack   if the check is written to bigco then one or more of those numbers is incorrect    the buyer could be getting a 20 stake   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1.25 million    or paying $   the new value of the company after the investment is $    or bigco could only be worth $ 750,000 before the investment   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1 million    or jack is getting screwed selling $ in stock 25 for only $ 250,000   jack 's shares drop from being worth $ 1 million to only $   the value of the company is $ 1.25 million    or some combination of smaller changes that balances

is it any different than if i decide to put similar amount of money in 401(k at some other time of the year   not from a tax standpoint but if can affect a few other things since the earnings difference is likely negligible you miss out on returns for only a few months i would look at other conditions   in the long run it probably wo n't make much difference but knocking out obstacles to wealth building can give you a sense of accomplishment that will encourage smart money decisions going forward

in the us there are a few different schemes namely regulated and unregulated in regulated states e.g. colorado everything except for some of the generators are owned by one company called a vertically integrated utility and that company is allowed a specific return on its investment rates being set by a formula that includes the utility 's fixed costs the variable amp fuel costs and this return in unregulated markets like texas the generators transmission system load serving entities aka distributors and retailers are all separate although sometimes the same company owns parts at various levels the transmission and load serving entities function like the traditional utilities i described above but can choose their own retailer and the retailers then buy energy from the generators    here is a good video about how the us energy market works   to answer the question i think the answer is actually that in most cases the wires costs for us customers is lower due to the higher density and of the various power systems in the us in the the primary energy market in australia there are significant distances between loads and the larger generators and there are overall fewer customers per mile of line other than that the system both and from a market design standpoint is generally based on the us system specifically   the other big difference is that australia does not have a single grid like the us does us has 3 but is one big grid

a trader will make a blatant mistake a customer calls to buy 100 shares at $ 10 and the trader by mistake enters 10 shares at $ 100 you get one very happy seller in the usa it does n't happen often for sales because if the trader offers to sell 10 shares at $ 100 there will be nobody accepting the other   in japan with one dollar equal to 120 yen the same mistake would mean that someone wanted to sell 100 shares at 1200 yen and the trader enters 1200 shares for 100 yen then you will get a happy buyer and a massive loss

through the comments here it seems that almost every one has missed the point that the tesla 3 is a performance car in addition to being electric   sure it 's not as fast as the 's but at 0 60 in 5.6 seconds that equals the ford mustang     in addition to that it also has fabulous handling   the motor trend cars tesla tesla drive called it the best small sedan he had ever driven   so to those about displays and electricity costs per mile and colored paint costs $ 1000 more this is kind of like looking at a porsche and complaining about the back seat and the trunk space   all true but also almost entirely irrelevant

you could talk to them but assuming you 're in the u.s. it 's highly doubtful any bank would honor a check from 26 years ago   most checks in the u.s. are only valid for 180 days mainly to help companies and banks keep accounting simple i would suggest talking to your late husband 's former employer   explain the situation and ask if they 'd be willing to research it and perhaps honor his memory and contribution to their company by issuing a new check   they might do it as a gesture of good will are they legally bound to do this   to my knowledge the answer is no   the check was issued and never cashed which is not all that unusual for companies in business for a long time   a good example of this would be rebate checks which you 'd be surprised quite frequently end up in a drawer and forgotten about   there has to be some closure for the issuing company in its accounting else they 'd have money in their bank accounts that does n't properly show in their ledgers this is an interesting question though   i hope others will reply and perhaps they have a more informed take than me   i 'm going to upvote it simply because i 'd like to see this discussion continue good luck

you could use paypal to transfer money you can pay with paypal and your uk contact could transfer the money to his bank account through paypal i just received money this way from the us and paid 9 eur for this receiving the funds is as quickly as clicking a button on the paypal site transfering it without costs took 1 3 days it is by far the easiest way if you are uncomfortable using paypal the other option would be through your own bank account where you would transfer using iban swift the swift bank account is usually the iban code plus a branch code often it is difficult to find the branch code in that case you can use the in the latter things might be delayed but i actually have n't noticed the delay yet since international transfer always seem to take between 1 and 10 days the international transfering of money costs except if it is within the eu region the way to transfer money through internet banking differs from bank to bank they keywords you need to look for are sepa swift iban or international transfer

i 'm mostly guessing based on existing documentation and have no direct experience so take this with a pinch of salt my best understanding is that you need to file form 843 the instructions for the form say that it can be used to request a refund or of a penalty or addition to tax due to     reasonable cause or other reason other than erroneous written     advice provided by the irs allowed under the law the reasonable cause here is a good faith confusion about what line 79 of the form was referring to in form 843 the irc section code you should enter is estimated tax for more see the irc section note however that if you already received a notice from the irs you should cross check that this section code is listed on the notice under the part that covers the estimated tax penalty if your request is accepted the irs should issue you notice item 17 penalty removed you can get more general information about the tax collection process and how to challenge it from the pages linked from understanding your notice

the idea is great but us securities laws impose a huge burden on these businesses   specifically rule of reg d prohibits general solicitation and advertising such as using the internet   there is currently pending legislation to amend the us securities act of 1933 sec regarding public offerings to help reduce such barriers but as it stands there are significant barriers to entry in the market   sec filing and reporting requirements especially after dodd frank are onerous to say the least and running direct lending services are at the moment largely cost prohibitive due to these requirements

until you read about someone mentioning one of the main reasons main street took those losses was because of the municipalities state and federal pensions invested into those cdss    credit default swaps were the insurance scams that 's different   municipalities purchased cdos and not   someone correct me if i am wrong   the cds 's were also a problem but of a different sort   cds allowed people to take out insurance on a competing product   imagine me taking out a fire insurance on your house   things like that   cdo = debt obligation this is the paper which represents hundreds of mortgage slices mixed and matched by some bullshit software algorithm that promised to predict risk accurately   cds = credit default swap this is an insurance paper which is not regulated like all the other normal and legitimate insurance that insures the cdo garbage above so if your or even your competitor 's cdo goes into the shitter you can collect on your cds bullshit so the cds was supposed to be a hedge against the cdo failure

i 'm curious so i 'm going to calculate it for my area i 'm in an average priced metro and a 2 bedroom apartment out here is going to cost you at least $ 1400 700 each with a and that 's if you go minutes from downtown it does n't really drop off any more than that the further you go out you 'll also still need renters insurance and to cover half the utilities lets tack on another $ 75 here conservatively at that far out you need a car and the insurance gas and maintenance costs that go with it assuming you go with something cheap say $ 5k with a payment around $ 120 a month + $ 60 a month for insurance another $ 60 for gas and accruing $ 30 a month for maintenance you 're going to need a cell phone and if you 're on a plan alone it 's not cheap with the big 4 providers so you 'll go with someone smaller for $ 50 a month even though the service is mediocre you 'll need to eat so being cheap and buying store brands and sale items you get your groceries down to $ 120 a month so that should cover the bottom level of 's pyramid which is far from glamorous that puts your living costs at $ a month being that it is a major metro minimum wage within the city is $ assuming you have a job that 's 40 hours a week that puts you at $ a month before taxes are withheld since you make so little taxes would only be around $ a month that leaves $ 49 for saving spending emergencies i live in a state that has very good support for the aca as well so the $ 300 credit roughly covers the cost of the monthly premium the deductible is obviously still impossible to pay but you do n't get hit with the penalty at year end and the hospital still gets mostly paid and you might just be able to avoid bankruptcy if the hospital is willing to negotiate the payment plan with you   so what are the conclusions here it 's possible to skate by for a short while assuming you can live without any social life stay healthy and have no emergencies   you also need the self discipline of a monk and to live in an area that supports a minimum wage relative to living costs and the aca

it 's a tough question because there is society and individual to consider and the society 's effects on the individual   currently employers do n't have to provide insurance they do it to compete in the employee marketplace employers have an advantage over employees in that regard because they can procure insurance at a lower cost that employees can and they get tax breaks for doing so employers providing health insurance get a more stable relationship with their employees because employees always hold great value in having an employee who provides good benefits   the company i work for provides good benefits but suppose tomorrow they told me hey we 're not providing benefits anymore but we 'll bump your salary to what your benefits are worth plus enough to compensate for the tax break we get so now everything is equal to what it was before but i have to go out and find my own insurance which is a hassle but presumably because of the ppaca i can get a good value and carry this insurance with me wherever i go and never have to mess with changing every time i change jobs   but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up and they 've essentially pocketed the difference or passed it on to their customers now people have less money to buy health insurance and those near the bottom will now have to rely on the government to assist with providing health insurance   this is the way it works now with the minimum wage a recent report found that walmart employees rely on welfare to the tune of $ billion a fuels inequality epidemic taking advantage of our safety net while the company makes $ 15 billion in profit so 18 of walmart 's profits are an indirect subsidy from the us taxpayer which comes to about $ 48 per us citizen or about $ a year for the top 50 of wage earners   even so i think i 'd prefer to get my whole compensation package in one shot all else being equal that last part is important though i would need to get all the breaks my employer gets for providing myself with health insurance

other than the exchange risk one more thing to consider is interest rate risk and the returns you are generating from your money if it is lying around in a current account with no interest then it is rational to keep it where you intend to or aus now if your money is working for you earning interest or has been invested in the market then it seems reasonable that you should put it where it earns the maximum for you but that comes with a rider the exchange risk you may have to bear if you are converting between the currencies do the returns earned by your money cancel out the fx rates moving up and down and still leave you with a positive return compared with what you would earn if your money was where you stayed consider the below scenarios do evaluate all your options before you transfer your money

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

i find this very hard to believe believe it   the bottom quarter of american households have negative net worth and the bottom three quarters have no more than a tiny amount saved up in an emergency 63 of americans would not be able to come up with $ 500 without going into debt   nobody can retire with 5k in the u.s. the money will be gone within a year is it possible now you begin to see why the long term stability of social security and medicare are at present hot topics in american political life without them a great many more americans would die in poverty what is the actual figure the $ 5000 figure is accurate but irrelevant that median includes people who are thirty years from retirement and people who are two days from retirement the more relevant statistics are those restricted to people at or close to retirement age and they can be found lower down in the article you cite or in numerous other studies here 's one from the gao for example the figures here are unfortunately no less terrifying now $ 104 k is a lot better than $ 5 k but it 's still not much to retire on why we believe that it is reasonable to throw out all the zeros before taking the median i do not know that seems like bad math to me update there is some discussion of this point in the comments all i 'm saying here is that this is a and possibly misleading way to characterize the situation the linked report has the actual data but let 's try to summarize it here in a more meaningful way let 's suppose that we make buckets for how dependent on ss is a retirement age household to avoid starving to death being homeless and so on maybe these buckets are not ideal and we could move them around a bit   the takeaways here are that the ratios of nothing inadequate barely adequate comfortable is about that only the top of retirement age households can fund a comfortable retirement without help illustrates just how dependent on ss american households are how do 50 of old americans survive in their old age   social security and medicare   as the cited gao report indicates social security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older do most old americans rely on their children for financial support one day i met a woman at a party and we were making small talk about her kids she had a couple already and one more was on the way   i want to have lots of children to support me in my old age she said   do you support your parents i asked which frankly seemed like an entirely reasonable question   of course not i ca n't afford it i 've got a baby on the way and two more kids at home i left her to draw her own conclusions as to the viability of her retirement plan

it can be zero or negative given the current market conditions any money parked with treasury bonds is 100 risk free so if i have a large amount of usd and need a safe place to keep then in today 's environment even the banks large as well are at risk so if i park my money with some large bank and that bank goes bankrupt my money is gone for good after a long drawn bankruptcy procedure i may get back all of it or some of it even if the bank does not go bankrupt it may face liquidity crises and i may not be able to withdraw when i want   hence it 's safer to keep it in treasury bonds even though i may not gain any interest or even lose a small amount of money at least it will be very safe    today there are very few options for large investors typically governments and institutional investors the euro is facing uncertainty the yuan is still regulated there is not enough gold to buy or to store it hence this leads towards the usd   the very fact that usd is safe in today 's environment is reflected in the treasury rates

equate to the same thing how will this enforcement agency get paid are they going to sell tickets are they going to make a product or service outside of enforcement probably not otherwise they are going to gain a reputation for having a conflict of interest and always have the suspicion of corruption hanging over them so then we are back to some form of tax on the market in order to pay for

and that is why it failed and that is why they are now raising taxes to pay for gaping deficits    okay so lets say you are correct about kansas lets do some apples to apples comparisons most people say okay lets compare texas and california our two biggest gdp states i am fine with that even though their gdp comes from very different sources ca is a technology state while tx is an oil state they both have a little bit of farming on top of that ca has one of the highest and strictest tax policies of any state in the union tx is known for being a business friendly state and a tax although they surely do n't have a zero tax policy not having an income tax is nice while they have one of the highest real estate taxes of any state    ca currently has a gdp growth rate of california brown are jobs california growing hell lot faster and has a job growth rate that exceeds the national average tx is has fallen below the national average on both aspects mostly because of the oversupply of oil on the global market and of course tx was one of the top states while oil was up but still was ca the point being is that their very different tax policies did not make or break their positions and many would argue that tax policy can help gdp when it builds stability and infrastructure while states like ks seem to show the opposite to be true    lets do another comparison and see if we can get even more apples to apples lets find a couple of states the sit right next to each other have very similar economies and demographics but very different views on taxes and infrastructure how about wi and mn ks and mi nh and me and or and id    conservative with very lenient tax policy an emphasis on freedom and reduced government wi ks me and id liberal states with emphasis on infrastructure and social services mn nh or mi    in all of the above examples the liberal states exceeded the conservative states in job growth and gdp growth this does n't mean the liberal state exceeded the national average in the ks mi and mn wi examples both states lagged the national average however in both examples the liberal state better    people could argue it is in spite of the increased taxes or they could try to find minute differences in the economies those states are pretty close and yet the liberal states exceeded the conservative states    this can be seen on a global scale as well it is

the debt on credit cards is pretty high its in the range of 30 40 apr there could also be a case very high personal loan for medical or other personal emergencies at a rate in excess of 15 the debt consolidation would offer this at a very low apr there are institutions that offer debt consolidation services that would consolidate all your debt into a single loan at a lower rate of interest they would also negotiate with all your lenders to waive charges and accrued interests to the max extent the benefit to the institution offering this service is that they have a larger loan on books and hence the servicing cost is less most of the time the debt consolidation is offered with some asset as the guarantee for the new loan by doing this the advantages are of course if you are looking for the balance transfer on cards to new one then its same and in fact may at times be more expensive

if this is your friend and he that convinced he will get rich from this then there 's really nothing you can do   you 've obviously done your best to explain the situation to him but he 's been caught up in their sales pitch and that 's more convincing to him i worked in sales for many years and the answers he gives you the one about not needing to know the details of how your smartphone works is a classic variation of typical objection handling that salespeople are taught proves that he has been sucked in by their scheme at this stage all you 're going to do is ruin your friendship with him if you continue to press the matter because he has made it clear he ca n't be convinced that this is anything other than legitimate   the reality is he is probably in too deep at this stage to just walk away from it so he has to convince himself that he made a wise choice schemes like this use a scarcity approach there 's only so much to go around and if you do n't get yours now then someone else will get it coupled with ego boosting boy mr. prospect this is such a great opportunity and you 're one of only a few who are sophisticated enough to understand and take advantage of it to get people to lower their guard and not ask a whole lot of probing questions nobody wants to feel stupid and they do n't want others to think they 're stupid so these schemes will present the information in such a way that ordinarily prudent questions come across as sounding dumb making the questioner seem not so smart   rather than walking away from it peoples pride will sometimes make them double down on it and they 'll just go along with it to come across as though they get it even when they really do n't the small payouts at early stages are a classic sign of a ponzi scheme   your friend will never listen to you as long as those little checks continue to come in because to him they 're absolute proof he 's right and you 're wrong   it 's those checks or payouts however they 're doing it that will make him step up his efforts to recruit other people into the scheme or worse yet invest more of his own money into this keep in mind that in the end you really have no power to do anything in this situation other than be his friend and try to use gentle persuasion   he 's already made it clear that he is n't going to listen to your explanations about why this is a scam for a couple reasons   first and probably greatest it would be an admission that he 's dumb or at least not as smart as you and who wants that   second he continues to get little checks that reinforce the fact this must be real or why else would he be getting this money   third he has already demonstrated his commitment to this by quitting his job so from his point of view this has become an all or nothing ticket to wealth    the bottom line is these schemes work because the sales pitch is powerful enough to overcome ordinary logic for people who think there just has to be an easy way to easy street all you can do is just be there as his friend and hope that he sees the light before the damage to himself and anyone else gets too great   you ca n't stop him from what he 's doing any more than you can stop the sun from rising as long the message and checks he 's getting from other people keep him convinced he 's on the right path edit after reading the comments posted in this thread i do want to amend my statements because many good points have been raised here   you obviously ca n't just sit by and do nothing while your friend talks others into taking the same or worse risks that he is   that 's not morally right by any measure at the same time however be very careful about how you go about this   your friend as you stated sounds pretty much like he 's all in with this scheme so there 's definitely going to be some serious emotional commitment to it on his part as well   anyone and everything that threatens what he sees as his ticket to easy street could easily become a target when this all comes crashing down as it inevitably will   you could very well be the cause of that in his eyes especially if he knows you 've been discouraging people from buying into this nightmare people are not rational creatures when it comes to money losses   it 's called costs where they 'll continue to chase their losses on the rationale they 'll make up for it if they just do n't give up   the more your friend committed to this the worse his about losing so he 'll do whatever he has to in order to save his position   this is what gamblers do and why the house does so well for itself some have suggested making anonymous flyers or other means of communicating that do n't expose you as the person spreading the message and that 's one suggestion   however the problem with this is that since the receiver has no idea who sent the message they 're not likely to give it the kind of credibility or notice that they would to something passed to them by a person they know and trust and your anonymous message will have little weight in the face of the persuasive pitch that got your friend to commit his own money and future another problem as you 've noted is that you do n't travel in the same circles as the people he 's likely to recruit so how would you go about warning them   how would they view their first contact with you when it comes with a message not to trust what someone else they already know is about to tell them   would they write it off as someone who 's   hard to tell another huge ploy of these schemes is that they tend to preemptively strike at what you propose doing that is warning people to stay away   they do this by projecting the people giving the warnings as losers who did n't see the opportunity for themselves and now want to keep others away from their own financial success   they 'll portray you as someone who is n't smart enough to see this huge opportunity and since you ca n't understand it you do n't think anyone else does either   they 'll point out that if you were so good with finances why are n't you already successful these guys are very good and they have an answer for every objection you can raise whether its to them or to someone else   they 've spent a long time honing their message which makes it difficult for anyone to say something persuasive enough to sway others away from being duped   this is a hard path no doubt i hope you are able to warn others away   just be aware that it may come at a cost to you as well and be prepared for what that might be i hope this helps good luck

to supplement ben 's answer following smart money utilizes information available in a transparent marketplace to track the holdings of professionals   one way may be to learn as much as possible about fund directors and monitor the firms holdings closely via prospectus i believe certain exchanges provide transaction data by brokers so it may be possible for a well informed individual to monitor changes in a firms holdings in between prospectus updates   an example of a play on smart money   s&p500 companies are reviewed for weighting and the list changes when companies are dropped or added as you know there are etfs and funds that reflect the holdings of the sp500   changes to the list trigger   binary events where funds open or close a position some people try to anticipate the movements of the sp500 before smart money adjusts their positions i have heard some people define smart money as people who get paid whether their decisions are right or wrong which in my opinion best captures the term this course may be of interest

i love giving non answer answers   it will depend on you   suppose you are embarrassed by driving older cars your significant other does n't like having you drive an older car you do n't really maintain the car well it develops a variety of problems acquires a few dents and you really worry about reliability   then the value of the car will probably drop rather quickly below the blue book value and you should sell it on the other hand if you do n't care how the car looks it runs pretty well fewer repairs than you would expect you maintain it yourself aka cheaply and do a good job at that and have plenty of friends who owe you a favor and will give you a ride if your car wo n't start there will probably never be a time that the value to you drops below the official blue book value what others will pay so you would drive it until the engine drops out of the   the blue book value represents some kind of rough consensus about what a car of that age and exterior condition is worth to the typical person it will be the discrepancy between the typical person and you that determines whether you 'll sell an illustration of this   i know a few people who 1 do n't care what their car looks like and 2 are very handy at repairs   these people started out by buying cheap used cars and ran them until they basically fell to pieces   however even though their taste in cars did n't changes as their incomes increased it finally reached the point where doing their own repairs was too much of a time sink so the value of really old cars dropped in their minds and they shifted to buying newer cars and selling them before they completely fell apart   that 's why this is a hard question to answer

last week barack obama went to kansas to kick off a more populist phase in his 2012 re election bid this is a make or break moment for the middle class declared the us president who chose the same venue that roosevelt used in 1910 to call for a new progressive era i believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot   saying everyone should get a fair shot always makes political sense particularly at a time when us income inequality rivals that of mark ’s age but it might have been a stretch for mr obama to suggest the american middle class is facing a unique make or break moment in reality the labour force has been for most of the past generation in a trend that has sharply accelerated since 2000   america used to be exceptional it maintained lower unemployment than the europeans and a higher rate of jobs turnover enabling it to get away with more benefits a fair day ’s work for a fair day ’s pay was within the grasp of most that gave america a booming middle class that until recently was the most important engine of global demand   no longer today somewhat remarkably us is higher than in much of europe and the us consumer is mired in high personal debt as the jobs crisis so too does us political allegations of class warfare are a staple of washington debate in contrast to the 1960s dominated by protests for peace and civil rights today ’s battles are economic yet there are few signs that either policymakers or economists are closer to finding answers nothing mr obama has been able to accomplish since 2008 including off a second great depression and pushing through an overhaul of the healthcare system appears to have resolved that underlying structural challenge indeed the signs are that the problem is in the words of david a leading labour economist at harvard university the labour force is suffering from a growing missing middle   in short the middle skilled jobs that once formed the of the world ’s wealthiest middle class are disappearing they are being supplanted by relatively low skilled and low paid jobs that can not be replaced either by new technology or by offshoring such as home nursing and landscape gardening jobs are also being created for the highly skilled notably in science engineering and management for the remainder of the workforce including college graduates it is both increasingly hard to find a secure job and tougher for those who do find jobs to be paid in line with inflation most people know that median us income has declined sharply since the late 1990s fewer are aware that real incomes also fell sharply in the same period for those with degrees only those with qualifications particularly phds saw net gains for some spectacular   the jobs crisis has many worrying of which three are worth highlighting perhaps the most troublesome is the waning of the market people used to describe the us labour market as after the austrian economist who depicted the cycle of creative destruction jobs might be lost rapidly in a downturn but were swiftly to more productive sectors when economic growth that is not now the case

first and foremost being cool stops being a thing you have to worry about once you graduate from secondary school nobody 's really going to care what car you drive the ones that do care are n't worth maintaining personal friendships or relationships with the notable exception would be a sales job requiring you to look successful to be successful and in that case you 'll need to either have a nice looking car or buy one very quickly also consider what you 're buying an which for the u.s. crowd was the previous generation of and sedans will be at best a old car and they made these as long ago as 98 which would make it 15 years old the standard in the u.s. is to put about 10k miles which would be about 17k km per year on it so you would expect even the newest to have at least 100 000 km on them at this point even the best cars start needing increasing amounts of maintenance and on a bmw that maintenance does n't come cheap   consider why a bmw would be sold it sounds cliche but in the u.s. at least there are three tiers of used car in the luxury class there are the and two year olds used by the dealer as a loaner or owned by the type of guy who buys a new car every year they 're practically new for 30 50 off sticker and a great deal when you find them there are the 15-year old or older cars which were used up and traded in the majority of these end up auctioned off and for parts with the remaining sold for salvage then there are the in between three and ten years old you get a wide variety this car could have been all its life and driven to and from work and around town before its owner got a raise and decided to splurge or its previous owner could have driven the wheels off all over the continent for work or travel it could have a major problem that developed or was discovered after the warranty expired and there is n't an on the road that 's still under warranty which caused the owner to sell overall i would wait until you have your first real job to spend real money on a car like this the one that will actually pay the bills with enough left over for fun when you 're making 35k a year with only your own personal expenses as long as you manage your debt well and do n't get in trouble with credit you should have no trouble buying a car like this or even a newer one if you are going to buy used even then i recommend you do your homework on required maintenance for the brand and in general what each milestone will cost you and based on mileage how soon and i would find a reputable used car dealer which is a contradiction in terms but there are guys out there who are n't out to completely screw you over

a bank may not like loaning money to you for this that is one snag you listed 500,000 600,000 $ for a monster of a house 3000 sqft is over three times the average size of homes a hundred years ago add in the price of the land at 60 k 600 k divided ten ways where i live there is a 15 vat tax on new homes i ca n't find out if california imposes a vat tax on new homes anyway returning back to the topic because of the risk of loaning you 660 k for a piece of land and construction the bank may only let you borrow half or less of the final expected cost not value another huge snag is that you say in a comment to quid i came up with this conclusion after talking to someone who had his property built in early 2000s in bay area for that average price let 's apply 3 inflation over 15 years to that number of that brings the range for construction costs to even at 2 inflation edit op later expanded the question making it an inquiry on why people do n't collaborate to buy a plot of land and build their homes back in the day this was n't all that atypical for example my pastor 's parents did just this when he was a young apart from the individual issues mentioned above there are sociological challenges that arrive examples these are the easy questions

they 're wrong and it 's easy to show that if you pay the same in taxes then you end up the same either way if you have an initial investment of 10k an effective tax rate of 25 and gains of 10 a year here are the numbers you invest 10k into a traditional after 50 years you have $   after paying taxes you end up with $ you invest 10k into a roth after paying the taxes your initial investment is $ 7500 after 50 years you have $ the same you have with the traditional the advantage from the roth comes from two things the assumption that taxes are lower now for you than they will be in the future a good bet given that taxes are relatively low in the us and the ability to have a mix of taxable and non taxable income to draw from in retirement to lower your effective tax rate draw down the taxable up to a certain tax bracket then use your non taxable above that

assuming the question is will they close it for inactivity alone the answer is nope unequivocally update < my answer is geared to credit cards issues by companies that deal in credit not merchandise i.e. store cards retailer cards etc   retailers like amazon etc want to sell goods and are in the credit card business to generate sales   banks and credit companies about whom i am referring make their money primarily on interest and secondarily on service charges either point of use charged to the vendor that accepts payment or fees charged to the user > the only major issuer i will say that it might be possible is discover because i never kept a discover card   i also do n't keep department store cards which might possibly do this but i do doubt it in either of those cases too my answer is based on having 2 amex cards and blue and multiple other visa mc 's that i never use and most of these i have not for over 10 + years since i am also presuming that you are also not talking about an account that charges a yearly or other maintenance fee   why would they keep the account open with the overhead statements and other mailings etc because you might use it   you might not be able to pay it off each month   because you might end up paying thousands in interest over many years   the pennies they pay for maintaining your account and sending you new cards with chip technology etc are all worth the gamble of getting recouped from you   this is why sales people waste their time with lots of people who will not buy their product even though it costs them time and money to prospect because they might buy naturally there are a multitude of reasons for canceling a card but inactivity is not one   i have no less than 10 + inactive cards one that has a balance and two i use infrequently   i really would not mind if they closed all those accounts but they wo n't so enjoy your amex knowing that your visa will be there when you need want it the bank that issues your visa is banking on it presuming you do n't foul up financially cheers

when using a debit card there are two limits that may be imposed on the use the current balance and the maximum daily limit if the banking institution limits your daily usage that may mean that on a particular day you may not be able to make a large purchase even though you have money in the bank otherwise as long as you have funds in the account linked to the debit card you can make the transaction the catch is that as soon as the transaction is sent to the bank one of two things happens the money is immediately deducted from the account or a hold equal to the the amount of the transaction is placed on the account a hold is generally used when the transaction is done in two parts the pre scan at a restaurant or gas station the hold reduces the amount of available funds in the account a hold or an immediate deduction limits the size of future transactions to be able to make larger transactions you need to transfer more money into the account there is no debit card transaction that you can do to   artificially allow a larger transaction unless the bank is not placing a hold or doing an immediate deduction   because a debit card is linked to a bank account some accounts have overdraft protection this protection comes in two forms they either transfer your money from another account or they make a loan either way there can be costs involved

here in the uk the rule of thumb is to keep a lot of equity in your home if you can i assume here that you have a lot of savings you 're considering using if you only have say 10 of the house price you would n't actually have a lot of choice in the matter the mortgage lender will penalise you heavily for low deposits the practical minimum is 5 but for most people a 95 mortgage is just silly albeit not as silly as the 100 or greater mortgages you could get and you should take serious individual advice before considering it according to which the average in the uk for first time buyers is 20 not the best source for that data i confess but a convenient one above 20 is not at all unusual you 'll do an affordability calculation to figure out how much you can borrow which is n't at all the same as how much you should borrow but does get you started basically you decide how much a month you can spend on mortgage payments the calculation will let you put every penny into this if you choose to but in practice you 'll want some discretionary income so do n't do that decide the term of the mortgage for a young first time buyer in the uk i think you 'd typically take a 25-year term and consider early repayment options rather than committing to a shorter term but you do n't have to mortgage lenders will offer shorter terms as long as you can afford the payments decide how much you 're putting into a deposit make for cost of moving stamp duty if applicable fees aka people to your stuff receive back a number which is the house price you can pay under these constraints and of course a breakdown of what the mortgage principle would be and the interest rate you 'll pay this step requires access to lender information since their rates depend on personal details deposit percentage phase of the moon etc our mortgage advisor did multiple runs of the calculation for us for different scenarios since we had n't made up our minds entirely since you have not yet decided how much deposit to make you can use multiple calculations to see the effect of different deposits you might make up to a limit of your total savings putting up more deposit both increases the amount you can borrow for a given monthly payment since mortgage rates are lower when the loan is a lower proportion of house value and of course increases the house price you can afford so unless you 're getting a very high return on your savings £ 1 of deposit gets you somewhat more than £ 1 of house and the calculation will tell you how much more once you 've chosen the house you want the matter is even simpler do you prefer to put your savings in the house and borrow less and make lower payments or prefer to put your savings elsewhere and borrow more and make higher payments but perhaps have some additional income from the savings assuming you maintain a contingency fund a lower mortgage is generally considered a good investment in the uk but you need to check what 's right for you and compare it to other investments you could make the issue is complicated by the fact that residential property prices are rising quite quickly in most areas of the uk and have been for a long time meaning that highly leveraged property investment appears to be a really good idea this leads to the imprudent but tempting conclusion that you should buy the biggest house you can possibly afford and watch its value rises i do not endorse this advice personally but it 's certainly true that in a sharply rising house market it 's easier to get away with buying a bigger house than you need than it is to get away with it in a flat or falling market as stephen says an offset mortgage is a no brainer good idea if the rate is the same unfortunately in the uk the rate is n't the same or anyway it was n't a couple of years ago offset mortgages are especially good for those who make a lot of savings from income and for any reason do n't want to commit all of those savings to a traditional mortgage payment good reasons for not wanting to do that include uncertainty about your future income and a desire to have the flexibility to actually spend some of it if you fancy

both are correct depending on what you are really trying to evaluate if you only want to understand how that particular investment you were taking money in and out of did by itself than you would ignore the cash   you might use this if you were thinking of replacing that particular investment with another but keeping the in out strategy if you want to understand how the whole investment strategy worked both the in out motion and the choice of investment than you would definitely want to include the cash component as that is necessary for the strategy and would be your final return if you implemented that strategy as a side note neither irr or cagr are not great ways to judge investment strategies as they have some odd timing issues and they do n't take into account risk

i do n't think asking a business to pay living wages is as cold as a business paying wages for work that keeps their business afloat a business that is only profitable because they pay shit really should n't exist in the us    look i 'm not about destroying but i am about someone who works 40 hour weeks making enough money to reasonably cover their expenses without government assistance that simply is n't the case with the min wage where it is now    it is insane to put the people who are creating businesses that ca n't exist without unfair wages above the interests of people who do n't have the advantages necessary for whatever reason to land a non min wage job    maybe with the change to higher wages the gov would be forcing barely profitable businesses to become unprofitable but if you are willing to say that then it would be fair to say that the current min wage is mandating everyone who works a minimum wage full time job into literal poverty    and how would a massive population that is suddenly flush with spending money not the economy people spending money is good that is why a big healthy middle class is so good for a country to have let people who can pay fair wages pay them let everyone else come up with a business plan that does n't hinge on unfair wages ffs min wage has been raised before and actual studies have suggested time and time again that the benefit outweighs the short term loss of employment    tl;dr we can not put needs of business owners ahead of needs of the people working for them that creates a massively unstable amp unequal society

supply and demand pure and simple there are two basic forms of this a change in the quantity demanded supplied at any given price and a true change in the amount of demand supply itself please note that this can be distinct from the underlying change in the value of the company and/or its expected future cash flows which are a function of both financial performance and future expectations if more people want the stock that are willing to sell it at a given price at a given point in time sellers will begin to offer the stocks at higher prices until the market is no longer willing to bear the new price and vice versa this will reduce the quantity of stocks demanded by buyers until the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied once again reach an equilibrium at which point a transaction occurs because people are motivated to buy and sell for different reasons at different times and because people have different opinions on a constant flow of new information prices change frequently this is one of the reasons why executives of a recent ipo do n't typically sell all of their stock at once in addition to legal restrictions and the message this would send to the market if they flooded the market with additional quantities of stock supplied all else being equal since there is no corresponding increase in the quantity demanded the price would drop significantly sometimes the demand itself for a company 's stock shifts unlike a simple change in price driven by quantity supplied versus quantity demanded this is a more fundamental shift for example let 's suppose that the current demand for rare earth metals is driven by their commercial applications in consumer electronics now if new devices are developed that no longer require these metals the demand for them will fall regardless of the actions of individual buyers and sellers in the market another example is when the rules of the game for an industry change dramatically markets are behavioral in this sense prices are most directly driven by human behavior which hopefully is based on well informed opinions and facts this is why sometimes the price keeps going up when financial performance decreases and why sometimes it does not rise even while performance is improving this is also why some companies stock continues to rise even when they lose huge sums of money year after year the key to understanding these scenarios is the opinions and expectations that buyers and sellers have of that information which is expressed in their market behavior

consider the following scenario at a small business as a business owner i have 10k in the bank at the moment i have a one time expense of 4k that will not directly impact the growth of my business i can choose to pay the 4k out of the 10 in the bank and then put the rest towards business growth assuming a 10 annual return on capital at the end of this transaction i am left with $ now if instead i chose to pay the 4k with a business credit card i have that only carries a 7.9 interest rate what would happen is that i incur a 4k balance that i have to pay off in a year and put 10k towards my business now this is a simplified case that does not take into account the effective interest on the card and the minimum monthly payments that being said what happens in the end of the year is that i owe $ to my credit card but i now have 11k   in the bank due to business growth that leaves me with $ after a year 's worth of operations which is better than my original $ this is a small scale scenario though but the basic idea is that if you can put the money towards growth that is better than the interest you are paying to the card you win the risks of course include missing a payment and incurring a penalty not being able to grow your money at the rate you thought and so on hope this explains things a bit

you own a fractional share of the company maybe you should care enough to at least read the proxy statements which explain the pro and con position for each of the issues you are voting on that does n't seem like too much to ask on the other hand if you are saying that the people who get paid to be knowledgeable about that stuff should just go make the decisions without troubling you with the details then choose the option to go with their recommendations which are always clearly indicated on the voting form however if you do this it might make sense to at least do some investigation of who you are voting onto that board i guess as said you could just abstain but i 'm not sure how that is any different than just trashing the form as for the idea that proxy votes are tainted somehow the one missing piece of that conspiracy is what those people have to gain are you implying that your broker who has an interest in you making money off your investments and liking them would fraudulently cast proxy votes for you in a way that would harm the company and your return why exactly would they do this i find your stance on the whole thing a bit confusing though you seem to have some strong opinions on corporate governance but at the same time are n't willing to invest any effort in the one place you have any control over the situation i 'm just update per the following information from the sec website it looks like the meaning of a proxy vote can vary depending on the mechanics of the specific issue you are voting on my emphasis added what do for against withhold mean on the proxy card or voter instruction form    depending on what you are voting on    the proxy card or voting instruction    form gives you a choice of voting    for against or abstain or    for or withhold here is an    explanation of the differences election of directors generally    company bylaws or other corporate    documents establish how directors are    elected there are two main types of    ways to elect directors    vote and majority vote a vote means that the    winning candidate only needs to get    more votes than a competing candidate    if a director runs he or    she only needs one vote to be elected    so an against vote is meaningless    because of this shareholders have the    option to express with    a candidate by indicating that they    wish to withhold authority to vote    their shares in favor of the    candidate a substantial number of    withhold votes will not prevent a    candidate from getting elected but it    can sometimes influence future    decisions by the board of directors    concerning director nominees a majority vote means that directors    are elected only if they receive a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this case    you have the choice of voting for    each nominee against each nominee    or you can abstain from voting your    shares an abstain vote may or may    not affect a director 's election each    company must disclose how abstain or    withhold votes affect an election in    its proxy statement this information    is often found toward the beginning of    the proxy statement under a heading    such as votes required to adopt a    proposal or how your votes are    counted proposals other than an election of    directors matters other than voting    on the election of directors like    voting on shareholder proposals are    typically approved by a vote of a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this    situation you are usually given the    choice to vote your shares for or    against a proposal or to abstain    from voting on it again the effect    of an abstain vote may depend on the    specific voting rule that applies the    company 's proxy statement should again    disclose the effect of an abstain    vote

do n't worry about minimizing taxes too much worry about maximizing post tax income   keep in mind that if you just got a job then it 's likely that the taxes being automatically withheld are based on the assumption you 've been earning this much all year which could mean that you 're likely going to be due a refund come april basically if you 're making 100k year but only actually getting 20k this year they 'll still take taxes out as though you were making the full 100k    if you 're maxing out your 401 k you can also contribute to an ira to reduce taxes or contribute to a roth to invest more if you max it out    for investment i like betterment it 's well diversified and avoids many common investment pitfalls   much better than a savings account but you should also consider the need to have readily accessible money in case of emergencies

also i would n't go so far as to say that just because a government agency is performing the work it is now therefore objective   remember in each and every instance it is a person doing the actually work   that person is at least just as likely to be corruptible in a corporate setting as in a government setting   rather i would go so far as to say that they are more likely to be corruptible in a government job as there is n't a tremendous amount of upside   if you 're making $ 75k a year and have the opportunity for a $ 100k payment on the side to look the other way you 're much more likely to take it than if you 're making $ 500k per year   there 's also the added complexity of each employees exit opportunities from government work   for example if you work for the sec your best employment option outside of the commission is to go work in compliance for the industry hedge funds and investment banks in particular   kind of skews your incentives a bit right

how much is your time worth this has been useful for me judging things based on how much their time value is worth to me weighted more heavily than their actual worth for instance there was a time when i used to work on the weekends and pay to have my laundry done doing the laundry myself would have cost 25 cents but taken two hours at least since i was making $ 45 an hour i would have lost $ 90 dollars by doing my laundry instead of paying specialists $ 28 to do it for me much better than i would your own capital should begin growing at a rate that makes many many things worth less than the time it takes for you to entertain it so in your cable bill example you should n't have argued for a $ 5 credit for two hours unless you make $ 2.25 an hour after tax this is simplistic as you would extrapolate how much this would cost you over a year or two but such cost benefit analysis become easy with this simple concept this can also be used to rationalize your lavish expenditures such as not really comparing the costs for a flight because its a 2 hour flight for $ 400 and you 've found yourself making at least $ 200 an hour with your $ annual earnings and capital gains this will cure your frugality while retaining safe guards on your spending

this has never really adequately explained it for me and i 've tried reading up on it all over the place for a long time i thought that in a trade the market maker pockets the spread for that trade but that 's not the case   the only sensible explanation i 've found which i 'm not going to give in full is that the market maker will provide liquidity by buying and selling trades they have no actual view on short or long and if the spread is higher that contributes directly to the amount they make over time when they open and close positions they 've made   it would be great to see a single definitive example somewhere that shows how a market maker makes money

say a stock is listed in nasdaq and the same company has a stock listed in tsx does the nasdaq price affect the tsx price as trading not directly basically an exchange is a market and the price is defined only by supply and demand in that market however any substantial price differential for a commodity traded in multiple market creates an arbitrage opportunity and there are many traders whose job it is exactly to find and use such opportunities their activity in turn has the effect of reducing the price to the point where transaction costs make them unprofitable with high frequency traders around the time for a price differential to disappear is nowadays measured in milliseconds if a trader buys from one exchange will it affect the price of the other only through the mechanism mentioned above   are there any benefits to being listed in two exchanges it increases the liquidity of a stock

not directly nintendo but a company would want its share price to be high if it wants to sell its stock e.g. on ipo or on subsequent offerings however if they want to buy back some shares it would be in their interest to get more stock for the buck there may of course be derivative values associated with a high share price e.g. if they bet on the price or have agreements with investors for particular to be reached employees might hold shares and be motivated by share price increases so a decrease may not be desired unless they are into some kind of insider trading buy low sell high and last over valued share prices may undermine trust in a company and failing to inform shareholders sufficiently may be outright illegal besides those reasons related to law funding sales public relations and company image companies should be pretty much independent from their own share prices in contrast to share distribution

your question is n't great but i will attempt to answer this piece as it seems really the root of your personal finance question i want to convince my wife to make this move because it will save us    at least 800 month but she fails to see how buying a second home is    financially sound because we have to lose our savings and we have to    pay interest on our second home and her logic is it will take almost 5 years to get back our down payment    and we have to pay interest as well so how can this move help our    family financially in the long run is she right she is mostly wrong first consider that there is no roi really on your down payment assuming you are paying what your home would sell for the next day then your rio is already yours minus realtor fees she is talking about cash on hand not roi i will use an example without taking into account risk of home markets going down or other risks to ownership example let 's say you pay $ 2800 a month in mortgage at 5.5 apr and $ 200 a month in on a $ loan $ 400k house in this example let 's say the same house if you were to rent it is $ 3800 a month understand the opportunity cost of renting the marginal amount it costs you to not buy so far your opportunity cost is $ 800 a month the principle of your house will be increasing with each payment in our example it 's about $ 400 for the first payment and will increase with each payment made while decreasing the interest payment suggest you look at an amortization table for your specific mortgage example so you 're real number is now $ 1200 a month opportunity cost consider also the fact that the $ 400 a month is sitting in a savings account of sorts while most savings accounts give you less than 1 in returns and then charge taxes on that gain your home may or may not be much higher than that and wo n't charge you taxes on the gains when you sell it if you live in it for a period of time as defined by the irs let 's assume a conservative long term appreciation rate of 3 that 's $ 12k a year on a $ 400k house so now you 're at $ 2200 a month opportunity cost in this example i did n't touch on your tax savings of ownership i also did n't touch on the maintenance cost of ownership or the maintenance cost of renting your deposit + other fees which all should be considered you may have other costs involved in renting for instance the cost of not being able to fully utilize your rental as your own house this may be an even simpler and more convincing way to explain it on the $ 2800 mortgage example you will be paying around $ 19k in interest and $ 2400 on taxes insurance = $ 23k per year number could be way different in your example that is basically throw away money you 're never getting back on the rental 100 of your rent at $ 3800 a month is throw away money you 're never getting back that 's $ a year

from my understanding a cds is a financial product to buy protection against an event of default default of payment example if general motors owes me money $ 10,000,000 because i own gm bonds for example and i wish to protect myself against the event of gm not repaying the money they owe me event called credit default i pay the seller of the cds perhaps $ 250,000 per year against the promise that will pay me in case gm is not paying me this way i protected myself against that risk took the risk against money a cds is in fact an insurance except they do n't call it an insurance which enabled the financial industry to avoid the regulation that applies to insurances there is a lot of here

a few years back me and a couple of friends made about 100 of these on his 30 watt laser cutter at the time i was using them for ring boxes because i make spoon rings and wanted something to give to people for the nicer sterling rings if i remember correctly we used high plywood at 1/8 thickness the grade we were buying ran us about $ 30 for a sheet we cut them into sheets because that 's the max size for his laser and cut roughly 5 out of each sheet the ones we were making were of course much smaller than what you are looking at though materials alone ended up running about $ .50 a piece we were coating with one layer of oil it was roughly ten minutes to cut out 5 boxes then another ten minutes to pop them out of the plywood and assemble each one despite what has been stated with tweaking friction fit held up completely fine we did n't use glue on a single one and i still have a few laying around that are holding up fine also anyway say you are paying yourself roughly $ 20 an hour and you can speed it up from what we did and make 20 in an hour now you have $ 1 a piece in labor keep in mind if you go to a place to have these made from my experience most places will charge you roughly $ 1 a minute for laser time add engraving time if you want a logo or something on them probably another minute per box all in all in the end these are going to end up costing you $ a box if you have free access to a laser i would imagine anyone making them for you would probably charge double that    in the end after the first batch of both these boxes some slightly different and some jewelry trees we found out that it 's hard to sell these items for an affordable price and still make it worth your while if i remember correctly we ended up selling most of the remaining boxes for about $ 4 a piece just to break even and cover all of our expenses of course this is just my experience if someone has a way to do this more efficiently and for a profit i would be interested to hear it because we still have the laser and probably 100 sheets of plywood left

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

i 'm assuming your talking usa there are two ways to look if you know you should pay on the cap gains the best way to handle that separately from your salary is to file a quarterly tax payment   that i understand is what the self employed have to do i 'm in the situation where at some point probably this year the company that employs me will be bought out and i will owe capital gains taxes on my shares up in the buy out   it 's a cash for stock transaction   so in my case i 've just adjusted my w-4 to take advantage of the safe harbor provision related to taxes i payed in 2016 and my salary   the details vary depending on your situation but in my case i 've calculated what it will take in w-4 allowances to make sure i pay 110 of my 2016 tax payment after refund   i 'm not worrying about what the actual taxes on those shares of company stock will be because i 've met the rules for safe harbor safe harbor just means that they ca n't penalize you for under withholding or underpayment   it does n't mean i wo n't have to write a check on april 15

first off great job on your finances so far you are off on the right foot and have some sense of planning for the future   also it is a great question    first i agree with @littleadv take advantage of your employer match do not drop your 401(k contributions below that also good job on putting your contributions into the roth account second i would ask are you out of debt   if not put all your extra income towards paying off debt and then you can work your plan third time to do some math   what will your business look like   how much capital would you need to get started   are there things you can do now on a part time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business come up with a figure find some mutual funds that have a low beta and back out how much money you need to save per month so you have around that total   then you have a figure e.g. assume you need $ 20,000 and you find a fund that has done 8 over the past 20 years   then you would need to save about $ to be ready to go in 10 years or $ to go in about 5 years   it 's a time value of money calculation the house is really a long way off but you could do the same kind of calculation   i feel that you think your income and possibly locale will change dramatically over the next few years   it might not be bad to double what you are saving for the business and designate one half for the house

he is assuming flat structural growth    amazon is turning no profit because they are a services company not a hardware company they use all their money to invest in infrastructure to expand their services amd needs to spend a lot of money to operate a fab to produce chips while amazon keeps spending money to expand new business units offering greater services    imagine you are a toll bridge operator you build a bridge and collect a toll but instead of declaring the fees collected as profit you start construction of another bridge paid for by the profits of the first you are pretty careful not to go crazy with debt so you break even all the time    20 year later you have 10 bridges paying for the next ten to be built those 20 will pay for the next 20 their bridge membership club keeps customers using existing bridges and automatically brings in customers for newly built ones    of course it took amazon so long to catch the largest retailer and so little to double them    the next large play is really large the whole foods purchase they bought the foundational land for hundreds of small bridges to more easily connect them to even more bridge users    once amazon is done growing and they have thousands of bridges collecting tolls all over the world the money flow will be absolutely insane    but they will still be breaking even as they will be buying fleets of aircraft and other international chains for further delivery but the small profit they declare will still be pretty big it wo n’t be apple sized profit but it will be an amazing amount of revenue    amazon is to big box retail what big box retail was to mom pop retail the oxygen remover    they want to be the toll booth operator for all retail in the entire world

changes in graduated income tax rates do n't necessarily drive how you should allocate money to a traditional vs roth account true for both ira or 401k what does drive this decision is what your income tax rate is now compared to what you believe your rate will be when you retire so if you expect the tax rate change to still be in effect when you retire it does n't matter if the change is a tax increase or decrease your previous allocation could likely remain the same this means that if congress passed the change effective immediately it would be too late for you to make a meaningful adjustment but if congress passes the change effective next year then most likely your tax rate will decrease for next year meaning you are probably better off switching all roth allocations to traditional and then switching them back to whatever allocations you have now for next year the reverse would be true if you knew about an upcoming tax increase in which case you would load up roth this year and then switch back to whatever you had for next year that being said regarding after the fact considerations i suppose it would be fair to say that if the country is accustomed to a higher tax rate and then rates are dropped if spending is not cut to make up for it then rates would likely have to go up again in the future to make up the difference if you believe that will happen then roths would become a little more attractive since rates would be lower than what you expect them to be when you retire as a side note if you ever had reason to believe that congress was going to move away from the graduated income tax structure all bets are off for example if the income tax was replaced with a tax on spending such as the then in the interim period roths would become worthless and you 'd want to switch to until the change went into effect and then once in effect both roths and would be pointless

you should check the details of those balance transfers they typically have a 3 to 5 one time fee which means you pay nearly a year 's interest right away and then every time you transfer the total on again also this fee gets added to the credit card total and it is possibly considered paid last after you paid off the completed transferred balance so it cost interest for the whole time and that interest is different maybe 19.99 or worse it is probably a better idea to refinance for 5 years at < 3 and they pay off as fast as possible

its based on demand and supply and what bank think the future rates would be today banks in india have a liquidity crunch as the repo rates by reserve bank of india central bank are high bank want to encourage more people to deposit money and hence are offering higher rates banks also believe that once the inflation is under control the central bank would ease the repo rates this is likely to happen in a years time hence banks one year down want to lower the fixed deposit rates so essentially they would be at loss if they give higher rates for longer periods so they are offering the highest rates for a period of year which motivates more people to invest for a year even if they want to stay invested for long

when your options vest you will have the option to buy your company 's stock at a particular price the strike price a big part of the value of the option is the difference between the price that your company 's stock is trading at and the strike price of the option if the price of the company stock in the market is lower than the strike price of the option they are almost worthless   i say almost because there is still the possibility that the stock price could go up before the options expire if your company is big enough that their stock is not only listed on an exchange but there is an active options market in your company 's stock you could get a feel for what they are worth by seeing what the market is willing to buy or sell similar exchange listed options once the options have vested you now have the right to purchase your company 's stock at the specified strike price until the options expire   when you use that right you are exercising the option   you do n't have to do that until you think it is worthwhile buying company stock at that price if the company pays a dividend it would probably be worth exercising the options sooner options do n't receive a dividend   ultimately you are buying your company 's stock albeit at a discount   you need to see if your company 's stock is still a good investment if you think your company has growth prospects you might want to hold onto the stock   if you think you 'd be better off putting your money elsewhere in the market sell the stock you acquired at a discount and use the money to invest in something else if there are any additional benefits to holding on to the stock for a period of time e.g. selling part to fit within your capital gain allowance for that year you should factor that into your investment decision but it should n't force you to invest in or remain invested in something you would otherwise view as too risky to invest in a reminder of that fact is that some employees of enron invested their entire retirement plans into enron stock so when enron went bankrupt these employees not only lost their job but their savings for retirement as well

bonds are valued based on all of this using the concept of the time value of money simply stated money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later case in point let 's say the par value of a bond is $ 100 and will mature 10 years from this date these are common terms for most bonds though the u.s. treasury has a variety of bonds with varying par values and maturation periods with a 0 coupon rate nothing 's paid out prior to maturity if the company or government issuing the bonds needs one million dollars and the people buying the bonds are expecting a 5 rate of return on their investment then each bond would only sell for about $ 62 and the bond issuer would have to sell a par value of $ million in bonds to get its $ 1 m now these numbers are based on equations that calculate the future value of an investment made now and conversely the present value of a future return back to that time value of money concept money now that you 're paying to buy the bond is worth more than money later that you 'll get back at maturity so you will expect to be returned more than you invested to account for this time difference the percentage of rate of return is known as the yield or the discount rate depending on what you 're calculating what else you take into consideration when defining the rate like inflation and whom you talk to now that $ m in par value may be hard for the bond issuer to swallow the issuer is effectively paying interest on interest over the lifetime of the bond instead many issuers choose to issue coupon bonds which have a coupon rate determining the amount of a coupon payment this can be equated pretty closely with you making interest only payments on a credit card balance each period in which interest is compounded you pay the amount of interest that has accrued to avoid this compounding effect   from an accounting standpoint the coupon rate lowers the amount of real monies paid the same $ 1 m in bonds maturing in 10 years with a 5 expected rate of return but with a 5 coupon rate now only requires payments totalling $ 1.5 m and that half million in interest is paid $ 50k at a time annually or $ 25k semi annually but from a finance standpoint because the payments made in the first few years are worth more than the payments made closer to and at maturity the present value of all these coupon payments plus the maturity payout is higher than if the full payout happened at maturity and so the future value of the total investment is higher   coupon rates on bonds thus allow a bond issuer to plan a bond package in less complicated terms if you as a small business need $ 1 m for a project which you will repay in 10 years and during that time you are willing to tolerate a 5 interest rate on the outstanding money then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ 1 million worth to mature in 10 years and a 5 coupon rate now whether the market is willing to accept that rate is up to the market right now they 'd be over the moon with that rate and would be willing to buy the bonds for more than their face value because the present value would then match the yield they 're willing to accept as in any market system you as the seller will sell to the highest bidder to get the best price available if however they think you are a bad bet they 'll want an even higher rate of return and so the present value of all coupon and maturity payments will be less than the par value and so will the purchase price

i see some merit in the other answers which are all based on the snowball method however i would like to present an alternative approach which would be the optimal way in case you have perfect self control given your amount of debt most likely you currently do not have perfect self control but we will come to that the first step is to think about what the minimum amount of emergency funds are that you need and to compare this number with your credit card limit if your limits are such that your credit cards can still cover potential emergency expenses use all of the 4000 $ to repay the debt on the loan with the higher interest rate some answer wrote that others may disagree as it is more efficient to pay down the however if you pay it all of within the year the difference only comes to $ 260 this is bad advice because you will probably not pay back the loan within one year where would you miraculously obtain 20 000 $ for that thus paying back the higher interest loan will save you more money than just next follow 's advice and refinance your debt under a lower rate this is much more impactful than choosing the right loan to repay make sure to consult with different banks to get the best rate reducing your interest rate has utmost priority from your accumulated debt we can probably infer that you do not have perfect self control and will be able to minimize your spending maximize your debt repayments thus you need to incentivize yourself to follow such behavior a powerful way to do this is to have a family member or very close friend monitor your purchase and saving behavior if you can not control yourself someone else must it should rather be a a person you trust than the banks you owe money

you 're right of course but that 's not something you would ever want to do    five years from now the op may well decide to convert some of his traditional funds to roth for now even though roth was his original intent that would mean a tax come next april    as an aside the biggest reason for most people to have roth funds is n't because you expect to make more inflation or more importantly tax code adjusted in retirement than now   if that were the case the entire concept would be almost worthless who the heck makes more after retiring than before   the best reason to have substantial roth funds in your retirement portfolio is the way that social security is taxed   if you can keep your agi under $ 25k note that includes half of your ss benefits but since the standard deduction is roughly $ 10k those more or less cancel each other out you do n't pay a dime in taxes on your ssi   so if you have a solid budget take your yearly expenses subtract out $ 25k and that 's what you should sustainably have in roth funds   the remaining $ 25k is what you should have in traditional funds

if you really believe in the particular stocks then do n't worry about their daily price   overall if the company is sound and presumably paying a dividend then you 're in it for the long haul notwithstanding that it is reasonable to look for a way out   the two you describe are quite different in their specifics selling sounds like the simpler of the two but the trigger event and if it is automatic or manual matters   if you are happy to put in a sell order at some time in the future then just go ahead with that many brokers can place a stop order that will trigger on a certain price threshold being hit   do note however that by default this would place a market order and depending on the price that breaks through in the event of a flash crash depending on how fast the brokers systems were you could find yourself selling quite cheaply a stop limit order will place a limit order at a triggered price   this would limit your overall downside loss but you might not sell at all if the market is really running away options are another reasonable way to deal with the situation sort of like insurance   in this case you would likely buy a put which would give you the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at the price the that was specified in the option   in this case no matter what you are out the price of the option itself hence my to insurance but if the event never happens then that was the price you paid to have that peace of mind i can not recommend a specific course of action but hopefully that fleshed out the options you have

are you in the us because if so there are tax discrepancies gains from sale of stocks held for less than one year are subject to ordinary income tax so probably around 30 if you hold those stocks for a year or more gains will be taxed as capital gains tax 15   for forex taxes on your earnings will be split 60/40 60 will be traded at the lower 15 rate while the remaining 40 will be taxed at a higher rate approximately 30   so purely short term there is a tax advantage to in forex however these are both incredibly risky things to do with your money i never would recommend anyone invest short term looking to make quick cash in fact the tax code discourages people from short term investments

there is no advantage to using one type of account or the other if you are in the same tax bracket at retirement that you are in during your working years however for tax planning reasons it is good to have some money in both a roth and a traditional ira plan   joetaxpayer has often advocated a good rule of thumb to use a roth when your tax bracket is 15 or lower and use a traditional account when in the 25 bracket or above the reason for this rule of thumb is that you are less likely to be in the higher tax bracket when you are living off retirement savings unless you put away an awful lot of money between now and then if you are making enough money to be paying a 25 marginal rate on some of the money you would be putting away for retirement then by all means put all of that money in a traditional 401k if after contributing that portion of your savings taxed at the higher rate you still have money to put away for retirement put the rest in a roth and pay the 15 taxes on it when you are younger it is likely that you are making less than you will a few years hence and it is also likely that a larger portion of your income will be paying tax deductible interest on a mortgage if those are true for you then by all means use the roth that was true of me when i was single and just getting started when you do finally retire it is possible that the tax brackets will be increased to match inflation and if so then there is no benefit to having tax free money at retirement vs. paying taxes on deferred accounts but there is also usually more flexibility in when to spend money you may find that you have a year where you have to spend a lot so it is good to be able to pull money out without it increasing your marginal rate for that year and other years where you spend relatively smaller amounts and you can withdraw taxable money and pay a lower rate on that money no one knows what the tax code will look like in 40 years but having some money in each type of account will give you flexibility to minimize your tax bill at retirement

there is a strategy called merger arbitrage where you buy the stock of the acquired company when it sells for less than the final acquisition price usually the price will rise to about the acquisition price fairly rapidly after the merge is announced so you have to move fast the danger is that the merger gets called off regulatory reasons the acquired company board votes no and you get left holding shares bought at a price higher than the price after the merger collapses this is kind of an advanced strategy and a tough one to back test since each deal is unique

first request that you complete a tax return on this tax return you will complete both the employed and self employed sections this will give you a total income and tax liability you will already have paid some tax via paye but you will have to pay additional tax for any other income for future years there is the option depending on amount to collect extra tax through paye to cover the other earnings if it is likely to be the same for the next few years this may be a better option than paying a lump sum the tax return is now mostly online and not too bad if your affairs are otherwise simple the hardest part will be keeping a good record of your other earnings remember that you have to keep these records for seven years in case hmrc ever want to audit them and it 's a good idea to have a separate account for the income or some other way of easily identifying it

this is way too long for a comment so i am posting this as an answer my bet is that you 're buying a new piano it is the only instrument that makes sense the rest of this answer are going to assume this but this should apply well if you 're going after a or for example for those readers that do not know a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument my piano is literally more expensive than my car there are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car you may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price therefore the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you this explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy you are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region or the exact model around your region which you have already did those indicate the standard price in your negotiation you described the dealer had the exact model you desire only in different appearance i assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood pattern one in their showroom note every piano is different even with the exact same model there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch since some processes are hand finished if you 're buying a treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal if they do not have your desired model in the showroom ask for a visit to their inventory facility again play the exact instrument not a showroom model some dishonest dealers will have their showroom regulated and tuned differently than the standard from shipping if you get an extremely good offer proceed with caution there may be defects in that particular instrument look for rust or layers on the strings look for in the hammers listen to clicking when playing the keys these are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they can not sell it you can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online before you close the deal ask for after sale services how many free will they provide will they polish your piano after delivery these are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price

well you have three main options in my opinion for cash or any assets you can convert to cash you could purchase bonds with a maturity date close to what you are looking to lock your funds up for while you could sell these on a secondary market admittedly however you have a justification you can provide to yourself as to why you can not sell them fixed term deposits often have poor interest rates but if you ask to withdraw your money early you often forfeit all of the interest you would have gained while your money would not be locked up it keeps it further out of your reach just like bonds every step further away from your bank account the funds get the less likely you are to surrender to giving away money that is rightfully yours it comes with the added advantage of typically high returns trust funds can be set up with anyone as the beneficiary and provide legal barriers so long as the beneficiary is n't also the executor while it can be expensive to do so you could hire a lawyer who specialises in estate law to set up a trust fund you are the beneficiary of which has stipulations as to how and when assets can be released i did n't include this as one of the main three because it does n't allow you to specify exactly when funds are released to you but in many countries including the us you have special tax advantaged retirement accounts where funds are locked away until you retire however it is unfortunate you even need to think about this another thing to consider is that if people start pressuring you for money you should cut them out of your life

taking as given that your definition of va involves selling at intermediate times your question can be made more general   after all value averaging is just one special case of a portfolio that rebalances to target weights periodically do back end fees and front end fees harm the value of portfolios that require rebalancing   the answer is yes they do   those fees are put in place in order to prevent investors from redeeming shares over any but the longest horizons   any portfolio that rebalances periodically will involve some periodic selling   if you invest in a fund with front end or back end fees it is optimal to leave your money in it for as long as possible and not do any rebalancing if you want to run a portfolio that is at all active involves rebalancing then it is probably wise to use no load funds these are often some of the best and cheapest funds anyway but even if front or back end load funds have a lower expense ratio you will likely lose money on those loads as you rebalance

i believe that the same message could be sent without shutting the company and putting thousands of people on unemployment and hurting shareholders dissolving the company would only hurt everyone except the people responsible who almost certainly have golden parachutes in their employment contracts   how about penalizing them by assessing an extra cyber breach tax on their revenues or seizing stock options and assets of the top level execs and only releasing portions after x many months without a security breach or use the fines to fund an initiative that companies need to be bonded against data loss with the rates set by security experts doing audits on the companies   there are plenty of ways to improve the situation without putting them out of business at the very worst the company should be put up for sale to be taken over by a holding company that can manage the process of their security instead of just liquidating assets which would only hurt the innocent in the incident

changing my answer based on clarification in comments it appears that some of the securities you mentioned including are traded on what is colloquially known as the grey market grey sheets and also known as the gray market is another category of otc stocks that is completely separate from pink sheets and the   from investopedia the grey market is an over the counter market where dealers may execute orders for preferred customers as well as provide support for a new issue before it is actually issued this activity allows underwriters and the issuer to determine demand and price the securities accordingly before the ipo   some additional information on this type of stocks source unlike other financial markets no recent bid or ask quotes are available because no market makers share data or quote such stocks there is no quoting system available to record and settle trades all grey sheet trading is moderated by a broker and done between individuals at a price they agree on the only documentation that can be publicly found regarding the trades is when the last trade took place no sec registration and little sec regulation regulation of grey sheet stocks takes place mainly on a state level unlike pink sheets these stocks have no sec registration to possess a stock symbol or to possess shares or trade shares of that stock such penny stocks similar to pink sheets are not required to file sec securities and exchange commission financial and business reports these stocks may not be solicited or advertised to the public unless a certain number of shares are qualified to be traded publicly under 504 of regulation d. extremely illiquid gray sheet trading is infrequent and for good reason difficult to trade not advertised difficult to follow the price the least regulation possible hard to find any information on the stock very small market cap little history and most such stocks do not yet offer public shares the lack of information bids history financial reports alone causes most investors to be very skeptical of gray sheets and avoid them altogether   gray sheets are commonly associated with initial public offering ipo stocks or start up companies or spin off companies even though not all are ipo 's start ups or spin offs grey sheets is also home to delisted stocks from other markets some stocks on this financial market were once traded on the nasdaq or the pink sheets but ran into serious misfortune usually financial and thus failed to meet the minimum requirements of the registered sec filings and/or stock exchange regulations for a financial market such stocks were delisted or removed and may begin trading on the grey sheets   so to answer your question i think the cause of the wild swings is that    great question btw

the government bailed out the financial system because it was in its best interest to letting the system all crash on top of yourself is definitely not smart so we loan financial institutions money shore up any short term issues and we get most of the money back if not all of it if i 'm not mistaken all the bail out money was paid back   but beyond the point there may be merit in basic income ideas but this is definitely not the kind of rhetoric thinking analysis or insight that it needs

there is absolutely no logical reason why each nation does not own and control banking and thus the supply of money   any system including the financial system works exactly the same way regardless of ownership   banking depends solely on the confidence of the customers investors therefore when a sovereign nation state has ownership of the banks the profits are kept in house within the nation which is actually a bonus and taxes can be off set by profits which is another benefit   any improvement or benefit by the private ownership of banking is a total myth

bond etfs are traded like normal stock   it just so happens to be that the underlying fund for which you own shares is invested in bonds   such funds will typically own many bonds and have them laddered so that they are constantly maturing   such funds may also trade bonds on the otc market note that with bond etfs you 're able to lose money as well as gain depending on the situation with the bond market   the issuer of the bond does not need to default in order for this to happen   the value of a bond and thus the value of the bond fund which holds the bonds is much like a stock determined based on factors like supply demand interest rates credit ratings news etc

as others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns   defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it    is one better than the other we can argue this either way    defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured   the problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount   if the employer fails in that responsibility then the only fallback is government guarantees   and of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee   for example from wikipedia    the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by pbgc is set by law and adjusted yearly for plans that end in 2016 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $ per month or $ per year under pbgc 's insurance program for single employer plans benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor and higher for those who retire after age 65 additionally the pbgc will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five year period prior to a plan 's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree 's lifetime other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits benefit increases within the last five years before a plan 's termination and benefits earned after a plan sponsor 's bankruptcy by contrast people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts   so they control how much gets invested and where   defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded    defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded   they expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short   this allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement   but it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee    if you want someone else to make promises to you and are n't worried that they wo n't keep them you probably prefer defined benefit    if you want to have personal control over the money you probably prefer defined contribution    my personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse   they encourage risky behavior and false promises   defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation   others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions

i thought the line is much than that though say you have a company with divisions an overseas division makes an item sells it to another division overseas for final packaging then it 's sold domestically the domestic division should only pay taxes on the profits they earn and overseas on the profits from what they ship    but the company only wants to pay minimal taxes so they set the foreign price high so that a majority of profits are made overseas who will argue that this is n't correct is n't that it it 's not foreign sales but markup

this is a question with a flawed premise   credit cards do have two factor authentication on transactions they consider more at risk to be fraudulent   i 've had several times when i bought something relatively expensive and unusual for me where the cc either initially declined and sent me a text asking to confirm immediately after which they would approve the charges or approved but sent me a text right away asking to confirm after which they 'd automatically dispute if i told them to   the first is legitimately what you are asking for the second is presumably for less risky but still some risk transactions ultimately the reason they do n't allow it for every transaction is that not enough people would make use of it to be worth their time to implement it   particularly given it slows down the transaction significantly and look at the complaints at the ~10 15 seconds extra emv authentication takes imagine that as a minute or more i think you 'd get a single digit percentage of people using that service

as documented in myfico there are several factors that affect credit scores payment history 35 the first thing any lender wants to know is whether you 've paid past    credit accounts on time this is one of the most important factors in    a fico ® score as miller mentioned checking your credit report to determine whether or not late payments were reported to credit bureaus will give you a sense of whether or not this was effected you mentioned several bounced payments which certainly could have caused this this would be my largest concern with a closed account is to investigate why and what was reported to the bureaus and in turn other lenders also since this has the highest impact on credit scores 35 it 's arguably the most important this is further detailed here which details the public record and late payment effect on your score amounts owed 30 having credit accounts and owing money on them does not necessarily    mean you are a high risk borrower with a low fico ® score however    when a high percentage of a person 's available credit is been used    this can indicate that a person is overextended and is more likely to    make late or missed payments given that this card was closed whatever your credit limit was is now no longer added into your total credit limit however your utilization on that card is gone assuming it gets paid off depending on any other credit lines and since you reported heavy use that could be a positive impact though likely not length of credit history 15 in general a longer credit history will increase your fico ® scores    however even people who have n't been using credit long may have high    fico scores depending on how the rest of the credit report looks depending how old your card was and particularly since this was your only credit card it will likely impact your average age of credit lines depending on other lines of credit loans etc you have open this accounts for about 15 of your score so not as large of an impact as the first two   credit mix in use 10 fico scores will consider your mix of credit cards retail accounts    installment loans finance company accounts and mortgage loans given that this was your only credit card your loan mix has been reduced possibly to none new credit 10 research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period    of time represents a greater risk especially for people who do n't    have a long credit history this focuses on credit inquiries which as you mentioned you will likely have another either re opening this credit card or opening another at some point in the future   regardless paying off the rest of that card is a priority as interest rates on average credit cards are over 13 and often higher source this rate comes into play when not paying the balance in full every month and also as miller suggested i would not utilize a credit card without being able to pay it in full it can often be a dangerous cycle of debt

it 's called extracting consumer surplus basically i have a bunch of movie who have paid a lot for their tickets some of them do n't like popcorn and some do of the people in the latter group there are some who are willing to pay a lot for it that 's partly because i have a select group rich movie and partly because some of these people would be willing to pay more for popcorn with a movie than without if i were just selling popcorn i 'd have to charge a competitive price but i 'm really selling movies which have more than covered my costs rent heat etc so my costs of selling popcorn are less than that of a non movie popcorn seller and i do n't really need to sell it ironically it means that i can take my chances and sell a relatively small amount at a high price thereby maximizing my unit profit i do n't mind having people not buy popcorn because i 've already made my profit from them with the movie from the point of view of the consumer most consumers see popcorn as an afterthought they will seldom   think i can buy popcorn $ 2.00 cheaper at theater a than theater b and there 's a 20 percent chance that i will want to buy popcorn so theater a is 40 cents $ cheaper than theater b. instead most make the decision to buy the popcorn after they 've arrived at theater b because it as impulse item   and even if they do the 40 cents calculation theater b might be selected because other factors convenience location etc outweigh the 40 cent extra cost of popcorn purchased sometimes put another way the cost of popcorn is usually heavily discounted because of its to other facets of the decision

i would personally look at consolidating your debt at a lower interest rate by refinancing your mortgage i would leave any retirement funds alone unless it was absolutely necessary to touch it with no other avenues available however once you have consolidated your debt into the mortgage i would pay more than the minimum amount so that you do n't take too long to pay it off i would put about 50 of the freed up cash flow back into the repayments that way you will be paying more debt off quicker and you will have additional cash flow to help your monthly budget another good point would be to go through your monthly budget to see if there is any expenses you could reduce or eliminate

the price of a company 's stock at any given moment is established by a ratio of buyers to sellers   when the sellers outnumber the buyers at a given price the stock price drops until there are enough people willing to buy the stock to balance the equation again   when there are more people wanting to purchase a stock at a given price than people willing to sell it the stock price rises until there are enough sellers to balance things again   so given this it 's easy to see that a very large fund or collection of very large funds buying or selling could drive the price of a stock in one direction or another because the sheer number of shares they trade can tip the balance one way or another    what 's important to keep in mind though is that the ratio of buyers to sellers at any given moment is determined by market sentiment and speculation   people selling a stock think the price is going down and people buying it think it 's going up and these beliefs are strongly influenced by news coverage and available information relating to the company   so in the case of your company in the example that would be expected to triple in value in the next year if everyone agreed that this was correct then the stock would triple almost instantly   the only reason the stock does n't reach this value instantly is that the market is split between people thinking this is going to happen and people who think it wo n't    over time news coverage and new information will cause one side to appear more correct than the other and the balance will shift to drive the price up or down   all this is to say that yes large funds and their movements can influence a stock 's trading value but their movements are based upon the same news information analysis and sentiment as the rest of the market   meaning that the price of a stock is much more closely tied to news and available information than day to day trading volumes   in short buying good companies at good prices is just as good as it 's ever been    also keep in mind that the fact that you can buy and sell stocks without having a huge impact on price is an advantage that you have   by slipping in or out at the right times in major market movements you can do things that a massive investment fund simply can not

from investopedia   beating the market is a difficult phrase to analyze it can be used    to refer to two different situations 1 an investor portfolio manager fund or other investment specialist    produces a better return than the market average the market average    can be calculated in many ways but usually a benchmark such as the    s&p 500 or the dow jones industrial average index is a good    representation of the market average if your returns exceed the    percentage return of the chosen benchmark you have beaten the market    congrats to learn more read benchmark your returns with indexes 2 a company 's earnings sales or some other valuation metric is    superior to that of other companies in its industry matching the market i would presume will be generating returns equivalent to the index you are comparing your portfolio with if for a sector industry then it would be the returns generated by the sector industry as an index is more or less a of the market as a whole people tend to use an index

has a great answer about dividends generally but to answer your question specifically about yield traps here are a few things that i look for as with everything if it looks too good to be true it probably is   a 17 yield is pretty out of this world even for a reit   and i would n't bet on it holding up   compare a company 's yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different standards for what is considered a high or low yield dividends have to come from somewhere and that somewhere is cash flow   look at the company 's financial statements   do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend   have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation   how are earnings holding up   debt levels cash on hand sudden moves in stock price   a sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise   sometimes this indicates a bargain but if the drop is due to a real worry about the company 's financial health see 2 it 's probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming what does their dividend history look like   do they have a consistent track record of paying out good dividends for years and years   companies with a track record of paying dividends consistently and/or increasing their dividend regularly are likely to continue to do so

there are two types of 401(k contributions elective contributions which are the part put in by the employee and nonelective contributions which are the part put in by the company   elective contributions are summed across all the plans she is contributing to   so she can contribute $ 18,000 minus whatever she put in her 403(b additionally she can contribute 20 of the net profit of the company before the elective contributions as nonelective contributions these contributions must be designated as such you will notice that the irs document says 25 but that 's what you can do if her business is incorporated   for a sole proprietorship nonelective contributions   ends up being limited at 20 of profit additionally the sum of these two and her contribution to her 403(b can not exceed $ 53,000 example line 31 of her schedule c is $ 30,000 and she has contributed $ 10,000 to her 403(b maximum contribution to her solo 401(k is $ 18,000 $ 10,000 + 0.2 $ 30,000 = $ 14,000 her total contributions for the year are $ 10,000 from her 403(b plus $ 14,000 in her solo 401(k   this is less than $ 53,000 so this limit does not bind   if she made a ton of 1099 money her contribution maximum would follow the above until it hit $ 53,000 and then it would stop there the irs describes this in detail in publication 560 which also has a worksheet for figuring out your maximum explicitly   it 's unpleasant reading and the worksheets are painful but if you do it right it will end up being as i just described it   using the language of that publication hers is a qualified plan of the defined contribution variety

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

to put a different spin on it suppose you loaned someone $ 100 k expecting that they would pay it back and then a little later they decided not too they are perfectly capable of paying back the money but just decided they did n't want to and it seems the laws of your state said you could n't make them how would you feel about that since this is supposed to be an answer to the question the answer is only if you ca n't afford to repay it that 's what foreclosure is supposed to be about not you deciding you would rather not pay your debts let 's not forget who pays that bill for you every one of your bank 's other customers edit for the people the moral aspect and saying it 's perfectly alright because the law says that 's the punishment and i 'm willing to pay it the law also says if you kill someone you go to prison for life does that mean that someone who decides they are going to kill someone has a perfect right to do it as long as they are prepared to take the consequences

step 2 is wrong leverage is not necessary it increases possible gain but increases risk of loss by essentially the same amount those two numbers are pretty tightly linked by market forces see many many other answers here showing that one can earn market rate 8 or so with far less risk and effort if one is patient and some evidence that one can do better with more effort and not too much more risk and yes investing for a longer time horizon is also safer

this seems like a huge advantage for a roth to the point where i ca n't    figure out why anyone would choose a traditional you are missing something called the time value of money this is the concept that a certain amount of money now has the same value as a bigger amount of money later basically you would n't be willing to give up an amount of money now and get the same amount of money later you need to get a larger amount later to be willing to exchange it for a certain amount now so that larger amount later has the same value to you than that smaller amount now this is the idea behind interest and investment returns when you make an investment and it earns interest or gains over a period of time in effect that final amount of money principal + interest has the same value as the principal when you started because that final amount was grown from the original principal so whether you are taxed on the principal in the beginning as in roth ira or on the principal + interest at the end as in traditional ira you are still taxed on the same value of money and if the tax rates are the same between now and in the future then you pay the same value in taxes in both cases roth would only be better than traditional if the tax rates are lower now than when you take it out and traditional would only be better than roth if the tax rates are higher now than when you take it out let 's consider a simple example to demonstrate that the two are equivalent if the tax rates assuming a flat tax because tax brackets introduce other complications are the same now and when you take it out in both cases you start with $ 1000 pre tax wages you invest it for 10 years in a place with guaranteed 5 returns per year adn then take it out there are no penalties for withdrawal and there is a flat 25 tax now and in the future note that you are left with the same amount of money in both cases this arises from the of multiplication note that roth ira has a higher effective limit than traditional ira because the nominal limit is the same for both but roth is post tax so if you contribute to near the limit where traditional can no longer match the value that roth can contribute then the comparison no longer applies the $ 1000 in this example is below the limit for both

diversifying your portfolio between asset a and asset b only reduces the portfolio risk if asset a and asset b are not correlated if they have either a low correlation or a negative correlation to each other then you benefit from combining them in a portfolio in terms of risk reduction the standard deviation of returns will be lower in a portfolio of low or uncorrelated assets if on the other hand you combine two correlated assets into a portfolio you are doubling down on the same assumption which means you are not reducing your risk you are also wasting capital because now you have allocated capital to 2 separate trades investments yet they have shown a high tendency of moving together here is an article that discusses this further why diversify your stock portfolio

i do n't buy new cars anymore but i 've helped family members negotiate prices on new cars recently there are various online services to see the average price paid as well as the low outliers i 've looked at for instance to see what others have paid within 50 miles of my zip code i think the only way for you to know you 're being offered a good deal is to see if any of the other dealers that have not responded are willing to talk when you offer them $ which the dealer above suggested was break even point if none of them respond then you know you 're really at the bottom of the negotiating window if one of them does respond then you can go back to that internet sales manager and ask why another dealership do not disclose which one is willing to sell it to you for less than $ do not disclose how much lower they offered to sell it for   in my experience most dealers will sell at or just below the break even price at the end of the quarter so that they can beat other dealerships out for the quota that gives you a week and a half to find the bottom price before going in on new years eve to seal the deal

here are three key factors that you do not explicitly state so while i can not say exactly why the tax law is the way it is i can infer that it encourages long term investments rather than short term which would seem to be a good thing for society overall   the fast that capital gains are taxed at all somewhat discourages cashing out investments although i suspect it 's more of a nuisance factor the cash received is likely more on an incentive that the tax is a disincentive

to try to answer the three explicit questions every share of stock is treated proportionately each share is assigned the same dollar amount of investment part of the contribution in the example and has the same discount amount 15 of $ 20 or $ 25 depending on when you sell usually so if you immediately sell 120 shares at $ 25 you have taxable income on the gain for those shares either selling immediately or holding for the long term period 12 18 mo can be advantageous just in different ways    selling immediately avoids a risk of a decline in the price of the stock and allows you to invest elsewhere and earn income on the proceeds for the next 12 18 months that you would not otherwise have had   the downside is that all of your gain $ per share is taxed as ordinary income    holding for the full period is advantageous in that only the discount 15 of $ 20 or $ 25 will be taxed as ordinary income and the rest of the gain sell price minus $ 20 or $ 25 will be taxed at long term capital gain tax rates which generally are lower than ordinary rates all taxes are due in the year you do sell   the catch is you will sell at different price higher or lower and thus have a risk of loss or gain you will never be federally double taxed in any scenario   the $ 3000 you put in will not be taxed after all is sold as it is a return of your capital investment   all money you receive in excess of the $ 3000 will be taxed in all scenarios just potentially at different rates ordinary or capital gain   all this ignores amt considerations which you likely are not subject to

close warning i may be off a bit here i 'm sure someone will correct me if so traditional 401k or ira money goes in pre tax so yes you avoid paying tax on it now grows untaxed taxes are due when you retire and start taking money back out of the account but your income including these withdrawals is likely to be lower than your peak earning years so your tax rate will be lower you do n't avoid all the tax but you delay it and hopefully reduce it and by doing so there 's more money in your account earning returns roth 401k or ira money goes in after taxes you do pay income tax now however all returns on the money are untaxed i believe and you pay no tax when you 're eligible to withdraw the funds   either or both kinds of 401k may be eligible for some percentage of matching funds from your employer there are some incentives for them to offer this benefit i believe that even if you 're doing a roth 401k the matching funds legally have to go in as traditional plan and yes as that implies it is possible to split your contribution between the two styles note the matching funds are free money if your plan offers a match it is highly recommended that you contribute enough to your 401k to capture the maximum match

if you invest in a 401(k the shares in that plan are yours for as long as you live or until you pull them out so if the employer is offering any sort of matching and those matched funds remain yours after you leave then definitely contribute that 's an immediate return on your money if the employer is not matching funds then usually it is better to contribute to an ira instead you get the same income tax benefits from the deduction without the headaches of going through your company or the company from 3 jobs ago or whoever bought them to get to your money if i were in your position the most i personally would do after i quit the company which i 'm assuming you 'd be doing if you were going back to your country of origin would be to have the 401k shares rolled over into a traditional ira that way i 'd have more control over it from outside the country just keep the bank holding your ira of your movements around the world and how they can get ahold of you it may be wise to grant a limited power of attorney to someone who will be staying in the u.s. if you do n't want the bank mailing your statements all around the world and the money can stay in an american account while you do whatever you have to outside it as long as you do n't take the money out in cash before you 're 59 1/2 years old you do n't need to pay taxes or penalties on it if you were to need it to cover unexpected expenses perhaps relating to the aforementioned family emergency then that decision can be made at that time if you think that 's even remotely likely you may consider a roth ira with a roth you pay the income taxes on your contributions but the money is then yours you can withdraw anything up to the total amount of your contributions without any additional taxes or penalties and once you hit 59 and a half the interest also becomes available also and free so if you had to leave the country and take a lot of cash with you you could get out everything you actually put into a roth with only minor if any transaction fees and the interest will still be there compounding

there is little difference between buying shares in your broker 's index fund and shares of their corresponding etf   in many cases the money invested in an etf gets essentially stuffed right into the index fund i believe vanguard does this for example   in either case you will be paying a little bit of tax   in the etf case it will be on the dividends that are paid out   in the index fund case it will additionally be on the capital gains that have been realized within the fund which are very few for an index fund   not a ton in either case   the more important tax consideration is between purchase and sale which is the same in either case i 'd say stick it wherever the lowest fees are

you have to balance several concerns here the primary problem is that if you go to the effort of saving your money you want to also be sure that your savings will not lose too much of its value to inflation ukraine had a terrible inflation spike in 2015 for obvious reasons even as inflation has settled down in 2016 it is stabilizing around 12 which is very high   exchange rates are your next concern if you lose a large percentage of the value of your money just in the process of exchanging it that also eats away at the value of your money if you accept the us federal reserve target of 2 inflation then you should only exchange money that you will hold long enough that both exchange fees will outweigh the 10 inflation advantage even in cases where you have placed your money in a foreign currency there 's a chance that your government could freeze accounts denominated in foreign currencies so there 's always the political risk that you have to factor in for that reason keeping foreign currency in cash also has some appeal because it can not be confiscated as easily you could still certainly be robbed so keeping all of your savings in cash is n't a great solution either all in all you are diversifying your savings if you use the strategy of balancing all three methods splitting it evenly to 5 for each method is n't the most important i would suggest taking advantage of good exchange rates as they appear to time when you buy foreign currency

i am in a different situation because i earn more than i spend but i have found that i need to make the money inaccessible if i want to really avoid spending it   i used to just throw my paychecks into a high yield savings account but eventually the balance was large enough that a large purchase did n't seem like that much because i would have had so much left in the account after the purchase   it was way too easy for me to spend way too much now i invest my savings automatically   the obvious benefit is my money has a much higher growth rate than a simple savings account especially with fed interest rates so low   i invest most of my savings in retirement accounts where there are severe penalties for withdrawing prior to retirement age   then i invest a significant portion to a regular brokerage account where the money is invested in stock and bond funds   this money is accessible within a few days of whenever i need it   the remainder of my savings goes into a savings account as cash i can get to at any time   all 3 accounts grow with every paycheck market fluctuations aside    this system helps me to categorize my savings as never ever touch retirement accounts touch only if i can wait 3 days and am willing to pay taxes brokerage account or touch whenever you need it with no penalties savings account   if my savings account grows too much i 'll move money from there to the brokerage account where it has more growth potential   the longer my money is invested in the brokerage accounts the less taxes i 'll need to pay when i sell withdraw the funds so that 's even more incentive for me to keep those funds where they are i have credit cards so in my opinion having to wait 3 days for funds from my investment account to become accessible is considered accessible in an emergency because my credit cards can be used to cover a large purchase for 3 days and as long as i pay it off within the grace period there 's no interest charged tl;dr investing is probably the smartest way to both grow your money and prevent the urge to spend it right away   my advice is to start with a 401(k or ira as soon as you can since the younger you are the more time until retirement that your money has to compound   investing $ 100 more a month can mean hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in your account when you 're ready to retire

you should definately have a stop loss in place to manage your risk for a time frame of 5 to 10 years i would be looking at a trailing stop loss of 20 to 25 off the recent high   another type of stop you could use is a volatility stop here the more volatile the stock the larger the stop whilst the less volatile the stock the smaller the stop you could use 3 or 4 x weekly average true range to achieve this the reason you should always use a stop loss is because of what can happen and what did happen in 2008 some stock markets have yet to fully recover from their peaks at the end of 2007 almost 9 years later what would you do if you were planning to hold your positions for 5 years and then withdrawal your funds at the end of june 2021 for a particular purpose and suddenly in february 2021 the market starts to fall by the time june comes the market has fallen by over 50 and you do n't have enough funds available for the purpose you planned for instead if you were using a trailing stop loss you would manage to keep at least 75 of the peak of your portfolio you could even spend 10 minutes each week to monitor your portfolio for warning signs that a downtrend may be around the corner and adjust your trailing stop to maybe 10 in these situations protecting 90 of the peak of your portfolio if the downtrend does not you can adjust your trailing back to a higher percentage if you do get stopped out and shortly after the market recovers then you can always buy back in or look for other stocks and etfs to replace them sure you might lose a bit of profits if this happens but it should always be part of your investment plan and risk management how you will handle these situation if you are not using stop losses risk management and money management you are essentially gambling if you say i am going to buy these stocks and etfs hold them for 10 years and then sell them then you are just hoping to make gains which is essentially gambling

relative strength indicators are also trailing indicators   they are based on the number of recent or in an investment 's price   the size of a tick is and related to the investment 's price   by the time enough have accumulated to generate a buy signal the investment has already increased in price significantly   similarly by the time enough have accumulated a to generate a sell signal the investment has already dropped in price significantly the theory of relative strength indicators is based on the hope that moves found by these indicators are likely to continue after the signal is generated   but even if this is the case someone who relies on these indicators will miss out on the first part of the move wright offers investment research based on the theory of relative strength indicators   they offer investment vehicles based on this research   they also work with local investment advisors to develop custom back tested strategies   they have published a white paper with references to others research

it 's very straightforward for an honest vendor to refund the charge and the transaction only costs him a few pennies at most   if you initiate a chargeback the merchant is immediately charged an irreversible fee of about $ 20 simply as an administrative fee   he 'll also have to refund the charge if it 's reversed   to an honest merchant who would've happily refunded you it 's unfair and   in any case now that he 's out of pocket on the administrative fee his best bet is to fight the chargeback since he 's already paid for the privilege to fight also a chargeback is a strike against the merchant   if his chargeback rate is higher than the norm in his industry they may raise his fees or ban him entirely from taking visa mc   for a small merchant doing a small volume a single chargeback can have an impact on his overall chargeback rate   the threshold of proof for a chargeback varies by patterns of fraud and the merchant 's ability to recover   if you bought something readily fungible to cash like a gift card casino chips concert tickets etc forget it   likewise if   you already extracted the value last month 's netflix bill   credit card chargeback only withdraws a payment method   your bill is still due and payable the merchant is within his rights to dun you for payment and send you to collections or court   most merchants do n't bother because they know it 'll be a fight an unpleasant distraction and bad for business   but they 'd be within their rights   working with the merchant to settle the matter is a final resolution

gt thank you for the wealth of information   sure i hope my opinions are food for thought   gt 1 does that basically translate to less tax on poor wealthy to promote entrepreneurship   no your typical entrepreneur is a smart disgruntled employee who thinks they have a better way to do a job   if you want more entrepreneurs you should do things to help them succeed in a new company and minimize the risk   some ways to do this   create a government agency that offers programs that help new companies   guidance and funding are obvious candidates   advertising for small local business would help too   one of the most important would be getting talent together because a start up needs the talents of at least four different people to have a good chance of succeeding   establish guaranteed health care   a with a wife and kids may have a great idea but ca n't risk to leave his family with no health insurance for the two years it would take to get his idea off the ground   better enforce anti trust law   i believe small companies are stifled by big companies because the latter control too much of the market   if you want competitive markets you need to either break up or and monitor the big players   create a better safety net   it is a lot easier to go on your own if you know at least you wo n't starve   gt 2 rich using money to grow their own wealth but would n't that mean as a byproduct jobs will be made   in theory yes but i believe in practice the opposite happens   big companies can make significantly more money hoarding their market share rather than branching into new markets   here 's a true story of my last company with names changed   company a makes widgets   company b makes bookkeeping software for tracking widgets and is very successful controlling a majority of the market   company a buys company b at an inflated price   the government allows the sale on the condition that company a does not use company b 's information on the widget market to gain an unfair advantage   company a agrees and the buyout takes place   company a then approaches all of company b 's customers and says let us look at the data on your bookkeeping software and we will give you a 5 discount   most customers agree so company a now has all the data controlled by company b but this is not illegal because they got it from company b 's customers not company b.   company a proceeds to undercut the market because it now knows exactly how much their competitors widgets sell for   company a now controls a majority of the widget market and their market share continues to grow rapidly   by the way here is that bloomberg article i described earlier about repatriation being about articles/2017 05 of tax repatriation is better than the reality   gt;&gt   take home money is used for investment it is n't   gt 3 i do n't think i understand this one at all will you rephrase it for me   the argument is that we need to tax corporations less so they can invest more   here 's the problem investments are not taxed   a corporation 's tax is a percentage of their gross income minus their expenses   investment is an expense   therefore the more they invest the lower their tax bill   if you want companies to invest more raise their tax rate   gt 4 i did hear from my professor and the educational videos he had shown us that the capital tax is one of the highest among the other oecd nations   i need to walk back what i said earlier   the us corporate tax rate is one of the highest   does that mean us corporations pay the most tax   well it 's check does the u s have the highest corporate tax rate in the world   gt why ca n't we just close loop holes instead of choosing to slash capital tax   note that those go in opposite directions   closing loopholes would make companies pay more   slashing capital tax would have them pay less   perhaps doing both would be revenue neutral   i would be in support of that because i suspect loopholes benefit big companies a lot more than small ones because they have the resources to find and exploit those loopholes   that said people in power have been talking for 20 years about closing the loopholes   they never do   gray has an excellent video explaining why these loopholes are not going anywhere anytime watch?v =   gt 5 i think it 's in each company 's best interest to further their own agenda and that agenda usually means bad for the majority   yes that 's a much better way of saying what i meant   gt thank you in advance for your time   sure thanks for thinking asking questions and making up your own mind

you have a few options option 1 leave the money where it is if your balance is over $ 5k you should be able to leave the money in your former employer 's 401(k the money will stay there and continue to be invested in the funds that you elect to invest in you should at the very least be receiving quarterly statements for the account even better you should have access to some type of an online account where you can transfer your investments rebalance your account conform to target etc if you do not have online account access than i 'm sure you can still transfer investments and make trades via a paper form just reach out to the 401(k tpa or recordkeeper that administers your plan their contact info is on the quarterly statements you should be receiving option 2 rollover the money into your current employer 's 401(k plan this is the option that i tend to recommend the most roll the money over into your current employer 's 401(k plan this way all the money is in the same place and is invested in the funds that you elect let 's say you wanted to transfer your investments to a new fund lineup right now you have to fill out the paperwork or go through the online process twice for both accounts moving the money to your current employer 's plan and having all the money in the same place eliminates this redundancy and allows you to make one simple transfer of all your assets option 3 roll the money from your former employer 's plan into an ira this is a cool option because now you have a new ira with a new set of dollar limits you can roll the money into a separate ira and contribute an additional $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 if you are 50 + years of age so this is cool because it gives you a chance to save even more for retirement many ira companies give you a sign on bonus where if you rollover your former employers they will give you a bonus typically a few hundred bucks but hey its free money other things to note take a look at your plan document from your former employer 's 401(k plan take a look at the fees compare the fees to your current employer 's plan there could be a chance that the fees from your former employer 's plan are much higher than your current employer so this would just be yet another reason to move the money to your current employer 's plan do n't forget you most likely have a financial advisor that oversees your current employer 's 401(k plan this financial advisor also probably takes fees from your account so use his services you are probably already paying for it talk to your hr at your employer and ask who the investment advisor is call the advisor and set up an appointment to talk about your retirement and financial goals ask him for his advice its always nice talking to someone with experience face to face good luck with everything

your analysis is not comparing apples to apples which is why it looks like investing money in a non qualified account is better than a 401k traditional or roth   for the non qual you are using post tax dollars money that has already been taxed now on top of that original tax you are also going to pay capital gains tax for any growth plus dividend rates for any dividends it throws off   for the 401k let 's assume for the moment that $ 10,000 is invested in a traditional and that the marginal tax rate is always 20 and for growth let 's assume 10x with a traditional your money will grow to $ 100,000 and then the irs gets $ 20,000 as you pull the money out the result is a net 80,000 for you   for a roth 401k it is taxed first so only $ 8,000 gets invested this then grows by the same multiplier to $ 80,000 until you consider changing tax rates the roth and traditional give the same growth of money considering the non qual option like with the roth we only have $ 8,000 to invest however in this case you will not realize the full 10x growth as you will have to pay taxes on $ 72,000 these are taxes that the 401ks and also iras do not pay there are other reasons to consider non qual over maxing out your 401k liquidity quality of investments and fees being some of those but the capital gains rate vs. ordinary income rate is not one as the money in the non qual still has to go through that ordinary income tax first before it is available to even invest

a loan is most generally a liability a part of the balance sheet   expenses income are part of the income statement   income is the net of revenues after expenses the interest is an expense on the income statement but the loan itself does not reside there unless if it is defaulted and forgiven   then it would become a revenue or contra expense depending on the methodology the original purpose of the income statement is to show the net inflows of short term operational accruals which would exclude new borrowing and repaid loans the cash flow statement will better show each cash event such as borrowing debt repaying debt or paying off a bill to show how a loan may have funded a bill which in theory it directly did not because an entity be it a person or business is like a single tank of water with multiple pipes filling and multiple pipes extracting so it is impossible to know which exact inflow funded which exact outflow unless if there is only one inflow per period and one outflow per the same period that being said with a cash flow statement the new loan will show a cash inflow when booked under the financing portion and paying a bill will show a cash outflow when booked under the operating portion   with only those two transactions booked and an empty balance sheet beforehand it could be determined that a new loan funded a bill payment

the is calculated by taking = dividing this number by 100 gives you the answer 100 = when dealing with it 's important to remember the relationship between a decimal and a percent 1 = .01 to return .01 to a percent you must multiple that number by 100   so .01 x 100 = 1 in order to get a decimal from a percent which is what is used in calculations you must divide by 100 so here if we are trying to calculate how much interest you are paying each month we can do this = $ interest you will pay that year if the principal balance never changed 12 = now month two = 12 = in order to get your monthly payments which wo n't change for the life of the loan you can use this formula monthly payment = where   interest rate remember if calculating monthly to do present value of loan n = time of loan in your case 36 since we are talking monthly and 12 3 = 36 from here we get = $ when rounding is $ as far as actual applied interest rate i 'm not even sure what that number is but i would like to know once you figure out since the interest rate you 're being charged is most definitely

unless a study accounts for whether the users are following a budget or not it is irrelevant to those who are trying to take their personal finances seriously i can certainly believe that those who have no budget will spend more on a credit card than they will on a debit card or with cash under the right circumstances spending with cards can actually be a tool to track and reduce spending if you can see on a monthly and yearly basis where all of your money was spent you have the information to make decisions about the small expenses that add up as well as the obvious large expenses   debit cards and credit cards offer the same advantage of giving you an electronic record of all of your transactions but debit cards do not come with the same fraud protection that credit cards have so i and many people like me prefer to use credit cards for security reasons alone cash back and other rewards points bolster the case for credit cards over debit cards it is very possible to track all of your spending with cash but it is also more work the frustration of accounting for bad and every transaction multiple times is worth discussing too as a reason that people get discouraged and give up on budgeting my point is simply that credit cards and the electronic records that they generate can greatly simplify the process of tracking your spending i doubt any study out there accounts for the people who are specifically using those benefits and what effect it has on their spending

in short if your expenses rise with inflation but your income does not your expenses will eventually exceed your income as the article on perpetuities says a perpetuity is an annuity that pays forever   an annuity is a financial arrangement whereby you are paid a fixed sum every so often for a period of time   hence a perpetuity is an arrangement whereby you are paid a fixed sum every so often until you die   since the sum is fixed in nominal dollars or other currency units it will become worth less and less in real dollars as time goes on which is what will erode your financial independence to adapt the example from the article that you quote if you buy an annuity that will pay you $ 101 per month and your expenses are $ 100 per month you may seem to be financially independent   however if inflation is 2 per year then next year your expenses will be $ 102 but the annuity will still only pay you $ 100   at that point you will no longer be financially independent since the annuity no longer covers your expenses there are some senses in which the article 's statement is inaccurate in practical terms e.g. annuities need not always have fixed payments but may be adjusted for inflation also there are n't many real perpetuities in existence anyway and plus it does n't matter whether the source of the income is an annuity or something else but that is the gist of what the article is saying

good question here are some possible answers its a good idea there is probably some validity to the and having money invested generally speaking has proven far more valuable than having it sit in a savings account it tends to reinforce strength suppose you own two stocks one that is a great performer and one that is n't   generally speaking the high performer will pay out more and if you reinvest more into that stock you will be wealthier if you contributed equally to both stocks you might forget people tend to forget to do things that are not in the forefront and reinvestment is one of those things that slip people 's mind   one of the wealth building tools that people universally recommend is automation   reinvesting is a way to automate one aspect of one 's financial life    you might spend it on something else if you put the dividends into your checking account there is a non zero chance that it might get put towards something else   better to have it out of sight and mind and invested they make money generally speaking the more money you have in a brokerage account the more the brokerage makes    so it is good for them as well as yourself while there is some attraction to being able to see a balance that is the result of dividend investments its just far better to have them be poured right back into whatever investment seem appropriate

answering for just the us part yes you should be able to do this and it 's a good strategy the only additional gotcha i can think of is that if you 've made after tax contributions to your traditional ira you need to prorate the conversion you ca n't just convert all the pre tax or all the after tax i 'm not familiar with oregon personal income tax so there may be additional gotchas there

take as many practice exams as possible get used to testing your sanity sitting for an extended period of time i just passed last month using kaplan    the class instructor will give you tips remember them and practice writing down your dump sheet which is any formulas or diagrams that might help you i included the bond inverse relationship the options chart and balance sheet    when i took the test there were a ton of questions on bonds options and annuities though yours could be very different i did n't have too much math   most importantly focus on the actual concepts more so than memorizing the correct answers to the practice tests    maybe check out series 7 for dummies it helped me understand options overnight    relax you got this
