not really the lender is not buying the stock back at a lower price remember he already owns it so he need not buy it again the person losing is the one from whom the short seller buys back the stock provided that person bought the stock at higher price   so if b borrowed from and sold it to c and later b purchased it back from c at a lower price then b made profit c made loss and a made nothing

michael gave a good answer describing the transaction but i wanted to follow up on your questions about the lender first the lender does charge interest on the borrowed securities the amount of interest can vary based on a number of factors such as who is borrowing how much are they borrowing and what stock are they trying to borrow   occasionally when you are trying to short a stock you will get an error that it is hard to borrow this could be for a few reasons such as there are already a large amount of people who have shorted your broker 's shares or your broker never acquired the shares to begin with which usually only happens on very small stocks in both cases the broker lender does nt have enough shares and may be unwilling to get more in that way they are discriminating on what they lend if a company is about to go bankrupt and a lender does nt have any more shares to lend out it is unlikely they will purchase more as they stand to lose a lot and gain very little   it might seem like lending is a risky business but think of it as occurring over decades and not months general motors had been around for 100 years before it went bankrupt so any lender who had owned and been lending out gm shares for a fraction of that time likely still profited   also this is all very simplified joetaxpayer alluded to this in the comments but in actuality who is lending stock or even who owns stock is much more complicated and probably does nt need to be explained here i just wanted to show in this over simplified explanation that lending is not as risky as it may first seem

the correct answer to this question is   the person who the short sells the stock to here 's why this is the case   say we have a who owns the stock and lends it to b who then sells it short to c. after this the price drops and b buys the stock back from d and returns it to a. the outcome for a is neutral   typically stock that is sold short must be held in a margin account the broker can borrow the shares from a collect interest from b and a has no idea this is going on because the shares are held in a street name the brokerage 's name and not a. if a decides during this period to sell the transaction will occur immediately and the brokerage must shuffle things around so the shares can be delivered   if this is going to be difficult then the cost for borrowing shares becomes very high the outcome for b is obviously a profit they sold high first and bought back low afterwards this leaves either c or d as having lost this money   why is n't it d one way of looking at this is that the profit to b comes from the difference in the price from selling to c and buying from d.   d is sitting on the low end and thus is not paying out the profit   d bought low compared to c and this did not lose any money so c is the only remaining choice another way of looking at it is that c actually lost all the money when purchasing the stock   after all all the money went directly from c to b.   in return c got some stock with the hope that in the future c could sell it for more than was paid for it   but c literally gave the money to b so how could anybody else pay the loss another way of looking at it is that c buys a stock which then decreases in value   c is thus now sitting on a loss   the fact that it is currently only a paper loss makes this less obvious if the stock were to recover to the price c bought at one might conclude that c did not lose the money to b.   however in this same scenario d also makes money that c could have made had c bought at d 's price proving that c really did lose the money to b. the final way of seeing that the answer is c is to consider what happens when somebody sells a stock which they already hold but the price goes up who did they lose out on the gain to   the person again is who bought their stock   the person would buys the stock is always the person who the gain goes to when the price appreciates or the loss comes out of if the price falls

i do n't know the legal framework for rsus so i 'm not sure what is mandatory and what is chosen by the company issuing them i recently reviewed one companies offering and it basically looked like a flat purchase of stock on the vest date so even if i got a shares for $ 1 granted to me if it was 100 shares that vested at $ 100 on the 1st then i would owe tax on the market value on the day of vest further the company would withhold 25 of the vest for federal taxes and 10 for state taxes if i lived in a state with income tax the withholding rate was flat regardless of what my actual tax rate was capital gains on the change from the market value on the vest date was calculated as short term or long term based on the time since the vest date so if my 100 shares went up to $ 120 i would pay the $ 20 difference as short term or long term based on how long i had owned them since the vest that said i do n't know if this is universal your hr folks should be able to help answer at least some of these questions though i know their favorite response when they do n't know is that you should consult a tax professional good luck

it 's not a bad strategy i 'd rather owe money at 4 interest than at 6 7 however there is something to consider   consolidating debt into a new loan can backfire when you have money borrowed at 7 you want to get that paid off as quickly as possible once you have that converted to 4 if you think now i can take my time paying off this debt then you are n't really better off in fact if you take too long paying off the new loan you might end up paying more interest than if you had kept the high interest loan and paid it as soon as possible do n't lose your drive to get out of debt after you refinance   as far as how the student loans affect your debt to income ratio i 'm not sure however if they do count i think they do your ratio will not really be going up by taking out the new loan since you are using the money to pay other debt make sure the new lender knows this so they take that into consideration when making their decision   overall i like your strategy pay off what you can right away the car loan and the highest interest student loans and reduce the interest on the rest just make sure that you continue to pay down that debt as quick as you can

you did n't mention a country and precise rules will be different from country to country the usual rules are   shares that you did n't sell do n't count if you buy shares there is no taxable gain until you sell them   when you sell shares it is assumed that the shares you are selling are the last ones that you bought   in many places if you sell shares and buy the same shares back very quickly the tax office may have rules to pretend you never sold the shares for example in the uk where a good amount of profit per year is tax free you ca n't just sell enough shares to stay below your tax limit and then buy them back to take profits out of the shares you own   in your case you made $ 30 profit on every share you sold and that is what you will be taxed for in most countries according to the rules of your country

there are two reasons you would get a higher yield for savings accounts either because it is not guaranteed by a national deposit insurance fund i presume in canada or you have to hold it for a longer term money market accounts are insured in the u.s. and are also very liquid since you can debit from it any time because of this they offer much lower rates of interest than comparable products   if you look at the savings products such as the 1.50 momentum savings account offered by scotiabank you actually have to hold a $ 5000 balance and not make any debit from it for 90 days in order to get the extra 0.75 that would get you to 1.50 essentially this is roughly equivalent to offering you a 1.50 gic with a 0.75 withdrawal penalty fee but simply presented in more positive terms as for the financial financial 1.75 offering it looks like it is not insured by the

here in the u.s. a realtor can act as a seller 's agent or a buyer 's agent i think what you are calling a broker in the u.s. we call a buyer 's agent and this may just be a difference in terminology from your post it sounds like the concept is the same i am answering from a u.s. perspective please let me know if something does n't make sense in the israeli context here each typically gets 3 to 3.5 of the sale price at least in my part of the country so yes the buyer 's agent has an incentive to get a higher price even though this is contrary to the interests of the person he is supposed to represent on the other hand the buyer 's agent has a strong incentive to find a house at a price that you consider acceptable if the absolute most you are willing to pay is say and he keeps showing you houses that cost he 's just wasting his time he 's wasting your time too of course but let 's assume he does n't care about that i do n't know what housing prices are in israel today just making up numbers suppose he has two houses that he can show you one in your price range and one not if he shows you the first you may buy it and we will very quickly get his commission if he shows you the second you probably wo n't buy it and he 'll get zero if he keeps showing you houses above your price range he 's doing a bunch of work for which he will never be paid the worst case from your point of view is if you 're thinking that you 're expecting and prepared to pay say to and you tell the broker that his incentive is to concentrate on the upper end maybe even push it a little but still if he shows a house that 's well within your range so you 'll quickly buy he can get today versus trying to push you to go higher so he can maybe get in a few months is the extra worth several months of extra work probably not personally i 've never had a problem with a realtor trying to push me to buy a house more expensive than i said i was prepared to pay at least not that i noticed maybe they were very skillful at it and i did n't realize they were doing it like showing me houses that were totally run down dumps until i decided i was willing to pay more as to your specific suggestion i do n't know if a realtor would be willing to negotiate an alternative deal from their standard contract i 've never tried to do such a thing yes this would give him an incentive to find the lowest possible price arguably this would create a perverse incentive to show you houses of very low quality just because they 're cheap and there would be the problem that he 'd have no incentive to show you houses at or just over your stated maximum as his commission would be zero negative if it goes over slightly what i did on my last house was tell the realtor i want to start by looking at houses costing under if i ca n't find anything i like i 'll go a little higher by not telling the realtor my maximum i discouraged her from immediately going for the maximum at least that was my theory

you normally only pay taxes on the difference between the sale price and the cost basis of the asset in your example you would probably pay taxes on the $ 10 difference not the full sale price of $ 110 if you paid a commission however you would be taxed on your gain minus the commission you paid since you held the asset for less than a year you would n't pay the long term capital gains rate of 20 you 'd be taxed on the capital gain as if it were ordinary income which depends on your federal income tax bracket also littleadv makes a good point about the implications of buying the asset with after tax funds too so that 's another part of the equation to consider as well

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

as has been pointed out one is n't cheaper than the other one may have a lower price per share than the other but that 's not the same thing let 's pretend that the total market valuation of all the stocks within the index was $ 10,000,000 look i said let 's pretend you want to invest $ 1,000 for the time being let 's also pretend that your purchasing 0.01 of all the stock wo n't affect prices anywhere one company splits the index into 10,000 parts worth $ 1,000 each the other splits the same index into 10,000,000 parts worth $ 1 each both track the underlying index perfectly if you invest $ 1,000 with the first company you get one part if you invest $ 1,000 with the second you get 1,000 parts ignoring spreads transaction fees and the like immediately after the purchase both are worth exactly $ 1,000 to you now suppose the index goes up 2 the first company 's shares of the index of which you would have exactly one are now worth $ each and the second company 's shares of the index of which you would have exactly 1,000 are worth $ 1.02 each in each case you now have index shares valued at $ for a 2 increase $ $ 1,000 = 1.02 = 102 of your original investment as you can see there is no reason to look at the price per share unless you have to buy in terms of whole shares which is common in the stock market but not necessarily common at all in mutual funds because in this case both funds track the same underlying index there is no real reason to purchase one rather than the other because you believe they will perform differently in an ideal world the two will perform exactly equally the way to compare the price of mutual funds is to look at the expense ratio the lower the expense ratio is the cheaper the fund is and the less of your money is being eroded every day in fees unless you have some very good reason to do differently that is how you should compare the price of any investment vehicles that track the same underlying commodity in this case the s&p 500

first you need to ensure that you are not violating any federal child labor laws i would look at this u.s. dept of labor wage hour div standards for and 15-year olds in employment these were the items that to federal law for 14 year olds 14 is the minimum age for employment in specified occupations outside    of school hours for limited periods of time each day and each week    and 15-year olds may not be employed there is a section on minimum allowed wage payment to young workers and also a list of allowed types of work for 14 and 15 year old 's the type of household helper tasks described definitely fell within what was allowed for child labor the same page details what sort of forms need to be filled out i think this is something that is done quite commonly here are specifics in new york state for minimum wage for minors and for employing 14 year olds

neither party gives an f about the consumer    the real issue is class action lawsuits in which the consumer gets shafted and the lawyers make a killing    real class action reform would not come in the form of favoring arbitration over lawsuits or vice versa but in requiring that fees in class action suits be paid in the same form as the payment to consumers and requiring that people opt in to join a class rather than having to actively opt out ending payment of fees in cash but consumers getting coupons which are only good one buys more of the alleged wrong doing products services would ensure consumers get a fair shake   this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most democrats and many republicans would never support it requiring people to opt in to class action suits rather than go through a long process of opting out would reduce the number of frivolous class action suits   again this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most of our politicians would n’t support it in short it comes down to most democrats favoring the lawyer lobby over the business lobby and most republicans favoring the opposite neither cares about the consumer citizen

aside from the calculations of how much you save through reducing interest you have two different types of loan here   the house that is mortgaged is not a wasting asset you can reasonably expect that in 2045 it will have retained its worth measured in houses against the other houses in the same neighbourhood in money terms it is likely to be worth more than its current value if only because of inflation to judge the real cost or benefit of the mortgage you need to consider those factors you did n't say whether the is a fixed or variable rate but you also need to consider how the rate might compare with inflation in the long term if you have a fixed rate mortgage and inflation rises above in future you are making money from the loan in the long term not losing what you pay in interest on the other hand your car is a wasting asset and your car loans are just a way of paying by installments over the life of the car if there are no penalties for early repayment the obvious choice there is to pay off the highest interest rates first you might also want to consider what happens if you need to get the $ 11,000 back to use for some other unplanned or emergency purpose if you pay it into your mortgage now there is no easy way to get it back before 2045 on the other hand if you pay down your car loans most likely you now have a car that is worth more than the loans on it in an emergency you could sell the car and recover at least some of the $ 11,000 of course you should keep enough cash available to cover normal emergencies without having to take this sort of action but abnormal emergencies do sometimes happen

depending on your location you might have a lot of options to choose from to mitigate your tax burden there might even be a possibility of combining a few options to make a buck or two off of it as someone already mentioned check out conservation easements and reits they can be great ways of your burden another option that i know is available in a number of states is land use tax qualifications that allow for significantly reduced tax rates based on the current zoning use of the land as a timber may not plan on harvesting the timber but you can potentially still qualify for the reduction is the land appropriately assessed appraised make sure you 're not getting ripped off what are your neighboring paying for taxes i would imagine most locales in and around new england would at least have parcel maps in place talk to your neighbors and find out what they do to minimize their costs if all else fails check out or google earth pro and find out the digs on others with similar land holdings make some cold calls be polite and ask many people especially in the country are happy to oblige a friendly neighbor   what would the definition of pristine be what is the age of the trees furthermore what type of trees comprise the are you open to selective if done properly can actually improve the health of your out what you can do with your comprised of sugar maple or some other resource that might be of persistent value do you want to have the land for the sake of having it or do you want to do anything with it if you 're in a semi urban environment you could converse with local hunting disc golf or other groups that might be interested in utilizing the land these uses could potentially be combined with a conservation easement to improve your outcome in more ways than one   keep in mind often times with conservation easements know everything you want out of the land in the long term once the ink is dry the deal is done take your time think about it do what feels right

the professional financial advisors do have tools which will take a general description of a portfolio and run monte carlo simulations based on the stock market 's historical behavior after about 100 simulation passes they can give a statistical statement about the probable returns the risk involved in that strategy and their confidence in these numbers   note that they do not just use the historical data or individual stocks there 's no way to guarantee that the same historical accidents would have occurred that made one company more successful than another or that they will again past performance is no guarantee of future results but general trends and patterns can be roughly modelled which makes that a good fit for those of us buying index funds less good for those who want to play at a greater level of detail in the hope of doing better but that 's sorta the point to beat market rate of return with the same kind of statistical confidence takes a lot more work

a lot depends on whether your mortgage payments are interest only or repayment and what the remaining term is on each of the mortgages   either way i suspect that the best value for the money you put in will be had by making payments to the larger newer mortgage   this is because the quicker you reduce the capital owed the less interest you will pay over the whole term of the mortgage and you 've already had the older mortgage for sometime unless you so the benefit you can get from an arbitrary reduction in the capital is inevitably less than you will get from the same reduction in the capital of the newer mortgage   even if the two mortgages are the same age then the benefit of putting money into the one on the new house is greater due to the greater interest charged on it

you should pay things off every month   you do n't want to be paying interest if you do n't have to   if you regularly use you card the credit agencies ca n't tell the difference   the way it works is that every month they send the credit agencies your current balance and if you paid the last bill on time   there is nothing that indicates if this is a standing balance or if you charged all of it since the last payment any business that you legitimately owe a debt to can report that to the credit agencies   not all of them do   this includes utilities cell phone companies landlords etc if any of them report overdue items it will show up on your credit report and your credit card company can use that to raise you interest rate some cards will automatically raise you credit limit   they are basically looking to make money fro you   if you often charge near the limit and pay the minimum balance each month they may raise your limit to get you to charge more and pay more interest   you can also call them and ask   they have some internal rules to decide if based on your history with them and your credit history if you are a good risk

you should have drafted a contract of purchase that stipulated out equity stake in the home based of his down payment and yours along with future monthly payments   but morally if the house sells yielding 100,000 profit after fees taxes etc you should get to calculate your cut 20,000 + your total mortgage payments applied to principle 1,900 + his total mortgage payments applied to principle only profit on sale of house after all fees = your cut his would be 1,900 + his total mortgage payments applied to principle only 20,000 + your total mortgage payments applied to principle profit on sale of house after all fees = his cut you 'd then take mortgage payment totals for each and calculate the payments made towards interest and claim the correct amount each of you paid on payments for the mortgage interest deduction when you file your taxes although depending on how the loan is written the banks may issue 1099s which do nt reflect actual payments made talk to an accountant

this is a gross simplification as there are a few different ways to do this the principle overall is the same though to short a stock you borrow x shares from a third party and sell them at the current price you now owe the lender x shares but have the proceeds from the sale if the share price falls you can buy back those shares at the new lower price return them to the lender and pocket the difference the risk comes when the share price goes the other way you now owe the lender the new value of the shares so have to find some way to cover the difference this happened a while back when porsche made a fortune buying shares in volkswagen from short sellers and the price unexpectedly rose

do n't start by investing in a few individual companies this is risky want an example i 'm thinking of a big company say $ 120 billion or so a household name and good consistent dividends to boot they were doing fairly well and were generally busy trying to convince people that they were looking to the future with new environmentally friendly technologies then they went and spilled a bunch of oil into the gulf of mexico yes it was n't a pretty picture if bp was one of five companies in your portfolio that day things would look a lot better if they were one of 500 or 5000 companies though so first aim for diversification via mutual funds or etfs i personally think you should probably start with the mutual funds you avoid trading fees for one thing it 's also easier to fit medium sized dollar amounts into funds than into etfs even if you do get fee free etf trading etfs can get you better expense ratios but the less money you have invested the less important that is once you have a decent sized portfolio tens of thousands of dollars or so then you can begin to consider holding stocks of individual companies take note of fees including trading fees commissions if you buy $ 2000 worth of stock and pay a $ 20 commission you 're already down 1 if you 're holding a mutual fund or etf look at the expense ratio the annualized real return on the stock market is about 4 a real return is after adjusting for inflation if your fee is 1 that 's about a quarter of your earnings which is huge and while it 's easy for a mutual fund to outperform the market by 1 from time to time it 's really really hard to do it consistently once you 're looking at individual companies you should do a lot of obnoxious boring stupid research and do n't just buy the stock on the strength of its brand name you 'll be interested in a couple of metrics the main one is probably the p e ratio price earnings if you take the inverse of this you 'll get the rate at which your investment is making you money e.g. a p e of 20 is 5 a p e of 10 is 10 all else being equal a lower p e is a good thing it means that you 're buying the company 's income really cheap however all else is seldom equal if a stock is going for really cheap it 's usually because investors do n't think that it 's got much of a future earnings are not always consistent there are a lot of other measures like beta correlation to the market overall riskier volatile stocks have higher numbers gross margins price to unleveraged free cash flow and stuff like that again do the boring research otherwise you 're just playing games with your money

so many complicated answers for a straight forward question first to this point i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund an ira can be invested in a mutual fund   the ira benefit over standard mutual fund is pre tax contribution lowering your current tax liability the advantage of an ira over a 401k is control   your employer controls where the 401k is invested you control where your ira is invested   often employers have a very small number of options because this keeps their costs with the brokerage low 401k is amazing if you have employer matched contributions   use them to the maximum your employer will match   after that own your ira   control is key when it comes to your money on ira 's buy roth first   contribute the calendar maximum   then get a traditional   the benefit of roth is that you already paid taxes on the contribution so your withdrawal is not taxed and they do not tax the interest earned like they do on a standard mutual fund

as you are not a tax resident in india the income you have earned can be moved to india tax free however if you are investing the funds into say shares fixed deposits etc the income you earn on these funds is taxable in india the funds can be transferred directly into savings account however its to open an nre nro account as its easier to track funds for tax purposes i.e. these accounts by nature certify that the funds received into them are from foreign sources and can easily be explained to the tax authorities however establishing the origin of funds in ordinary savings accounts needs more paper work whenever there is a scrutiny by tax authorities on this savings account it would need more efforts to establish that the credits are from foreign earnings

in my opinion you ca n't save too much for retirement an extra $ invested at 8 for 30 years would give you $ k more at retirement   if your good amount in my 401k is a hint that you do n't want us to go in that direction then how about saving for the child 's college education 15 years savings again at 8 will return $ 85 k which feels like a low number even in today 's dollars 15 years of college inflation and it wo n't be much at all   not sure why there 's guilt around spending it if one has no debt good retirement savings level and no pressing need to save for something else enjoying one 's money is an earned reward   even so if you want a riskless investment just prepay the mortgage you 'll see an effective return of the mortgage rate 4 or so vs the .001 banks are paying of course this creates a monthly windfall once the mortgage is paid off but it buys you time to make this ultimate decision   in the end i 'd respond that similar to who can truly afford luxury cars one should produce a budget i do n't mean a set of constraints to limit spending in certain categories but rather a look back at where the money went last year and even the year before that what will emerge are the things that are normal the utility bills tax bill mortgage etc as well as the discretionary spending if all your current saving is on track the investment may be in experiences not financial products

we were on the gold standard in name only since about 1910 there was not enough gold to remotely back the us currency which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough and gold possession had to be outlawed well partially so no we were not on a gold standard   secondly when you 're on a any fixed item standard your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the fixed item there are many reasons for this and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past years   so besides the fact that the us has not in modern history been backed by gold despite the name there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth

if human beings were i.e. textbook rational and self interested economic minded beings as opposed to simply human then yes simple advice like just stay out of debt and your credit score will take care of itself could work   your simplification would be very persuasive to such a being however people are not perfectly rational   we buy something we should n't have we charge it on a credit card we ca n't afford to pay it off at the end of the month   we lose our job   our furnace breaks down or our roof leaks and we did n't anticipate the replacement cost   some of this is our fault some of it is n't basically shit happens and we get into debt   maybe even knowing all the while we should n't have our credit history and score takes a hit   only then do we find out there are consequences our interest rates go up our insurance companies raise premiums our prospective new employers or landlords run credit checks and either deny us the job or the apartment telling a person who asks for help about their credit history score that they should n't have taken on debt in the first place is like telling the farmer he should have kept the barn door shut so the horse would n't run out   while it is not bad advice it 's not the only kind of advice to offer when somebody finds themselves in such a situation adding advice about actions is more helpful   the person probably already know that they should n't have overspent in the first place and got into debt   yes remind them of the value of being sensible about debt in the first place it 's good reinforcement but add some helpful advice to the mix   e.g. so you 're in debt   you should n't have lived beyond your means   but now that you are in this mess here 's what you can do to improve the situation

outside of broadly hedging interest rate risk as i mentioned in my other answer there may be a way that you could do what you are asking more directly you may be able to commit to purchasing a house condo in a pre construction phase where your bank may be willing to lock in a mortgage for you at today 's rates the mortgage would n't actually be required until you take ownership from the builder but the rates would be set in advance some caveats for this approach 1 you would need to know the house condo you want to move into in advance and you would be committing to that move today 2 the bank may not be willing to commit to rates that far in advance 3 construction would likely take far less than 5 years unless you are buying a condo which is the reason i mention condos specifically 4 you are also committing to the price you are paying for your property this hedges you somewhat against price fluctuation in your future area but because you currently own property you are already somewhat hedged against property price fluctuation meaning this is taking on additional risk the savings associated with this plan as they relate to your original question which are really just hedging against interest rate fluctuations are far outweighed by the external pros and cons associated with buying property in advance like this by that i mean if it was something else you were already considering this might be a small tick in the pro column but otherwise is far too complex to be considered for interest rate hedging on its own

investing in the stock market early is a good thing   however it does have a learning curve and that curve can and eventually will cost you one basic rule in investing is that risk and reward are proportional   the greater the reward the higher the risk that you either a wo n't get the reward or b lose your money instead   given that do n't invest money you ca n't afford to lose you mentioned you 're on a student budget if you want to start with short but investments try finding a high interest savings account or cd   for example the bank i use has an offer where the first $ 500 in your account gets ~6 interest certainly not bad if you only put $ 500 in the account   unfortunately most banks are offering a pittance for savings rates or cds if you 're willing to take more risk you could certainly put money into the stock market   before you do i would recommend spending some time learning about how the stock market works it 's flows and and how stock valuations work   do n't buy a stock because you hear about it a lot understand why that stock is being valued as such   also consider buying index funds such as spy which is like a stock but tracks an entire index   that way if a specific company suddenly drops you wo n't be nearly as affected   on the flip side if only 1 company goes up but the market goes down you 'll miss out   but consider the odds of having picked that 1 company

i 'm not a millennial either   i was born right in the middle of gen x.   i do n't hate applebee 's but i do n't eat there either   there are a number of small mom and pop in town   the cost of eating at those is roughly half of a meal at applebee 's and the food is usually better   further i recently bought a house and have upgraded the kitchen so i will be cooking for myself much more often   homemade meals are about the cost of applebee 's   quality is much higher too   there are two problems with applebee 's   one too many grasping hands   iirc applebee 's is a franchise   that means the franchisee corporate and shareholders are all over their share of the profits   that leads to cuts in product quality and underpaying employees   that 's a recipe for disaster   yes i believe in profit but the profit should be going to only one entity   otherwise you start on product and employees which suppress profits   the other problem is complexity   how many items are on the applebee 's menu   80 100   i have n't counted   that 's too many   they need to get it down to 15 20 items and go all out to make those the best possible   if they had a more limited menu with higher quality items the employees were better paid and the prices were lower because only one party collected profits they 'd be doing well

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

your instructor 's numbers do not seem to have any basis in current reality at this page you can see a comparison of interest rates offered by banks and credit unions   in the most recent table for june 2014 banks paid an average interest rate of 0.12 percent on savings accounts while credit unions paid an average of percent    if you look back further you will see that interest rates paid by banks and credit unions are generally comparable   credit union rates tend to be a little bit higher but certainly not 7 times higher the last time any financial institution paid as much as 15 on a savings account would probably be the early 1980s   you can see here a historical chart of the prime rate for lending   savings account rates at either banks or credit unions would typically be lower this is based on the us in accordance with your tag   interest rates in other places especially developing countries with less stable currencies can be dramatically different

this is a well worn path and not a bad idea   there are quite a few pitfalls but there are a lot of resources to learn for other people 's mistakes having a plan and doing your research should help you avoid most of them   here is some general advice to help get you started on the right foot   know the market you are investing in   the city should have more than one major employer the population should be rising and hopefully there are other positive economic indicators   check the city 's and state 's chamber of commerce for useful information   you do not want to be stuck holding a bunch of upside down property in detroit    accurately calculate expenses   set aside money for repairs   budget 5 of the rent or 100 a month for repairs if no repairs happen that money goes into the repair fund for the future   set aside money for capital expenditures if the roof has a 10 years of life left in 10 years you better be ready to replace it same with any major appliances your area should have a baseline vacancy rate 5 8 in my area that says out of a year your property will be vacant for around 6 of the year or 21 days for turnover you should build that cushion into the budget as well setting aside a portion of the rent to cover that lean period some property management will offer eviction insurance which is basically them enforcing that savings   financing maybe difficult a lot of banks like to see 25 down payments on investments you will also face higher interest rates for investment properties banks generally also like to see enough money to cover 6 months worth of expenses in your account for all property   some banks will not give financing for investment property to someone without 1 2 years of landlord experience all in all finding money will be hard when you gets started and your terms may be less than ideal   hopefully make around 3 5k a year in profit   if that includes loan pay down and is not just cash flow you are probably in the right ballpark   i can find $ dollars cash flow a month on single family home in my area once loan pay down is included your numbers are close   it sounds like you have a good attitude and a good plan   a book that i really enjoyed and i think may be useful is start small profit big in real estate by jay   i think of it as required reading for do it yourself real estate investors good luck and happy investing

there is no rule of thumb although some may suggest there is everybody will have different goals investment preferences and risk tolerances you need to figure this out by yourself by either education yourself in the type of investments you are interested in or by engaging and paying for a financial advisor you should not be taking advice from others unless it is specifically geared for your goals investment dna and risk tolerance the only advice i would give you is to have a plan whether you develop it yourself or pay a financial advisor to develop one also do n't have all your savings sitting in cash as long term you will fall behind the eight ball in real returns allowing for inflation

yeah i get the logic of what you are saying because his comments are really ambiguous but his argument is pointing the other way so what he actually means by driving capital overseas is that other countries are seeing greater economic growth overall and therefore better investment returns that 's why capital is fleeing but it 's because us growth is badly constrained   it 's constrained because the republican stranglehold on congress is preventing government investment that will support greater corporate growth   i wish he would say it more clearly but from the context of his comments here and elsewhere this is what he means   he is not reversing his former views but them

assume that he reformed his ways he stopped the destructive behavior gambling and had enough money from a job going forward to pay for all his future expenses then it is true the old debts will fade away both as being collectable and as a source of a negative mark on the credit report also assume that the people or companies never figure out that the the relative has a steady source of income also assume that all the debts can be forgiven and have no long lasting impact if any of those assumptions are n't true the plan wo n't work the trail of debts will continue to grow and may have additional complications as debts fall off the radar they may be replaced even faster by new threats many a person has used a debt consolidation loan or a home equity loan to pay off all the credit cards but found themselves back in trouble because they never fixed the underlying problem they spend more than they make in the case of a home equity loan they put their house at rick as a replacement of unsecured loans if the gambling continues the lack of payment of old debts becomes a for the ability to generate new debts

here is an example for you we have a fictional company it 's called moneycorp its job is to own money and that 's all right now it owns $ 10,000 it does n't do anything special with that $ 10,000 it stores it in a bank account and whenever it earns interest gives it to the shareholders as a dividend also it does n't have any expenses at all and does n't pay taxes and is otherwise magic so that it does n't have to worry about distractions from its mathematical perfection there are 10,000 shares of moneycorp each worth exactly $ 1 however they may trade for more or less than $ 1 on the stock market because it 's a free market and people trading stock on the stock market can trade at whatever price two people agree on scenario 1 moneycorp wants to expand they sell 90,000 shares for $ 1 each the money goes in the same bank account at the same interest rate do the original shareholders see a change no 100,000 shares $ 100,000 still $ 1/share no problem this is the ideal situation scenario 2 moneycorp sells 90,000 shares for less than the current price $ 0.50 each do the original shareholders lose out yes it now has something like $ 55,000 and 100,000 shares each share is now worth $ 0.55 the company has given away valuable equity to new shareholders that 's bad why did n't they get more money from those guys scenario 3 moneycorp sells 90,000 shares for more than the current price $ 2 each because there 's a lot of hype about its business moneycorp now owns $ 190,000 in 100,000 shares and each share is worth $ 1.90 existing shareholders win big this is why a company would like to make its share offering at the highest price possible think facebook ipo of course the new shareholders may be disappointed moneycorp is actually a lot like a real business actually if you want to get down to it moneycorp works very much like a money market fund the main difference between moneycorp and a random company on the stock market is that we know exactly how much money moneycorp is worth you do n't know that with a real business sales may grow sales may drop input prices may rise and fall and there 's room for disagreement that 's why stock markets are as unpredictable as they are so there 's room for doubt when a company sells their stock at a price existing shareholders think is too cheap or buys it at a price that is too expensive most companies raising capital will end up doing something close to scenario 1 the fair prices for everyone scenario legally if you own part of a company and they do something a on you you may be out of luck consider also the other owners are probably hurt as much as you are only the new shareholders win and unless the management approving the deal is somehow giving themselves a sweetheart deal it 'll be hard to demonstrate any malfeasance as an individual you probably wo n't file a lawsuit either unless you own a very large stake in the company lawsuits are expensive a big institutional investor or activist investor of some sort may file a suit if millions of dollars are at stake but it 'll be ugly at best if there 's nothing evil going on with the management this is just one way that a company loses money from bad management it 's probably not the most important one to worry about

whether or not it is logical probably depends on individual circumstance   when you take on or maintain debt you are choosing to do two things the first is clear this is what you describe very well in your answer it is a straightforward analysis of interest rates the fixed cost of the debt can then be directly compared to expected return on investments that are made with the newly available cash flow if you can reasonably expect to beat your debt interest rate this is an argument to borrow and invest add to this equation an overwhelming upside such as a 401k match and the argument becomes very compelling the second cost listed is more speculative in nature but just as important when you acquire debt you are committing your future cash flow to payments this exposes you to the risk of too little financial margin in the future it also exposes you to the risk of any negatives that come with non payment of debt repossession foreclosure credit hit sleeping at night family tension worst case bankruptcy since the future tends to be difficult to predict this risk is not so easy to quantify clearly the amount and nature of the debt is a large factor here   this would seem to be highly personal with different individuals having unique financial or personal resources or income earning power   i will never say someone is illogical for choosing to repay their debts before investing in a 401k i can see why some would always choose to invest to the match

banks are not your friends they are not performing services for you because they like you they are a business and they make money by borrowing money from you at low interest and loaning it out at higher interest they are trying to persuade you to deposit more money however briefly in their bank so they can loan out more money they are probably also counting on the fact that most folks wo n't go to the trouble of setting up accounts at multiple banks with the automatic transfers in order to meet the required deposit threshold that lets them save on the interest payments to consumers that are individually tiny but significant in the aggregate

to the best of my knowledge in california there 's no such thing as registering a place as a business there 's zoning residential commercial mixed etc and there 's a business registered at a place but there 's no place registered as a business so you better clarify what it is that you think your landlord did it may be that the place is used for short term rentals in which case the landlord may have to have registered a business of short term rentals there depending on the local municipal or county rules specifically regarding the deposit however there 's a very clear treatment in the california law the landlord must provide itemized receipt for the amounts out of the deposit that were used and the prices should be reasonable and based on the actual charges by the actual vendors if you did n't get such a receipt or the amounts are bogus and unsubstantiated you have protection under the ca law

for example for my employer i received a signing bonus and a    relocation lump sum separate from that signing bonus the relocation    lump sum is taxed and will appear as income on my w-2 and i can spend    it on anything i want that said should the relocation lump sum count    towards the entry quoted above in form or would it be considered    the same as any other bonus thus allowing me to take a full deduction    for all of my deductible travel expenses the signing bonus and relocation lump sum will appear as regular income on your w-2 you can think of the relocation bonus as something to cover the pain and suffering the cost of moving without needing to send in receipts lets assume that you meet the distance and time tests so there is potential to save money on your taxes lets also put your actual moving expenses as $ 2500 if you have valid moving expenses the irs will allow you to use them to reduce your agi so now you can reduce your agi by the $ 2500   enter the total amount your employer paid you for the expenses listed    on lines 1 and 2 that is not included in box 1 of your form w-2    wages this amount should be shown in box 12 of your form w-2 with    code p. my question is what exact payments from your employer should be    entered here i realize that you can just write the number you get in    box 12 with code p on your w-2 but i 'm curious how they come up with    this number in some cases the company will reimburse you your moving expenses up to a maximum of $ x. for example a maximum of $ 1000 that means you submit receipts for those expenses and they give you a check or add it to your next paycheck the check will either be for the amount on your receipts or the maximum amount whichever is smaller in this situation with actual expenses of $ 2500 and a reimbursement of $ 1000 you can reduce your agi by $ 1500

the first thing you should do and should have been doing all this time if you were n't is to take the money you would've paid in the payment plan and set it aside in a separate savings account   if your plan was 2 years $ 65 a month then set that aside now that will allow you to be in a better negotiating position when this is finally resolved   it 's also possible this takes two years to be resolved in which case you 'll be in position to pay the debt off in full at that point   it 's also possible at some point in the future you 'll be offered to settle for half or something like that at which point if you 've saved several months of payments that might be more practical to do as far as what to do about the charges being removed unless you have a specific reason for believing they 're invalid that 's probably impossible   you could go to the public service commission outlined in this article about making complaints about from coned it seems like it 's probably too late for that honestly but who knows   if you 'd made more of an effort at the time it 's possible you could 've disputed them back then with    and as far as what to do with requiring written payment plans absolutely 100   i would try to find out why you 're not getting the plans   do they have the wrong address perhaps   or is your mail sometimes poorly delivered   ask them to send it via certified mail you may be charged a few dollars for this or ask them to e mail you a copy while you 're on the phone with them my preferred option bill collectors like getting their money so they ought to help you out with this

to add a little to mhoran_psprep 's answer the clause in question is not binding in perpetuity but only for the duration of the construction loan   i assume that you are getting the loan from a bank rather than through   the builder   the way a construction loan works is that the bank   agrees to loan you a certain amount of money for you to pay the builder but you do n't get the money upfront to hold   till the construction is complete or to pay to the builder each month each month or whenever a major phase of the construction is completed the builder submits a request for payment of say $ x to you stating what part of the   whole work has been completed and attaching lien waivers from all the subcontractors that did any part of the work that they have been paid in full   it is up to you to verify   for your own protection that the work has in fact been completed and that the work is satisfactory   if everything looks ok you send the   request together with the lien waivers to the bank which sends its own home inspector to verify that the work has in fact been completed after the inspector 's ok the bank pays the builder $ x   more commonly $ or $ and gets a lien waiver from the builder in the amount of the payment   at this point the amount that you   owe the bank increases by the amount paid this goes on till the   house is completed the municipality or county issues a certificate   of occupancy meaning that that august body is satisfied that   there are no building code violations etc and the place is   and the request for payment is made because a good construction contract withholds   some amount 5 or 10 of the money owed to the builder   for anywhere from three   months to a year to ensure that the builder will come back   and fix things that were done incorrectly but not noticed   till the house was lived in for example one nail had an electrical wire creating leakage this was not discovered during inspection flip the switch light turns on yes so flip the switch back and move on but when the light was turned on for three hours after the house was occupied an electrical fire began inside the wall   so after this settle down period is over the builder submits the final payment request and gives a final lien waiver to the effect that everything owed to him has been paid it is during this period of time that the bank wants to make sure that you do n't take on additional loans or debts or make any material changes to the facts that the bank used in assessing your credit worthiness and making the decision to loan you the money hence the clause that is causing you to worry   construction loans usually are at higher interest rates than regular mortgages so that once construction is complete it is in your best interest to replace the construction loan paying off its mortgage with a regular home owner loan and mortgage   if you get the regular mortgage from the same bank you might be able to get some of the fees waived while going to another bank will mean that appraisal fee termite inspection fee etc will have to be paid but in either case the prohibition against buying that will disappear just do n't take out that auto loan between the mortgage application and the closing on the regular mortgage as mhoran_psprep 's buyer did

investment banks do n't have to buy anything if they do n't think the stock is worth buying they wo n't if they think it is others on the secondary market will probably think so too initial public offering is offering to the public i.e. theoretically anyone can participate and purchase stocks the major investment firms are not buying the stocks for themselves but for their clients who are participating in this ipo i for example receive email notifications from my brokerage firm each time there 's another ipo that they have access to and i can ask the brokerage to buy stocks from the ipo on my behalf when that happens they do n't buy the stocks themselves and then sell to me no what happens is that i buy a stock through them and they charge me a commission for the service usually ipo participation commissions are higher than regular trading commissions most of the time those who purchase stocks at ipo are institutional investors i.e. mutual funds pension plans investment banks for their managed accounts etc retail investors would probably not participate in the ipo because of the costs limited access not all the brokerage firms have access to all the ipos and the uncertainty and rather purchase the stocks later on a secondary market

yes it 's normal if you buy your own disability insurance with after tax money any payout you get is non taxable if your employer buys your disability insurance with their own money any payout you get is taxable since the payout is not 100 of your pre disability income most folks strongly prefer that the payout be non taxable to achieve this i pay the premiums on behalf of my employees including myself and then add that premium to their salary as a taxable benefit in effect i paid it to them then took it from them and used it to buy the insurance it has no impact on my corporate taxes since i can either deduct premiums or salaries same either way this ensures they wo n't pay tax if they should collect and i have had people collect and it was non taxable to them

during the hyperinflation of the republic corporate stocks and convertible bonds were thought second only to the species gold silver etc as the only secure currencies   as milton friedman proved inflation is caused solely by the monetary token supply increasing faster than productivity   in the past days of species of currency it was caused by governments the currency e.g. the same amount of silver in 50 coins to 100 coins sudden increases in the supply of precious metals can also trigger it the various gold rushes in 19th century and later improvements in extraction methods caused of inflation most famously the huge amounts of silver the spanish extracted from the new world mines devastated the european economy with high inflation governments use inflation as a form of stealth flat tax money functions as an abstract universal trade good and it all the rules of supply and demand if the supply of money goes up suddenly then its value drops in relation to real goods and service but that drop in value does n't occur instantly the increased quality of tokens has to through the market before the value changes   so the first institution to spend the debased currency can get the full current value from trade the second gets slightly less the third even less and so on in 2008 the federal reserve began printing money and loaning at 0 to insolvent backs who then used that money to buy t bill this had the effect of giving the banks an arbitrary a1 rated asset for their fractional reserve while the federal government got full pre inflation value of the money paid for the t bills as the government spent that money the number of tokens increased fast than the economy   in times of inflation the value of money per unit drops as its supply increases and increases the best hedges against inflation are real assets e.g. land equipment stocks ownership of real assets and convertible bonds which are convertible to stock   it 's important to remember that money is of itself worthless it 's just a technology that and trading which at the base is still a barter system during inflation the barter value of money plunges owing to increased supply but the direct barter value between any two real assets remain the same because their supplies have not changed   the value of stocks and convertible bonds is maintained by the economic activity of the company whose ownership they represent dividends stock prices and bond equity as measured in the inflated currency continue to rise in sync with inflation thus they preserve the original value of the money paid for them not sure why you expect more inflation the only institution that can create inflation in the us is the federal reserve which trump has no direct control off deregulation of banks wo n't cause inflation in and of itself as the private banks can not alter the money supply if banks fail owing to deregulation unlikely i think given the dismal nearly century long record of regulation to date then the federal reserve might fix the problem with another inflation tax but otherwise not

in addition to the issues discussed in 's answer i think you need to consider your medium term saving needs and existing savings in particular do you have a sufficient rainy day fund a fund you will spend if things go wrong for example if you are dependent on a vehicle that is not covered by a guarantee or service plan you should have enough money saved for a couple of major repairs depending on how secure your job is whether it carries sick leave and long term disability and how easy or difficult it would be to find another job in the event e.g. of your employer going bankrupt due to a downturn in your industry you should have months to years of minimal living expenses in your rainy day fund if you do n't have those things covered you should urgently save as much as you can until they are covered if you do then the next savings priority is to put money by for retirement of course if all goes well the rainy day fund will ultimately get folded into retirement but it needs to exist now in a form you can access quickly

u.s. citizens are allowed to own foreign bank and investment accounts however there are various financial and tax reporting requirements for owners of such accounts even when there is no foreign income involved for example famous fbar fincen report form 114 form 8938 and even more forms if your assets activities abroad become more complicated penalties even for unintentional non compliance can be draconian so just keep in mind that once you start having foreign accounts you will start having additional obligations and might spend more money and time on tax preparation if you are ok with that then its cool but assuming your predictions on trump presidency come true they might be accompanied by more strict capital control reporting requirements and may become even greater pain in the neck for people with foreign assets regarding recommendations i am not sure about banks but there are some foreign precious metal investing companies that are completely online based such as and these might also guard you from potential problems with us dollar

fundamentally interest rates reflect the time preference people place on money and the things money can buy   if i have a high time preference then i prefer money in my hand versus money promised to me at some date in the future   thus i will only loan my money to someone if they offer me an incentive which would be an amount of money to be received in the future that is larger than the amount of money i ’m giving the debtor in the present i.e. the interest rate many factors go into my time preference determination   my demand for cash i.e. my cash balance the credit rating of the borrower the length of the loan and my expectation of the change in currency value are just a few of the factors that affect what interest rate i will loan money the first loan i make will have a lower interest rate than the last loan ceteris paribus   this is because my supply of cash diminishes with each loan which makes my remaining cash more valuable and a higher interest rate will be needed to entice me to make additional loans   this is the theory behind why interest rates will rise when qe3 or ever stops   qe is where the federal reserve cartel prints new money to purchase bonds from cartel banks   if qe slows or ends the supply of money will stop increasing which will make cash more valuable and higher interest rates will be needed to entice creditors to loan money note that increasing the stock of money does not necessarily result in lower interest rates   as stated earlier the change in value of the currency also affects the interest rate lenders are willing to accept   if the federal reserve cartel deposited $ 1 million everyday into every us citizen ’s bank account it would n’t take long before lenders demanded very high interest rates as compensation for the decrease in the value of the currency does the federal reserve cartel affect interest rates   yes in two ways   first as mentioned before it prints new money that is loaned to the government   it either purchases the bonds directly or purchases the bonds from cartel banks which give them cash to purchase more government bonds   this keeps demand high for government bonds which lowers the yield on government bonds yields move inverse to the price of the bond   the federal reserve cartel also can provide an unlimited amount of funds at the federal funds rate to the cartel member banks   banks can borrow at this rate and then proceed to make loans at a higher rate and pocket the difference remember however that the federal reserve cartel is not the only market participant   other bond holders such as foreign governments and pension funds buy and sell us bonds   at some point they could demand higher rates   the federal reserve cartel which currently holds close to 17 of us public debt could attempt to keep rates low by printing new money to buy all existing us bonds to prevent the yield on bonds from going up   at that point however holding us dollars becomes very dangerous as it is apparent the federal reserve cartel is just a money printing machine for the us government   that ’s when most people begin to dump dollars en masse

not to mention that what they were doing was the right way to do it for many decades it was simply seen as the norm that you would have a job take part of your savings and put that into a 401k because it was the only way to really provide for a safe future   so that 's what we did oops   the other big difference between gen x and the surrounding generations in regards to retirement is social security the baby boomers will have social security for most of the rest of their lives it 's funded and it wo n't be a problem millenials have mostly come of age knowing that 's a joke gen x on the other hand grew up and worked at least part of their lives under the assumption that social security while having problems would at least provide some help however with the way the economy and government is going it 's very possible that wo n't be a guarantee without major adjustments decreased payout increased retirement age etc so they 're going to be taking it there as well   that 's not even to get started on the mortgage situation for a lot of us x'ers we bought homes near or at the top of the bubble again because everyone was telling our generation that we were foolish for renting why with the tax incentives in place and the way housing prices have been rising the last 20 years you 're just throwing your money away by renting so again the baby boomers enjoyed 20 30 years of rising home prices giving them a chance to build up a lot of equity and refinance at lower and lower rates the millenials again were shielded simply by not being at the point in their lives where it would be a problem once again it 's gen x that was just trying to do what they had observed as working their entire life   i think generation x will rise out of everything that has happened much wiser most of us have been through enough at this point that i think we 're beginning to become very of the way things are and that will have heavy ramifications as the reigns of power fall from the boomers to the x'ers   may you live in interesting times

already hit on some of this   it 's hard to explain this to a five year old because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved but here goes    all actual money is debt all of it including monetary gold etc do n't argue with me yet i 'll get to that   imagine a pretend world with no money some kind of primitive or something now let 's invent paper money you ca n't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff because nobody would honor it but you could print ious let 's walk through this   let 's say you 're an apple farmer and i 'm a hunter you want some meat but have n't harvested your crops yet you say to me hey go hunt me some meat and i 'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall fair enough i give you meat you owe me apples there 's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on in addition to normal barter in time standard prices start to emerge a deer is worth a bushel of apples or whatever    now let 's say a week later i realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than i need a bushel of apples i come back to you and say   hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me could you write a marker redeemable for one bushel of apples that i can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes you say okay and we have invented a transferable note something a lot like money    in time our little starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things the fisherman who does n't even like apples will accept apple certificates in trade for fish because he knows he can trade them to boat builder who loves apples in time you can even start to hire farm workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest    now you are issuing debt a promise to provide apples the money is a transferable your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm work or whatever and it 's transferrable so they can use it to buy whatever they want the worker gets fish from the fisherman not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use but in exchange for an iou that the fisherman can redeem anywhere    so far so good but there are a couple of in the road here on the way to a realistic monetary system that we 'll address separately   what happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out it did n't go anywhere it 's just gone it does n't exist real value was genuinely destroyed there is no law of the conservation of monetary just as you and i created it by creating transferable debt it can also be genuinely destroyed we 'll get back to this in a minute it gets interesting    the second issue is that in all probability the whole town is not just trading apple certificates i could also issue promises to catch deer the fisherman could issue promises of fish and so on this could get pretty messy especially if you got the notion to issue more apple certificates than you can grow you could buy all kinds of stuff with self issued debt that you could never repay and the town would n't find out until harvest time comes once again value has been destroyed people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that does n't exist and will never exist all that stuff they made is gone you consumed it and there is nothing to show for it   the above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later and probably sooner   this leads to the question of credit which is at its most basic a measure of every time you issue an apple certificate you are borrowing with a promise to repay from future apple    after the first couple of town scandals people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer let 's say the town potato farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato certificates are actually issued by some credible third party say the town priest or whatever who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop yield and no more and keeps half of the certificate on file issuing the other half now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato grower a lot of credit compared to other farmers in town that means that the potato grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some system similarly the town drunk probably wo n't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold    now we have something like a credit market emerging and the potato farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern bond   continued in a reply to this post

first of all congratulations on paying off $ 40k in debt in one year mathematically you 'd be better off making the standard car loan payments and putting your extra money toward the student loan however there are a few other things that you might want to consider over the last year you 've knocked out a whole bunch of different debts   feels pretty good does n't it   at your current rate you could knock out your new car loan in 6 months   then you 'd only have one debt left   if it sounds to you like it would be nice to only have one debt left then it might be worth the mathematical disadvantage you would get by paying off the car early instead of putting the money toward the last student loan the car loan is 0 but if you are late on a single payment they will take that opportunity to raise your interest rate to something probably higher than the interest rate of your student loan   for this reason you may decide it is not worth the hassle and you 'd rather just eliminate the car loan as quickly as possible either choice is fine in my opinion as long as you have a purpose behind the choice and you are committed to eliminating both debts as quickly as possible as an aside it is important to remember that even a 0 loan is not really free money and needs to be paid back   you know this of course but sometimes you see a 0 loan and it feels like free money   it 's not   you have probably already paid for the loan by forfeiting a rebate   so although at this point having already taken this loan and paying for it you will come out ahead by dragging out your car loan for the full term in the future do not think that you can make money by buying something at 0 interest

there are a few ways to look at this question assumptions per the original post 's assumptions this answer in other words if the owner paid the mortgage on its original schedule the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for $   200,000 of equity after 30   years   or the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for a $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years while the owner is paying down the mortgage the return on equity is the principal payment divided by the equity   the principal payment is the net rent minus non financing costs and interest so it is actually a profit the initial return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   210.70 monthly principal payment by the initial $   40,000 equity and converting from monthly return to annual return after 30 years the return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   810.70 monthly cash flow which is no longer reduced by mortgage payments by the $   200,000 equity after 30 years and converting from monthly return to annual return the cap rate is the same as the return on equity in the absence of debt   in this example   apr or   apy the return on equity declines from   apy initially to   apy after 30 years this is because the cap rate exceeds the note rate   apy vs.   apy and the leverage decreases from 5x to 1x the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the equity during the 30 years is   apy   per the original poster 's answer this is computed by taking the 30th root of the increase in equity   because the owner made no extra principal payments besides those already discussed the relevant amounts are the initial $   40,000 owner payment and the final $   200,000 owner equity     apy corresponds to a   apr the internal rate of return if the owner never sells can be computed by treating the deal as a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for an $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years   the internal rate of return irr is not a very useful number because it assumes that you can somehow reinvest the eventual dividends at the same rate   in this example the irr is   apr or   apy   in this example the irr is calculated by finding an interest rate for which initial investment 1 + irr ^ number periods before dividends start = periodic dividend irr growth rate of dividend   for example $   40,000 = $   810.70 0 = $   i then converted the   monthly irr to an annual irr the deal can be thought of as a return on equity plus a return on paying down the mortgage when computing the return from paying down the mortgage the initial equity is irrelevant   it does not matter whether you start with a $ 160,000 mortgage on a $   160,000 property a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   200,000 property or a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   1,000,000 property   all that matters is the note rate on the mortgage which is the applicable compound interest rate the return on paying down the mortgage equals the note rate of the mortgage   for a 4.5 note rate this works out to a annual percentage yield apy you can confirm this by looking at your amortization schedule   suppose you have a $   160,000 mortgage with a fixed 4.5 apr note rate for 360 months   your monthly payment is $   810.70   in the first month $   600 goes toward interest and $   210.70 reduces the principal   in other words the $   210.70 principal payment eliminated the need for a $ 810.70 payment 30 years later   notice that $ 210.70 1 + = $ 210.70 = $ 210.70 = $ which is within rounding error of $   810.70 the interest rate is   per month which is an apr of 4.5 and an apy of

the key part of your question is the so far   so you did n't need a credit card today or yesterday or last month great   but what about tomorrow   the time may come when you really need to spend a little more than you have and a credit card will let you do that at a very modest cost if you pay it off promptly no cost if paid within 30 days i learned this when i was traveling and stranded due to bad weather   i had almost nothing in my bank account at the time and while i actually did have a small student type credit card i came really close to having to sleep at the train station when i did n't have enough for another night in a hotel as an example if you have close friends or family living across the country and something tragic were to happen would you be able to pay for a flight to attend the funeral   what if you 'd recently had an accident and a big medical bill it does n't take much a broken arm can cost $ 10,000   perhaps you have a solid nest egg but breaking a cd ahead of schedule or taking short term capital gains on a mutual fund will usually cost more than one or two months of interest payments

if you are just barely scraping by on your current income then you should n't be thinking about buying a car or house unless you can present at least to yourself clear evidence that doing so will actually lower your monthly expenses yes there are times when even buying depreciating assets such as a car can lower your expenses but you need to think hard about whether that is the case or if it is just something you want to get because you feel you should remember the old adage that rich people buy themselves income streams investments that either earn money or reduce expenses while poor people buy expenses if you are in the situation of barely scraping by on your current income then the first step in my mind is to find out exactly what you are spending your money on do this for a month or two and then try to include non regular or rarely bills such as subscriptions insurance perhaps utilities and so on once you know where your money is going right now outline that in a budget at this point you are n't judging your spending but rather simply looking at the facts once you have a decent idea of where your money is going only then try to think about what you can cut back on some things will be easier than others to change it 's much easier to cancel a premium tv channels package than to move to cheaper living quarters for example although in some cases simply picking the low hanging fruit alone wo n't help you make a revised budget for the next month based on the new numbers and try to live by it keep writing down what you actually spend your money on then rinse and repeat of course you can make a budget for whatever period of time works for you if you get paid every two weeks budgeting per two weeks might be easier than budgeting per month the bottom line is that a budget is useless without a follow up process to see how well your spending actually matches the budgeted amounts so you need to spend some time following up on it and making adjustments no budget will ever match reality exactly think of the budget as a map not a by guide for getting from a to b. when you find some wiggle room in your budget for example let 's say you decide to cancel the premium tv channels package you got some time ago because it turns out you are n't watching much tv anyway do n't put that money into a discretionary spending category there is an old rule in personal finance that says pay yourself first if you are able to find $ of wiggle room put it into savings of some kind if you are unsure what kind of savings vehicle you should use i 'd suggest starting off with a simple savings account it certainly wo n't earn you a great return you 'll be lucky if you can keep up with inflation but it will get you into the habit of saving which at this point is a lot more important and make that savings transfer as soon as the money hits your account if you can get the depositor to put a portion of your income directly into the savings account if you can not make the transfer yourself immediately afterwards and try to force yourself to live with the money that 's left not touching the savings account ideally you should save a decent fraction of your income i 've seen figures everywhere from 10 to 25 of your after tax income recommended by various people and start out by budgeting that to savings and then working with whatever is left in practice saving anything and putting the money anywhere is much better than saving nothing just make sure that the savings are liquid easy to convert to cash and withdraw without a penalty should the need arise set up a regular bank transfer for whatever amount you can find in that budget and try to forget about it until you get the bank statement for the savings account and get that warm fuzzy feeling for actually having a decent amount of money set aside should something ever happen making you need it then later you can decide whether to use the money to buy a car start a company take early retirement or something entirely different having the money will give you the options and you can decide what is more important to you yourself just keep on saving

basically do some math on the 2 schools let 's say you know it will take 4 years if you go the cheaper route at $ 8k yr plus the $ 300/month total cost $ if you for these purposes do not have to pay back new loans until school is completed and depending on the rate of those loans you would need approx $ 6k yr in loans plus the same costs $ 300/month + $ 8k yr to cover the other part of tuition let 's say the expensive school takes 3 years to complete which means you 're out of pocket $ and in debt an additional $ 18,000 totaling $ this means that to make the 2nd school worth it assuming your rates do n't kill you etc you should have an increased earning potential of at least $ after you get your degree if you can finish in 2 years your costs are $ + $ 12k and you do n't even have to change your earning potential to come out ahead other factors to consider are if you are n't following any of the math or want to post more information just comment back to me and i 'll try to explain further best of luck

if you can afford it there are very few reasons not to save for retirement the biggest reason i can think of is that simply you are saving in general the tax advantages of 401k and ira accounts help increase your wealth but the most important thing is to start saving at an early age in your career as you are doing and making sure to continue contributing throughout your life compound interest serves you well if you are really concerned that saving for retirement in your situation would equate to putting money away for no good reason you can do a couple of things save in a roth ira account which does not require minimum distributions when you get past a certain age additionally your contributions only that is not your interest earnings to a roth can be withdrawn tax and penalty free at any time while you are under the age of 59.5 and once you are older than that you can take distributions as however you need save by investing in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds you wo n't get the tax advantages of a retirement account but you will still benefit from the time value of money the bonus here is that you can withdraw your money whenever you want without penalty both ira accounts and mutual fund brokerage accounts will give you a choice of many securities that you can invest in in comparison 401k plans below often have limited choices for you most people choose to use their company 's 401k plan for retirement savings in general you do not want to be in a position where you have to borrow from your 401k as such it 's not a great option for savings that you think you 'd need before you retire additionally 401k plans have minimum distributions so you will have to periodically take some money from the account when you are in retirement the biggest advantage of 401k plans is that often employers will match contributions to a certain extent which is basically free money for you in the end these are just some suggestions probably best to consult with a financial planner to hammer out all the details

the economy stinks because the government targets a straight line rate of ngdp growth that is ever diverging from the rate of sustainable economic growth which has been flattening since the 1970s when the cost of energy sustained significant rises in price and never looked back the only way to make the economy not stink is to find a miraculously cheap energy source that is as cheap as fossil fuels were before the 1970s   since the possibility of this is practically zero the best we can do is make the economy stink less in the long run by intentionally flattening the rate of ngdp growth by gradually pulling back on massive debt spending and tightening loose monetary policies if we do n't do this we are just setting ourselves up for a future economic correction whose will not only be bigger than the great recession but will also be relatively bigger than the great depression

i am going to assume that this is going to be a long term investment and you do n't need this money before 5 at the very least my advise would be to invest in one of the following funds premier equity fund growth plan direct only sip allowed right now icici discovery fund growth plan direct microcap fund growth plan direct in case you do not want to be invested in small and mid cap and want a little less volatility then my first choice for that would be quantum long term equity fund dividend plan whatever you go for make sure you go directly with the fund house and not through a broker as you end up getting charged an extra extra as opposed to going direct and you will also be paying for a demat account which can be avoided if you invest directly with a fund house out of the above mentioned funds quantum has the lowest expense ratio of 1.25 and it is a huge benefit if you are talking 10 + years because it makes a lot of difference source my own research and experience as an investor

if you want to make a profit from long term trading whatever long term means for you the best strategy is to let the good performers in your portfolio run and the bad ones   of course that strategy is hard to follow unless you have the perfect foresight to know exactly how long your best performing investments will continue to outperform the market but markets do n't always follow the assumption that perfect information is available to all participants and hence momentum has a real world effect on prices whether or not some theorists have chosen to ignore it but a fixed strategy of daily rebalancing does exactly the opposite of the above it continuously reduces the holdings of good performers and increases the holdings of bad   if this type of rebalancing is done more frequently than the constituents of benchmark index are adjusted it is very likely to underperform the index in the long term other issues in a real world market are the impact of increased dealing costs on smaller parcels of securities and the buy sell spreads incurred in the daily rebalancing trades if the market is up and down 1 on alternate days with no long trend quite likely the fund will be repeatedly buying and selling small parcels of the same stocks to do its daily balancing

and the weird shit is that it 's actually kind of good thing for the banks to do that   if there is lot 's of money around on people it means they can invest it on something that investment helps new businesses to emerge and employ more people   if there would be less money around the rich dudes would still invest but there could not be so much competition in investing so they could ask for higher interests    this would mean that the system is rewarding someone more not because he is taking bigger risks or because he is driving the economy into efficient direction but because there just happens to be shortage of money   does more money imply that more people will invest yes because of inflation they have to invest not to lose actually that 's why governments maintain inflation so that people are forced to invest

that happens all the time the best situation for this to happen is when you have several products each a bit better and a bit more expensive than the other and you add a new product which is the cheapest that gets people into the store to look at the cheapest product and then you show the the next more expensive which is so much better for only a little more money and the next more expensive which is again so much better you might not sell any of the cheapest product but it helps you sell the others   also happens the other way round you add a really expensive item unaffordable for most customers that is really really nice then customers look at it and you show them that for half the price they can have something that is almost as nice the expensive product increases the amount that customers think is the right price for that kind of product a customer might think that $ 2,000 for a diamond ring is an awful lot of money but if you show them another ring for $ 5,000 then suddenly the $ 2,000 does n't look that expensive anymore and if it is almost as nice as the $ 5,000 ring you sell a lot of rings for $ 2,000 because you had the more expensive ring in the store

if you receive a loan from your parents it is treated legally just as a loan a bank or from any private person with spare money you do n't pay tax on a loan that you get from your bank or your parents and the bank or your parents do n't pay tax when you repay the loan if you pay interest the parents will have to pay tax on the interest just like they would have to pay tax if the money was in their own bank account   i would advice both you and your parents to make sure that a contract is signed saying that this is a loan and how it is repaid and that you follow the contract otherwise if you or your parents treat the loan as an actual present then you might have to pay tax because there is tax due on gifts and you might get a penalty for trying to avoid tax by declaring the gift as a loan so pay the money back only up to £ 3,000 in cash gifts that a person gives each year is tax free but the parents can use any unused money from last year so they can give a gift of £ 6,000 if they gave nothing in the previous year and it is per parent so both the mother and father can make a gift

what you are describing sounds a lot like the way we handle our household budget   this is possible but quite difficult to do with an excel spreadsheet   it is much easier to do with dedicated budgeting software designed for this purpose when choosing personal budgeting software i 've found that the available packages fall in two broad categories some packages take what i would call a proactive approach you enter in your bank account balances and assign your money into spending categories   when you deposit your paycheck you do the same thing you add this money to your spending categories   then when you spend money you assign it to a spending category and the software keeps track of your category balances   at any time you can see both your bank balances and your spending category balances   if you need to spend money in a category that does n't have any more money you 'll need to move money from a different category into that one   this approach is sometimes called the envelope system because it resembles a digital version of putting your cash into different envelopes with different purposes   a few examples of software in this category are you need a budget ynab mvelopes and everydollar other packages take more of a reactive approach you do n't bother assigning a job to the money already in your bank account   instead you just enter your monthly income and put together a spending plan   as you spend money you assign the transactions to a spending category and at the end of the month you can see what you actually spent vs. what your plan was and try to adjust your next budget accordingly   software that takes this approach includes quicken and mint.com i use and recommend the proactive approach and it sounds from your question like this is the approach that you are looking for   i 've used several different budgeting software packages and my personal recommendation is for ynab the software that we currently use   i do n't want this post to sound too much like a commercial but i believe it will do everything you are looking for    one of the great things about the proactive approach in my opinion is how credit card accounts are handled   since your spending category balances only include real money actually sitting in an account not projected income for the month when you spend money out of a category with your credit card the software deducts the money from the spending category immediately as it is already spent   the credit card balance goes negative   when the credit card bill comes and you pay it this is handled in the software as an account transfer from your checking account to your credit card account   the money in the checking account is already set aside for the purpose of paying your credit card bill dedicated budgeting software generally has a reconcile feature that makes verifying your bank statements very easy   you just enter the date of your bank statement and the balance and then the software shows you a list of the transactions that fall in those dates   you can check each one against the transactions on the statement editing the ones that are n't right and adding any that are missing from the software   after everything checks out the software marks the transactions as verified so you can easily see what has cleared and what has n't let me give you an example to clarify in response to your comment   this example is specific to ynab but other software using the same approach would work in a similar way let 's say that you have a checking account and a credit card account   your checking account named checking has $ 2,000 in it currently   your credit card currently has nothing charged on it because you 've just paid your bill and have n't used it yet this billing period   ynab reports the balance of your credit card account we 'll call this account creditcard as $ 0 every dollar in checking is assigned to a category   for example you 've got $ 200 in groceries $ 100 in fast food $ 300 in rent $ 50 in phone $ 500 in emergency fund etc   if you add up the balance of all of your categories you 'll get $ 2,000 let 's say that you 've written a check to the grocery store for $ 100   when you enter this in ynab you tell it the name of the store the account that you paid with checking and the category that the expense belongs to groceries   the groceries category balance will go down from $ 200 to $ 100 and the checking account balance will go down from $ 2,000 to $ 1,900 now let 's say that you 've spent $ 10 on fast food with your credit card   when you enter this in ynab you tell it the name of the restaurant the account that you paid with creditcard and the category that the expense belongs to fast food   ynab will lower the fast food category balance from $ 100 to $ 90 and your creditcard account balance will go from $ 0 to $ -10 at this point if you add up all the category balances you 'll get $   and if you add up your account balances you 'll also get $ because checking has $ 1,900 and creditcard has $ -10   if you get your checking account bank statement at this time the account balance of $ 1,900 should match the statement and you 'll see the payment to the grocery store assuming the check has cleared   and if the credit card bill comes now you 'll see the fast food purchase and the balance of $ -10 when you write a check to pay this credit card bill you enter this in ynab as an account transfer of $ 10 from checking to creditcard   this transfer does not affect any of your category balances they remain the same   but now your checking account balance is down to $ and creditcard is back to $ 0 this works just as well whether you have one checking account and one credit card or 2 checking accounts 2 savings accounts and 3 credit cards   when you want to spend some money you look at your category balance   if there is money in there then the money is available to spend somewhere in one of your accounts   then you pick an account you want to pay with and looking at the account balance if there is n't enough money in that account to pay it you just need to move some money from another account into that one or pick a different account   when you pay for an expense with a credit card the money gets deducted from the category balances immediately and is no longer available to spend on something else

although it may be a little late for you the real answer is this   when you close on a mortgage for a primary residence you are in an affidavit two intents now these are intentions not guarantees so if a homeowner has a change of circumstance and can not meet these affirmed intentions there is almost always no penalty   frankly the mortgage holder 's primary concern is you make payments on time and they likely wo n't bother with any inquiry    that being said should a homeowner have a pattern of buying primary residences and in less than 1 year converting that primary to a rental and purchasing a new primary there will likely be a grounds for prosecution for mortgage fraud in your specific situation you can not legally sign the owner occupancy affidavit with the intention of not staying for 1 year   a solution would be to purchase the condo as a second home or investment both of which you can still typically get 80 financing   a second home is tricky i would ask your lender what their requirements are for 2nd home classification    outside that you could buy the condo as a primary stay in it for a year then convert   if you absolutely had to purchase the 2nd property before 1 year you could buy it as a primary with a 2 month rent back once you reach 10 months   should you need it earlier just buy the 2nd house as an investment then once you move in refinance it as a primary this last strategy requires some planning ahead and you should explain your intention to the loan officer ahead of time so they can properly price the non owner occupied loan

technically this does n't seem like a scam but i do n't think the system is beneficial   they use a lot of half truths to convince you that their product is right for you some of the arguments presented and my thoughts do n't buy term and invest the rest because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn from the rest    also do n't invest in a 401k because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn they are correct that you wo n't know exactly how much you 'll have due to stock market but that does n't mean the stock market is a bad place to put your money   investing in a 401k is risky because of the harsh 401k withdrawal rules   yes 401ks have withdrawal rules ca n't typically start before 59.5 must start by 70.5 but those rules do n't hamper my investing style in any way     most term life insurance policies do n't pay out   they are correct again but their conclusions are wrong yes most people do n't die while you have a term insurance policy which is why term life insurance is relatively cheap    but they are n't arguing you do n't need insurance just that you need their insurance which is better you need the guaranteed growth they offer   the chart used to illustrate their guaranteed growth includes non guaranteed dividends    they invest $ 10,000 per year for 36 years and end up with $ 1,000,000    that 's a 5 return   i use 10 for my estimate of stock market performance but let 's say it 's only 8    the same $ 10,000 per year results in over $ 2 million dollars   using 10.5 average return of the s&p 500 over it 's lifetime the result is a staggering $ 3.7 million    so if i 'm looking at $ 3.7 m vs. $ 1 m it costs me $ 2.7 million dollars to give me the same coverage as my term life policy that 's one expensive term life insurance policy my personal favorite blindly following the advice of wall street and financial gurus such as dave ramsey and suze orman got you where you are are you happy with the state of your finances do you still believe their buy term insurance and invest the difference   yes i sure do believe that and i 'm quite well thank you while i do n't think this is a scam it 's outrageously expensive and not a good financial choice

index funds can be a very good way to get into the stock market it 's a lot easier and cheaper to buy a few shares of an index fund than it is to buy a few shares in hundreds of different companies an index fund will also generally charge lower fees than an actively managed mutual fund where the manager tries to pick which stocks to invest for you while the actively managed fund might give you better returns by investing in good companies instead of every company in the index that does n't always work out and the fees can eat away at that advantage stocks on average are expected to yield an annual return of 4 after inflation consider that when you see an expense ratio of 1 index funds should charge you more like or so possibly more if it 's an exotic index the question is what sort of index you 're going to invest in the standard and poor 's 500 s&p 500 is a major index and if you see someone talking about the performance of a mutual fund or investment strategy there 's a good chance they 'll compare it to the return of the s&p 500 moreover there are a variety of index funds and exchange traded funds that offer very good expense ratios e.g. vanguard 's etf charges very cheap you can also find some funds which try to get you exposure to the entire world stock market e.g. vanguard total world stock etf nyse vt an index fund is probably the ideal way to start a portfolio easy and you get a lot of diversification later when you have more money available you can consider adding individual stocks or investing in specific sectors or regions someone else suggested brazil russia indo china or brics having some money invested in that region is n't necessarily a bad idea but putting all or most of your money in that region would be if brics are more of your portfolio then they are of the world economy your portfolio is n't balanced also while these countries are experiencing a lot of economic growth that does n't always mean that the companies that you own stock in are the ones which will benefit small businesses and new ventures may make up a significant part of that growth bond funds are useful when you want to diversify your portfolio so that it 's not all stocks there 's a bunch of portfolio theory built around asset allocation strategies the idea is that you should try to maintain a target mix of assets whatever the market 's doing the basic simplified guideline about investing for retirement says that your portfolio should have your in bonds e.g. a 30-year old should have 30 in bonds a old 50 this helps maintain a balance between the volatility of your portfolio the stock market 's ups and downs and the rate of return you want to earn money when you can but when it 's almost time to spend it you do n't want a sudden stock market crash to wipe it all out bonds help preserve that value but do n't have as nice of a return the other idea behind asset allocation is that if the market changes e.g. your stocks go up a lot while your bonds stagnate you rebalance and buy more bonds if the stock market subsequently crashes you move some of your bond money back into stocks this basically means that you buy low and sell high just by maintaining your asset allocation this is generally more reliable than trying to time the market and move into an asset class before it goes up and move out before it goes down market timing is just speculation you get better returns if you guess right but you get worse returns if you guess wrong commodity funds are useful as another way to diversify your portfolio and can serve as a little bit of protection in case of crisis or inflation you can buy gold silver platinum and palladium etfs on the stock exchanges having a small amount of money in these funds is n't a bad idea but commodities can be subject to violent price swings moreover a bar of gold does n't really earn any money and owning a share of a precious metals etf will incur administrative storage and insurance costs to boot a well run business does earn money assuming you 're saving for the long haul retirement or something several decades off my suggestion for you would be to start by investing most of your money in index funds to match the total world stock market with something like the aforementioned nyse vt for instance a small portion in bonds and a smaller portion in commodity funds for all the negative stuff i 've said about market timing it 's pretty clear that the bond market is very expensive right now and so are the commodities then as you do additional research and determine what sort investments are right for you add new investment money in the places that you think are appropriate stock funds bond funds commodity funds individual stocks sector specific funds actively managed mutual funds et cetera and try to maintain a reasonable asset allocation have fun most of your investment money you should have a separate fund for emergencies and do n't invest money in stocks if you know you 're going need it within the next few years

all other things being equal you might be better off contributing to a ira that is a brokerage account   you will have lots of flexibility in your investments and there would probably not be fees for the account itself   you might incur commissions for trading and/or owning mutual funds that are charged by the funds themselves    you wo n't be able to borrow from an ira as opposed to a 401k.   imho that is a good thing are you suggesting that you would withdraw early from a retirement account   you 'd probably be better off not doing that   assuming a large salary you would be paying 43 to withdraw your money early   would you accept a loan at 43 interest    you are probably better off not putting the money in in the first place to accomplish your goals then withdrawing it early most people opt for a 401 k for two reasons   the company match and ease of investment make a compelling argument   keep in mind if a 401 k is available to you regardless if you you start phasing out your ira deduction at 60 k a year single or 96 k married   given your huge salary comments i imagine an ira would not be an option in your scenario given that if you leave a job you can roll your 401 k balance into a trading account

to expand on mhoran 's answer once you mention the 401(k we 're compelled to ask a what is the match if any and b what are the expenses within the funds offered   depositing to get the full match is going to get you the biggest return on your money it 's common to get a dollar for dollar match on the first 5 or 6 of your income if the fees are high you stop at the match and move to an ira for the next money you wish to save   at 22 i 'd probably focus on the roth if you have access to a roth 401(k that 's great the match will be pre tax dollars and you 'll get started with a decent tax status mix   these accounts can form the core of your investing most people have little left over once their retirement accounts are fully funded and yes reading to understand stocks is great but also to understand why stock indexing is the best choice for most investors

most people will never need to pay federal gift taxes the federal gift taxes start after giving away million over the course of your life this number is adjusted annually for inflation there are only two states that i know of which impose state gift taxes connecticut and minnesota in connecticut you need to start paying taxes if the lifetime value of your gifts exceed two million in minnesota it starts at 1 million   the federal tax is paid for by the person making the gift unless other arrangements are made there is an annual exclusion amount of approximately $ 14,000 you can give up to this amount to any number of recipients and it is not considered taxable therefore when you give $ 100 to someone it is not a taxable event   if you do make a gift to an individual in excess of 14k you 'll need to file a gift tax return irs form 709 when you file form 709 you wo n't need to pay taxes until the million is exceeded instead you can claim an exemption since most people do n't exceed that amount its rare to ever pay taxes even when exceeding the annual exclusion amount the annual exclusion amount is adjusted each year for inflation

banks make far more money on bad debtors   the interest rates and penalties for getting behind on payments are pretty absurd   there was a law passed in 2005 that made it extremely difficult for people to continue to file for personal bankruptcy so the banks thought they were safe   this could 've been extremely lucrative for them had there not been an snowball effect of the rates doubling thus forcing many to search for last resorts plus the fact that so many houses were now underwater due to dropping housing prices at the same time   if they default then the bank just keeps the house win for the bank unless the housing market sucks so they ca n't unload it and they have to take a huge lose even if they could

cash has zero value until it is transformed into something material    cash hoarders realize no improvement in their lifestyle by gaining more cash than they need    if corporations are already so flush with cash they only inflate the stock market why would further tax breaks improve anything    an inflated stock market only improves income for very few    people who need money will spend it and put it back into circulation    people will not hoard cash if they know more will show up regardless of their ability to perform    less financial pressure and less resentment of the rich for their preferential treatment would create a more positive attitude among the population and improve productivity    a happier work force is a more productive work force    people should only work part time anyway so they can have a life outside of work to enjoy their lives while they have the health to do it    your life away until you ca n't do the things you always wanted to do does not improve a person 's outlook    life according to me    was a reduction in unemployment compensation medicare and snap payments included in the study    there may be a reduction in spending on crime and addiction as well

my parents and i were suckered into buying this kind of thing when i was in high school the sales people literally told us that it could be used to pay off student loans they left out the in the event of your death part we knew it was a life insurance policy but were told that it would mature 6 months after graduation from college and that it would then be disbursed to pay off loans even if i did n't die that seemed strange to us so we explicitly asked several different ways whether it would pay off the loans after graduation even if i lived and they just straight up told us yes i 'm guessing this ploy is still being used also last i checked student loans are non transferable in the unfortunate event that your child dies which means the loan is forgiven anyway so this whole thing seems like garbage to me at least in the student loan sense i would steer clear from this stuff it 's pure snake oil in my experience

no something does n't seem right here   there would be virtually no time value to the option 10 minutes before market close on the expiration day what option is it and what is the expiration edit it appears you were looking only at the ask price it was $ however the bid price was only $ 1.35 and the last transaction was $ 1.40 so the true value is right about $ 1.35 to $ 1.40 at this second   this is a pitfall that tends to occur when you trade options with almost no volume for instance the open interest in that option is only 1 contract assuming that is yours so the bid and the ask can often be very far apart as they are only being generated by computer traders or the result of outdated irrelevant human orders

make sure you are paid on volume not people   almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others   that 's not bad it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs   that 's what the commissions are for   the largest cost of distributing a product outside of mlm is advertising and marketing   if i remember correctly this adds up to about 66 of the cost of the product   if that 's true an mlm has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive but when all is said and done you should be paid on volume just like a sales manager position in a company   a sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff but once they are out producing the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff   if an mlm is setup the same way then this is good   if they are setup to pay on recruiting people then run away as quickly as you can the biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it   it 's whether or not the people you recruit can do it i have been involved with an mlm of sorts for 10 years   it pays a nice continual flow of income   i worked it hard for about 6 years and have ever since   the problem was attrition   it was greater than i ever imagined   it became very   i never have and never will be a high pressure person   i would show them the business and if they were interested great if not great   the problem was that people became interested but did n't have the skills to be successful   i should never have let them join the business   so they leave the business and say that mlm is bad   no it just was n't right for them or they were n't right for it regardless of what business you join make sure that you believe that everyone you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing   if they do great otherwise do n't even show it to them

i understand you make money by buying low and selling high you can also make money by buying high and selling higher short selling high and buying back low short selling low and buying back even lower an important technique followed by many technical traders and investors is to trade with the trend so if the shares are trending up you go long buy to open and sell to close if the shares are trending down you go short sell to open and buy to close but even if the stock price goes up why are we guaranteed that there is some demand for it   there is never any guarantees in investing or trading the only guarantee in life is death but that 's a different subject there is always some demand for a share or else the share price would be zero or it would never sell i.e zero liquidity there are many reasons why there could be demand for a rising share price fundamental analysis could indicated that the shares are valued much higher than the current price technical analysis could indicate that the trend will continue greed could get the better of peoples emotion where they think all my are making money from this stock so i should buy it too just to name a few after all it 's more expensive now what determines if a stock is expensive as joe mentioned was apple expensive at $ 100 people who bought it at $ 50 might think so but people who bought at $ 600 + would think $ 100 is very cheap on the other hand a penny stock may be expensive at $ 0.20 it would make sense if we can sell the stock back into the company for our share of the earnings but why would other investors want it when the price has gone up you do n't sell your stocks back to the company for a share of the earnings unless the company has a share buy back arrangement in place you get a share of the earnings by getting the dividends the company distributes to shareholders other investor would want to buy the stock when the price has gone up because they think it will go up further and they can make some money out of it some of the reasons for this are explained above

i 'm afraid the great myth of limited liability companies is that all such vehicles have instant access to credit   limited liability on a company with few physical assets to underwrite the loan or with insufficient revenue will usually mean that the owners or others will be asked to stand surety on any credit however there is a particular form of credit available to businesses on terms with their clients   it is called factoring factoring is a financial transaction    whereby a business sells its accounts    receivable i.e. invoices to a third    party called a factor at a discount    in exchange for immediate money with    which to finance continued business    factoring differs from a bank loan in    three main ways first the emphasis    is on the value of the receivables    essentially a financial asset not    the firm ’s credit worthiness    secondly factoring is not a loan it    is the purchase of a financial asset    the receivable finally a bank loan    involves two parties whereas factoring    involves three recognise that this can be quite expensive   most banks catering to small businesses will offer some form of factoring service or will know of services that offer it   it is n't that different from cheque services pay day services where you offer a discount on future income for money now an alternative is simply to ask his clients if they 'll pay him faster if he offers a discount since either of interest payments or factoring would reduce profitability anyway

when you sell a stock that you own you realize gains or losses short term gains realized within a year of buying and selling an asset are taxed at your maximum or marginal tax rate long term gains realized after a year are taxed at a lower preferential rate the first thing to consider is losses losses can be cancelled against gains reducing your tax liability losses can also be carried over to the next tax year and be redeemed against those gains when you own a bunch of the same type of stock bought at different times and prices you can choose which shares to sell this allows you to decide whether you realize short- or long term gains or losses this is known as lot matching or order matching you want to sell the shares that lost value before selling the ones that gained value booking losses reduces your taxes booking gains increases them if faced with a choice between booking short term and long term losses i 'd go with the former since net short term gains are taxed at a higher rate i 'd want to minimize the short term tax liability before moving on to long term tax liability if my remaining shares had gains i 'd sell the ones purchased earliest since long term gains are taxed at a lower rate and delaying the booking of gains converts short term gains into long term ones if there 's a formula for this i 'd say it 's   profit loss x tax bracket = tax paid

one easy way to monitor costs in quickbooks is to establish sub bank accounts    for example you may have an asset account called state bank numbered asset cash and cash equivalents bank convert this to a parent account for a middle school by making subaccounts such as at budget formation transfer $ 800 from operations to family fun committee   then write all checks for family fun from the family fun subaccount    for fundraising transfer $ 0 at budget formation to the x grade accounts   do deposit all grade level receipts into the appropriate grade level subaccounts and write all checks for the grades from the grade level subaccounts    the downside to the above is that reconciling the check book each month is slightly more complicated because you will be reconciling one monthly paper bank statement to multiple virtual subaccounts also you must remember to never write a check from the parent state bank and instead write the checks from the appropriate subaccounts

the days are long gone when offered mortgages were simply based on salary multiples these days it 's all about affordability taking into account all incomes and all outgoings different lenders will have different rules about what they do and do n't accept as incomes these rules may even vary per product within the same lender 's product list   so for example a mortgage specifically offered as buy to let might accept rental income with a suitable void period multiplier into consideration but an owner mortgage product might not similarly business rules will vary about acceptance of regular overtime bonuses and so on guessing at specific answers 1 maybe if it 's a buy to let product note that these generally carry a higher interest rate than owner mortgages expect about 2 more 2 in my opinion it 's extremely unlikely that any lender would consider rental income from your spouse 3 probably yes if it 's a buy to let product

as far as i can recall savings and chequing accounts exist due to regulations on the banking industry that put were into effect after the depression to prevent a run on the bank    a chequing account is a demand account meaning you can go and demand your money and they have to pay immediately by means of a withdrawal or a cheque   banks used to get out of hand and loan out pretty much all the money they had on deposit and of course those people with loans just put the money they borrowed into another chequing account and the bank loaned that out to someone else   the money that people believed they had access to multiplied indefinitely   however when everyone goes to take that money out at the same time you have a run on the bank   therefore government regulations stipulate a that the bank must have on hand   the typical number is 5   that effectively limits the money multiplier to 19 times savings accounts get around this restriction by putting limits on how much and how quickly you can withdraw the amounts   they pay you more interest because the money in a savings account is worth more to them because it 's not subject to those restrictions some chequing accounts pay interest but you have to maintain a minimum balance   some savings accounts allow you to write cheques but i assume the withdrawal limitations probably still apply there 's also something to do with deposit insurance as in the chequing accounts are covered by government deposit insurance but savings accounts are not   i 'm not 100 certain of that though

theory of levered investing borrowing in order to increase investment exposure is a time honored and legitimate activity   it 's the optimal way to increase your exposure according to finance theory which assumes you get a good interest rate more on this later   in your case it may or may not be a good idea   based on the information in your post i believe that in your case it is not a good idea   consider the following concerns risk in finance reward comes with risk and in no other way   investing borrowed money means there is a good not small chance that you will lose enough money that you will need to pull significant wealth from your own savings in order to make up the difference   if you are in a position to do this and ok with that possibility then proceed to to the next concern   if losing a lot of money means financial calamity for you then this is a bad idea   you have n't described your financial situation so i do n't know in which camp you fall   if the idea of losing say $ 100 k means complete financial failure for you then the strategy you have described simply has too much risk make no mistake just because the market makes money on average does not mean it will make money or as much money as you expect over your horizon   it may lose money perhaps a lot of money make sure this idea is very clear in your mind before taking action rewards your post implies that you think you can reliably get on an investment this is not the case   there are many years in which a reasonable portfolio makes this much or more but on average you will earn less no ones knows the true long term market risk premium but it is definitely less than 10   a better guess would be 6.5 plus whatever the risk free rate is currently about 0   buying riskier investments means from the optimal portfolio meaning you took on more risk than is justified by how much extra money you expect to make   i never encourage people to invest based on optimistic or unrealistic goals   if anything you should be conservative about how you expect things to go   and remember these are averages any portfolio that earns also has a very good chance of losing 25 or more   people who sell or give advice on investments frequently get you charged up by pointing at times and investments that have done very well   unfortunately we never know whether the investments and time period in which we are investing will be a good one a bad one or an one   the reality of investing is well more realistic than what you have described costs i ca n't imagine how you could borrow that much money and only have an annual payment of $ 2000 as you imply that must be a mistake   no individual borrows at a rate significantly below 1   it sounds like it 's not a collateralized loan of any kind so unless you are some kind of prime loan customer your interest rate will be significant   subtract whatever rate you actually pay from 6.5 to get a rough idea of how much you will make if things go as well as they do on average   you will pay the interest whether times are good or bad if your rate is typical of personal loans there 's a good chance you will lose money on average using the strategy you have described   if you are ok with taking risk with a negative expected return consider a trip to las vegas   it 's more exciting ethics i 'm not one to make people feel guilty for doing things that are legal but of questionable morality   if that 's the case and you are ok with it more power to you i 'm not sure under what pretense you expect to obtain the money but it sounds like you might be crossing legal lines and committing actual crimes like fraud   make sure to check on whether what you intend is a white lie or something that can get you thrown in prison for example if you are proposing obtaining a subsidized education loan and using it for speculation i could easily see you spending serious time in prison and permanently ruining your life even if your plan works out   a judge and 12 of your peers are not going to think welfare fraud is a harmless twist of the truth summary i 've said a lot of negative things here   this is because i have to guess about your financial situation and it sounds like you may have unrealistic expectations of the safety and generosity of investing   quite frankly people for whom borrowing $ 250 k is no big deal do n't normally come and ask about it on stackexchange and they definitely do n't tend to lie in order to get loans   also $ 18 k a year does n't change their quality of life however i do n't know   if $ 250 k is small relative to your wealth and you need a good way to increase your exposure to the market risk premium then borrowing and investing may well be a good idea

it would seem that you are in a position where you are able to save money and you hope to have your money work for you from your statement above it is implied that you are a professional with a steady income not related to the finance field with that said it is better to diversify your portfolio and have your money work for you through passive investments rather than an active one where you actively search for companies that are below market price that research takes time and much more experience in order to properly execute   now if your overall goal is to trade actively then maybe researching individual companies might be the best way to get your feet wet but if your goal is to create a diversified portfolio and make your money work for you then passive is the way to go   two passive financial vehicles   mutual funds and etfs depending on what you are hoping to accomplish in the future an etf or a mutual fund will likely suite your situation i would encourage you to do your due diligence and find out the weakness and strength of each from there you are able to make an informed decision

price is decided by what shares are offered at what prices and who first   the buyer and seller are both trying to find the best offer for their definition of best within the constraints then have set on their bid or ask the seller will sell to the highest bid they can get that they consider acceptable the buyer will buy from the lowest offer they can get that they consider acceptable the price and whether a sale purchase happens at all depends on what other trades are still available and how long you 're willing to wait for one you 're happy with and may be different on one share than another at the same time if the purchase could n't be completed with the single best offer and had to buy from multiple offers this may have been easier to understand in the days of open outcry pit trading when you could see just how chaotic the process is but it all boils down to a high speed version of seeking the best deal in an old fashioned marketplace where no prices are fixed and every sale requires or at least offers the opportunity for negotiation fred sells it five cents cheaper then why are n't you buying from him he 's out of stock well when i do n't have any my price is ten cents cheaper maybe i wo n't buy today or i 'll buy elsewhere maybe i wo n't sell today or maybe someone else will pay my price sam looks interested ok ok i can offer two cents more three sam looks really interested two and a half and throw in an apple for susie done and the next buyer or seller starts the whole process over again open outcry really is just a way of trying to shop around very very very fast and electronic reconciliation speeds it up even more but it 's conceptually the same process either seller gets what they 're asking or they adjust and/or the buyer adjusts until they meet or everyone agrees that there 's no agreement and goes home

rule of thumb to retire with a yearly income of $ x you need to save $ in other words the safe assumption is that you 'll average 4 returns on your stabilized savings investments in the case of retiring with a $ 50k passive pretax income that means you need savings of $ 1 m by the time you retire if you want the $ 50,000 to be real post tax spendable dollars and your savings are n't in something like a roth 401k or roth ira increase that proportionately to account for taxes how you get there depends on what you start with how much you put into it every year how you invest it and how many years you have before your retirement date passive investment alone will not do it unless you start with a lot of money passive ongoing investment may depending on how much you can make yourself save when to find out whether any specific plan will do what you need you have to work with real numbers

what are you talking about the rules are regulations are setup as needed if you give a concrete e.g. maybe if you give a concrete example of where the govt is in the way i can understand rules and regulations are not examples of govt in the way in itself it would be if say you need to do something but you need to petition the govt first for something and there 's tons of bureaucracy or or something else govt just set the rules such as stop at red light etc   govt is not in the way here    the rest of your comments are on same line so this one bullet is enough again you 're just accusing generally with no specifics and i 'm not naive this is real and my opinion govt sets new rules as needed as a response to something not because people in the govt who change every few years feel so you 're talking about changing people in govt all adhering to the same laws because it makes sense to keep it and if not it gets repealed govt is not one same set of people always present from your birth to death govt keeps changing govt does care about fairness and hft 's existing is proof that govt lets free market and private business start things as it pleases till such time as it stops being fair for all    govt is not really an inhibitor to free market govt actually has no to free market because it allows a fair and balanced free market unlike what you 're referring to which is a free market with no rules like the wild wild west we had that free market before and over time people went from unregulated markets to more regulated markets because it is for our own good govt is just people who agreed with it joined the govt and made it so and others agreed if we do n't agree in future it can be changed    there is a term as regulated free market unregulated free market will lead to salesmen and generally a backwards movement to the wild west again   i do n't think you really want to talk you just want to spew your ignorant libertarian viewpoints because you 've heard them somewhere without thinking much about it you just blindly believe the govt is always wrong with no logic or justification just like religious people    just think on a few points and you will see that you are wrong sometimes is the govt perfect heck no is it always right nope but it is some times and it does do the right things many times it does the wrong things at times as well    but i do n't believe like you do at all because i think for myself and reason if you reason on a few points you 'll see the other viewpoint and stop reading or ron paul because they 're not right about govt being always wrong either    i wo n't bother replying to you anymore because you 're just a troll or arrogant smug guy who thinks he knows it all because your friends all think like you and blindly agree with you so you 've never been taken to reason or logic like others have to you on this board look at the other replies to your posts almost all contradict you just think why are they all wrong or perhaps you are

we do n't make enough to really consider it a salary but i 've heard    using a draw without a salary is a bad idea as any other illegal action not paying yourself a   reasonable salary when being a corporate officer is indeed a bad idea i have no idea what i need to do to actually get some money in our    pockets the answer is simple you need to earn more money since it is s corp it does n't matter if you keep the profits on the corporate account or distribute the profits will be taxed to you you are also as i said above required by law to pay yourself a reasonable salary reasonable meaning corresponding to market rates paying a cpa or a software engineer a minimum wage will not be reasonable that is of course if you 're profitable you 're not required to pay yourself more money than the corporation actually has just to be clear my answer refers to the question asked and the confusing answer above that made a claim that has no in the law i do not intend to write a thesis about pros and cons of using s corp every time a question about reasonable salary is asked

it may be the case that some of your debts have a flat regular fee in addition to the interest which will go away when the debt is completely paid for example my mortgage has an approximately $ package fee as well as its quite low interest when i finish paying the mortgage i wo n't have to pay that fee anymore so it is theoretically possible that spending extra money on paying off my mortgage would be better than spending it on paying off some other debt i think it 's unlikely that it would actually ever be my optimal move in practice but the point is there may be an advantage financial or otherwise to getting rid of a particular debt other than merely removing the burden of interest those are special situations though and in the majority of cases starting with the highest interest loan will be the right move

this is an easy question the us government has demonstrated repeatedly that it will bail out the established auto industry    tesla is very very cool and may well bury the rest of the auto industry eventually but they 're not viewed as too big to fail    thus ford 's bonds even if practically junk are essentially backed by us treasury that 's a pretty good deal if you 're looking for ultra low risk

find a physical activity or programme that interests you   memberships only have real value if you use them   consider learning a martial art like karate fu tai do tai chi    even yoga is a good form of exercise many of these are offered at local community centres if you just want to try it out without worrying about the cost initially   use this to gauge your interest before considering more advanced clubs   one advantage later on if you stay with it long enough some places will compensate you for being a junior or even associate instructor regardless of whether this is your interest or if the gym membership is more to your liking real value is achieved if you have a good routine and interest in your physical fitness activity   it also helps to have a workout buddy or partner   they will help motivate you to try even when you do n't feel like working out

answers here are correct but i 'll offer an extremely overly simple explanation that should help you in understanding the more detailed answers   when most people own stock they do so through a broker   unless you jump through some hoops the broker keeps the shares in the name of the brokerage   this is called holding the stock in street name when you sell short through a brokerage the broker is letting you borrow a certain number of shares owned by someone else and sell them for cash now   at some point you need to repay this loan with the same number of shares you borrowed   ideally you want the stock to drop to $ 0   the reason you might be forced to purchase the stock is that the actual owner(s of the stock want to sell   if the broker has too many people wanting to sell you will need to repay some of all of the loan in shares i.e. purchasing shares at the current market price

it just states that the price does n't justify the valuation which is not a factual statement also this is based on someones opinion of the companies p e. the p e was published and public information and idiots on both the buy and sell side jumped in    the article does not make a factual claim about fraud cooking the books speculates that management   and auditors cooked the books

this is exactly what needs to happen for the benefit of the country do n't make this a republican vs democrat thing the mortgage interest deduction causes artificially high home prices and discourages building small affordable homes home purchase prices falling means builders might start building smaller cheaper homes again if it causes a housing crisis it will be for those who bought 3000 sq ft on what used to be farmland    removing the state and local tax deduction means there might finally be incentive for cities to consolidate local and increase overall efficiency again the ultra wealthy that keep poor people out through high taxes will decrease and join other larger local governments this would be a huge plus as far as tax reform goes

you have what is called in the biz a thin file   check with a credit union   they will get you a secured card or maybe a straight credit card   they usually will graduate you from a secured card to a real credit card in 12 18 months then you are on your way    you should also sign up for creditkarma to get your credit report updated every week   they make their money on referring people to credit card companies so you might be able to kill two birds with one stone

your ignorance of global finance and business is showing through   conspiratorial just standard tax optimization scheme as shown by   google amp apple   the tech industry is fundamentally different from   that you ca n't see this is mind boggling   there is nothing standard about the tax optimization schemes done by apple and google that can be copied by grocers   apple and google have vast international operations with revenue coming from multiple countries   they are asset light and have very high profit margins   grocery stores have very small negligible international operations and are asset heavy   try also have very low profit margins   the point of supply and demand they are actually overpaid lots of desperate people that agree to the minimum allowed by law and below that if you include illegal aliens still does n't mean they are paying the living wage   mentioning living wages in an argument about supply and demand tips off that you have no clue what you are talking about   living wage is irrelevant to the supply and demand for labor   what you call desperation for a job dismissed many of the perfectly logical reasons why somebody may choose to work for a low wage   you assume that the equilibrium wage for grocery store workers is below the minimum wage falsely   walmart workers make more than minimum wage on average before benefits are taken into account   illegal aliens ca n't do most grocery store jobs because 1 they ca n't speak english and 2 they probably ca n't do the math needed to be a cashier   teenagers the vast majority of minimum wage workers are increasingly choosing not to work   the supply of people that are able to do these types of jobs is probably not much bigger than it is already   are imported   and they do n't have to set up a supply chain just the bare minimum to legally siphon funds into another company they own be it via interest on credit rent intellectual property i.e. franchise or trademark payments or anything else   this is laughable do you really believe this   grocery stores have absolutely massive supply chain risk   arguably their entire value proposition is in supply chain   you seem to think there 's an evil cabal moving money around to screw people over   this is left wing bullshit conspiracy stuff   you sound like a left wing version of alex jones   show me clear evidence that a grocer is doing this including references in their actual financial statements

is there a place to discuss investment strategy particularly as it pertains to global macro and a variety of asset classes alot of the investing subreddits seem to be based around equity investment only and focused on us large cap for the most part i rarely ever see posts about em equities which have outperformed this year for example and it would be great to talk about things like asset allocation

i 'm not comparing the ows with the tea party    how were the protests at uc davis violent and deserving of   gt;the right to peacefully assemble does not mean you can and block the police from doing their lawful job   correct so you feel the proper response is to people is n't there a better way to move people out of the way my point was that in the past workers fighting for some workplace safety and better wages had kill them because they people fought very very hard and some died to get where we are currently and with the police and the people okay with i am worried about the that might occur when we have to fight again for workplace safety    politicians are rolling back those protections   gt;no they 're not   they are osha is being targeted for budget cuts if there are no osha agents checking that workplaces are safe then workplaces can and will offer less protections to their workers    let me ask you a question what prevents a race to the bottom with wages and benefits if people do n't collectively bargain

your best bet is to remove the excess contribution your broker should have forms to do that there is a 6 tax on the excess contributions for each year that it remains it would be better to just eat the $ 25 fee and get rid of any future headaches

the person who told you no load funds had the right idea   since you are risk averse you tend to want a value fund that is it 's not likely to grow in value that would be a growth fund but it is n't like to fall either to pick an example more or less at random fidelity blue chip value fund usually returns around 8 a year which in your case would have meant about $ 20,000 every year but it 's lost in the last year i like fidelity as a brokerage as well as a fund manager   their brokers are salaried so they have no incentive to push load funds or other things that make them but not you money   for intermediate investors like you and me they seem like a good choice be careful of short term   most funds have some small penalty if you sell within 90 days   carve off whatever amount you think you might need and keep that in your cash account and a piece of personal advice do n't be too risk averse   you do n't need this money   for you the cost of losing it completely is exactly equal as the benefit of doubling it   you can afford to be aggressive think of it this way the expected return of a no load fund is around   for a savings account the return is within rounding error of zero   do you spend that much $ 15,000 on anything in your life right now   any recreation or hobby or activity   maybe your rent or your tuition   why spend it for a vague sense of safety when you are in no danger of losing anything that you need

fx trading platforms are not used for exchanging money they are used for trading currencies i know there are cheaper services like transferwise charging about 0.5 but there is little no control over the exchange rate you just get the rate at the time of execution with fx trading you do n't have control of the exchange rate either just like the share market fx markets are determined by supply and demand of one currency over an other so an individual does not have control over the exchange rate but will just get the rate at the time of the trade being executed

its fraudulent because it is feeds on new investment to pay the old investors the exact definition of a ponzi    and it now is contingent on the faith of the us as with most other debts there is no trust fund of this wealth sitting waiting for us if the usa fails   but do tell me how is ss not a ponzi scheme does it not use new money to pay the old if the new money ran out would it not default on its debts in the future and what part of the constitution says the us government should collect some of my wages and save it for me for later   you do know some people have opted out of ss even the us government will not take the fight to court they know its a sham

a mortgage is simply a loan backed by a property and because it 's both very large and very common covered by some specific laws   as such the bank is n't an investor in your house it simply is lending you money with the property as collateral   so it does n't get any share of the profit as long as you sell the house on your own for more than you owe most of the time in the us you will get about 92 94 of the sale price back minus whatever you owe on the house   the 6 8 you do n't get will go to the realtors as commission unless you sell by owner and do n't sell to someone with a buyer 's agent and to pay some of the costs of the sale how much of those you pay depends on the deal you make with the buyer but it 's common to pay some of them in some areas   you also will owe taxes potentially   you then pay the bank back from that amount as such in your example let 's say bob owes $ 50k on his house and sells it with a realtor for $ 150k   he gets $ 150k = after commission he then hands the bank a check for the current payoff of the loan that amount is usually slightly higher than the remaining principal because you owe the interest that 's accrued between last payment you made and day of sale   let 's say this is a 6 loan which works out to around 0.5 per month and it 's been half a month since his last payment so he owes another 0.25 or another $ 125   some mortgages also may have prepayment penalties check your note   in this case there is n't a penalty so the bank gets $ from the sale   usually the bank would get that immediately at closing ie he does n't get the full $ or $ 150k and then write a check instead the title closing company gets that amount and gives the $ 9k to the realtors the $ to the bank and the remaining $ to him    do n't forget he may also owe income taxes and sometimes other local taxes on the profit on the sale in this case the irs would n't get anything as it 's under $ 250k assuming it 's a primary residence but keep that in mind also in the case of a foreclosure the bank will get some extra money to pay for the costs it incurred in foreclosing on and selling the house
