a company 's stock price will reflect the general sentiment about a company 's value now and in the future net income is only one figure you need to crack open the net summary and see what 's inside it in the financials you reference in your question you 'll also notice that   ultimately the stock price is just a reflection on what the market feels its current future is worth you me other investors with future value calculators and strong opinions on what would provide value for them
# 551492
ideally stock price reflects the value of the company the dividends it is expected to pay and what people expect the future value of the company to be only one of those maybe one and a half is related to current   sales and not always directly short term motion of a stock is even less directly linked since it also reflects previous expectations a company can announce disappointing sales and see its stock go up if the previous price was based on expecting   worse news

cart 's answer is basically correct but i 'd like to elaborate a futures contract both the buyer of a contract and the seller of a contract to conduct the underlying transaction settle at the agreed upon future date and price written into the contract aside from settlement the only other way either party can get out of the transaction is to initiate a closing transaction which means   the party that sold the contract buys back another similar contract to close his position   the party that bought the contract can sell the contract on to somebody else whereas an option contract provides the buyer of the option with the choice of completing the transaction   because it 's a choice the buyer can choose to walk away from the transaction if the option exercise price is not attractive relative to the underlying stock price at the date written into the contract   when an option buyer walks away the option is said to have expired however and this is the part i think needs the original seller writer of the option contract does n't have a choice   if a buyer chooses to exercise the option contract the seller wrote the seller is obligated to conduct the transaction   in such a case the seller 's option contract is said to have been assigned   only if the buyer chooses not to exercise does the seller 's obligation go away   before the option expires the option seller can close their position by initiating a closing transaction   but the seller ca n't simply walk away like the option buyer can

uber should have crushed lyft by being the first to market a long time ago instead they blew their lead by dumping all their money into    1 with google which they will lose and were always bound to lose because nobody at uber has ever heard of or sunk cost fallacies    2 pr scandals until the point where customers actively sought out an alternative not because the product was bad because uber was in many ways a superior product but because they saw uber as a bad company and it takes a lot to lose customers in that situation    what a stupid company

legally speaking if you do close a limited company the funds belong to the government bona there 's some guidance on this at companies house and there is indeed a substantial amount of administration work to get it undone notable excerpts you should deal with any loose ends such as closing the company ’s    bank account the transfer of any domain names before you apply from the date of dissolution any assets of a dissolved company will    belong to the crown the company ’s bank account will be frozen and any    credit balance in the account will pass to the crown 4 what happens to the assets of a dissolved company from the date of dissolution any assets of a dissolved company will    be bona bona literally means vacant goods and    is the technical name for property that passes to the crown because it    does not have a legal owner the company ’s bank account will be frozen    and any credit balance in the account will be passed to the crown chapter 3 restoration by court order the registrar can only restore a company if he receives a court order    unless a company is restored to the register see    chapter 4   anyone who intends to make an application to the court to    restore a company is advised to obtain independent legal advice chapter 4 administrative restoration 1 what is administrative restoration under certain conditions where a company was dissolved because it    appeared to be no longer carrying on business or in operation a    former director or member may apply to the registrar to have the    company restored

most of the answers here reflect a misunderstanding of what gold actually is from a financial perspective   i 'll answer your question by asking two questions and i do challenge you to stop and think about what we mean when we say cash or unit of exchange because without understanding those you will completely miss this answer in 1971 the dxy was 110   for people who do n't know the dxy is the us dollar index it weighs the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies   hey look it 's a pretty graph of the dxy 's history in 1971 gold was $ 35 an ounce the dxy is 97 today gold is $ an ounce today now the questions if shares of company a in 1971 were $ 10 a share but now are $ 100 a share and some of this is because the company has grown but some of it is because of inflation and the dxy losing value what would the value of the company be if it was held in grams of gold and not dollars benjamin graham who influenced warren buffett is a supposed critic of gold yet what percent of his life were we not on a gold standard   in his day the dollar was backed by gold why would you buy gold if every dollar represented gold finally consider how many us dollars exist and how few metric tonnes of gold exist   even paul volcker admitted that a new gold standard would be impossible because the value of gold if we did it today would put gold in the $ range which is absurd to get on a gold standard technically now an old fashioned gold    standard and you had to replace all the dollars out there in foreign    hands with gold god the price you buy gold because the price of    gold would have to be enormous so you 're all left hoping the federal reserve figures how to get us all out of this mess without causing trouble otherwise let me just kindly say you will realize the value of gold then as the old saying goes a fool and his money are soon   i could be wrong but i 'd say that those who 've been buying gold since 1971 for their cash holdings not index funds are n't the suckers

the insurance company is must assume you do have a preexisting condition you are unaware of   the reason for that is that affordable care act precludes the insurance company from denying coverage of them if you do   insurance companies are businesses   they are in business to make you have a nonprofit insurer   they can not do that if you can buy insurance only when you need for them to pay out   so even though you may not have a preexisting condition they are from requiring an examination that would detect the most expensive preexisting conditions hidden cancers disorders   so the companies must do what takes business sense and either deny you coverage or charge a rate that covers the risk they would be forced to take    in your question on travel there was a response that suggested you get international health insurance instead of travel health insurance that would be considered credible coverage   you are trying to save money which on a personal level is a good idea   however that is against the societal and business need that you maintain health coverage during your healthy times to cover the costs of those who need expensive treatment   so you will be monetarily penalized should you choose to the society of insured people   once you have paid the higher rate for up to 18 months you should be able to get a better policy for people who have had continuous coverage   alternately you may be lucky enough to start working for a company that provides health insurance with out requiring continuous coverage

the case you are looking at is rather special because the chinese government for the longest time did not allow foreigners to invest in chinese stocks the adrs explained in 's answer are a way around that restriction recently there are some limited official ways   in general it is perfectly normal for a stock to appear on different exchanges in different currencies and it 's all the real stock because remember a stock exchange is really nothing more than a fancy place for people to buy and sell stocks there is absolutely no reason why a specific stock should only be traded in one place companies that have decided to be publically tradeable generally want to be traded in as many exchanges as possible because it makes the stock more liquid which helps their shareholders individual exchanges have different requirements for a stock to be listed for trading there some may even do it without the company 's explicit approval

# 559618
somehow i just stumbled onto this thread   gt you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off    depends on leverage with fractional reserve lending   banks are permitted to loan out 30x their actual assets or more   if i have $ 1 but can loan out $ 30 and anything more than $ 1 gets paid back i have n't lost any money   in addition i can write off the amount defaulted and the government will pay me back for certain types of loans   with student loans since they are almost impossible to discharge gov't will pursue the borrower for years and decades and ultimately collect more interest   here is an article on it     gt according to the government stands to earn $ more in interest from a $ 10,000 loan that defaulted than if it had been paid in full over a 20-year term and $ more than if it had been paid back in 10 years alan founder of borrowers rights advocacy student loan justice said the high recovery rates provide a perverted incentive for the government to allow loans to go into default estimates the recovery rate would need to fall to below 50 in order for default prevention efforts to become more lucrative than defaults themselves    not to mention     gt so essentially the department is given a choice   either do nothing and get nothing or outlay cash with the knowledge that this outlay will realize a 22 percent return ultimately minus the governments cost of money and collection costs   from this perspective it is clear that based solely on financial motivations and without specific detailed knowledge of the loan i.e. borrower characteristics etc the would clearly favor the default scenario   for not only the   return but perhaps the potential savings in subsidy payment as well      and do n't forget the penalties accruing to the person defaulting they will probably have to move out of the country in order to escape collection   and let 's factor in the huge roi the lender sees by creating an indentured servant class   plus the gov't will issue as much currency as it wants to make itself whole   and how much of a loss is the loss when the whole of the loan amount went right back into the local economy paying professors janitors landlords grocery stores etc   and do n't forget all those taxes income and sale that the gov't collects   government will collect of the loan immediately as income and sales tax plus a portion of it every time the money changes hands i pay income tax then use some of my after tax money to pay you for a product or service and you still have to pay tax on that money and so on   so it 's more complicated than having robbed the person holding the debt   banks at 30x leverage do n't lose money as long as they get back of the total amount lent out including interest fees and penalties before considering write offs and government repayment   in fact the point of over leverage is so you can make loans that have risk attached   if you could only lend what you actually had you would have to stay away from anything risky because it would be too easy to lose money   having virtual $ to bet means you can serve market segments that have higher risk   this makes more money for the banks that 's why they do it   they are already playing with funny money so they do n't lose any even if you default and move to another country   and the money you spent has also made its way back to them in various amounts such as your professor 's mortgage payments auto loan etc   your taking on debt already helped the bank get its other loans repaid   so roughly speaking if you took out $ 90,000 and $ 3,000 of that made its way back to the bank through various means they have n't lost any money because it only cost them $ 3,000 actual dollars in the first place

correct long short strategies should have zero beta with the stock market but this is intentional and investors in true hedged funds seek this portable alpha as a complement to their long only sleeve in the portfolio   my question is if for example you are long low p e stocks and a short high p e stocks what creates the alpha your portfolio should have zero beta i believe in the long run this long short p e strategy generates basis points of return per year un pages faculty   is not reasonable to assume if returns from long only investing is driven by beta and investors use 6 to 12 discount rates in their valuation models then an an un levered long short strategy should always under perform a long only strategy in the long run the purpose of long short strategies is not to beat long only investing it is to create portable wiki   in fact at a high level of abstraction the average long short strategy should not earn a return greater than the risk free rate in the long run because the strategy has zero beta

this is a bit complicated because of all the moving parts but is a little simpler because the two warrants are now publicly traded   the main rule appears to be that your cost should be apportioned into the bases for the pieces you received by the proportions of the prices established in the market on the first day of trading in which they trade separately source   since the a and b gm warrants began trading in march 2011 at least that 's what a quick search shows use their prices and the gm price on the same day to establish the proportions   you also must include the factor of how much of each piece you received for each of your bonds so for example if the prices of gm and were $ 32 $ 23 and $ 17 on the first day of trading and you got 3 shares gm 2 a warrants and 1 b warrant for your bonds their worth on first day of separate trading would be and so the proportion of your bond cost to be allocated to your a warrants for instance would be or about using these example figures the small of additional securities you have received already i would include in the calculation above and if you in the future receive any further i would assign them a basis of $ 0 as your full bond cost would have already been completely allocated

the answer is yes and the reason is if today 's interest rates are lower than the interest rate coupon at which the bond was issued the bond 's lifetime value is 100 cents on the dollar that 's the principal repayment that the investor will get on the maturity date but suppose the bond 's coupon rate is 4 while today 's interest rate is 3 then people who bought the bond at 100 would get 4 on their money while everyone else was getting 3 to compensate a three year bond would have to rise to almost 103 so that the so called yield to maturity would be 3 then there would be a capital loss from almost 103 to 100 that would exactly offset the extra interest that is 1 more for three years if today 's interest rates are negative as they were from time to time in the 1930s and in the present decade the negative interest rates will prevent the buyer from getting the lifetime value as defined by the op of principal plus interest over the original life of the bond this happens in a flight to quality situation where people are willing to take a small capital loss on treasuries in order to prevent a large possible loss from bank failures like those that took place in 2008

it has got to do with the irrationality of humans   the so called long term investor is in it for the long term they are not worried about market fluctuations nor timing the market but yet they will aim to try to get a bargain when they buy in   it is contradictory in a way think about it if i buy a stock and it drops by 30 i am not worried because i am in it for the long term but i am worried about getting 1 off when i buy it   they usually tend to buy when the stock starts falling however what they do n’t realise is when a stock starts falling there is no telling when it will stop so even if they get a bargain for that day it is usually quickly wiped out a few days later instead of waiting for the price to find support and start recovering they are eager to buy what they think is a bargain i think this type of long term investing is very risky and the main reason is because the investor has no plan they just try to buy so called bargain stocks and hold them until they need the money usually in retirement but what happens if the stock price is lower when they want to retire than when they bought it i hope no long term investor was trying to retire in 2008 if they simply had a plan to indicate when they would buy and under what conditions they would sell and have a risk management plan in place then maybe they could reduce their risk somewhat and conserve their capital a good article to read on this is what 's wrong with long term investing

it is n't as simple as just borrowing money this is more of an economics question but there are reasons to borrow money simple example being when the economy is growing too slowly and reasons to increase taxes basic example being when the economy is growing too fast check out monetary and fiscal policy on investopedia or youtube this should give you a good understanding    now one more thing to consider is the risk of governments defaulting on their loans in a simple sense the more debt a government has the more risk there is to default this means people who lend the government money will want a higher interest rate making it harder for the government to borrow money

i would strongly try to influence circumstances so that buying is feasible that means buy something where it is likely that you can resell it at the same price or even higher or at the least for significantly more than total cost of ownership rent payed elsewhere for example if it is in an area where you have good reasons to assume that prices will go up in the future or if the object needs and you are sure that you can do it yourself you will no doubt sell it later you will near certainly not live in such a small house for all time so the question of whether you will sell it is moot so when you have a potential house to buy you will have to calculate everything very carefully with an estimate of how long you will stay you need to make your calculation as optimistic pessimistic as you like this is more a question of your character whatever calculation comes out better wins it goes without saying that if you for example overestimating your ability or time to refurbish forgetting to calculate non obvious costs of being surprised by hidden damage to the object the price development in the area you run a considerable risk so the question of whether you are able to calculate the risks correctly will need to influence the calculation itself add 20 or whatever risk buffer if you are not sure etc but the potential is for you to have a very good start in the whole financial game of your life your house will likely be for a considerable time the biggest single part of costs in your life and getting that under control from the get go is a huge benefit

i read up on it and saw that the irs can charge the loan provider on    interest even if the loan provider does n't charge interest but this    is normally mitigated by the 0 interest being considered a gift and    as long as it 's below x amount your fine yes this sums it up x is the amount of the gift exemption the $ however you must differ between loan with no interest and loan with no paying back with loan with no interest you 're still giving a statutory gift of the irs mandated minimum interest however the principal is expected to be repaid to you and you must show that this expectation is reasonably fulfilled if you can not i.e. you gave a loan with no intention of it being paid back then the irs will recharacterize the whole amount as the gift and you 'll be on the hook for gift tax for the amounts above the exemption what defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the irs is it simply that    the loan will be paid back or is it only considered a loan if a    note is made as i said you must be able to show that the loan is indeed a loan even if it is with no interest i.e. it is being repaid it is treated as a loan by all parties and is not an attempt to evade gift tax promissory note is not a must but will definitely be helpful in showing that but without the de facto repayment of the loan it will be hard to argue that it is not a gift even if you have a promissory note that means you should make a loan in such a way that the borrower will begin repaying it reasonably soon so that you can show payment schedule being followed and money moving back to you reasonably soon is not of course defined in a statute so do consult with a ea cpa licensed in your state on how to structure the loan so that it will not appear as an attempt to evade the gift tax are there any limits on how big a loan can be no but keep in mind that even with statutory interest charges published by the irs monthly see the link with large enough loan you can exceed the gift tax exemption also keep in mind that interest is taxable income to you even if you gift it back i.e. the statutory interest

you 're mostly correct although i think you 're missing something essential about no arbitrage versus an arbitrage argument   black scholes makes an arbitrage argument which is that the value of an option should be the same as any portfolio that has identical cash flows and this is generally a sound argument   notice however that bs is ultimately an equilibrium model it tells you the correct price of an option if the assumptions of bs hold and does n't necessarily match observed market prices   a no arbitrage condition or model deliberately incorporates observed prices or yields or whatever into the model so that there can not be an arbitrage opportunity implied by the model   this comes up a lot in term structure of interest rate problems where equilibrium models like or cox ross wo n't perfectly reproduce the current observed term structure and so imply an arbitrage opportunity   no arbitrage models like hull white specifically match the model 's term structure to observed yields prices so that there is no arbitrage opportunity between the observed term structure and your model of it   it 's important to note that this will still allow for arbitrage involving bonds that are not part of the observed term structure   as for equivalent martingale measures you might think about it more generally   the process involves changing the probability distribution from the actual which is hard to use for pricing to a different one that 's easier to use but will result in the same prices this is nearly always a risk neutral probability   you can think of equivalent martingale   pricing as asking how would this security behave and be priced in a world that is completely risk neutral and then making an argument that the prices are in fact equivalent   edit grammar

comparing retirement savings to ordinary investment is not an apples to apples comparison retirement savings are savings for retirement if you want to invest in things now and live off of or reinvest those earnings then retirement accounts are not the right vehicle    that said here are some benefits of the main types of retirement accounts benefits of a 401(k benefits of a ira benefits of a roth 401(k benefits of a roth ira the benefits above are not exhaustive there are other benefits such as using a roth ira for higher ed expenses etc but those are the highlights if you have a plan for how you hope to use the money now rather than later does it make sense to hold onto it if your plan is meant to provide income at retirement and earns returns higher than the returns plus matches and tax benefits you get from retirement accounts then yes it may make more sense but those benefits are generally very hard to beat   plus having the money locked away in an account that is painful to tap can be a good thing you 're less tempted to use that money for foolish decisions which everyone makes at some point

put options are contracts to sell you pay me a fee for the right to put the stock or other underlying security in my hands if you want to that happens on a specific date the strike date and a specified price the strike price you can decide not to exercise that right but i must follow through and let you sell it to me if you want to put options can be used by the purchaser to cap losses for example you purchase a put option for ge from me on october 19th you can make me let you sell your ge stock to me for $ a share if the price for ge has fallen to $ that would be a good idea if its now at $ 15.00 a share you will probably keep the ge or sell it at the current market price call options are contracts to buy the same idea only in the other direction you pay me a fee for the right to call the stock away from me calls also have a strike date and strike price like a put you can choose not to exercises it you can choose to buy the stock from me on the strike date for the strike price but i have to let you buy it from me if you want to   for example you purchase a call option for ge 16.00 option from me on october 19th you can buy my ge stock from me for $ 16.00 a share if the current price is $ you should make me let you buy if from me for $ 16.00 if its less than $ 16.00 you could by it at the current market price for less commonly options are for a block of 100 shares of the underlying security note this is a general description options can be very complicated the fee you pay for the option and the transaction fees associated with the shares affects whether or not exercising is financially beneficial options can be very risky you can loose all your money as there is no innate value in the option only how it relates to the underlying security before your brokerage will let you trade there are disclosures you must read and affirm that you understand the risk

there are a number of benefits to this type of account   if one has highly appreciated stock think apple donations of the stock are taken at current value so for example i donate $ 10,000 worth of shares which cost me $ 100 in the 28 bracket and itemizing i see a $ 2800 benefit but i also avoid a $ capital gain and the 15 tax on that or $ in this example the fund comes into play as it would allow me to break up that $ 10,000 into smaller donations and over a number of years   next example in my article some years ago fun with schedule a i describe how a strategy of ones itemized deductions every other year can help push people into the ability to itemize where normally they just miss doing so using the charitable fund can help people smooth out their contributions to the end charities while actually making the out of pocket withdrawal every other year   last there are many whose income is irregular for whatever reason this type of account can be useful to help people in this situation make a deposit in high income high tax rate years skipping the deposit in low income low rate years but still keep up with the annual charity support   obviously one 's goal is to help the charities they wish to support it 's silly to donate for the deduction but for those who are charitable these strategies help them divert more money to the charity and less to uncle sam   sorry i 'm not sure about the math to show that my answer was to share the benefits of using these types of accounts

you ca n't currently avoid it the reason the legislation was introduced was to prevent the big name developers from setting up shop in a low vat country and selling apps to citizens of eu countries that would normally be paying a much higher vat   you need to register for vat and file quarterly nil returns so that you get that money back it 's a hassle but probably worth it just to recoup those funds   from an article in from late 2014 you see in the uk we have a rather sensible exemption on vat for    businesses that earn under £ a year this allows people to run    small businesses like making and selling games in your spare time    for instance without the administrative nightmare of registering as    a business and paying vat on sales unfortunately none of the other    eu member states had an exemption like this so when the new    legislation was being put together there was no exemption factored    in that means that if someone makes even £ 1 from selling something    digital to another person in another eu country they now have to be    vat registered in the uk and they have to pay tax on that sale at    whatever rate the buyer ’s country of residence has set that could be    25 in sweden 21 in the netherlands and so on there ’s one piece of good news even though anyone who sells digital    stuff now has to be vat registered in the uk they do n’t actually have    to pay vat on sales to people in the uk if they earn less than £    from it this concession was achieved earlier this month after    extensive lobbying but they ’ll still have to submit what ’s called a    nil return which is essentially a tax return with nothing on it    every quarter in order to use the vat moss service that ’s a lot of    paperwork obviously brexit may have a significant impact on all this so the rules might change   this is the official google link to how they 've implemented this and for which countries it affects   due to vat laws in the european union eu google is responsible for    determining charging and remitting vat for all google play store    digital content purchases by eu customers google will send vat for eu    customers digital content purchases to the appropriate authority you do n't need to calculate and send vat separately for eu customers    even if you 're not located in the eu this change in vat laws will    still apply

you have figured out most of the answers for yourself and there is not much more that can be said from a lender 's viewpoint   non immigrant students applying for car loans are not very good risks because they are going to graduate in a short time maybe less than the loan duration which is typically three years or more and thus   may well be leaving the country before   the loan is fully paid off in your case the issue is exacerbated   by the fact that your opt status is due to expire in about one year 's time so the issue is not whether you are a citizen but whether the lender can be reasonably sure that you will be gainfully employed and able to make the loan   payments until the loan is fully paid off yes lenders care about work history and scores but they also care perhaps even care more about the prospects for steady employment and ability to make the payments until the loan is paid off   yes you plan on   applying for a h1-b visa but that is still in the future and whether the visa status will be adjusted is still a matter with uncertain outcome also these are not matters that can be explained easily in an on line application or in a paper application submitted by mail to a distant bank whose name you obtained from some list of lenders who have a reliable track record of extending   auto loans to non permanent residents for this reason i   suggested in a comment that you consider applying at a credit union   especially if there is an employees credit union for those   working for your employer if you go this route go talk to a loan officer in person rather than trying to do this on the phone similarly a local bank and especially one where you currently have an account hopefully in good standing is more likely to be willing to work with you   failing all this there is always the auto dealer 's own loan offers of financing   finally one possibility that you might   want to consider is whether a one year lease might work for you instead of an outright purchase and you can buy a car after your visa issue has been settled

like any share valuing facebook requires a projection of earnings and earnings growth to arrive at a present value for the right to share in these future earnings    there are economic arguments to be had for facebook to see either a negative or positive future long term net income growth given the uncertainty we can establish a very rough baseline value by treating it as a perpetuity zero growth discounted at historical equity growth rate 8 with some very simple math an annual net income of 900 million discounted at 8 percent in perpetuity is worth billion   now take into account the fact that tech stocks trade at an inflated pe multiple of around 3 times that of a mature company in an established industry pe 20 for average stocks and anywhere between 60 + for tech stocks and i would expect the market cap for this perpetuity to be around 34 billion   a market cap of 34 billion is a share value of around 15.5 which is the point where i would take up a long position with fair confidence i do think that the share deserves a premium for potential income growth despite the current and potential future revenue losses simply due to the incredibly large user base and the potential to monetize this of course it was n't worth the 22 dollar premium that ipo buyers paid but its worth something   i think there is simply too much uncertainty for me to go long in the next 6 months unless it hits which may never happen if the company can monetize mobile and show quarterly results in the next year i would consider a long position for anywhere from 15 20 a share

you need to find out if the credit card has been reporting these failed automated payments as late or missed payments to your credit report to do this go to annualcreditreport.com the official site to get your free credit reports and request your report from all three bureaus if you see late or missing payments reported for the months where you made a payment but then they did an automatic payment anyway you should call up the credit card company explain the situation and ask them to retract those negative reports if they refuse you should dispute the reports directly with the credit bureaus if they have been reporting late payments even though you have been making the payments that will impact your credit much more than the fact that they closed your account   unfortunately they can turn off your credit account for any reason they like and there is n't much you can do about that find yourself another job as soon as you can get back on your feet pay off your debt and think very carefully before you open another credit card in the future do n't start a new credit card unless you can ensure that you will pay it off in full every month

i would suggest that you use emergency funds for things that have a low likelihood of happening but if they do happen can be devastating i used to work as a financial advisor and the we gave people is to have about 3 months worth of expenses in cash this was primarily to cover things luke loss of work or some unforseen even that would prevent you from missing work for an extended period of time once you have your emergency fund saved do not touch it leave it where it is then can start working on a savings account for those items that are more likely to happen but do nt have as much of a negative impact

you can simply use the previous year 's tax liability as your basis for payments take the amount of tax you owed the previous year divide by four and use that amount for your estimated payments as long as you 're paying 100 of what you owed last year you wo n't have any penalty except if your agi is above a certain limit $ 150k for married filing jointly in 2011 then you have to pay 110 see irs pub 505 for details general rule special rule under higher income taxpayers h t to @dilip sarwate for pointing out the 110 exception in a comment below

there are ways to avoid having federal income taxes withheld   in order to avoid withholding altogether you ’ll have to fall into    both of the following categories you have no tax liability this year    and you had no tax liability in the previous tax season so all of the    federal income tax you paid was given back to you generally you can    say you have no tax liability when you ’re not required to file an    income tax return or you owe zero taxes you may also be able to claim    an exemption if your earned income for the year is extremely low    $ or less if those conditions apply to you you can write exempt in line 7    keep in mind that the exemption only eliminates your federal income    taxes not your medicare or social security if your parents use an accountant to prepare their taxes i 'm sure he she would be able to give you a solid answer on how to fill it out

lots of places in the us do it   although the way that they usually phrase it is prices reflect a discount for cash since most of the credit card companies have an agreement that says you can not charge a surcharge if someone is using a credit card   so they get around it by giving a discount for cash    effect is the same but it the letter of the agreement

i can not tell you what is or is not allowed under islamic law what i can tell you is that when most investors talk about the power of compound interest they are not actually necessarily talking about interest the idea of the magic of compound interest is that when you receive an interest payment on your investment you now have a larger investment earning more interest your investment grows exponentially this does n't just apply to interest payments however but can apply to any type of investment where the profits of the investment cause the investment to get larger   for example if you invest in a company 's stock and the value of the stock goes up 10 in a year after that year your investment is worth more than it was at the beginning if it goes up another 10 the following year you have gained more money in the second year than you did in the first your gains are compounding even though interest payments are not involved at all the same is true if you reinvest dividends or if you use business profit to expand your business for example   the term power of compound interest is so named for historical reasons but really applies to any type of investment where the investment itself is growing

it depends on the market that you participate in stock markets are not zero sum as joetaxpayer explained on the other hand any kind of derivative markets such as options or futures are indeed zero sum due to the nature of the financial instruments that are exchanged those markets tend to be more i do n't have evidence for this but i believe one of the reasons that investors so often lose their money is psychology the majority of us as humans are not wired to naturally make the kinds of rigorous and quick decisions that markets require especially if day trading some people can invest time and energy to improve themselves and get over that those are the ones who succeed

as says ever yes but generally no if your 401k is invested in stocks and bonds the long term return is very likely higher than the interest on a mortgage long term return on the stock market is around 7 mortgage rates these days are around 4 add the tax penalty on top of that and you 're almost surely better to keep your money in the 401k there 's also the psychological budgeting factor people very often say i 'll pull money out of my retirement fund for this important purchase and then put it back later and then later comes and there are other expenses and things they want to do and they never put the money back

when you buy a futures contract you are entering into an agreement to buy gold in the future usually a 3 month settlement date   this is not an option but a contract so each party is taking risk the seller that the price will rise the buyer that the price will fall   unlike an option which you can simply choose not to exercise if the price goes down with futures you are obligated to follow through or sell the contract to someone else or buy it back   the price you pay depends on the margin which is related to how far away the settlement date is but you can expect around 5 so the minimum you could get into is 100 troy ounces at todays price times 5   since we 're talking about 100 troy ounces that means the margin required to buy the smallest sized future contract would be about the same as buying 5 ounces of gold   roughly $ 9 k at current prices if you are working through a broker they will generally require you to sell or buy back the contract before the settlement date as they do n't want to deal with actually following through on the purchase and having to take delivery of the gold   how much do you make or lose lets deal with a smaller change in the price to be a bit more realistic since we are talking typically about a settlement date that is 3 months out and to make the math easy lets bump the price of gold to $   that means the price of a futures contract is going to be $ 10 k    lets say the price goes up 10   well you have basically a leverage since you only paid 5 so you stand to gain $ 20,000 sounds great right   wrong because as good as the upside is the downside is just as bad   if the price went down 10 you would be down $ 20000 which means you would not only have to cough up the 10 k you committed but you would be expected to top up the margin and throw in   another $ 10,000 as well   and if you ca n't pay that up your broker might close out your position for you oh and if the price has n't changed you are mostly just out the fees and commissions you paid to buy and sell the contract   with futures contracts you can lose more than your original investment   not for the faint of heart or the casual investor   not for folks without large reserves who can afford to take big losses if things go against them   i 'll close this answer with a quote from the site i 'm linking below the large majority of people who trade futures lose their money    that 's a fact they lose even when they are right in the medium term    because futures are fatal to your wealth on an and    temporary price blip now consider that especially the bit about price blip and then look at the current volatility of most markets right now and i think you can see how futures trading can be as they say fatal to your wealth man i love that phrase what a great way of putting it   this site has a pretty decent primer on the whole thing their view is perhaps a bit biased due to the nature of their business but on the whole their description of how things work is pretty decent   investopedia has a more detailed and perhaps more objective tutorial on the futures thing   well worth your time if you think you want to do anything related to the futures market

you seem to have a grasp of the basic principles involved but your estimation of the risk you are taking seems a bit low your non investment reserves are unlikely to cover your expenses for more than a month so the chance that you would need to sell investments to cover additional expenses is high you mention that i am flexible with the cash on hand amount for instance for about three months i put a very tight spending investing freeze on my life because i knew i 'd be leaving jobs and moving i already had the other job lined up those savings presumably went toward moving expenses as your usual savings were insufficient in the event that you are laid off suddenly you might find yourself in the same position again with added unplanned expenses like fees for breaking a lease your current plan involves selling investments to cover the gap based on your age you have probably only invested in a predominantly positive market so the chance that you might need to sell investments for cash seems like a reasonable trade off for the added potential gains your perception might change if the markets go south and you are forced to sell into a down market possibly at a significant loss you also do n't indicate if your investments are currently sufficient to cover an extended period of unemployment you are taking on a lot of risk under your current plan essentially you are trading possible investment gains for flexibility and time by making small changes like saving at least enough to move as you did previously you can give yourself time to react to job loss or other unexpected financial need rather than give the traditional emergency funds advice i suggest you look at the broader picture the total amount of savings risk is up to you but you should consider your current savings as insufficient to rely on as a safety net

with reference to the uk structured deposits should not be confused with structured products   structured deposits are often quite simple deposit accounts you place your money into what is essentially a deposit account and are therefore guaranteed not to lose your capital as with any other deposit account the attraction is that you could earn more than you would in a normal deposit account often around double due to indirect exposure to the markets another benefit is that structured deposits can form part of your annual cash isa allowance so the returns can be tax free these products are popular with those who have savings which they are happy to deposit away for between 3 and 6 years and are looking for better rates of return than standard cash isas or savings accounts the main drawback is that you may not receive anything other than your original deposit that poses a minimal risk if your savings are earning less than 1 currently   see my article at for a more rounded overview of the structured deposits

there is a basis for that if you consider the power of compounding so the sooner you re invest the dividends the sooner the time will give you results through compounding there is also the case of the commissions if they are paid with a percentage of the amount invested they automatically gain more from you just my though the other answers are probably more complete

according to the sec shareholder reports a mutual fund and a closed end fund respectively must provide    shareholders with annual and semi annual reports 60 days after the end    of the fund ’s fiscal year and 60 days after the fund ’s fiscal    mid year these reports contain updated financial information a list    of the fund ’s portfolio securities and other information the    information in the shareholder reports will be current as of the date    of the particular report that is the last day of the fund ’s fiscal    year for the annual report and the last day of the fund ’s fiscal    mid year for the semi annual report   other reports a mutual fund and a closed end fund must file a form n q each quarter    and a form n each year on the sec ’s edgar database although funds    are not required to mail these reports to shareholders funds disclose    portfolio holdings on form n q. form n identifies specific    proposals on which the fund has voted portfolio securities over the    past year and discloses how the fund voted on each this disclosure    enables fund shareholders to monitor their funds’ involvement in the    governance activities of portfolio companies which means that sixty days after the end of each quarter they will tell you what they owned 60 days ago this makes sense why would they want to tell the world what companies they are buying and selling

gt i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   you 're right i went ad hominem apologies   gt then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   we have the same goal and that 's to have a society that results the maximum quality of life for the most amount of people however being a this is where i usually fail to find common ground with the libertarian view point   what should be a right and what should be restricted by law is totally subjective so since any law can be seen as a violation of someone 's rights the argument that a law is wrong simply because it does so is invalid to me a   demonstration that the benefits outweigh the costs is a more powerful argument though it should probably be shown that there is a significant margin between the two otherwise i 'd have to air on the side of individual rights   we do n't have the right to advertise sugar pills as a cure for cancer we do n't have the right to drive our cars after 10 beers we do n't the right to sit on a park bench and start we do n't have these rights because the cost to our society is greater than the benefits maybe these are n't the greatest examples but you get the idea   so as for making an employer send a couple representatives to a bargaining table being a violation of their rights yes it is but this is such a small cost compared to the benefit of diminishing the chance of work that have a effect on the economy and the resulting unrest created when people feel like they have no hope read the introduction to the national labor relations act i 'd also argue that the protects more rights than it takes away mainly the rights of free association and speech   i could raise the issues of unions contributing to a more democratic and socially just society but i 'm guessing that 'd fall on deaf ears in general though i think you give the idea of a union too much credit do you know how hard it is to get colleagues to start seeing one another as having shared interests it ai n't easy that 's for sure   gt the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   you may very well be right about this but a child working a mundane job instead of building their mind diminishes the life of one not strong enough yet to determine their own course is just so terribly wrong so i just have a hard time accepting this especially living in a world where there is such with such a huge wealth disparity     gt a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   unions are generally made up of the socially conscious type no one gets into organizing for the money i ca n't say for certain if this challenges your point however i do n't exactly see the difference between the who is going to retire and the ceo is going to retire and the shareholders who can pull out when put their money elsewhere when it suits them   gt many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   examples needed where the industries were actually bankrupted not just moved overseas to increase profits because workers will settle for less   gt why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   i never said that employers should be paying out all they can afford and you setting up this straw man only my point that these discussions with libertarian types all too often come down to this zero sum game where an increase in working conditions will trigger bankruptcy which i think stems from a belief that supply side economics is keeping standards the highest they can possibly be   if a company has an operating income of $ 1 what is giving a 5 pay raise to workers going to do except make that operating income slightly less i suppose it 'd be better if that money were invested back into the company but wait are n't people a resource to invest in and one that offers a high rate of return   take the the lock out of coned workers in nyc for example coned 's profits were over 2 billion when their previous contract was signed and a few years later when their contract expired the profits were still that high what did coned do they came to the table with an offer that slashed their benefits tremendously and locked out all the workers when the union rejected it    how can the case be made that coned could n't afford to give workers what they already had has their value all of a sudden dropped i do n't think so this is just greed and does n't contribute to a healthy society

gt they deficit spend they increase prosperity and thus demand   but what i 'm saying is that there are more efficient ways of accomplishing this that does n't involve any debt whatsoever if the the debt money being spent is coming from your paycheck in the form of an increased cost of living then merely increasing the ratio of wages to capital returns would provide the same benefit without debt in fact this means of driving demand is so efficient that if you take it too far it 'll drive stagflation when the cost to capital returns exceeds an optimal ratio    gt;the interesting side effect is that they are making the economy do better   yes it certainly does over a limited number of years following the debt incurred but it is only an economic benefit because that same demand has already been taken from the economy in the form of wage suppression as a ratio of returns and not absolute values if those wage returns were too high relative to returns like in the 1970s in the us then driving more demand through debt spending would be the opposite of a benefit it 's only a short term benefit because that demand has already been taken from your wages   gt;the government gives you more income than it takes from you in taxes   this is true in more ways than one and i 'm not absolutely certain in which sense you mean it in terms of say the earned income tax credit it 's nowhere near enough to cover the losses incurred through wage suppression in terms of teachers infrastructure up to a point etc these things have a productive return on investment   gt;every bit of cut spending removes income from the population   no not that the spending cuts being done are anything but harmful and costing the economy but paying people to count flies on is not helpful at all and if it results in a net positive it 's because the economy is in a bad state of mismanagement with wages as an aggregate ratio of returns too suppressed for a healthy economy it 's like cutting people and saying it benefits the economy by increasing the sale of band aids and driving demand for doctors of course the band aids help but it does n't mean the policies that makes it a benefit anything but a cost    once wages as an aggregate ratio of returns exceeds an optimal ratio like in the prod media newshour jpg then every new increase in demand results in a new deficit in supply that can not be met due to constraints on capital returns i call this a supply constrained economy as opposed to the demand constrained economy we now live in in this kind of economic environment there would even be any short term benefits to funding consumption with debt   so basically you have two choices make everybody wealthy enough to match supply while trying not to exceed it to avoid triggering too much inflation and encouraging investment in new productive capacity or suppressing wage returns too much relative to total returns inducing excessively low and potentially negative inflation making almost everybody much poorer than necessary then trying to fix the imbalance between supply and demand through debt spending i would call the second choice a fools choice   but none of this means that funding for teachers social workers etc should go away these things need their funding and we should be paying the taxes to fund them not pretending that debt spending will let of have our cake and eat it to it 's like a pot luck dinner in which people bring ious in place of dishes until people are leaving dinner hungry because there 's not enough to go around   economic trouble has nothing to do with efficiency and how much work needs to be done and everything to do with how much money people have to spend   that is in fact true in our present economic circumstances but that situation was created by wage suppression relative to total returns in aggregate but as the 1970s demonstrated the opposite can also be true this realization is what drove the reagan revolution only the fed policy operates monetary easing and all on the assumption that this is driven by the employment rate or wiki it 's not it 's driven by the aggregate ratio between capital to labor returns and leads to bad economic conditions differently at both extremes which is why they find our present economic situation an mystery    the mistake of thinking how much money people have to spend i.e. strictly demand side driven economics is what created the economic problems that lead to reagan only now the power structure takes the opposite extreme in which supply side driven economics has become an article of faith this is why the older generation like myself say and believe such bat shit crazy things about the economy today the same older generation now that now drives politics because they came of age in the 1970s when what you are saying would have been a bad policy a policy that gave us stagflation that many classical keynesian 's thought impossible before then they ca n't believe something that was so bad can now be a good thing but it in fact is because the important thing for prosperity and growth is the optimal balance between supply and demand not the argument over whether the economy is supply side driven or demand side driven because either of those agendas can push the economy out of balance   automation will pretty certainly change everything about economics in the coming years but that is not why we are in the situation we are in at this particular moment

the implication is market irrationality is stronger than market rationality aka nothing makes sense when tsla climbs to $ 400 or when cmg rises to $ 750    i would n't say there is a systematic flaw in valuation i think there is just a lot of ignorance markets are more open to household investors than ever before you used to go to your broker and ask him what 's up and he 'd give you the inside scoop since you pay them money now you go onto marketwatch and get some random nobody 's opinion on everything and make stock selections based on that    but eventually the chickens come home to roost and things will correct itself big players will jump ship and cause signals to other traders to jump ship the public can pump stocks up pretty high but it does n't just go to infinity eventually someone will stop and say wtf is going on and start selling stocks are sold on a basis of a limit order book so it 's real prices that people are paying people do n't care about prices currently because most do n't have any finance knowledge but want to invest their own money   they just hear about tesla doing something amazing from some clickbait article or news outlet and ca n't stop thinking about buying tesla they go to chipotle and think wow this place is so good and hip they must be a great investment    the markets have been filled with more subjective analysis than ever before especially with so much low quality information at your equally ignorant people blogs about investment and personal finance being for other ignorant people in the end they all lose   people who this stock is going up to $ 250 easily with literally zero quantitative analysis or even a baseline reference point to back it up are prime examples of this    ignorance of markets and cheap money almost always lead to market runs that end dot com bubble 1929 market crash 2008 it 's always the same people who have no business taking loans out or buying on margin or leveraging positions with debt only to get fucked over once things are brought back down to earth after 2 runs of qe we now have cheap money and with everyone being a for their personal investment strategy we now also have rampant ignorance    i do n't expect things to last but no one can call the bottom or the top or else you 'd be very very rich have a safe portfolio do n't try to time the markets have a strategy that hedges against unexpected change do n't try to gamble on this change because it 's ultimately impossible to predict the movement of every single person on this earth that invests their money into markets so do n't try just be prepared      to expand further into valuation theory   at the end of the day people invest their money to make more money   it 's as simple as that   if your money does n't grow in an investment vehicle it 's ultimately a shit investment   but no one values intrinsic value of a company 's equity before they decide whether or not $ 380 for tsla is a good bad deal   as a result stocks can be pumped up way higher and people still see the gains on their stocks through capital gains fueled by other optimistic investors    non zero sum goes both ways   people can make shitloads of money on stock without an equitable loser people can also lose shitloads on stock without any real winner emerging from the   when this bubble bursts lots and lots of people will lose money on tsla when people 's expectations become rational and they stop paying $ 300 a share for a negative or 70 pe ratio   it 's insane what people will pay for these companies without even realizing the implication if you buy a share of a company with a pe ratio of 70 you just paid 70 times their earnings for a share   in an ideal world where they released every single penny of earnings as dividends it would take you 70 periods to reclaim your money on that share   this obviously does n't take into account capital gains but capital gains are n't supposed to be this irrational to where a stock can be pumped up into pe ratio in the first place   it 's a whole messed up web of confusion and irrationality and eventually something will a reaction   imagine a market where everyone just agreed to pump up a single stock to infinity and everyone just in shitloads of money   would this work   of course not   it 's literally a pyramid scheme that relies on future generations to constantly inject capital no real value is being created by this scheme   it requires constantly more future generations to continue adding money into the scheme and will crash once people stop pumping money into it   the same thing will happen here   everyone agreed to pump up tsla in a sense but eventually people will realize this is stupid as shit and the pyramid will come down because there is nothing they receive from this scheme other than the money from other people   it 's essentially moving money around making 0 use of it until people stop pumping money into the system and everyone realizes that nothing of real value had been produced through the use of this money   ultimately the only thing that creates real value is the money that is returned to shareholders from an outside party the company you 're invested in   real value is not created when people exchange stock and money   so why do these transactions create higher values in equity   the basis of equity valuation states that dividends are the only way for companies to raise the price of their stock going off the traditional dividend discount model   and theoretically that 's the only logical explanation   buying and trading stock does nothing for the company minus t stock they might own   ultimately the only party creating real value is the underlying company   if they are n't creating real value then their stock should not be increasing period   the way they create value is by efficiently utilizing assets to generate returns on investment which can be returned to investors through dividends   dividends can only be increased while maintaining an equitable payout ratio by generating more net income that can increase the actual pool of money that can be allocated back to investors   tsla does not do this   tsla regularly loses money and   there is no logical explanation for any of this except that everyone is irrational     obviously theory is not the same as in practice but the theory is important here because it 's really the basis for any investment at all   at the end of the day a share of stock is the right to a share of the company 's equity   people own equity in companies because companies generate money that it returns back to its owners   that 's what a company does   that 's what an owner does   if you own shares of a company you 're an owner   and if your company does not return more money back to you yoy then why are you invested in them     ultimately you 're riding a capital gains wave that will eventually once market irrationality to rationality   and it always does because the real value always catches up to the fake value that is caused by pumping and dumping stocks

yes but the move to regulated monopolies is tactical duke 's deeper strategy is to prepare for the coming rise of distributed generation hiding behind regulatory barriers is a way to do that and it gives them a stronger lobbying platform from which to attack pushing for grid connection surcharges that will cripple rooftop solar it 's a copy of similar utility strategies in places like spain and australia

ah two things   first there is n't a small state with capitalism   capitalism requires lots of support from a state    for example there needs to be a functioning judicial system to settle disputes and to enforce all sorts of laws that benefit capitalism   there also needs to be large investments in infrastructure including infrastructure that would be impossible for a private entity to build and run   also capitalism has this thing called business cycles   we have had two now in the past 80 years that required massive state intervention in order to save capitalism itself   you say you are in favor of democracy but that does n't extend to the enterprise   would n't democracy also include workers being able to own and vote how a company is run   how is it democratic for the person with the most shares and thus the most money to have the most votes   even in our political democracy capital has a giant influence   one only has to look at our current government to see that influence

thanks for posting this   funny but i find myself watching rt far more than cnn these days   i am not a finance expert but as an econ major i can at least follow the argument   seems credible to me   they are just saying that the resulting downgrade of bank bonds will affect them less than their competition the second argument is that new 2008 accounting rules allow them to show a net gain on paper when their bonds get downgraded as a result of this loss   it 's a complicated argument but i can see how it make perfect sense   i like how bob english points out the fishy and probably strategic nature of the thursday announcement   obviously there is a lot more to this story

the capital gains is counted towards your income if you cash out 1 million dollars you have a 1 million dollar income for that year which puts you at the 39.6 tax bracket however because that 1 million dollars is all long term capital gains you will only have to pay 20 of it in long term capital gains taxes the best you can do is to cash the 1 million dollars through several years instead of just all at once this will put in a lower tax bracket and thus will pay lower capital gains tax

gt say you repeal a tax without reducing public spending then if you analyze the economic impact that does not fairly represent the impact of the tax now does it   you are right but my issue is that you are accounting for changes that are not happening   if you are comparing a country 's tax structure before and after a wealth tax then i would agree however in this case all the subjects are separate economies and have presumably found some sort of equilibrium   the wealth tax policy is not changing for them so there is no surplus or deficit of public spending to adjust for

actually if you look at a loan for $ 115,000 over 30 years at current interest rates you would have a payment of about $ 500 a month i would argue your $ 500 monthly payments are building equity the same way a loan repayment schedule would is your agreement in writing if it is there 's nothing you can do unless they agree if it 's not then write up a contract for a $ loan that you will pay back over 30 years at $ 500 a month with the amortization table that will show how much equity you 're building over time it 's not much the first 10 years note that some states require real estate contract to be in writing or else they are by either party whatever you do get something in writing or you 'll probably either end up in court or feeling bitter for the next few decades

aca has market stabilizing mechanisms like cost sharing reduction subsidies   republicans have been blocking that in recently causing many insurance companies to pull out of some states   i imagine repeal will just be a continuation of that until there is less competition and insurance companies make higher margins to offset the risk of unprofitable quarters   so maybe they make more money because of higher margins or maybe they do n't because they lose subsidies

403b plans are used by school districts colleges and universities nonprofit hospitals charitable foundations and the like for their employees while 401k plans are used by most everybody else i would suspect that a school district etc can use a 401k plan instead of a 403b plan if it chooses to do so but the reverse direction is most likely forbidden a for profit company can not use a 403b plan one difference between a 403b plan and a 401k plan is that the employer can choose to offer and the employee can choose to purchase stock in the company inside the 401k plan this option obviously is not available to charities etc which do n't issue stock your comment that the 403b plan invests solely in variable annuities suggests that the plan administrator is an insurance company   and that the employer is moving to more modern version that allows investments in mutual funds and the like forty years ago my 403b plan was like that the only investment choice was an annuity but some time in the 1980s the investment choices were to include mutual funds possibly because the 1986 tax reform act changed the rules governing 403b plans   so are you sure that your employer is changing from a 403b plan to a 401k plan or is it just a change of 403b plan administrator from the insurance company to another administrator who offers investment choices other than an annuity note of course that insurance companies have changed their options too for example tiaa the teachers insurance and annuity association which was the 403b plan administrator for many schools and colleges became tiaa cref college retirement equities fund where the cref mutual funds actually were pretty good investments

i assume that mutual funds are being discussed here as says open ended funds are bought from the mutual fund company and redeemed from the fund company   except in very rare circumstances   they exist only   as bits in the fund company 's computers and not as share certificates whether paper or electronic that can be delivered from the selling broker to the buying broker on a stock exchange effectively the fund company is the sole market maker if you want to buy ask the fund company at what price it will sell them to you and it will tell you the answer only after 4 pm that day when a sale at that price is no longer possible unless you committed to buy say 100 shares and authorized the fund company to withdraw the correct amount from your bank account or other liquid asset after the price was known   ditto if you want to sell the mutual fund company will tell you what price it will give you only after 4 pm that day and you can not sell at that price unless you had committed to accept whatever the company was going to give you for your shares or had said send me $ 1000 and sell as many shares of mine as are needed to give me proceeds of $ 1000 cash

i agree with mark   i was quite confuse about the short position at first but then i did a lot of learning and found out that as long as you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement you do not pay any interest since you do not have a debit on your margin balance   this is not true for a long position though supposed you have 5k cash and 5k margin balance if you buy 10 k worth of stocks then you will need to pay interest on the 5k of the margin balance since it is a debit   since shorting is done at a credit basis you actually get interest from the transaction but you still may need to pay the borrowing fees for the stocks so they could simply balance each other out   i have shorted stocks twice through two different companies and neither time i noticed any interest charges   but make sure you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement because once your margin balance is used to covered your position then interest would accrual learn

you need to get the current tax software the 2013 filing software is out already even though it needs to update itself before filing as the final forms are n't ready yet then you will look carefully at schedule e to understand what gets written off i see you are looking at the $ 2200 rent vs your own rent of $ 2100 but of course the tax form does n't care about your rent you offset the expenses of that house against the income   the expenses are the usual suspects mortgage interest property tax repairs etc but there 's one big thing new landlords are prone to forgetting depreciation it 's not optional say the house cost you $ 400k. this is your basis you need to separate the value of land which is not depreciated for a condo with no land it can be as little as 10 when we bought our house for insurance purposes the land was nearly 40 of the full value say you do the research and decide 30 for land then 70 = $ depreciation is taken each year over a 27.5 year period or just over $ 10,000 per year note the forms will help you get your year 1 number as you did n't have a full year   this depreciation helps with your cash flow during the year as you should do the math and if you keep the house adjust your w4 withholdings for 2014 that lump sum you 'll get in april wo n't pay the bills each month but is recaptured on sale   at some point in the future you may save enough to buy a house where you wish to live but need to sell the rental consider a 1031 exchange it 's a way to sell a rental and buy a new one without triggering a taxable event what i do n't know is how long the new house must be a rental before the irs would then allow you to move in the same way you turned your home into a rental a rental can be turned back to a primary residence i just doubt you can do it right after the purchase as fellow member @littleadv would advise get professional advice and he 's right i 've just offered what you might consider the first year tax return with that schedule e is the toughest as it 's brand new the next year is simple in comparison   the question of selling immediately is tough only you can decide whether the risk of keeping it is too great you 're saying you do n't have the money to cover two month 's vacancy that scares me i 'd focus on up the emergency account and securing a credit line you mentioned the tax savings my opinion is that for any investment the tax tail should never wag the investing dog buy or sell a stock based on the stock not the potential tax bill for the sale in your situation the rent and expenses will cancel each other and the depreciation is a short term loan from a tax perspective if you sold today what do you net if you analyzed the numbers now what is your true income from the property each year is that return worth it a good property will provide cash flow principal reduction each year and normal increase in value this takes a bit of careful looking at the numbers you might feel you 're just breaking even but if the principal is $ 12 k less after a year that 's something you should n't ignore on the other hand an exact break even with little equity at stake offered you a leveraged property where any gains are a magnified percentage of what you have at risk   last welcome to money se consider adding some more details to your profile

first step is determine how much equity is in the car positive or negative then for your car payments has that been paid out of money that has already been split or is it from a pool that is still to be if the later then it is irrelevant to this discussion since it was from a joint pool if the money has already been split then adjust her half of the equity in the car by what you have been paying an make her that offer for her half of the car   i recommend showing her the calculations so as to explain how you came with what she is owed and then let her make a counter offer

i believe that it 's not possible for the public to know what shares are being exchanged as shorts because broker dealers not the exchanges handle the shorting arrangements   i do n't think exchanges can even tell the difference between a person selling a share that belongs to her vs. a share that she 's just borrowing   there are sec regulations requiring some traders to declare that trades are shorts but a i do n't think this applies to all traders b it only applies to the sells and c this information is n't public that being said you can view the short interest in a symbol using any of a number of tools such as nasdaq 's here   this is often cited as an indicator similar to what you proposed though i do n't know how helpful it would be from an intra day perspective

is investing more money into a stock that you already have a stake in which has gone up in price a good idea what you describe here is a good idea when the stock keeps up trending the way to do it is say you have originally bought $ 1000 worth of shares then the next purchase you buy $ 500 worth then $ 250 worth it is called into your trades however this system would not be the best with simply a buy and hold when you keep holding even if the price starts you would need to have a trailing stop loss on your initial trade and then as you buy each additional trade your trailing stop loss would incorporate the additional trade and move to a level where if you get stopped out you will make an overall profit with each additional trade your trailing stop will move higher and higher for higher protected profits the whole point behind pyramid trading is to keep buying more of a stock that keeps performing well to increase your profits however each additional purchase is half the previous one so that you do n't eat too much into existing profits in the case of the uptrend reversing and so as to not on the one stock so you are using part of your existing profits in an attempt to make more profits

a dividend is a cash disbursement from the company   the value of the company goes down the same amount of the dividend so it is analogous to having money in a savings account and taking a withdrawal every month   obviously you are going to have less in the end than if you just kept the money in the account suppose that i own 10 different stocks and do n't reinvest dividends but keep them on account and each month or two as i add more money to invest either in one of my existing stocks or perhaps something new i add whichever dividend amount is currently available in cash to my new purchase would this strategy provide the same results roughly yes   reinvesting dividends is essentially buying more stock at the lower price which is a net zero effect in total balance   so if you invested in the same stocks yes you 'd be in the same place   if you invested in different stocks then you would have a performance difference depending on what you invested in the risk is the temptation to take the cash dividend and not reinvest it but take it in cash thereby reducing your earning power that is is there some particular reason that the brokers are recommending automatically reinvesting dividends as opposed to reinvesting them manually perhaps not always in the same item i 'd like to think that they 're looking after your best interest and they might be but the cynical part of me thinks that they 're either trying to keep your business by increasing your returns or there 's some uk regulation i 'm not aware of that requires them to disclose the effect of reinvesting dividends     £ 100 invested in the uk stock market since would have grown into just £ after adjusting for inflation this figure seems ludicrous to me   i have n't actually measured what the historical returns on the uk market are but that would mean an annualized return adjusted for inflation of just 0.5   either uk stocks pay a ridiculous amount of dividends or there 's something wrong with the math edit i still have not found a definitive source for the real uk market return but according to this inflation calculator £ 100 in would equate to almost £ 12,000 today for an average inflation rate of percent which would put the cagr of the uk market at about 4.9 which seems reasonable   the cagr with dividend reinvestment would then be about making dividend reinvestment a no brainer in the uk market at least

ok i think what you 're really asking is how can i benefit from a collapse in the price of gold   and that 's easy the hard part 's making that kind of call with money on the line the etf gld is entirely physical gold sitting in a bank vault in new york i believe you could simply sell it short   alternatively you could buy a put option on it even more risky you could sell a naked call option on it i.e. you receive the option premium up front and if it expires worthless you keep the money of course if gold goes up you 're on the hook do n't do this    the do n't do this was added by chris w. rea i agree that selling naked options is best avoided but i 'm not going to tell you what to do what i should have done was make clear that your potential losses are unlimited when selling naked calls for example if you sold a single gld naked call and gold went to shoot to $ you 'd be on the hook for around $ 10,000,000 an unrealistic example perhaps but one that 's worth pondering to grasp the risk you 'd be exposing yourself to with selling naked calls patches alternative etfs that work the same holding physical gold are iau and with those the gold is stored in london and switzerland respectively if i remember right   gold peaked around $ 1900 and is now back down to the $ so is the run over and it 's all downhill from here or is it a simple retracement gathering strength to push past $ 2000 i have no idea   and i make no recommendations

if i invest in index funds or other long term stocks that pay dividend which i reinvest they do n't need to be worth more per share for me to make a profit right that is if i sell part of the stocks it 's good if they 're worth more than i bought them at but the real money comes from the quantity of stocks that you get by reinvesting your dividends right i would say it is more the other way around   it is nice to get dividends and reinvest them but overall the main gain comes from the stocks going up in value the idea with index funds however is that you do n't rely on any particular stock going up in value instead you just rely on the aggregate of all the funds in the index going up   by buying lots of stocks bundled in an index fund you avoid being too reliant on any one company 's performance can i invest small amounts part of paycheck into index funds on a monthly basis like € 500 without taking major transaction fees likely to be index fund specific general answers or specific answers using popular stocks welcomed yes you can   at least in the us whether you can do this automatically from your paycheck depends on whether you employer has that set up   i do n't know that work in the netherlands   however at the least you can almost certainly set up an auto invest program that takes $ x out of your bank account every month and buys shares of some index fund(s is this plan market crash proof my parents keep saying that look at 2008 and think about what such a thing would do to your plan and i just see that it will be a setback but ultimately irrelevant unless it happens when i need the money and even then i 'm wondering whether i 'll really need all of my money in one go does n't the index fund go back up eventually does a crash even matter if you plan on holding stocks for 10 or more years crashes always matter because as you say there 's always the possibility that the crash will occur at a time you need the money   in general it is historically true that the market recovers after crashes so yes if you have the financial and psychological fortitude to not pull your money out during the crash and to ride it out your net worth will probably go back up after a rough   no one can predict the future so it 's possible for some unprecedented crisis to cause an unprecedented crash   however the interconnectedness of stock markets and financial systems around the world is now so great that were such a no return crash to occur it would probably be accompanied by the total collapse of the whole economic system   in other words if the stock market dies suddenly once and for all the entire way of life of developed countries will probably die with it   as long as you live in such a society you ca n't really avoid gambling that it will continue to exist so gambling on there not being a market crash is n't much more of a gamble does what i 'm planning have similarities with some financial concept or product to allow me to research better by looking at the risks of that concept product maybe like a mortgage investment plan without the bank eating your money in between i 'm not sure what you mean by what you 're planning   the main financial products relevant to what you 're describing are index funds which you already mentioned and index etfs which are basically similar with regard to the questions you 're asking here   as far as concepts the philosophy of buying low fee index funds holding them for a long time and not selling during crashes is essentially that espoused by jack bogle not quite the inventor of the index fund but more or less its spiritual father and the community of bogleheads that has formed around his ideas   there is a bogleheads wiki with lots of information about the details of this approach to investing   if this strategy appeals to you you may find it useful to read through some of the pages on that site

after their residency doctors are n't overworked they just work hard like most other professions and do n't have time to perform their own clinical studies to vet the medications that are provided for them to prescribe no hospital practice doctor has time for that except maybe a very select few   the only law against nurses that i 'm aware of i 'm sure there are others so feel free to fill me in is the one that requires that there be physician oversight for certain procedures which makes sense because if doctors were n't necessary for anything except surgery there would be no doctors except surgeons   and the limit on medical schools is a fascinating point i had n't heard about that and i think that it 's quite bad for costs the only upside is that it ensures that the quality of doctors stays as high as possible but i can see how that comes at a serious cost

american options like those on can be exercised by the holder anytime before expiration they will be exercised automatically at expiration if they are in the money however if there is still time before expiration as in this case and they are not extremely in the money there is probably extrinsic value to the option and you should sell it not exercise it european options are only automatically exercised at expiration and only if they are in the money these are usually cash settled on products like spx or vix they can not be exercised before expiration but can be sold anytime

depends on how far down the market is heading how certain you are that it is going that way when you think it will fall and how risk averse you are   by better i will assume you are trying to make the most money with this information that you can given your available capital if you are very certain the way that makes the most money for the least investment from the options you provided is a put   if you can borrow some money to buy even more puts you will make even more   use your knowledge of how far and when the market will fall to determine which put is optimal at today 's prices   but remember that if the market stays flat or goes up you lose everything you put in and may owe extra to your creditor   a short position in a futures contract is also an easy way to get extreme leverage   the of the leverage will depend on how much margin is required   futures trade in large denominations so think about how much you are able to put to risk the inverse etfs are less risky and offer less reward than the derivative contracts above   the levered one has twice the risk and something like twice the reward   you can buy those without a margin account in a regular cash brokerage so they are easier in that respect and the transactions cost will likely be lower directly short selling an etf or stock is another option that is reasonably accessible and only moderately risky   on par with the inverse etfs

answers here are correct but i 'll offer an extremely overly simple explanation that should help you in understanding the more detailed answers   when most people own stock they do so through a broker   unless you jump through some hoops the broker keeps the shares in the name of the brokerage   this is called holding the stock in street name when you sell short through a brokerage the broker is letting you borrow a certain number of shares owned by someone else and sell them for cash now   at some point you need to repay this loan with the same number of shares you borrowed   ideally you want the stock to drop to $ 0   the reason you might be forced to purchase the stock is that the actual owner(s of the stock want to sell   if the broker has too many people wanting to sell you will need to repay some of all of the loan in shares i.e. purchasing shares at the current market price

the mortgage is a debt and you pay interest on it typically more than you can earn elsewhere especially once taxes are taken into account by lowering the principal you lower the total interest you pay this is true whether you sell the house after 1 year 10 years or 100 years in your case prepayments made in the next few years would mean that when you sell your mortgage principal would be lower than it otherwise would have been and your house equity will be higher you can therefore either move up to more house for the same monthly payment or have a lower monthly payment for the same kind of house either of those are good things right now is the easiest time to find a little more money so do it if you can later you will have more obligations and develop a taste for more expensive things statistically speaking and therefore find a few hundred a month much harder to come by

because we need energy in the form of oil   if more of our money is spent on oil there is less money to spend on other items especially luxuries like dining out and new cars ironically since there is less money available the price of other things shift with it and the whole economy moves   since less money is available the value of a single dollar goes up basically it is because we as a species let alone nations are unbelievably dependent on having oil at this point in our existence how do currency markets work what factors are behind why currencies go up or down

asset allocation serves many purposes not just mitigating risk via a diversification of asset classes but also allowing you to take a level of risk that is appropriate for a given investor at a given time by how much is allocated to which asset classes a younger investor with a longer timeframe may wish to take a lot more risk investing heavily in equities and perhaps managed funds that are of the aggressive growth variety seeking better than market returns someone a little older may wish to pull back a bit especially after a bull market has brought them substantial gains and begin to take money off the table perhaps by starting to establish some fixed income positions or pulling back to slightly less risky index   value or balanced funds an investor who is near or in retirement will generally want even less risk going to a much more balanced approach with half or more of their investments in fixed income and the remainder often in income producing blue chip type stocks or income funds   this allows them to protect a good amount of their wealth from potential loss at a time when they have to be able to depend on it for a majority of their income an institution such as yale has very different concerns and may always be in a more aggressive long term mode since retirement is not a factor for them   they are willing to invest mostly in very aggressive ways using diversification to protect them from one of those choices tanking but still overall taking a pretty high level of risk much more so than might be appropriate for an individual who will generally need to seek safety and to preserve gains as they get older   for example look at the pdf that linked and observe the overall risk level that yale is taking and in addition observe the large allocations they make to things like private equity with a risk level compared to their very small amount of fixed income with a 10 risk level   yale has a very long time horizon and invests in a way that is atypical of the needs and concerns of an individual investor   they also have as you pointed out the economy of scale with something like in assets to afford to hire proven experts and their own internal phd level experts to watch over the whole thing all of which very few individual investors have for either class of investor diversification is a means to mitigate risk by not having all your eggs in one basket   via having multiple different investments such as picking multiple individual stocks or aggressive funds with different approaches or just an index fund to get multiple stocks you are protected from being wiped out as might happen if a single choice might fail   for example imagine what would have happened if you had in 2005 put all your money into a single stock with a company that had been showing record profits   such as lehman brothers and left it there until 2008 when the stock tanked or even faster collapses such as enron etc that all looked great up until shortly after they failed utterly    being allocated across multiple asset classes provides some diversification all on it 's own but you can also be diversified within a class yale uses the diversification across several asset classes to have lower risk than being invested in a single asset class such as private equity but their allocation places much more of their funds in high risk classes and much less of their funds in the lowest risk classes such as fixed income

all discount brokers offer a commission structure that is based on the average kind of order that their target audience will make different brokers advertise to different target audiences they could all have a lot lower commissions than they do the maximum commission price for the order ticket is set at $ 99 by the industry securities regulators when discount brokers came along and started offering $ 2 $ 9.99 trades it was simply because these new companies could be competitive in a place where incumbents were overcharging the same exists with robinhood the market landscape and costs have changed over the last decade with regulation and other brokerage firms never needed to update drastically because they could continue making a lot on commissions with nobody questioning it the conclusion being that other brokers can also charge a lot less despite their other overhead costs robinhood like other brokerage firms and anyone else trading directly with the exchanges are paid by the exchanges for adding liquidity not only are many trades placed with no commission for the broker they actually earn money for placing the trade if robinhood was doing you any favors they would be paying you but nobody questions free commissions so they do n't robinhood like other brokerage firms sells your trading data to the highest bidder this is called payment for order flow these subscribers see your order on the internet in route to the and before your order gets to the exchange the subscriber sends a different order to the exchange so they either get filled before you do analogous to front running but different enough to not be illegal or they alter the price of the thing you wanted to buy or sell so that you have to get a worse price these subscribers have faster computers and faster internet access than other market participants so are able to do this so quickly they are also burning a lot of venture capital like all startups you should n't place too much faith in the idea they are making enough money they also have plans to earn interest off of balances in a variety of ways and offer more options at a price like margin accounts

yes it 's a risk to put it in perspective if we look at the data for s&p returns since 1871 we get a cagr of but that comes with a standard deviation of this results in 53 of the 146 years returning less than 4   now if we repeat the exercise over rolling 8 year periods the cagr drops to but the drops to this results in just 31 of the periods returning less than 4 on the flip side 26 periods had an 8 year return of over 15 cagr   from the anti ds article you linked i see that you like a good analogy for me the returns of the s&p over the long term are like going to vegas and finding that after you run the math of their craps dice rolling game you find the expected return is 10 you can still lose on a given roll but over a series of a larger number of rolls you 're far ahead   to d stanley i agree that returns are not quite normal but they are not so far off of the rolling returns we 'd expect about 68 or 95 results to be 1 away we get 88 returns + 2 we 'd expect only 5 to lie outside this range and in fact i only get one result on the low side and 4 on the high side 5 results vs the 7 total we 'd expect the results are a bit better more profitable than the normal bell curve fit would suggest

traditionally dealers and broker dealers were in contact with the actual producers of a product or issuers of a security selling it at the exchange on their behalf   consumers would traditionally be on the buy side of course these days anyone can enter the market on either side   even if you do n't hold the security or product you could sell it and take on the risk of having to stock up on it by the delivery date in exchange for cash or other securities   on the other side if you ca n't hold the product or security you could still buy it taking on the risk of having to dispose of it somehow by delivery in exchange for cash or other securities in either case you the sell side take on risk and provide products securities cash   this is most commonly known as market making   modern literature coins the terms liquidity taker buy side and liquidity provider sell side   even more accurately risk management literature would use the terms risk taker sell side and risk or risk buy side this is quite illustrative in modern abstract markets   take a market that allows for no offsetting or hedging because the product in question is abstract or theoretical e.g. weather trading volatility trading inflation trading etc   there 's always one party trying to eliminate dependence on or correlation to the product the risk buy side and the counterparty taking on their risk sell side

i moved from contributing 10 to maxing as my salary rose over the course of three years after graduation   because of my raises my monthly take home still increased so it was a pretty painless way to increase my 401(k contribution and also avoid lifestyle inflation that said i would not do it if you have any credit card debt school loans or an auto loan   pay that off first   then work on maxing the 401(k   personally i rate owning a home behind that but that 's partially because i 'm in an area where the rent ratios are barely on the side of buying so i do n't find buying to be a pressing matter one thing to investigate is if your company offers a roth 401(k option   it 's a nice option where you can go roth without worrying about income limits   my personal experience does not include a roth ira because when i still qualified for one i did n't know much about them and now that i know about them i have the happy issue of not qualifying

first price is n't artificially maintained at a level when a refining company signs a contract to buy crude from a supplier it promises to buy at a certain price with options for increase and decrease due to the fluctuating prices in the market and it buys crude to build up a certain buffer to supply itself for a certain duration in case of supply problems as it had bought oil at a higher price it would be reluctant to lower the prices even if the current crude it buys is at a lower cost if it buys oil from the open market it has no other option than to pass on the hike on to the consumers so a more intense fluctuation in the prices of oil at the point where you buy it some airlines used hedging to take care of the in the price of oil to their operating margins   and moreover refining and distribution is a very low margin business so the company has an incentive to sell at a higher cost if required

i 've done this but on the other side   i purchased a commercial property from someone i had a previous relationship with   a traditional bank would n't loan me the money but the owner was willing to finance it   all of the payments went through a professional escrow company   in our case it was a company called but i 'm sure there are plenty out here they basically serve as the middle man for a fee something like $ 5 a payment plus something to set it up   they have the terms of the loan and keep track of balances can handle extra principle payments and what that does to the term of the loan etc    you want to have a typical mortgage note that is recorded with the local clerk 's office   if you look around you should be able to find a real estate lawyer who can set all this up for you   it will cost you a bit up front but it is worth it to do this right as far as taxes my understanding is that the property itself is taxed the same as any other property transfer   you would owe taxes on the difference between the value of the property when you inherited it and when you sold it   the interest you get from the loan would be taxed as regular income   the escrow company should send you tax forms every year listing the amount of interest that you received   there are also deductions you can take for expenses in the process

asking why the p e was so high is best answered because reported earnings were so low recall that the s&p500 bottomed in early march 2009 when the panic of the financial crisis reached exhaustion   as noted on the page you have linked the reported p e ratios are computed using reported earnings from the trailing twelve months   during those twelve months the banks were writing down all of the bad debt associated with the mortgage backed securities that has lost so much value   this meant that the banks were reporting negative earnings   since the financial sector is a large part of the s&p500 this alone had an enormous effect on the index p e   however the problem was compounded by a general collapse in earnings across the economy as consumers reacted to the resulting uncertainty   the same site reports earnings for the previous years at $ for the s&p500 compared to $ for the year prior to 2008   that is a collapse of about 78 in earnings   although the s&p500 has suffered badly during this time stock market investors being forward looking were starting to price in improved earnings by may 2009   indeed the s&p500 was up about 33 in just two months from its low in to mid   thus by may of 2009 prices were not suffering to the same extent as reported trailing earnings   this would account for the p e value reporting in

the satisfaction from gains packs less of an emotional impact than the fear of loss it 's very difficult for many people to overcome this fear so when prices begin to fall many investors sell to minimize their potential loss this causes a further drop which can lead to more selling as other investors reach their emotional threshold for loss this emotion based selling keeps the market inefficient in the short term if there are n't enough value investors waiting to scoop up the stock at the new discount it can stay undervalued for a long time

an actual discussion question i just wanna push fluff to get traffic on my blog the millenials did it   in all seriousness the housing market is all about supply and demand namely there are nt many housing being built across the us right now so that s driving prices up cheap loans also helped diminish the supply because those who could bought up a lot of rental properties since 08 so these things have caused home prices to steadily climb especially in desirable places to live such as large college towns boston san fran etc   but keeping demand in check are a few too rates are now going up and few millenials can afford starter homes due to student debt and relatively lower income in their late 20s than their parents plus they re having less kids at the moment so that s all pushing demand down especially in rural areas   the wild card imo will be the impending recession and the huge sell off in 10 15 years when all the boomers start hitting their late 70s and early 80s so there s your major volatility

the guideline for the size of an emergency fund is just a guideline   i 've usually heard it expressed as 3 to 6 months but everyone has a different idea of exactly how big it should be the purpose of the fund is to give you enough cash to be able to pay for unexpected expenses that have come up that you have not budgeted for without you having to borrow money to pay for them to figure out how big this fund should be we look at the worst case scenario   suppose that you lost your job tomorrow   what would you do cut your expenses   you 'd probably be much more careful how you spend money secure health insurance   this would be done by either continuing your employer 's policy with cobra or by purchasing your own insurance likely through the obamacare aca market   keep in mind that most likely your employer is paying for a portion of your insurance now so this expense will go up quite a bit no matter which option you choose look for another job   you 'd probably begin your search for a new job immediately the size of your emergency fund determines how long you will be able to go without income before you need to start a new job regarding cutting your expenses it is up to you how much you would cut   there are things that are easy to cut temporarily or permanently such as restaurants entertainment expenses vacations etc   you would probably stop retirement investing until you have income again   the more you cut the longer your emergency fund would last   things you do n't want to cut are necessities like housing groceries utilities transportation etc   i would also include health insurance in this list   certainly if you have a pre existing condition you do not want to let your health insurance coverage lapse your is also a factor   if you believe that you would have an easy time finding similar employment to what you have now your emergency fund might not need to be quite as big as someone who believes they would have a harder time finding another job

dealer financing should be ignored until after you have agreed on the price of the car since otherwise they tack the costs of it back onto the car 's purchase price they are n't offering you   a $ 2500 cash incentive but adding a $ 2500 surcharge if you take their financing package which means you 're actually paying significantly more than 0.9 for that loan remember that you can borrow from folks other than the dealer if you do that you still get the cash price since the dealer is getting cash check your other options and calculate the real cost of each before making your decisions and remember to watch out for introductory variable rates on loans leasing is generally a bad deal unless you intend to sell the car within three years or so

q will i have to submit the accounts for the swiss business even though i m not on the payroll and the business makes hardly any profit each year i can of course get our accounts each year but they will be in swiss german you will have to submit on your income from the business   the term partnership refers to a specific business entity type in the u.s.   i 'm not sure if you 're using it the same way   in a partnership in the u.s. you pay income tax on your share of the partnership 's income whether or not you actually receive income in your personal account   there 's not enough information here to know if that applies in your case in the u.s. the partnership itself does not pay income tax it is a disregarded entity for tax purposes with the tax liability passed through to the partners as individuals q will i need to have this translated is there any format procedure to this will it have to be translated by my swiss accountants and if so which parts of the documentation need to be translated as regards language you will file a tax return on a u.s. form presumably in english   you will not have to submit your account information on any other form so the fact that your documentation is in german does not matter   the only exception that comes to mind is that you could potentially get audited just like anyone else filing taxes in the u.s. in which case you might need to produce your documentation   that situation is rare enough that i would n't worry about it though   i 'm not sure if they 'd take it in german or force you to get a translation i was told that if i sell the business and property after i a that i will be liable to 15 tax of the profit i 'd made i also understand that any tax paid on selling in switzerland will be deducted from the 15 q is this correct the long term capital gains rate is 15 for most people at very high incomes it is 20   it sounds like you would qualify for long term held for greater than 1 year capital gains in this case although the details might matter there is a foreign tax credit but i 'm not completely sure if it would apply in this case if forced to guess i would say that it does   if you search for foreign tax credit and irs you should get to the information that you need pretty quickly i will effectively have all the paperwork for this as we 'll need to do the same in switzerland but again it will be in swiss german q would this be a problem if its presented in swiss german even in this case you will not need to submit any of your paperwork to the irs unless you get audited   see earlier comments

it seems from the bernanke and pundits in general that there 's an ideal inflation rate and it 's not zero when you reference that recessions bring prices down i think i understand you but recession does not mean deflation in fact deflation is a rarity not a common occurrence   when you look at what compounding does you see that a 3 inflation rate will double the cost of an item in 24 years from 1975 to 2010 inflation was 4x as it ran well above 3 for a time i chose that date as i was 13 at the time and was n't too aware of specific prices before that so i 've seen a pizza go from $ 3 to $ 12 during my life i hope to live long enough to see it double again   i think that it 's hyperinflation that 's an ongoing concern but the controlled inflation as i just described is not detrimental in fact it 's preferable in some sense for example when i look at my 5 mortgage it 's 3.6 after tax but with a 3 inflation rate my cost is really .6 as the remaining debt devalues over time and the house in theory goes up with inflation on the other extreme higher inflation say 8 starts to be detrimental distorting spending behavior and bad for the system

you would report the overall income on your t1 general income tax return and use form to report income and expenses for your business   form is like a mini income statement where you report your gross revenue and subtract off expenses   being able to claim legitimate expenses as a deduction is an important tax benefit for businesses big and small in terms of your second question you generally need to register for a business number at least once you cross the threshold for gst hst if you earn $ or spread over four consecutive quarters then charging gst hst is mandatory see gst hst mandatory registration   there are other conditions as well but the threshold is the principal one you can also register voluntarily for gst hst even if you 're below that threshold see gst hst voluntary registration   the advantage of registering voluntarily is that you can claim input tax credits itc on any gst that your business pays and remit only the difference   that saves your business money especially if you have a lot of expenses early on finally in terms of ontario specifically saw that on your profile you might want to check out ontario sole proprietorship   there are specific cases in which you need to register a business e.g. specific types of businesses or if you plan on doing business under a name other than your own finally you may want to consider whether incorporating might be better for you   here 's an interesting article that compares sole proprietorship versus incorporation   here 's another article choosing a business structure from the feds

assuming no constraints on how much you can move or how frequently into and out of your offset mortgage account the question becomes one of what rate of return you expect from your long term savings emergency cash fund the rate you are getting from the offset mortgage account is known since it reduces the principal amount owing and thus reduces interest charges the return is the mortgage rate though i would not be surprised if the offset mortgage account contract has bells and reducing the effective rate saying something like 3 pounds reduction of principal for every 5 pounds you put in so as a movie character once said do you feel lucky today   if so move money from your offset mortgage account to savings and earn more   if not move money in the opposite direction a guaranteed 2 return on the offset mortgage account might be better than taking a risk on the of the stock market and even the possibility of loss in your long term savings account

reversing your math i am assuming you have $ k to work with   in that case i would simply shop around your local banks and/or credit unions and have them compete for your money and you might be quite surprised how much they are willing to pay a couple of months ago you would be able to get about 4.25 from israel bonds in canada on 5 years term the product with minimum investment of $ 25 k   it 's a bit lower now but you should still be able to get very good rates if you shop around banks or credit unions who are more hungry for capital than the well funded banks or you could look at preferred shares of a large corporation   they are different from common shares in the sense they are priced according to the payout rate i.e. people buy it for the dividend a quick screen from your favorite stock exchange ought to find you a few options another option is commercial bonds   you should be able to get that kind of return from investment grade and higher bonds on large corporations these days   i just did a quick glance at marketwatch 's bond section and found aaa grade bonds that will yield > 5   you will need to investigate their underlying fundamentals coupon rate and etc before investing second thought grab a introduction to bonds book from chapters first hope these helps

i 'll assume that you would work as a regular part time employee in this case you are technically a you will need a specific kind of swiss permit allowing you to work in switzerland your employer typically takes care of this they have more experience than you you being non eu might make matters a bit more complicated your employer will withhold 4.5 of your gross income as source taxes when you do your tax declaration your entire income will be taxed in germany since this is where you live this will happen after your first year of work be prepared for a large tax bill or think of this as an interest free loan from germany to you however due to the dba the 4.5 you already paid to switzerland will be deducted from the taxes you are due in germany judging from my experience the tax authorities in germany are not fluent in the dba particularly in areas far away from the swiss border i had to gently remind them to deduct the source taxes explicitly referring to the dba the bill was revised without problems but i strongly recommend making sure that your source taxes are correctly deducted from your german tax liability once your local german tax office understands your situation you will be asked to make quarterly prepayments which will be calculated in a way to minimize your later overall tax liability budget for these you did n't ask but i 'll tell you anyway social security will normally be handled by switzerland as the country of employment not the country of residence your employer will automatically deduct old age unemployment and accident insurance and contribute to a pension plan all in switzerland however if you do a lot of your work in germany > 25 which certainly applies if you plan on mostly working remotely your social security will be handled by your country of residence this is a major pain for your employer because now your swiss employer needs to understand the german social security system how much and to whom to co pay and so forth this is a major area of study and your employer may not want to spend all this effort my employer has looked at this and requires anyone living outside of switzerland to limit working from home to less than 25 because by extension they would some day also need to do the same for employees living in france italy austria or even the uk they do n't want to dig through half the eu states social security regulations therefore you would not be able to work remotely from germany for my employer this is actually a fairly recent development that only entered in force at the beginning of 2015 before that this was all a bit of a gray area your prospective employer may not be aware of all details so you will need to think about whether you actively want to point them at this possibly ruining your plans of working remotely or not and possibly getting major problems and post payments years later finally i think you can choose whether you want to have your health insurance in switzerland or in germany unless your swiss obligation to be insured is waived because of your part time status some swiss health insurers offer plans where they cooperate with german health insurers so you can go to german doctors just like a german resident source i have been a from germany into switzerland off and on for over ten years now i ca n't say anything about whether your german visa restricts you from working in switzerland you may want to ask about this at se but i 'd much rather ask your local german authorities than random strangers on the internet

these unclaimed wages were presumably yours for the taking in year x when employer paid your other wages   maybe this is just about uncashed paychecks   in that case they would have appeared on your w-2 for that year   if you filed your return including that w-2 income then this is likely not new income this would be a constructive receipt evaluation   income occurs when you have the right to income whether or not you have actual receipt of it   for example if you are paid via cash drops into a piggy bank but you wait a week for the start of a new tax period to withdraw your cash from the piggy bank then the money was constructively received on the day it went into the piggy bank   this prevents taxpayers from structuring their actual receipt of income for tax purposes or otherwise in ways at odds with their true economic position   you ca n't delay taxable income that is legally yours simply by refusing to accept it when you have the right to it the wages were income at the time your employer the paycheck   you did not cash it but i suspect that you filed it on that year 's taxes   there 's a slight wrinkle that when the check went stale your ability to access the money was not so straightforward   however you still had the legal right to the money so my perspective is that the analysis did not change when the check went stale

with me and my wife coming from different countries and us both living in a non native country we have very little clue where we will eventually settle down the answer depends on where you reside currently tax rules and ability to move funds as well as where you plan to settle down and the tax rules there from what i understand once you eventually retire and take an annuity from your pension you are then taxed on it as income anyway yes and no for example if you move from us to india stay in india for 7 years you then move your retirement funds from us to india the entire amount would be taxable in india but would this freedom would come with significant costs in terms of savings at retirement the cost would be hard to predict it depends on the tax treatments in the respective countries on the retirement kitty   it also depends on whether the country you are staying in will allow complete withdrawal and transfer of retirement funds without penalty

no citation but i once read the average holding period of a 30 yr treasury is 8 hours a rise in the rate by just .1 will drop the value by just under 2 wiping out nearly a full year 's gains with 29 years to go the value of the 3 bond will be worth $ if the rate were then 3.1 it 's at the bond would drop to exactly $ 970 after the year i.e. you 've gotten no return at all   i view this as pretty high risk

a 401k is pretty good but it 's not magic personally i 'd consider a 30k salary with a 401k and a 2k employer match less valuable than a 36k salary let alone a 48k salary if worried about retirement savings simply set up that ira and put in the full 5.5k allowance

the bank is asking for a p l because as a contractor you are in essence running your own business   its kind of a technicality all you need to do is look at any expenses that you paid out of pocket while working there that were job or business related write a list of those expenses such as gas materials legal expenses etc and then show your total income from that job or contract subtract the expenses and show your total profit or loss hence profit loss statement i realize that you may not have any real expenses tied to that job although i do n't know and if you do n't then simply write in your income say no expenses and show your profit pay at the bottom of your p l your done good luck with the closing

the buy to rent investment bubble created in some markets a large number of new housing starts often exceeding the available demand   since people were investing in the capital gain they did n't mind whether a place was rented or not   many places stood empty at the prices investors wished to charge in the uk where building restrictions are so dire that few new houses can be built new house production is less than market demand which keeps up rental prices   there just is n't any stock in the us where construction is more liberal rental prices can fall as new stock enters the market   a driver will be where the sales market dries up and owners must rent to cover at least some of their mortgage losses or as joel points out if a major employer which dominates a small town leaves   many old industrial towns feature both low rentals and plenty of empty low priced property   liverpool in the uk features entire empty all up if you 're looking to track metrics on this simply look at migration patterns   where large numbers of people are moving towards prices and rentals will rise   where people are moving away all prices fall

why not just get a consolidated loan for 15 k and then $ 20 k zero transfer the loan will have a payoff on the amount borrowed probably a fixed payment which would be more than double the payment as if it were only $ 15 k to start that make sense   if you are approved for both pieces of this it should help what is going to be the rate on the loan   the process you are starting has 3 aspects cut spending reduce interest minimize payment obligations if you do anything to earn more even a few hours a week it will add up   i would not reduce any credit lines in a perfect world you will have a buffer of money to cover any expense until then available access to money is important but of course to be used either for emergencies or when cash is there to pay the bill in full when it comes in

@victor above has provided a very good answer i shall try and highlight some differences the differences are specific to a country however it does offer some insight regarding the difference between investing in retirement fund vis a vis investing in stock directly in many countries the retirement fund is mandated by the govt and has to be invested in in form of direct deduction from salary ~ investing in stock is up to the individual in many cases if not most capital gain interest accrual in retirement funds are not taxable ~ depending upon current laws capital gain long term short term from stocks are taxable retirement funds are managed and are in general more stable in their returns ~ returns from direct stock investments are dependent on investment decisions of the investor retirement funds tend to though this is very country specific return somewhat less than market as an example in india public provident fund provident fund epf return tax free ~ as for direct investment on stocks nifty has returned approx 17 cagr over 15 20 years given the above if you can invest in stock by taking informed calls and you have a good understanding of the financial markets and their and probably looking at long term investment then investing directly in stock could fetch returns that might not be by retirement funds if on the other hand if you feel investing in stock is not for you then it probably is better to stick with retirement funds and other low risk investments either way you probably have to and may be you should carry some portion of your portfolio as retirement funds

great where do i apply for my refund   an odd question but i 'll answer it if you really do n't know   tax credits will only likely be a refund if you pay too much tax during the year otherwise they will be reductions in your yearly tax bill   in most countries tax credits are awarded when paying taxes   assuming you are from the united states that would likely be in april on your individual income tax form   tax credits can be earned for doing anything the government deems desirable or worthy of exception   examples include buying a first house having children starting or running a business paying tuition adopting a child   caring for an elderly or disabled person earning money overseas paying certain types of medical insurance and being married in addition to purchasing a zero emission or low emission vehicle

there are some assumptions which can be made in terms of the flexibility you have i will start with the least flexible assumption and then move to more flexible assumptions if you must put down a number 1 your go to for the start period to 1 is pretty good and it 's used frequently for other divide by zero calculations like in a video game the problem i have with 1 is that it does n't allow you to handle various scales   some problems are dealt with in thousands some in fractions and some in hundreds of millions therefore you should change the start period to the smallest significantly measurable number you could reasonably have here that would take your example 0 and and give you an increase of it 's not a great result but it 's the best you can hope for if you have to put down a number   and it allows you to keep some of the meaning in the change if you absolutely must put something this is the assumption that most answers have taken you can put down a symbol a number with a notation empty space etc but there is going to be a label somewhere called growth that will exist i generally agree with what i 've seen particularly the answers from benjamin and for the sake of preservation those answers can be summarized as putting n a or possibly with a footnote and if you can avoid the measurement entirely the root of your question is what do my manager and investors expect to see i think it 's valuable to dig even further to what do my manager and investors really want to know they want to know the state of their investment growth is often a good measurement of that state but in cases where you are starting from zero or negative it just does n't tell you the right information in these situations you should avoid growth and instead talk in absolute terms which mention the time frame or starting state for example

if you are providing vat liable services you are and you register normally for vat then you will be able to reclaim vat on your buisness purchases but you will have to charge vat to your clients so the question really comes down to will your clients regard you adding vat to their invoices as a price increase or not that is likely to depend on whether your clients are in a position to claim back the vat you charged them if you are working mostly for vat registered who perform vat liable including zero rated activities then registering for vat is likely in your financial interests though it does mean more paperwork the flat rate scheme may be better still if you are working mostly for private individuals non vat registered or which perform vat exempt activities then registering for vat when you do n't have to is most likely not in your financial interests note vat exempt and zero rated for vat are very different things even though they look similar to the customer

the loan to value ratio ltv ratio is a lending risk assessment ratio that financial institutions and others lenders examine before approving a mortgage it sounds like your lender has a 60 requirement remember the home is the collateral for the loan   if you stop making payments they can take the house back from you   that number is less than 100 to accommodate changing market prices the cost of foreclosure repairing and reselling the home   they may be a safety factor built in depending on the home 's location    if you want to buy a $ 1.8 million dollar home you will have to come up with 40 down payment   that down payment is what reduces the risk for the lender   so no there is no way to cheat that think about the transaction from the view of the lender    note in some areas you can still get a loan if you do n't have the required down payment   you just have to pay a monthly mortgage insurance   it 's expensive but that works for many home buyers   a separate insurance company offers a policy that helps protect the lender when there is n't enough deposit paid update   er no   keep it simple   the bank will only loan you money if it has collateral for the loan they 've built in a hefty safety margin to protect them in case you quit paying them your monthly payments   if you want to spend the money on something else that would work as long as you provide collateral to protect the lender   you mention borrowing money for some other purpose then buying a home   that would be fine but you will have to come up with some collateral that protect the lender if you wanted to buy a new business the bank would first ask for an appraisal of the value of the assets of the business   that could be applied to the collateral safety net for the lender   if you wanted to buy a business that had little appraisal value then the bank would require more collateral from you in other forms   say you wanted to borrow the money for an expensive operation or cosmetic surgery in that case there is no collateral value in the operation you ca n't sell anything from the surgery to anybody to recover costs the money is spent and gone   before the bank would loan you any money for such a surgery they would require you to provide upfront collateral   in this case if you were to borrow $ 60,000 for surgery the bank would require $ 100,000 worth of collateral to protect their interest in the loan you borrow money then you pay it back at a regular interval at an agreed upon rate and schedule   same thing for borrowing money for the stock market or a winning horse at the horse race   a lender will require a hard asset as collateral before making you a loan    yes i know you have a good tip on a winning horse and you are bound to double your money but that 's not the way it works from a lender 's point of view     it sounds like you are trying to game the system by playing on words   i will say quit using the 40 to 60 phrase   that is just confusing   the bank 's loan to value is reported as a single number in this case 60   for every $ 6000 you want to borrow you have to provide an asset worth $ 10,000 as a safety guarantee for the loan if you want to borrow money for the purchase of a home you will need to meet that 60 safety requirement   if you want to borrow $ 1,000,000 cash for something besides a home then you will have to provide something with a retail value of $ as equity i think the best way for you to answer your own question is for you to pretend to be the banker then examine the proposal from the banker 's viewpoint will the banker have enough collateral for whatever it is you are asking to borrow if you do n't yet have that equity and you need a loan for something besides a home you can always save your money until you do have enough equity   comment one i thought that most lenders had a 75 or 80 loan to value ratio the 60 number seems pretty low   that could indicate you may be a high risk borrower or possibly that lender is not the best for you   have you tried other lenders   it 's definitely worth shopping around for different lenders    comment two i will say it almost sounds like you are n't being entirely honest with us here   no way someone with a monthly income who can afford a $ 1.8 million home would be asking questions like this   i get that english probably is n't your first language but still   the other thing is if you are truly buying a $ 1.8 million dollar home your real estate agent would be helping you find a lender that will work with you   they would be highly motivated to see this sale happen    all of your questions could be answered in ten minutes with a visit to your local bank or any bank for that matter   when you add up the costs and taxes and insurance on a 30 fixed loan you 'd have a monthly mortgage payment of nearly $ 10,500 a month or more   can you really afford that on your monthly income

in addition to d. stanley 's very fine answer the price of stocks change as a result of changing market conditions and the resulting investor estimation of its effect on the company 's future earnings take these examples right now in the usa there is a housing shortage that is there are fewer houses available for purchase than there are willing buyers investors will correctly assume that the future earnings of home builders will be higher than they were say ten years ago seeking to capitalize on these higher earnings they will try to buy the stocks however the current owners of the stock potentially the sellers know the same thing as the investor buyer and therefore demand a premium to entice a sale the price of the stock has risen the reverse is true also brick and mortar retailers are declining as more consumers prefer on line retail shopping the current owners of these stocks will probably want to sell their stock before it is worth even less the investor buyer also knows the same facts that future earnings will most likely be less for these companies the potential buyer offers a very low price to entice a sale the price of the stock has fallen finally the price of stocks rise and fall with general market conditions as an example assume that next months jobs report is released showing that 350,000 new jobs were created in july investors will believe that if companies are hiring then the companies are doing well they are selling products and services at a higher than expected rate requiring that they add new employees they will also conclude that those 350,000 new employees will be spending their salaries to buy not just food clothing and shelter but also a few luxuries like a newer car a tv perhaps even a new home please see paragraph 2 all of these companies will have more business more earnings and likely a higher stock price

i would suggest both as an investor and as someone who has some experience with a family run trust not my own that this is probably not something you should get involved with unless the money is money you 're not worried about money that otherwise would turn into trips to the movies or something like that   if you 're willing to treat it as such then i 'd say go for it first off this is not a short or medium term investment   this sort of thing will not be profitable right away and it will take quite a few years to become profitable to the point that you could take money out of it if ever   your money will be effectively if not actually locked up for years and be nearly entirely illiquid second it 's not necessarily a good investment even considering that   real estate is something people tend to feel like it should be an amazing investment that just makes you money and is better than risky things like the stock market except it 's really not   it 's quite risky vulnerable to things like the 2008 crash but also to things like a local market being a bit down or having several months with no renter    the amount your fund will have in it at most $ wo n't be enough to buy even one property for years $ 1500/month means you 're looking at what 100 150 months before you have enough and as such wo n't have enough to buy multiple properties for even longer which is where you reach some stability   having a washing machine break down or a roof leak is a big deal when you only have one property to manage having five or six properties spreads out the risk significantly you wo n't get tax breaks from this of course and that 's where the real issue is for you   you would be far better off putting your money in a roth ira or a regular ira but based on your career choice and current income i 'd strongly consider a roth   you 'll get tax free growth less risky than this fund and probably faster growing but regardless of both of those tax free   that 15 25 that uncle sam is giving you back is a huge huge deal greater than any return a fund is going to give you and if they promise that high run far and fast finally as someone who 's watched a family trust work at managing itself it 's a huge huge headache and not something i 'd recommend at least unless it comes with money in which case it 's of course a different story   you wo n't agree on investments inevitably and you 'll end up spending huge amounts of time trying to convince each other to go with your idea and it will likely end up being fairly stagnant and conservative because that 's what everyone will be able to at least not object to it might be something you all enjoy doing in which case good luck but definitely not my cup of tea

rand paul is an ideologue believer who makes his living as a politician pandering to other ideologue believers he does n't know shit about shit but will run his mouth non stop forever talking about all the shit he does n't know about because as a politician it is his job ignore the fool or believe him either way he is irrelevant   the free market is an ideal abstract concept which has practically no value whatsoever as concerns real societies and their economies there is no free market and never has been it is a toy that theorists use when they want to push their theories off on gullible rich people who need justification rationalization for their behaviors real economists examine the forces effecting market economies the free market has no such forces to study why because the free in free market means that the market is free of such forces

my suggestion is that you speak with a financial adviser that specializes in islamic investing for the long term there are islam approved mutual funds that only invest in non banking organizations and i would assume there are more conservative options for the short term as well 3 4 years although you may not feel the effects of inflation all that much in just a few years it would still be beneficial to utilize programs that allow you to earn a return on your money i may not have said that for $ 2,500 but for $ 25,000 i think it 's worth looking into also some scholars suggest that it is even allowed to invest in mutual funds that deal with banks as long as you calculate the portion of your return that came from the bank charging interest and donate that amount to charity

for this the internal rate of return is preferred in short all cash flows need to be discounted to the present and set equal to 0 so that an implied rate of return can be calculated you could try to work this out by hand but it 's practically hopeless because of solving for roots of the implied rate of return which are most likely complex it 's better to use a spreadsheet with this capability such as 's calc the average return on equity is 9 so anything higher than that is a rational choice example using this simple tool the formula variables can easily be input for instance the first year has a presumed cash inflow of $ because the insurance has a 30 discount from $ that is assumed to be otherwise paid a cash inflow of $ 40,000 to finance the a cash outflow of $ 40,000 to fund the a $ 400 outflow for inspection and an outflow in the amount of the first year 's interest on the loan this should be repeated for each year   they can be input as they are for each year and the calculator will do the rest

i think it 's an argument for keynesian economic policy basically an abridged version of this paragraph from the wikipedia article keynesian economists often argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector in particular monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government in order to stabilize output over the business cycle private sector decisions are bottom up millions of businesses and individuals make economic decisions and the economy is the sum of what they do monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government are top down central institutions implement measures that are intended to have a positive effect such as reducing unemployment on millions of individuals

i 'm assuming usa tax code as this is as the comments above suggest there is no right answer or easy formula   the main issue is that you likely got into business to make money and if you make money consistently you will pay taxes   reinvesting generally should be a business decision where the main concern is revenue growth and taxes are an important but secondary concern taxes can be complicated but for a small llc should n't be that bad   i highly recommend that you take some time closely analyze your business and personal taxes for the previous year   once you understand the problem better you can optimize around it   if it is a big concern some companies buy software so they can estimate their taxes periodically through the year and make better decisions

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

in layman 's terms oil on the commodities market has a spot price and a future price the spot price is what the last guy paid to buy a barrel of oil right now and thus a pretty good indicator of what you 'll have to pay the futures price is what the last guy paid for a futures contract where they agreed to buy a barrel of oil for $ x at some point in the future futures contracts are a form of hedging a futures contract is usually sold at a price somewhere between the current spot price and the true expected future spot price the buyer saves money versus paying the spot price while the seller still makes a profit but the buyer of a futures contract is basically betting that the spot price as of delivery will be higher while the seller is betting it will be lower futures contracts are available for a wide variety of acceptable future dates and form a curve when plotted on a graph that will trend in one direction or the other now as chad said oil companies basically get their cut no matter what oil stocks are generally a good long term bet as far as the best short term time to buy in to an oil stock look for very short windows when the spot and near future price of gasoline is trending downward but oil is still on the uptick during those times the oil companies are paying their existing high contracts for oil but when the spot price is low it affects futures prices which will affect the oil companies margins day traders will see that the sky is falling and sell off driving the price down temporarily that 's when you buy in pretty much the only other time an oil stock is a guaranteed win is when the entire market takes a swan dive and then bottoms out oil has such a built in demand for the foreseeable future that regardless of how bad it gets you will make money on an oil stock so when the entire market 's in a panic and everyone 's heading for gold t debt etc buy the major oil stocks across the spectrum even if one stock tanks chances are really good that another company will see that and offer a buyout jacking the bought company 's stock which you then sell and reinvest the cash into the buying company which will have taken a hit on the news due to the huge drop in working capital of course the one thing to watch for in the headlines is any news that renewables have become much more attractive than oil you wait in the next few decades some enterprising individual will invent a super efficient solar cell that provides all the power a real practical car will ever need and that is simultaneously integrated into wind farms making oil gas plants when that happens oil will be a thing of the past

as mentioned the main advantage of a 15-year loan compared to a 30-year loan is that the 15-year loan should come at a discounted rate   all things equal the main advantage of the 30-year loan is that the payment is lower a completely different argument from what you are hearing is that if you can get a low interest rate you should get the longest loan possible   it seem unlikely that interest rates are going to get much lower than they are and it 's far more likely that they will get higher   in 15 years if interest rates are back up around 6 or more where they were when i bought my first home and you are 15 years into a 30 year mortgage you 'll being enjoying an interest rate that no one can get you need to keep in mind that as the loan is paid off you will earn exactly 0 on the principal you 've paid   if for some reason the value of the home drops you lose that portion of the principal   the only way you can get access to that capital is to sell the house   you generally ca n't sell part of the house to send a kid to college   you can take out another mortgage but it is going to be at the current going rate which is likely higher than current rates another thing to consider that over the course of 30 years inflation is going to make a fixed payment cheaper over time   let 's say you make $ 60 k and you have a monthly payment of $ 1000 or 20 of your annual income   in 15 years at a 1 annualized wage growth rate it will be 17 of your income   if you get a few raises or inflation jumps up it will be a lot more than that   for example at a 2 annualized growth rate it 's only 15 of your income after 15 years in places where long term fixed rates are not available shorter mortgages are common because of the risk of higher rates later   it 's also more common to pay them off early for the same reason    taking on a higher payment to pay off the loan early only really only helps you if you can get through the entire payment and 15 years is still a long way off   then if you lose your job then you only have to worry about taxes and upkeep but that means you can still lose the home   if you instead take the extra money and keep a rainy day fund you 'll have access to that money if you hit a rough patch   if you put all of your extra cash in the house you 'll be forced to sell if you need that capital and it may not be at the best time   you might not even be able to pay off the loan at the current market value my father took out a 30 year loan and followed the advice of an older coworker to buy as much house as possible because inflation will pay for it   by the end of the loan he was paying something like $ 250 a month and the house was worth upwards of $ 200k.   that is his mortgage payment was less than the payment on a cheap car   it was an insignificant cost compared to his income and he had been able to invest enough to retire in comfort   of course when he bought it inflation was above 10 so it 's bit different today but the same concepts still apply just different numbers   i personally would not take anything less than a 30 year loan at current rates unless i planned to retire in 15 years

it appears you can elect to classify some or all of your scholarship money as taxable   if you do this you would be deemed to have used the scholarship funds for non deductible purposes e.g. room and board and you could be eligible to claim the american opportunity credit based on the money you used to pay for the tuition out of your own pocket i found this option in the section of publication 970 about coordination with pell grants and other scholarships specifically example 3 the facts are the same as in example excluded from income i.e. bill receives a $ scholarship and paid $ for tuition if unlike example 2 bill includes $ 4,000 of the scholarship in income he will be deemed to have used that amount to pay for room and board the remaining $ 1,600 of the $ scholarship will reduce his qualified education expenses and his adjusted qualified education expenses will be $ 4,000 bill 's agi will increase to $ 34,000 his taxable income will increase to $ and his tax before credits will increase to $ based on his adjusted qualified education expenses of $ 4,000 bill would be able to claim an american opportunity tax credit of $ 2,500 and his tax after credits would be $ you can only income in this way to the extent that your scholarship allows you to use that money for nonqualified expenses such as room and board   you should carefully check the terms of the scholarship to determine whether it allows this   the brief paragraph you cite from the fellowship document is not totally clear on this point at least to my eye   you might want to ask the fellowship administrators if there are restrictions on how they money may be used in addition i would be cautious about attempting to do this unless you actually did pay for the nonqualified expenses yourself so you can treat the money as fungible   if for instance your parents paid for your room and board it 's not clear whether you could legitimately claim that you used the scholarship money to pay for that since you did n't pay for it at all although in this case your parents could possibly be able to claim the themselves   i mention this because you say in your question that you only used the scholarship for tuition and fees   i 'm not sure how exactly you meant that but it seems from the example cited above that in order to claim the scholarship as taxable income you have to actually have nonqualified expenses which you can say you paid for with the scholarship   also of course you had to actually receive the money yourself   if the scholarship money was given directly to your school as payment of tuition then you never had any ability to use it for anything else

this is just an addition to 's answer   in order to maximize your overall wealth and wellbeing in a long run it is not enough to look only at the expected value ev in his example of always keeping $ or having $ 10000 99 of the time ev in the second case is greater $ > $ and if you are bill gates than you should not take an insurance in this case but if your wealth is a lot less than that you should take an insurance take a look at kelly criterion and utility functions if i offer you to take 100 million dollars no strings attached or to take a risk to get 200 million dollars 60 of the time and $ 0 40 of the time would you take that risk you should n't but bill gates should take that risk because that would be a very good investment for him utility functions can help you choose if you want an insurance or not maybe you want to insure your house because the value of the house is a large percentage of your wealth but on the other hand you do n't need to insure your car if it is very easy for you to afford another one but not easy to afford another house lets calculate what your wealth should be in order not to take this $ 150 insurance on a $ 10000 item if you pay $ 150 for an insurance you have guaranteed $ but choosing not to take an insurance is the same as betting $ in order to gain $ 150 99 of the time by using kelly criterion formula fraction of the wealth needed to make this bet is = + 1 = 1/3   that means that if your wealth greater than $ you do n't need an insurance but if you want to be sure it is advised to use fractional kelly betting for example you could multiply fraction by 1/2 and in that case if your wealth is more than $ you do n't need an insurance for this item

i am not going to argue the merits of investing in real estate i am a fan i think it is a great idea when done right   i will assume you have done your due diligence and your numbers are correct so let 's go through your questions point by point what would be the type of taxes i should expect   none you are a real estate investor and the us government loves you everything is tax deductible and odds are your investment properties will actually manage to shelter some of your job income and you will pay less taxes on that too   obviously i am exaggerating slightly find a cpa certified public accountant that is familiar with real estate but here are a few examples i am not a tax professional but hopefully this gives you an idea of what sort of tax you can expect    how is insurance cost calculated   best advice i have call a few insurance firms and ask them   you will need landlord insurance make sure you are covered if a tenant gets hurt or burns down your property you can expect to pay more for landlord insurance than regular insurance is not a bad number to just plug in when running numbers its probably high   also your lease should require tenants to have renters insurance to help protect you have a liability conversation with a lawyer and think about llcs    how is the house price increase going to act as another source of income   appreciation can be another source of income but it is not really that useful in your scenario   it is not liquid you will not realize it until you sell the property and then you have to pay capital gains and depreciation recapture on it   there are methods to get access to the gains on the property without paying taxes   this is done by leveraging the property you get the equity but it is not counted as capital gains since you have to pay it back a mortgage or home equity lines of credit heloc are examples of this   i am not recommending these just making sure you are aware of your options please let me know if i am calculating anything wrong but my projection for one year is about $ per house assuming no maintenance is needed i would say you estimated profit is on the high side   not being involved in your market it will be a wild guess but i would expect you to realize cash flow per house per year of closer to $ 7,000   maybe even lower given your inexperience   some costs you need to remember to account for taxes insurance vacancy repairs capex property management utilities lawn care snow removal hoa fees all in all expect 50 or your rental income to be spent on the property   if you do well you can be surprised

there are more than a few different ways to consider why someone may have a transaction in the stock market employee stock options if part of my compensation comes from having options that vest over time i may well sell shares at various points because i do n't want so much of my new worth tied up in one company stock thus some transactions may happen from people cashing out stock options shorting stocks this is where one would sell borrowed stock that then gets replaced later thus one could reverse the traditional buy and sell order in which case the buy is done to close the position rather than open one convertible debt some companies may have debt that come with warrants or options that allow the holder to acquire shares at a specific price this would be similar to 1 in some ways though the holder may be a mutual fund or company in some cases there is also some people that may seek high yield stocks and want an income stream from the stock while others may just want capital appreciation and like stocks that may not pay hathaway being the classic example here others may be traders believing the stock will move one way or another in the short term and want to profit from that so thus the stock market is n't necessarily as simple as you state initially a terrorist attack may impact stocks in a couple ways to consider liquidity in the case of the attacks of 9/11 the stock market was closed for a number of days which meant people could n't trade to convert shares to cash or cash to shares thus some people may pull out of the market out of fear of their money being locked up when they need to access it if someone is retired and expects to get $ x quarter from their stocks and it appears that that may be in jeopardy it could cause one to shift their asset allocation future profits some companies may have costs to rebuild offices and other losses that could put a temporary dent in profits if there is a company that makes widgets and the factory is attacked the company may have to stop making widgets for a while which would impact earnings no there can also be the perception that an attack is just the beginning and one could extrapolate out more attacks that may affect broader areas sometimes what recently happens with the stock market is expected to continue that can be dangerous as some people may believe the market has to continue like the recent past as that is how they think the future will be

there 's no easy answer and you 're asking others to do all of your research read up on utilities in north west europe and figure out their energy fuel mix if 1 of the company 's 2 nuclear reactors went offline they 'd have to make up for the energy they 've promised through another fuel source or purchase the power from a different utility co. you 'll have to research their fuel mix back up power generation 's hedging strategy amp position and so on    otherwise if you think a large portion of nuclear will go offline what 's the next largest source of power for those companies coal natural gas oil go long the backup fuel

related and one of the best titled psychology papers if money does n't make you happy then you probably are n't spending it money doesnt make you happy     the relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak which may stem in part from the way people spend it drawing on empirical research we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money specifically we suggest that consumers should 1 buy more experiences and fewer material goods 2 use their money to benefit others rather than themselves 3 buy many small pleasures rather than fewer large ones 4 eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance 5 delay consumption 6 consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day to day lives 7 beware of comparison shopping and 8) pay close attention to the happiness of others   even money does n't bring happiness material things do n't bring happiness things that bring happiness however are much easier to achieve with money novel bring happiness and it 's hard to afford vacations when you 're poor being useful to society at large make people happy bill gates is more useful because he is rich than a peace corps worker it 's the little things in life that make us happy and the rich can afford more of them happiness like death is by a thousand cuts

if you look at page 27 of their 10q jan 2017 it clarifies their streaming content liabilities    technically the total liabilities comes to $ 20b    depending on who your accountant is the amount can be as you have stated referred to but in real terms it 's higher    the magic of including year vs all of it     tesla does the same shit with their accounting

amount is the closest single word   amount in dollars would be the easiest way to specify information you are requesting   amount and currency if you in an area using multiple currencies   an accountant might be able to give you a more technical term but it would be accountancy jargon   amount due credit amount debit amount amount deposited amount credited amount withdrawn or amount included   if you 're writing instructions and want to specify that the person following the instructions needs to indicate the currency you 'll probably have to simply state that requirement    based on us centric thinking inside the us money is dollars dollars is money   for us citizens outside the country we would always tack on the currency   100 dollars or 100 euro   there is a segment of americans who do not understand geography and that other countries exist and that they use different currencies might not realize that other countries have currencies named dollars and that usd means us dollars   so for u.s. citizens be specific and clear bottom line if this is written for us residents and they need to specify the currency you need to explicitly require them to list the amount and currency

there can be a good reason if you own shares issued in a different country for example if you are in the uk and own us shares and take the dividend payments you get some check in us dollars that you will have to exchange to which means you pay fees mostly these fees are fixed so you lose a significant percentage of your dividends by reinvesting and selling shares over some years you got one much bigger check and pay only one fee

securities or quite a few negotiable instruments can change title of ownership without any issue many at times the owner ship in implicit if you are holding a certain instrument so for example in stock its a fractional ownership in a company this ownership transfers to the buyer from the seller without requiring any permission from the company    in case of say loans one can not transfer the loan to some one else without the banks permission

i can state with absolute certainty that 75 k a year would not be the line if is well above the point where lack of money ceases being a misery generator though i think i 'd probably need a curve to be optimal there 's a lot of stuff i 'd need up front but once that was done and a reserve set up for truly awful expenses like insane medical bills i 'm betting a stable flow of 40k year would keep me very happy indeed it 'd be even less but i really like to travel and expansive trips every couple months would get rather expensive discounting travel i could easily be quite happy with half of that

calculating beta is finding the correlation between the dependent variable msci world benchmark and the independent variable your companies if you know how to run liner regression models run each company as the independent variable with the dependent msci you can use excel to gather this result y = msci price change at closing hour while x = company stock price closing prince running the regression will give you the beta and alpha when doing portfolios which from linear algebra is the m in y = mx + b

littleadv 's first comment check the note is really the answer but your issue is   every mortgage i 've had over 10 in my lifetime allows early principal payments the extra principal can only be applied at the same time as the regular payment think of it this way only at that moment is there no interest owed if a week later you try to pay toward only principal the system will not handle it pretty simple extra principal with the payment due in fact any mortgage i 've had that offered a monthly bill or coupon book will have that very line extra principal by coincidence i just did this for a mortgage on my rental i make these payments through my bank 's billpay service i noted the extra principal in the notes section of the virtual check but again the note will explicitly state if there 's an issue with prepayments of principal the larger issue is that your friend wishes to treat the mortgage like a bi weekly the bank expects the full amount as a payment and likely has no obligation to accept anything less than the full amount given my first comment above here is the plan for your friend to do 99 of what she wishes tell her there 's nothing magic about bi weekly it 's a budget clever way to send the money but over a year it 's simply paying 108 of the normal payment if she wants to burn the mortgage faster tell her to add what she wishes every month even $ 10 it all adds up   final note there are two schools of thought to either extreme a pay the mortgage off as fast as you can no debt is the goal and b the mortgage is the lowest rate you 'll ever have on borrowed money pay it as slow as you can and invest any extra money i accept and respect both views for your friend and first group i 'm compelled to add be sure to deposit to your retirement account 's matched funds to gain the entire match $ 1 can pay toward your 6 mortgage or be doubled on deposit to $ 2 in your 401(k if available and pay off all high interest debt first this should stand to reason but i 've seen people keep their 18 card debt while prepaying their mortgage

gt the new exchange bonds will be getting paid as normal in argentina unless argentina changes its mind in which case it will have home court advantage in changing the terms of the bonds the old exchange bonds and the old old bonds wo n't get paid exactly but argentina will deposit money at the central bank for them which they can get any time they want to swap into new exchange bonds presumably many people will hold on to the old exchange bonds hoping for some improvement in their lot in life and eventually that hope will turn into lawsuits as hope does so there will be two classes of bondholders suing argentina and each other and not getting paid and being sad   this paragraph from op 's article is golden

from an india tax point of view your father can gift you unlimited amount of money and the transfer would be under gift tax act as per the act there is no tax on this transaction i does not matter if you get yourself added into the joint account or not from a us tax point of view this transfer would come under gift tax however in us the gift tax is applicable on the donor i.e. your father as your father is not a us citizen the provisions are not applicable to him edit under the liberalized remittance scheme an individual can transfer upto usd 1 million every year a ca certificate is required certifying that the taxes on the funds have been paid your bank would be able to guide you on the exact process

i would guess that before the spin off more money would be available in my experience the reverse is true the finance folks go into tightening everything up so that budget forecasts for the transition period are as accurate and predictable as possible this can be true 6 months out 12 months out etc depending on the size and complexity of the business so in terms of when to renegotiate i think approaching the issue after the dust has settled is more realistic make sure you know your numbers as per normal and just remember that after the spin off has occurred it 's a business like any other business if you are in position to negotiate and reasonably expect a raise then the fact that they spun off recently a month or two before is meaningless to the negotiation

yes you should invest and yes you should save for the house down payment these should be two separate pools of money and the goals and time frames for them are different with a 3 year time frame for the down payment on the house the risk you should accept should be essentially zero that means it is less of an investment and more plain vanilla savings account or maybe a higher interest account or a cd the worst thing to have happen would be to try and save for the house while the value of your investment keeps dropping   you have to decide how to allocate your income between retirement accounts and saving for the house while still meeting all your other obligations the exact balance depends on how much you need to save for retirement and things such as rules for the company match
