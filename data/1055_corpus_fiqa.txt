yeah i 'll take the challenge how trustworthy these are and what are their sources of income these are in fact two separate questions but the answers are related how trustworthy as trustworthy as they 're clear about their own sources of income if you can not find any clue as to why what for and how they 're paying you you probably should walk away what 's too good to be true usually is indeed too good to be true for those of the sites that i know of their sources of income it is usually advertisements and surveys to get paid you have to watch advertisements and/or answer surveys i know of some sites who are legit and pay people not money but gift cards airline miles etc for participating in surveys my own kaiser in california in fact pays small amounts to members who participate in enough surveys so its legit are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income not something you could live off but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to starbucks what do i need to consider tax wise usually the amounts are very low and are not paid in cash while it is income i doubt the irs will chase you if you do n't report the $ 20 amazon gift card you got from there it should strictly speaking be reported probably as hobby income on your tax return most people do n't bother dealing with such small amounts though in some cases like the i mentioned its basically a rebate of the money paid you pay your copays deductibles etc since the surveys are only for members you basically get your money back not additional income this is in fact similar to credit card rebates is there a best practice for handling the income if we 're talking about significant amounts more than $ 20 30 a year then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses and report it as any other business income on your taxes schedule c. is there a good test to determine what is and is n't a scam as i said if it looks too good to be true it most likely is if you 're required to provide your personal financial information without any explanation as to why what it will be used for and why and what for you 're going to be paid i 'd walk away otherwise you can also check internet reviews bbb ratings ftc information and the relevant state agencies and consumer for example whether they 've heard of that particular site and what is the information they have on it a very good sign for a scam is contact information do they have a phone number to call to is it in your own country if its not in your own country definitely go away for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the uk but listed address is in los angeles ca a clear sign of a scam if they do have a phone number try it talk to them call several times and see how many different people you 're going to talk to if its always the same person run and hide do they have an address if not walk away if they do look it up is it a a virtual office or do they have a proper office set up which you can see on the map and in the listings as their office and of course your guts if your guts tell you its a scam it very likely is

these are all factually correct claims s corporation is a pass through entity so whatever gain you have on the corporate level is passed to the shareholders if your s corp has capital gains you 'll get your pro rata share of the capital gains interest the same dividends you get it on your k-1 earned income taxed as such to you i.e. whether you earn income as a s corp or as a sole proprietor matters not that 's the answer to your bottom line question the big issue however is this you can not have more than 25 passive income in your s corp you pass that limit three consecutive years one off is ok your s corp automatically converts to c corp and you 're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates you then lose the capital gains rates personal brackets etc this means that an s corp can not be an investment company most of its income has to be earned not passive another problem with s corp is that people who work as self proprietors incorporated as s corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance should n't be taxed as self employed income irs upon such a position and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the tax court to prove you wrong this has happened before you should talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa attorney licensed in your state to educate you about what s corp is and how it is taxed and whether or not it is appropriate for you

my advice to you act like responsible adults and owe up to your financial commitments   when you bought your house and took out a loan from the bank you made an agreement to pay it back if you breach this agreement you deserve to have your credit score trashed   what do you think will happen to the $ 100k+ if you decide to stiff the bank the bank will make up for its loss by increasing the mortgage rates for others that are taking out loans so responsible borrowers get to subsidize those that their responsibilities if you were in a true hardship situation i would be inclined to take a different stance but as you 've indicated you are perfectly able to make the payments you just do n't feel like it real estate fluctuates in value just like any other asset if a stock i bought drops in value does the government come and bail me out of course not what i find most problematic about your plan is that not only do you wish to breach your agreement but you are also looking for ways to conceal your breach please think about this best of luck with your decision

even if the price of your home did match inflation or better and that 's a question i 'll let the other answers address i propose that owning a home by itself is not a sufficient hedge against inflation consider inflation will inflate your living expenses if you 're lucky they 'll inflate at the average if you 're unlucky a change in your spending patterns perhaps age related could result in your expenses rising faster than inflation look at the sub indexes of the cpi without income also rising with inflation or better how will you cope with rising living expenses each passing year advancing living expenses risk a static income your home is an illiquid asset generally speaking it neither generates income for you nor can you sell only a portion at best owning your principal residence helps you avoid a rent expense and inflation in rents but rent is only one of many living expenses some consider a reverse mortgage an option to tap home equity but it has a high cost in other words if you do n't want to be forced to liquidate sell your home you 'll also need to look at ways to ensure your income sources rise with inflation i.e. look at your cash flow not just your net worth hence investing in housing as in your own principal residence is not an adequate hedge against inflation if you owned additional properties to generate rental income and you retained pricing power so you could increase the rent charged at least in line with inflation your situation would be somewhat improved except you would perhaps be adopting another problem too high a concentration in a single asset class consequently i would look at ways other than housing to hedge against inflation consider other kinds of investments safe as houses may be a but it is no guarantee

markets tend to go up over time so most things you could buy would make money a benchmark is meant to represent the market as a whole or a subset that is relevant to what you are trading so you can tell if your specific choices helped or hurt your return as an example say you pick two financial stocks citi and goldman   they get you a return of 10 for the year so you think you made good choices   but if the financial sector as a whole had a return of 20 your choices were n't actually that great

my doubt is whether bank of india gives any explicit incentives to banks to offer cheaper home loans currently no in the past loan against gold was considered priority sector lending loans to poor and agriculture etc every bank need to lead around 25 to priority sector hence quite a few banks gave loans relatively cheaper to todays rate rather than giving it as farm loan that almost never get recovered it is no longer the case now as loan against gold is not considered priority lending if it were just demand supply i feel that gold loans should have been cheaper   it is demand and supply there are quite a few reasons for this

if you want to trade to gain from short term volatility you can use derivative based etfs that try to track the inverse of a broad index like the s&p 500 note that these etfs only track the index over a 1 day period so you should n't hold these if you 're looking for a longer term investment strategy look at low beta stocks which often do well or produce dividend income during volatile times examples include mcdonald 's corp and utilities like consolidated edison

in addition to alex b 's excellent overview i 'd like to add a few more bits of advice first of all one term you should know is commercial real estate which is precisely what this is there is a business element but it is strictly and almost entirely intertwined to the underlying real estate which makes this a special category of business which is generally considered simply commercial real estate just like office buildings shopping malls etc all real estate and businesses value are based on alternatives what other options are there in appraisal these are generally called comparables a professional appraiser is generally available for commercial real estate of this type while a full official commercial appraisal can run into the thousands many most all appraisers are willing to sell you a simplified version of their service which can be called a letter of opinion and can help you get an idea for the market price what other similar commercial properties are running for a loan company would strictly require this but if you are thinking of an all cash or form of seller financing this would technically be optional your best bet is to read about some of what is involved in commercial real estate appraisal and evaluation and you may even want to speak with commercial loan officers even if you do n't know that you want to get a loan to acquire the property it 's their job to help inform you about what is required and what they look for so they can be a potential resource beyond your own research as well with this said the only way to estimate value and conveniently the best way is to look at other properties and by others i mean that you should really not consider buying absolutely anything until you 've viewed at least 6 10 other options in some depth and you probably want to double or triple that number if you are looking to make this the last big business transaction of your life if you do n't you 'll be relying on little more than dumb luck to carry you through which in this area of business you do n't want to do because the dollar amounts and liabilities involved can bankrupt you in no time flat with that general advice out of the way here 's a tiny nutshell version of valuation of commercial real estate there are a few key parts involved in commercial real estate land improvements buildings stuff like that income and wages   land the value of the land is based upon what you could sell it for as is that is to say who else might want it this alone has many important factors such as zoning laws the neighborhood including your neighbors water utilities on the land someone may have insisted the land not be paved into a parking lot or really anything like that alternative uses could you put a golf course on it or is the land suitable for a big building or farming etc and is this in a growing area where you might hope the value will increase over the next decade or decrease or basically stay flat and possibly cause losses compared to inflation improvements anything on the land is both an asset and a liability it 's an asset because it could add to the value of the land but it might also reduce the land value if it with alternate land uses it 's a liability both in the legal sense and in that it requires maintenance if you want to rent them out especially that means concern about any foundations involved roofs sewage tanks utilities that are your responsibility pipes poles wires as well as any sort of ac heating you may have and so on these things are rarely free and absolutely can eat you alive income ah the best part the constant influx of cash but wait is it a constant influx some businesses are purely seasonal summer only winter only some are year round but have peak times and others do n't really have a peak to speak of if you are renting are there issues collecting or with people over staying how about damage making a mess getting and disturbing others regardless there is obviously some income and this is usually the most dangerous part of the equation i say dangerous because people absolutely lie like dogs on this part all the time it 's easy to cook the books assuming they even attempt to keep proper books in the first place businesses of this form often have a lot of cash business that 's easy to hide from uncle sam or sometimes even the owners themselves if there are employees involved and fake and some people are just shoddy and the info is just wrong but there will clearly be some kind of yearly income involved what does this matter well how much is there how much is tied to the owners personal friends do business and they will leave if the ownership management changes in commercial real estate the income will be calculated for a fiscal year and then there is something called a multiple which is market dependent let 's say the whole place takes in $ 100k in rent a year as part of buying this business you are buying not just assets but expected future income in some commercial areas the multiple is as little as .5 to 2 which means that the going rate is about 6 24 months worth of income as part of the purchase price so with 100k rent a year that means of the purchase price is attributable to the income of the business and if business is half of what you thought it would be that means the net value of the whole enterprise decreases by on top of the reduced income every year you own it income provides cash flow which should pay all the expenses cleaning up from wind storms replacing windows that are broken hauling off trash replacing a well that ran dry and then the extra that remains is positive cash flow if you take out a loan then ideally the cash flow would also pay that completely so long as you do n't have any big unexpected expenses in the year and still have some left over for yourself wages well that money does n't collect itself there 's sales keeping the books collecting the rent performing maintenance customer service cleaning paying the bills keeping the insurance people happy handling emergencies and everything else involved with running the business someone is going to do it and the biggest error people make here is not to put any value on their time and to make it so they can never afford to take a vacation again pay yourself and give yourself the flexibility to pay others when you ca n't or do n't want to do it all yourselves so what 's the point of all this how do you actually make any money in two ways 1 selling the whole thing later and 2 cash flow for 1 it 's important that you not be in a situation where you are betting that in the future there will be a person richer and dumber than i am now if the current owner wanted 2 million then 1 mil then less over multiple years this suggests either he is delusional about the value of his place and most property owners are or that its actually hard to find a buyer for such a business you are going to want to make sure you understand why that is because most of the value of real estate is well in the real estate itself for 2 you need cash coming in that 's considerably more than the cost of running the place also cash flow can strongly change the value of the business for resale depending on the multiple this can make a huge difference or prevent you from selling the thing at all   you mentioned you want to put in more cabins more marketing sales efforts etc that 's great but first that would mean added investment beyond the purchase price is it legally and physically practical to add more cabins and what is their current utilization rate if they are only renting 10 of their current capacity increasing capacity may be premature this will also vary through the year so you may find there is a problem with being sold out sometimes but only for a small percentage of the time which means you 'll be adding buildings only to have them used for a fraction of the year which will be very hard to make a profit from if cash flow is good ideally even being enough to cover a loan payment to help cover the purchase price and remember that commercial real estate loans are much smaller loan to value ratios than in residential real estate there is one final barrier to making money the damn non regular maintenance roofs wells and wooden walls all have a sad tendency to cost you nothing right up until the point they cost you $ on a single day is there enough cash flow to make these sort of and if you plan to be there for years they are a certainty not put you in the poor house this was rather long but i hope this overview helps you appreciate all that you 'll need to look into and be cautious of during your future en commercial real estate is generally costly and high risk but also can be high reward you 'll need to compare many opportunities before you can get a feel for what is a good deal and what is a terrible one you 'll need to consider many factors such as resale value and cash flow income which they will have to tell you and you can assume is not true due to ignorance or malice as well as maintenance and liabilities before you can begin to really estimate the value of an enterprise of this sort there are people who can help you like appraisers and commercial brokers but ultimately you 'll need to do a lot of research and comparisons yourself to help you make a good decision   finally there is no very simple method for evaluating commercial real estate value you need a variety of information and you must be skeptical of what you are told because of the very large sums of money involved it is doable lots of people do it but you must take care and do your due diligence so you do n't get bankrupted by a single bad purchase

i think you would be better asking about what things could increase in value even the given example houses are not certain to increase in value in fact one of the key causal factors of this recession imho is that no one realized that partly because there have been few recent housing busts and also the illusory effect of inflation that made it seem like houses always increase in value   i once heard it described that rich people tend to get richer because they spend more of their money on things that are more likely to hold their value or appreciate houses art etc as opposed to poor people who spend the majority of their money on consumables like rent utilities food cars etc

first you need to understand how modern insurance companies operate on the front end they write contracts with customers collecting up front premiums and promising to pay out to cover future losses efficient premiums cover exactly what 's paid out if you charge too much customers leave for competition and if you charge too little the company goes under or at least loses money large armies of people are employed to accurately guess future risks hopefully to the point of certainty you have in human mortality   so over time they will pay back those premiums and there 's a constant stream of new premiums coming in to replace money going out so there 's this effective pool of money they can use to buffer against large losses with it 's called float and when the pool of money remains relatively constant they can invest it longer term than the people who comprise the underlying risk large insurance companies like berkshire hathaway function in this manner it 's where warren buffet finds capital to invest while hiding from wall st in nebraska the way these companies profit is by making sure the equation works   profits = premiums payouts + return on float payouts could be just payments for insured risk but they could also be for the whole life insurance you 're running across from time to time these contracts offer the insured the chance to invest their money with the people who invest the float and as long as the return on float is greater than the return they 're offering it 's still profitable for the company since this guarantees suboptimal returns for you it 's usually a good idea to buy term insurance much cheaper and invest the difference yourself

what you are describing does not sound like an investment it sounds like a loan an investment involves you putting up a stake and sharing in the profits or losses of the business there is no guarantee you will get your money back a loan involves you putting up money for which you will receive interest and principal repayment in accordance with an agreed schedule you get this irrespective of how the business is performing also is the arrangement with your friend or his company they are different legal entities and your risk profile is different in both cases whatever the arrangement you need to sign a contract which details all the terms and conditions how much you will pay to whom and when how much you will get back from whom and when a method for resolving disputes what happens in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy what happens if someone breaks the terms of the contract if your payout depends on the value of the business at some future date how it is to be valued etc etc two points i am not a lawyer i am not your lawyer

is it worth it you state the average yield on a stock as 2 3 but seem to have come up with this by looking at the yield of an s&p500 index   not every stock in that index is paying a dividend and many of them that are paying have such a low yield that a dividend investor would not even consider them   unless you plan to buy the index itself you are distorting the possible income by averaging in all these you are also assuming your income is directly proportional to the amount of yield you could buy right now   but that 's a false measure because you are talking about building up your investment by contributing $ month   no matter what asset you choose to invest in it 's going to take some time to build up to producing $ 20k year income at that rate   investments today will have time in market to grow in multiple ways given you have some time immediate yield is not what you should be measuring dividends or other investments on in my opinion   income investors usually focus on yield on cost a measure of income to be received this year based on the purchase price of the asset producing that income   if you do go with dividend investing and your investments grow the dividends themselves on a regular basis it 's not unheard of for to be north of 6 in 10 years   the same can be true of rental property given that rents can rise achieving that with dividends has alot to do with picking the right companies but you 've said you are not opposed to working hard to invest correctly so i assume researching and teaching yourself how to lower the risk of picking the wrong companies is n't something you 'd be opposed to i know more about dividend growth investing than i do property investing so i can only provide an example of a dividend growth entry strategy many dividend growth investors have goals of not entering a new position unless the current yield is over 3 and only then when the company has a long consistent track record of growing eps and dividends at a good rate a low debt cashflow ratio to reduce risk of dividend cuts and a good moat to preserve competitiveness of the company relative to its peers   amongst many other possible measures   they then buy only on dips or where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal p e at the same time that they have faith that they 've valued the company correctly for a 3 + year or longer hold time there are those who self report that they 've managed to build up a $ dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years   check out dividend growth investor 's blog for an example   there 's a whole world of dividend growth investing strategies and writings out there and the commenters on his blog will lead to links for many of them i want to point out that income is not just for those who are old   some people planned and have achieved the ability to retire young purely because they 've built up an income portfolio that covers their expenses    assuming you want that the question is whether stock assets that pay dividends is the type of investment process that with you or if something else fits you better   i believe the op says they 'd prefer long hold times with few activities once the investment decisions are made and is n't by significant work to identify his investments   both real estate and stocks fit the latter but the of dividend growth stocks and hands off property investing which i assume means paying for a property manager are a better fit for the former   in my opinion the biggest additional factor differentiating these two is liquidity concerns   post tax stock accounts are going to be much easier to turn into emergency cash than a real estate portfolio   whether that 's an important factor depends on personal situation though

you can withdraw from your rrsp to pay your taxes while not necessarily advisable it is permitted yet the tax consequences are no different just because you happen to be using the money to pay a prior year 's income tax balance due when you make the withdrawal from your rrsp an amount will be withheld towards your income tax for the withdrawal year assuming you have other income then you are likely to owe cra even more than the amount withheld because the withdrawal is effectively taxed at your marginal rate in that case consider the withholding tax merely a downpayment you 'll figure the final amount due when you file your next income tax return e.g. if you were to withdraw money from your rrsp today in 2015 to pay your 2014 income tax balance due then on your 2015 income tax return you 'll need to declare the withdrawn amount as income for 2015 you 'll get credit for the withholding taxes already paid when you made the withdrawal your tax return will indicate how much more you 'll need to pay to settle your 2015 taxes if you then pay your 2015 income tax balance due with an rrsp withdrawal in 2016 then repeat better to save up funds elsewhere e.g. in a bank account or a tfsa to cover an anticipated income tax balance owing

i am going through this right now   we recently moved and learned the lesson of needing a good bit of wealth in easily accessible accounts   in our case for a down payment on a new house   so we have decided to increase our emergency fund to $ minimum   then throwing the rest in retirement accounts seems like a safe bet so my rule of thumb is think of how much a 20 down payment would be on a new house if you needed to move   that way you can avoid pmi while also avoiding penalties for withdrawing from your retirement accounts

with a question like this you should talk to a tax professional who knows about international tax and knows about both the uk and the country you will be working in they will give you up to date advice on what can be an extremely complex question however to get you started i 'll tell you what i was told when i did this nearly twenty years ago it 's all about whether you are resident in the uk for tax purposes or not if you are you will pay uk tax if not you wo nt assuming you are being paid outside the uk check with your professional exactly what is involved in those days you could be counted as non resident if you spent a complete period of twelve months outside the uk you can make occasional visits to the uk without that again check exactly how much you are allowed to return while still being not resident usually you will have to pay tax in the country where you are resident but check the rules there with some timing you may be able to be considered non resident in countries at least for some of the time again your tax professional will know the bank account question again get a professional i do n't think it 's a problem but you may have to establish that you are being paid in the foreign country in general you are going to need an account in the country where you work so if its a problem get paid there and transfer any money you need in the uk

that tends to be the case with a lot of things i am seeing any changes seem to create short term recession with projections of long term growth   i would normally see that as a problem because the reaction to the recession could effect the outcome post recession but the trending downward is not a good sign for the economy as a whole eventually that portion would leave most markets or welfare would have to increase on the current trajectory    i think encouraging non income producing assets for wealth generation is a flawed system personally whether i am right or wrong i do not know i think the government and subsequently the fed should encourage income producing assets for the wealth affect or in the very least not something as crucial as housing to the health of the consumer base

from a quick look at sources on the web it looks to me like money market accounts and savings accounts are both paying about the same rate today around 1 give or take maybe 0.4 i suppose that 's better than nothing but it 's not a whole lot better than nothing i saw several savings accounts advertising 0.1 interest if they mailed you a check the postage could be more than the returns personally i keep a modest amount of emergency cash in my checking account and i put my savings in a very safe mutual fund that generally gets somewhere from making maybe 3 a year to losing a small amount certainly nothing to sing about but better than savings or money markets whether you are willing to tolerate the modest risk or the sales charges is a matter for your personal situation and feelings

no at least not noticeably so the majority of what hft does is to take advantage of the fact that there is a spread between buy and sell orders on the exchange and to instantly fill both orders gaining relatively risk free profit from some inherent inefficiencies in how the market prices stocks the end result is that intraday trading of the non hft nature as well as speculative short term trading will be less profitable since hft will cause the buy sell spread to be closer than it would otherwise be buying and holding will be largely unaffected since the spread that hft takes advantage of is miniscule compared to the gains a stock will experience over time   for example when you go to buy shares intending to hold them for a long time the hft might cost you say 1 to 2 cents per share when you go to sell the share hft might cost you the same again but if you held it for a long time the share might have doubled or tripled in value over the time you held it so the overall effect of that 2 4 cents per share lost from hft is negligible however since the hft is doing this millions of times per day that 1 cent or more commonly a fraction of a cent adds up to hfts making millions individually it does n't affect anyone that much but collectively it represents a huge loss of value and whether this is acceptable or not is still a subject of much debate

my wife and i use a digital form of the envelope system we call it a budget we record how much we want to allocate each month to spend for each category of expense in a spread sheet why use prepaid cards why not open a bunch of bank accounts and use debit cards from each if you want to separate the money you could also keep a ledger for each account that you spend from on a smart phone or even in a physical ledger   the reason for the envelope method is that it psychologically hurts some people to physically part with cash once you it in some factor you lose what is the primary touted benefit and it 's no longer the envelope system the secondary benefit that once the budget for one category is gone it 's gone is only as good as the discipline you have to not rob cash from another envelope why is this any easier than the discipline of not debiting beyond the bottom of the ledger so a budget is a digital version of the envelope system once the physical cash is removed from the equation it 's definitely not the envelope system sorry for the contrarian take on this question but i 've never been a fan of the envelope system for many of the reasons you have described i guess i 'm too young for the cash psychology to work for me

wikipedia has a nice list of currencies that use cents and currencies that use 1/100th division that is not called cent cent means 100 in latin and french and probably all the roman family of languages so if the currency is divided by 100 it will likely to be called cent or something similar in the local language the list of currencies on the same page where it is not the case is significantly shorter and includes countries with relatively ancient currency units that were invented before the introduction of the decimal system even though now they are in fact decimal they still kept the old names like the british pence or the russian the point is that dollar and cent are not directly related many currencies that are not called dollar are using cents as well euro among others it just means 1/100th and it is safe to assume that most if not all of the modern currencies are divided into 1/100th

as others have already pointed out the bank is n't getting your money upfront the cash goes to the dealer and the bank will be financing you a much smaller amount they really do n't have any incentive to give you a better interest rate but it never hurts to ask the more important and question is should you do this keeping in mind that a loan with good credit could be in the 1.8 range average long term returns in the market are over 3x that so by paying upfront you 're trading the opportunity for returns for the ability to save -2 fees

first and foremost make sure where you are purchasing the product is a reputable organization   secondly coming from a biased computer geek be aware that apple is a content trap   now on to my answer to your question how do preferred account programs work they 're preferred because they tend to bring in more money to the lender   it may say no payments for 6 months but the fine print may have you being charged interest during those 6 months meaning your new shiny computer will be costing more than the sticker price   the good side is that you do n't have to send in any actual payments for 6 months but be aware that you 'll probably be paying more than advertised what are the different ways i can do it your listed options 1 2 are both good ways to pay for your new computer   yes option 1 will charge you sales tax but are you sure paying online excludes sales tax   some states mandate it    option 2 is a viable option too probably your best option 1st there is possibly no sales tax with purchases made online although there may be a delivery charge    2nd you 're not committing to an additional monthly bill you are essentially paying with cash just directly from your bank account   no interest charge 3rd that little visa logo is your friend   purchases made through visa mastercard whether it 's a credit or debit card   normally have an auto extended warranty feature you may want to verify with visa before taking my word on it   typically they double any manufacture 's warranty    lastly you can always set up a paypal account and link it to your bank account   assuming the site you plan on purchasing the computer from accepts paypal

note this answer is true for the uk other places may vary there are a couple of uses for credit cards   the first is to use them in a revolving manner if you pay off the bill in full every time you get one then with the vast majority of cards you will pay no interest delay your expenses by a month build your credit rating and with many credit cards you can also get rewards generally you should wait until the bill comes to pay it off this ensures that your usage is reported to the credit ratings agencies in general you should not draw out cash on credit cards as there is usually a fee and unlike purchases it will start interest immediately the second is longer term borrowing this is where you have to be careful firstly the standard rate on most credit cards is 20 apr which is pretty high secondly on many cards once you are carrying a balance any purchases start interest immediately however many credit cards offer promotional rates in contrast to the standard rates which are an expensive way to borrow the promotional rates often allow you to borrow at 0 apr for some period usually when it comes to promotional rates you get the best deal by opening a new credit card and using it immediately   ideally you should plan to pay off the card before the 0 period ends if you ca n't do that then a balance transfer may be an option but be aware than in a few years the market for credit cards may or may not have changed whatever you do you should always make sure to pay at least the minimum payment and do so on time not doing so may trigger steep fees loss of promotional interest rates there is a site called that tracks the best deals

there is no federal law that mandates that they must re open a closed account they can either refuse the transfer return the money or they can optionally re open your account so they get money makes more sense for them it is however in one of your agreements that they reserve the right to re open a closed account in order to receive the deposit at which point your account will become active and the balance may be below the required minimum balance threshold so you may have maintenance or low balance fees charged against the account credit unions are less likely to have these fees if you want to call them out on their bs you can ask them to cite the law which mandates the re opening of closed accounts they will likely fall back on your member agreement there may be some state laws that discuss this but i have n't found anything this has become such a problem for some bank customers where they are charged fees on the money they were n't aware they had that a law was proposed in sept. 2013 called the freedom and mobility in consumer banking act which would essentially only allow the named account to re open a closed account i went ahead and looked up the guidelines for ach transfers i got the 2013 version   2013 corporate rules and guidelines these lines reference article which is uniform commercial code section funds transfer this means that if your account is actually closed they have an exception to the standard timeframe for issuing a return entry this means that if you notify them in writing that you refuse any future credit entries to the account they must return them i then went looking for the return reason codes rdfi = receiving depository financial institution from what i gather based on these guidelines your cu did n't actually close your account they put it on hold or some similar state if they actually close your account they are required to issue a return entry with code   in your case your cu does n't charge you any maintenance fees but for those working with banks the best bet is to notify them in writing that you refuse any future credits to the account or go into a branch and insist on fully closing out the account

they could if they wanted it 's of course illegal to do if you did n't authorize it and to process credit cards they need to have a relationship with a credit card processing company which is not so easy to fake not any joe could do that using a fake id note that you are protected through your credit card company if you tell them it 's an unauthorized charge they 'll return it to you without discussion it is then the vendor 's duty to prove that it was authorized and if he can not he 'll pay extra fees to the processing company overall the risk is very small it should n't be your worry

the hard and fast rule is to pay off high interest loans first but each individual 's situation is different so there are some things to consider student loan interest is tax deductible up to $ 2,500   will your student loan interest exceed $ 2,500 for the year   if so i would try to pay down the student loan first to bring down the total interest for the year so that you get as much interest back as possible on your tax return   also it may be beneficial to pay off the car first to close that account so that you are only left with the 1 loan   once you have the car loan payment out of the way you can dedicate that amount to paying off the student loan i 'm in almost the same situation as you   i currently have a mortgage and car payment   in 6 months my grace period will be over and my student loan payments will start   i have $ 100k in student loan debt   so i will have a $ 1,100 mortgage payment $ 1,100 student loan payment and $ 700 car payment car loan is 0   i do n't want to have 3 loans active so i will pay off my car loan in a 2 3 months to get that out of the way   then i will pay down my student loan by paying $ 700 extra every month

since handled arbitrage i 'll take goodwill   goodwill is an accounting term that acts much like a plug account you add subtract to it the amount that makes everything balance   in the case of goodwill it generally only applies to mergers amp acquisitions   the theory and justification is this firms buy other firms at prices other than the market price usually higher and it is assumed that this is because the acquirer values its acquisition more than other people do   but whether you use historical prices or market prices when you add subtract assets and liabilities to to from your balance sheet this will never add up because you paid more less than the assets are worth in the market so more less cash flowed out than assets flowed in   the difference goes into the goodwill account so firms with a large goodwill account are ones that have made lots of acquisitions

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

without knowing your credit situation or your full budget it 's a little difficult but i 'd go with the snowball method for now it may seem like not a big deal to have this kind of debt but you really should be looking at it as if your walking around with your hair on fire   it 's a huge emergency debt especially looming cc debt with high rates can make things worse think water on grease fire really quickly so the faster you get rid of it the better   good luck

the short answer is that you would want to use the net inflow or net outflow aka profit or loss    in my experience you 've got a couple different uses for irr and that may be driving the confusion   pretty much the same formula but just coming at it from different angles    thinking about a stock or mutual fund investment you could project a scenario with an up front investment net outflow in the first period and then positive returns dividends then final sale proceeds each a net inflow in subsequent periods   this is a model that more closely follows some of the logic you laid out thinking about a business project or investment you tend to see more complicated and less smooth cashflows   for example you may have a large up front capital expenditure in the first period then have net profit revenue less ongoing maintenance expense then another large capital outlay and so on    in both cases you would want to base your analysis on the net inflow or net outflow in each period   it just depends on the complexity of the cashflows trend as to whether you see a straightforward example initial payment then ongoing net inflows or a less straightforward example with both inflows and outflows    one other thing to note you would only want to include those costs that are applicable to the project   so you would not want to include the cost of overhead that would exist even if you did not undertake the project

if you are just starting out learning to code then really just pick a language you 'll learn some principles that can be transfered to other languages and with experience that becomes easier every time    python is easy great for beginners since it is free has a great community and support online and is pretty well suited for data analysis there are several books for using python for finance google that phrase python is also quite popular for web development which might be another way to learn to code it will require learning html and sql databases besides python but even so might be more accessible rather than jumping into data analysis while learning how to code depends on the person though

if you buy a long term bond with long term fixed interest rate and then the interest rates increase your bond is worth less that 's not a problem because over the years the value of the bond will go back to its nominal value if you have a bond that does n't pay out annually but increases its value every year you will get exactly the amount of cash when it pays out that you expected   the problem is that if for 20 years interest rates were 8 while your bond only paid 4 then you will have such an amount of inflation that the cash you get is worth much less than you hoped you may have hoped that your bond would be worth one year average salary but it may be only worth six months of average salary even if the dollar amount is exactly what you expected

first to clear up your misconceptions the balance is not merely made up of deductible and non deductible contributions   there are also earnings implied in the balance i.e. the whole reason you invest in the first place is to realize some return on investment   that return a.k.a the earnings are included in the balance of the account   the balance is the sum total of everything in the account the bottom line generally speaking basis for an account is all of the money that has been contributed deposited to the account   in the context of an ira as described in the article however they are using basis to refer to only the non deductible contributions   of note however is that basis specifically excludes earnings   if you have deposited say $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next then your basis is $ 10,000 even if the balance has grown to say $ 12,000 which includes the earnings as may be evident by now earnings are not equivalent to deductible contributions   earnings may arise from such contributions but they are not the same   rather earnings are the net positive investment results from all contributions   again if you had contributed $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next and the balance has grown to $ 12,000 then the earnings portion is $ 2000 so to interpret what happened in the specific example provided over the years the account holder contributed deposited a total of $ 15,000 into his account   these must have been non deductible contributions in the case of the ira in order to arrive at basis of $ 15,000 over time and with the deposits that $ 15,000 grew to $ 24,000 i.e. earned $ 9,000 in earnings then the nearly 50 drop caused the balance to decay to $ 13,000   this means all $ 9,000 of his earnings were wiped out plus $ 2000 of the original basis the remaining $ 13,000 is all basis that is considered to be original money deposited to the account no earnings in effect the account has lost $ 2000 of basis because $ 15,000 was deposited and only $ 13,000 remains   simplistic way of looking at it   a $ 15,000 investment resulted in a final $ 13,000 sale i.e. a net loss of $ 2000 it does n't matter that it hit $ 24,000 in the meanwhile it could have hit $ 250,000 in value and then dropped to $ 13,000 and the net result would be the same a loss of $ 2000 in basis traditional ira earnings are always tax deferred i.e. whether earnings arise from deductible or else non deductible contributions when one takes a distribution withdraws from an ira and the distribution includes earnings the earnings portion is always taxable income   does n't matter if the earnings arose from one kind of contribution or the other i do n't think in this example there were any deductible contributions whatsoever does that make sense help

in case you did n't see over the past few years especially in banks falling stock prices often lead to ratings downgrades the logic is that a bank who 's stock price is low or falling is suffering from a decrease in their ability to tap the equity markets in times of need   with less ability to tap the equity markets in times of need this means it is less likely the bank can raise funds to pay off debt and thus makes their debt more risky    it 's unfair for me to imply a 100 causal relationship here because that 's not the case but each of the markets interact with each other in some way you will at least notice that whether leading or trailing companies that have a decreasing stock price also often have a decreasing credit rating   you 'll also notice that stocks which slip under $ 5 often times get put on credit watch    the logic could go any which way around the circle but a company that cuts its dividend may lose some investors who were in it for the dividend this can cause stock price to fall credit agencies depending on the situation may approve of companies that cut their dividend more cash to pay off debt or may indicate the dividend cut is not enough to make up for the company 's falling profits    in the absence of full information a cut in the dividend is often seen as a sign of weakness or a sign of tough times for the company in the future companies which have changes in dividend are looked at as less stable more unpredictable blah blah blah    again i 'm not implying a 100 causal relationship here but each of these markets work with each other somehow and a bank which cuts its dividend may be expecting lower profitability slower growth need the funds to cover lawsuit payouts or settlements with insert regulatory agency or any number of other situations

gt;and how did this cause the mbs to get wiped out was it a written clause or did they just collapse from the value dropping so hard    it was written into the debt instruments   mbs and cdos are broken down into tranches with descending priority of claims to the collateral pool   when it comes time for payment the top tranche gets paid out 100 before the one below it is entitled to a single cent and so on and so forth   here 's an example of how one might be organized     foo | bar | text tranche | size | credit rating class a | | aaa class b | | aa class c | | a class d | | bbb class e | | not rated   in this example lets say that 5 of the loans defaulted meaning that of the $ 1b only $ was available to get paid out assuming no over which most had but that 's besides the point here   the class a would get the full 750 they 're due the class b would get the full 100 and the class c would get the full 60   at this point there is only left so the class d would get 40 of the 50 due a 20 write down and class e would get nothing getting completely wiped out   gt;i do nt know what subordination level means subordination level basically just means how much debt it below it on the capital structure how much needs to get completely wiped out before any particular tranche starts sharing in the losses   gt did defaults reaching 8 meaning that 8 of loan takers defaulted    yeah more or less   technically i think it 's that 8 of the value of the mortgages defaulted but i believe they were set up to be relatively the same size within each instrument so there 's not really much distinction between 8 of the loan takers and 8 of the aggregate value

it 's called extracting consumer surplus basically i have a bunch of movie who have paid a lot for their tickets some of them do n't like popcorn and some do of the people in the latter group there are some who are willing to pay a lot for it that 's partly because i have a select group rich movie and partly because some of these people would be willing to pay more for popcorn with a movie than without if i were just selling popcorn i 'd have to charge a competitive price but i 'm really selling movies which have more than covered my costs rent heat etc so my costs of selling popcorn are less than that of a non movie popcorn seller and i do n't really need to sell it ironically it means that i can take my chances and sell a relatively small amount at a high price thereby maximizing my unit profit i do n't mind having people not buy popcorn because i 've already made my profit from them with the movie from the point of view of the consumer most consumers see popcorn as an afterthought they will seldom   think i can buy popcorn $ 2.00 cheaper at theater a than theater b and there 's a 20 percent chance that i will want to buy popcorn so theater a is 40 cents $ cheaper than theater b. instead most make the decision to buy the popcorn after they 've arrived at theater b because it as impulse item   and even if they do the 40 cents calculation theater b might be selected because other factors convenience location etc outweigh the 40 cent extra cost of popcorn purchased sometimes put another way the cost of popcorn is usually heavily discounted because of its to other facets of the decision

it is a great advice   i would suggest going to the companies house it 's in london somewhere picking up all of their regarding requirements for different forms of corporate entity and deciding if you want to have that burden   it is not a lot of work you can essentially claim vat on all business purchases the way roughly it works is that your company invoices your client your client has to pay the fee + vat usually that vat is then deducted by your client from it 's vat so no loss there and you pay the vat on the difference between the service sales price and your costs computers etc you have to be careful to avoid excessive double taxation paying income tax on both corporate income and then your personal income off said company but it usually comes off in your favor essentially if you 're making more than 50 of your income from services rendered it is to your advantage to render such services as a business entity

it 's not necessarily bad but it can cause the stock price to become a lot more volatile depends on which side of the bet you 're on suppose a hedge fund manager thinks a company is poorly run he may buy a ton of shares so that he can get rid of the current ceo and replace it with his her own for the hedge fund and others long on the stock this is good those who are trading options or using some short term strategies could get screwed because of the sudden volatility   my next point is related to the above what is the intrinsic value of a stock the current price of a stock is the equilibrium of all investor 's perception of the stock 's value professionals make up a value for a stock using models such as dcf once they do so they trade based on what they believe the value of the stock is you might calculate a stock is worth 70 and i believe it 's 80 so the stock price is going to fluctuate a bit but it should keep within that range assuming we 're the only investors then comes a hedge fund manager say carl icahn and discloses a stake in our stock wow the stock must be really valuable everyone starts buying this stock so up it goes to 90 simply because the guy who seems to know what he 's doing bought it the point here is that now it 's not trading based on intrinsic value now it 's purely psychological ie it 's now a momentum stock which you have no idea when it 'll crash look at tesla netflix or just google momentum stocks all the big crashes in stock prices happen when these big funds unload their stocks a surge in supply will cut the price the problem is you ca n't predict when some fund manager will decide to sell some stake of his   tying everything together is liquidity the more liquid a stock is the easier it is to obtain and the less volatile it is the more people playing the game with not too big shares of stock the faster the price will converge to some equilibrium and with less volatility institutional investors take away liquidity

like keshlam mentioned insurance and investment should not generally be mixed term insurance is the best and cheapest insurance this would work out better than money back option you have i.e. take a term insurance for the same amount invest the difference between the premium of term insurance and money back option even if you invest this difference in bank fd 's the return is much more than what your money back policy gives pension plans are not advisable although has in recent times streamlined quite a bit of it there is still some amount that goes into commission plus the returns from annuity providers the yearly payment you get after retirement is less than what you get from fd 's i.e. currently the annuity rates are in the range of 5 6 and one year fd 's are in the range of 7 8 the only reason one need to go with pension plan or money bank plan would be if one is not financially disciplined or ca n't   reconcile to the fact that term insurance in spite of not giving any returns is much better

from what i understand japan has a great consumer goods industry and a sealed off food industry they do not import rice and i seriously doubt anyone can supply seafood in their domestic market cheaper than they can so it could be that they do n't even really need to import that much at all at the end of the day that wealth is still wealth we do n't have that the japanese people can rely upon   i 'm not talking about a voluntary financial constraint like the arbitrary 90 debt gdp policy i 'm saying let 's actually figure out a method for determining our constraints scientifically in real time and adapt our policy accordingly

gt they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate   that 's not true is it i 'm fairly sure they 're taxed at the same rate now buybacks are still better for shareholders though because those who do n't want to sell have the option of just holding the stock with dividends everyone gets a dividend and the associated tax hit whether they want it or not   edit oh right ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income qualified dividends are not but are n't qualified dividends the modal type

you need to set your status as self employed the day you started online work if that date is a little ambiguous as is usually the case with online business you can start with the day you first made any money yes you can deduct expenses from your revenue but you have to be sure that the expenses were purely business related   this is how it goes you inform hmrc about the day you started work hmrc will assign you a unique tax reference number depending on how much you make you might or might not need to pay class 2 ni contributions you 'll need to tell hmrc how much you expect to earn in the current tax year finally you 'll need to complete a self assessment at the end of the tax year i highly recommend setting up a business banking account here is a link that discusses being part time self employed in the uk

psychology today had an interesting article from july 11 2016 in which they go through the psychological aspects of using cash vs. a credit card this article cites a 2008 paper in the journal of experimental psychology applied that found the more transparent the payment outflow the greater the aversion to spending or higher the pain of leading to less transparent payment modes such as credit cards and gift cards vs. cash being more easily spent or treated as play or monopoly the article cites a number of other studies that are of interest on this topic as well

they have a minimum to discourage applications for that particular card every application costs them money because they have to pay the credit agencies to pull the applicant 's credit history so one way they save money and reduce their cost of business is to discourage people from applying if they 're not creditworthy enough for that product credit card companies tailor their products into different income credit brackets those who have less creditworthiness would be better suited for a different product than what you 're referring similar to those with greater creditworthiness

the textbook answer would be assets discounted value of all future profit   is usually simple if a company has an extra $ 1 m in cash it 's worth $ 1 m more if it has an extra $ 1 m in debt it 's worth $ 1 m less if a company with assets and $ 50k in profit has a $ 1 m valuation then that implies that whoever makes that valuation wants to buy at that price really believes one of two things either the future profit will be significantly larger than $ 50k say it 's rapidly growing   or the true worth of assets is much more say there 's some ip code patents people that have low book value but some other company would pay $ 1 m just to get that the point is that valuation is subjective since the key numbers in the calculations are not perfectly known by anyone who does n't have a time machine you can make estimates but the knowledge to make the estimates varies some buyers sellers have extra information and they can be influenced by those buyers sellers e.g. for strategic acquisitions the value of company is significantly changed simply because someone claims they want to acquire it and $ 1 m valuation for a company with $ 500 m in profits is n't appropriate it 's appropriate only if the profits are expected to drop to zero within a couple years a stagnant but stable company with $ 500 m profits would be worth at least $ 5 m and potentially much more

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

this comment might sound like a circle jerk but i think it 's important to say indeed innovation is what creates more productivity which is fueled by debt but debt is fueled by real savings which comes from under consuming which is easier when your productivity is higher the government can stimulate innovation yes but only at the expense of someone else    what 's really scary is the federal reserve has been manufacturing all the savings for nearly a decade now so there 's a complete mismatch between credit and savings and the overall economy the actual price of money itself is manufactured too so just about all asset prices are inherently flawed in my view    i think it 's important to piggy back your point about innovation and how productivity ca n't really go down because inventions and new methods of producing goods do n't we come up with the engine or a new drug for example it 's now here forever ideally it 's work that we do n't have to do all over again   what brings on a crash or feeling like we 're going backwards in terms of progress comes when we somehow manage to go through a boom bust like in 2008 but then take on all this debt normally we can pay off debt but when the government manufactures it and credit is created out of nothing that 's when you get into problems like not being able to pay it back because it was n't truly real or representative of real savings i feel like i 'm ranting now but i think this stuff is super important and i think you understand it

no   this is too much for most individuals even some small to medium businesses   when you sell that investment and take the cheque into the foreign bank and wire it back to the usa in us dollars you will definitely obtain the final value of the investment converted to us$ that s what you wanted right   you 'll get that   if you also hedge unless you have a situation where it is a perfect hedge then you are gambling on what the currencies will do a perfect hedge is unusual for what most individuals are involved in it looks something like this   you know is going to pay you 10 million on dec 31   so you go to a bank probably a foreign bank i 've found they have lower limits for this kind of transaction and more customizable than what you might create trading futures contracts and tell them i have this contract for a 10 million receivable on dec 31 i 'd like to arrange a fx forward contract and lock in a rate for this in us$   they may have a credit check or a deposit for such an arrangement because as the rates change either the bank will owe you money or you will owe the bank money if they quote you 0.05 us$ then you know that when you hand the cheque over to the bank your contract payment will be worth us$ 500,000   the forward rate may differ from the current rate that s how the bank accounts for risk and includes a profit even with a perfect hedge you should be able to see the potential for trouble   if the bank does nt quite trust you and hey banks are nt known for trust then as the strengthens relative to the us$ they may suspect that you will walk away from the deal   this risk can be reduced by including terms in the contract requiring you to pay the bank some as that happens   if the falls you would get this money credited back to your account   this is also how futures contracts work there it is called mark to market accounting   trouble here   some people seeing how they are down money on the hedge cancel it   it is a classic mistake because it the protection that one was trying to achieve   often the rate will move back and the is left with less money than they would have had doing nothing even though they bought a perfect hedge

in my opinion i would if the income is from this year you can tax shelter $ plus somewhere between $ 50,000 and $ 300,000 depending on age in a 401(k and defined benefit plan this will take care of the current tax burden afterwards set aside your remaining tax liability in cash the after tax money should be split into cash and the rest into assets the split depends on your level of risk tolerance build a core portfolio using highly liquid and non correlated etfs think spy tlt qqq ect once these core positions are locked in start lowering your basis by systematically selling a 1 standard deviation call in the etf per 100 units of underlying this will reduce your upside extend your breakeven and often yield steady income similarly you can sell 1 standard deviation iron should the vix be high enough point is you have the money to deploy a professional type systematic strategy that is non correlated and income generating

the safest place to put money is a mixture of cash local municipal bond funds with average durations under two years and us treasury bond funds with short durations   examples of good short term us municipal funds i 'm not an active investor in australian securities so i wo n't recommend anything specific because rates are so low right now you want a short duration ie funds where the average bond matures in < 2 years fund to protect against increased rates the problem with safety is that you wo n't make any money if your goal to grow the value of your investment while minimizing risk you need to look at equities the portfolios posted by justkt are a great place to start

sounds nice in theory but let 's be honest here   competition between channels is weak   there do exist people who go on google and search for products though generally these people are looking for reviews which they will later go to amazon to purchase but most people go directly to amazon and use it as a product search engine   amazon owns search they own the marketplace they own the distribution   and they get to look at all your data if and when they see you got a good thing going they can choose to manipulate their listings to favor themselves and drown you out   it 's easy to say yeah being in the marketplace sucks just do n't do it   but if you do n't participate in their marketplace you 're probably going to go out of business   there is not a sufficient amount of competition in the other markets that are viable to go somewhere else ebay sears marketplace google shopping they 're a pittance

it is normally a bad idea to cash in retirement accounts to buy a house in your case it is a horrible idea because you are way behind on saving for retirement other fallacies in your reasoning    my advice increase the amount you are saving for retirement considerably and also put some money aside to save for a down payment on a house buy the house when you have enough non retirement money to afford the down payment if you ca n't wait that long buy a house you can afford it may help to think of it this way visualize yourself as a 65 year old retired person with very little income and living on your retirement account would you as a 39 year old ask that person to give you $ the amount you are talking about withdrawing compounded annually at 6 interest for 25 years with no additional contributions so that you could put a down payment on a house because that is what you would be doing when you hit retirement age would you kick yourself for making such a decision because unless you die young that person is sitting out there in your future needing that money to live off of do n't take this the wrong way but the tone of your question seems like you are looking for support to make what you already know is a bad financial decision

inflation and stock returns are completely different things the cpi tracks the changes in the prices of a basket of goods a consumer might buy the s&p 500 tracks the returns earned by investors in the equity of large companies   the two are very different things and not closely linked example a world without inflation consider a world in which there was no inflation   prices are fixed   should stocks return zero   certainly not   companies take raw materials and produce goods and services that have value greater than that of the raw materials   they create new wealth   this wealth becomes profit for the company which then is passed on to the owners of the company equityholders either in the form of dividends or more commonly price increases example a world with no inflation and no economic growth note that i have not implied above that companies have to grow in order for returns to outperform inflation   total stock returns depend on the current and expected profit of the firm   firms can remain the same size and continually kick out profits   total returns will be positive in this environment even if there is no growth and no inflation   if the firms pay the money out as dividends investors get a cash flow   if they retain these earnings the value of the firm 's equity increases   total returns take both types of income into account   technically the s&p 500 is not a total return index but in our current legal and corporate culture environment there is a preference for retaining profits rather than paying them out   this causes price increases risk bearing in principle if profit was assured then investors would bid up stock prices so high that profit would have to compete with the risk free rate which often is close to inflation like right now   however profit is not assured   firm profit swings around over time and constitutes a significant source of risk   we can think of the owners of the firm as being the bondholders and equityholders   these assets are structured such that almost all the profit risk is born by equityholders   we can therefore think of equityholders as being compensated for bearing the risk that would otherwise   be born by bondholders   because equityholders are bearing risk stock prices must be low enough that stocks have a positive expected return above the risk free rate which is presumably not significantly below inflation   this is true for the same reason that insurance premiums are positive people have to be compensated for bearing risk see my answer to this question for a discussion of why risk means we should expect stock prices to increase indefinitely even if inflation the s&p is not a measure of firm size or value the s&p measures the return earned by investors not the size of us companies   true if constituent companies grow and nothing else changes the index goes up but if a company shrinks a lot it gets dropped out rather than dragging the index down by the way please note that dollars put into equities are not stuck somewhere   they are passed on to the seller who then uses it to buy something even if this is a new equity issuance and the seller is the firm itself   the logic that growth of firms somehow sucks money out of usage is incorrect

i came to us as an international student several years ago and i have also experienced the same situation like most of the international students in finding ways to build credit history below i list out some possible approaches you may want to consider i. get a student job at campus recommended i think the best way is to get a student job in university say a teaching assistant or student helper in this case you can be provided with a social security number and start to build your own credit history ii get credit card you can also consider to apply for a credit card there are indeed some financial institutions that can provide credit cards for international students with no or limited credit scores requirement say discover and bank of america however it is relatively hard to get approved simply because hey may put more restriction in other aspects for example you may be required to keep sufficient bank balance above several thousand dollars during a period of time or you should prove that you have relatives with citizenship in us who can provide your financial aid if needed iii apply for a loan recommended getting a loan product is another alternative to get out of this difficult situation but most of people do n’t realize that there are some fintech start ups in united states that specifically focus on international loan financing one representative example is an online lending company that specializes in providing car loan for international students with no ssn or credit history i once used their loan product to finance a honda accord and reported my loan transaction records to us credit bureau during my repayment process later when i officially got my ssn number i found my credit history has been automatically and i do n’t have to start from all over again it never be an easy journey for international students to build credit history in united states what approach you should make really depends on you own situation i hope the information above can be useful and good luck for your credit journey

the problem with commodities is that they do n't produce income with a stock or bond even if you never sold it to anyone or it was n't publicly traded you know you can collect the money the company makes or collect interest that 's a quantifiable income from the security by computing the present value of that income cf you can have at least a rough sense of the value of the stock or bond investment commodities on the other hand eat income insurance and storage their value comes from their practical uses e.g. in manufacturing which eventually results in income for someone and from psychological factors the psychological factors are inherently unpredictable demand due to practical uses should keep up with inflation since in principle the prices on whatever products you make from the commodity would keep up with inflation but even here there 's a danger because it may be that over time some popular uses for a given commodity become obsolete for example this commodity used to be a bigger deal than now i guess the reverse is also possible that new uses for a commodity drive up demand and prices   to the extent that metals such as silver and gold bounce around wildly much more so than inflation i find it hard to believe the bouncing is mostly due to changes in uses of the metals it seems far more likely that it 's due to psychological factors and momentum traders to me this makes metals a speculative investment and identifying a bubble in metals is even harder than identifying one in income producing assets that can more easily be valued to identify a bubble you have to figure out what will go on in the minds of a horde of other people and when it seems safest for individual investors to just assume commodities are always in a bubble and stay away the one arguable reason to own commodities is to treat them as a random bouncing number which may enhance returns as long as you rebalance even if on average commodities do n't make money over inflation this is what people are saying when they suggest owning a small slice of commodities as part of an asset allocation if you do this you have to be careful not to expect to make money on the commodities themselves i.e. they are just something to sell some of rebalance out of whenever they 've happened to go up a lot

so your point is that you know a guy that is n't good with money and has made some not great life decisions thus all people that work low skilled jobs even at the minimum wage level are thus bad with their money and not cut out to own a house really is that your argument   correlation is not causation just because someone works a low skilled job and is bad with money life decisions and should n't own a house does not mean that working low skilled jobs are the root of those problems   gt;that being said the initial argument is as bogus as yours i have a 2 bed 1 bath apartment for rent for $ 500 right now inside loop in houston tx it 's 10 15 minutes from downtown   and rent here in the seattle area is way higher than all of that yes rent is different where you live it still does n't mean people in my area should have to live in a shack because you pay $ 500 in houston honestly that should be an incentive for companies to move to houston to reduce costs due to cost of living difference which is why companies are leaving california but if you are here in seattle or another city there should be the expectation that your workers can afford to pay rent somewhere in the area   also just curious do you pay any of your employees only the minimum wage

i want to caveat that i am not an active investor in australia you most likely should seek out other investors in your market and ask them for advice but since you came here i can give you some generalized advice   when investing in real estate there are a two main rules of thumb to quickly determine if the property will be a good investment the 50 rule and the 2 or 1 rule    the 50 rules says that in general 50 if the income from the property will go to expenses not including debt service   if you are bringing in $ 1000 a month 500 of that will go to utilities taxes repair capital expenditures advertising lawn care etc that leave you with 500 to pay the mortgage and if anything is left that can be cash flow   as this is your first property and it is in a relatively bad neighbourhood you might consider bumping that up to 60 just to make sure you have padding the 1 or 2 rules says that the monthly rent should be 2 percent of the purchase price in this case the home is bought at 150,000   if the rent is 1,500 a month it might be a good investment but if it rents for 3,000 a month it probably is a good investment   there are other factors to consider if a home meets the 2 rule it might be in a rough neighborhood which increases turnover which in general is the biggest expense in an investment property   if a property meets one or both of these rules you should take a closer look at it and with proper due diligence determine that it is a deal   these rules are just hard and fast guidelines to property analysis they may need to be adapted to you market   for example these rules will not hold in most all big cities

while i agree with the existing bulk of comments and answers that you ca n't tell the lender the $ 7k is a gift i do think you might have luck finding a mortgage broker who can help you get a loan as a group   you might consider as an llc or other form of corporation if no one will take you otherwise   that is each of you will be an owner of the house and appear on the mortgage   iirc as long as the downpayment only comes from the collective group and the income to debt ratio of the group as a whole is acceptable and the strongest credit rating of the group is good you should be able to find a loan   you may need a formal ownership agreement to get this accepted by the lender   that said i do n't know if your income will trump your brother 's situation presumably high debt ratio or lower than 100 multiplier on his income dues to its source but it will certainly help as to how to structure the deal for fairness i think whatever the two of you agree to and put down in writing is fine   if you each think you 're helping the other than a 50/50 split on profits at the sale of the property seems reasonable to me    i 'd recommend that you actually include in your write up a defined maximum period for ownership e.g. or 10yr etc and explain how things will be resolved if one side does n't want to sell at that point but the other side does just remember that whatever percentages you agree to as ownership wo n't effect the lender 's view of payment requirements   the lender will consider each member of the group fully and independently responsible for the loan   that is if something happens to your brother or he just out on you you will be on the hook for 100 of the loan   and vice versa   your write up ought to document what happens if one of you out on paying agreed upon amounts but still expects there ownership share at the time of sale that said if you 're trying to be mathematically fair about ownership you could do something like the below to try and factor in the various issues into the money flow the above has the benefit that you can start with a different ownership split etc if one of you wants to own more of the property

income tax was seen as a way to exploit the revenues available from the rapidly expanding ranks of people with mid to high incomes it was initially targeted at the very wealthy previously most federal revenues came from excise taxes and tariffs both of which have many negative economic effects leave the government with limited revenue generating ability and bring a host of international and domestic political problems   since the successful implementation of the income tax required a constitutional amendment it is very unlikely that anyone at the time seriously considered the income tax a temporary measure

a simple example when looking at oil trading in different locations first i have some back of the adjustments for the grade of oil then look at storage costs irrelevant in the case of electricity and transport costs between two locations to see if physical players are actively the spread    no strong views on reading material in this specific area google google scholar and amazon all have relevant material   when it comes to your current problem here are some questions to think about   1 is the power generated from the same commodity at location a and location w    2 how has the spread changed in the past has trading location w actively hedged the worst cases of prices moves in location a    3 is it feasible to trade the commodity that location a generates the majority of its power from how does that compare to electricity trading at location w as a hedge   4 if hedging is really desirable are you sure you ca n't do an illiquid over the counter hedge at location a paying a little bit more in the bid ask for the hedge could be more desirable than trying to jump into a market you yourselves do n't quite understand   5 if your consultants come back with just some hedge ratios without discussing what drives the spreads between the two locations and where the spreads are currently be skeptical

in addition to the other answers here 's a proper strategy that implements your idea if the options are priced properly they should account for future dividend payments so all other things aside a put option that is currently at the money should be in the money after the dividend and hence more expensive than a put option that is out of the money today but at the money after the dividend has been paid the unprotected futures if priced correctly should account for dividend payments based on the dividend history and since maturing after the payment should earn you you sell them less money because you deliver the physical after the dividend has been paid the protected ones should reflect the expected total return value of the stock at the time of maturity i.e. the dividend is mentally calculated into the price and any dividend payments that happen on the way will be debited from your cash and credited to the counterparty now that 's the strategy that leaves you with nearly no risk the only risk you bear is that the dividend is n't as high as you expected   but for that comfort you have to pay premiums   so to see if you 're smarter than the market subtract all the costs for the hedging instruments from your dividend yield and see if your still better than the lending rate   if so do the trade

yes you should take in the expenses being incurred by the mutual fund this   lists down the fees charged by the mutual fund and where expenses can be found in the annual statement of the fund to calculate fees and expenses as you might expect fees and expenses vary from fund to fund a fund with high costs must perform better than a low cost fund to generate the same returns for you even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time you do n't pay expenses so the money is taken from the assets of the fund so you pay it indirectly if the expenses are huge that may point to something i.e. fund managers are enjoying at your expense money is being used somewhere else rather than being paid as dividends if the expenses are used in the growth of the fund that is a positive sign else you can expect the fund to be downgraded or upgraded by the credit rating agencies depending on how the credit rating agencies see the expenses of the fund and other factors generally comparison should be done with funds invested in the same sectors same distribution of assets so that you have a homogeneous comparison to make else it would be unwise to compare between a fund invested in oil companies and other in computers yes the economy is inter but that is not how a comparison should be done

the 401(k has the advantage that you do n't pay any tax until you take it out that lets the gains multiple two examples if any of your stocks pay dividends these are directly taxable if you do n't have a 401(k in the 401(k the full dividends accumulate and are reinvested if you sell any stocks and get capital gains they are also directly taxable in a normal account having said that if you do n't get any match i would consider doing a 50/50 put half of your money in the 401(k in something simple like an index fund and invest the rest that 's assuming you have an index fund available in your 401(k

first do you understand why it dropped was it overvalued before or is this an overreaction to some piece of news about them or about their industry or arguably if you ca n't answer that you are n't paying enough attention to have been betting on that individual stock assuming you do understand why this price swing occurred or if you 're convinced you know better than the folks who sold at that price do you believe the stock will recover a significant part of its value any time soon or at least show a nice rate of growth from where it is now if so you might want to hold onto it risking further losses against the chance of recovering part or all of what is at this moment only a loss on paper basically if having just seen it drop you 'd still consider buying it at the new price you should buy it from yourself and go on from here that way at least you are n't doing exactly what you hope to avoid buying high and selling low heck if you really believe in the stock you could see this as a buying opportunity on the other hand if you do not believe you would buy it now at its new price and if you see an alternative which will grow more rapidly you should take your losses and move your money to that other stock or split the difference if you are n't sure which is better but can figure out approximately how unsure you are the question is how you move on from here more than how you got here what happened happened what do you think will happen next and how much are you willing to bet on it on the hand this is part of how the market operates risk and potential reward tend to be pretty closely tied to each other you can reduce risk by diversifying across multiple investments so no one company sector market can hurt you too badly and almost anyone sane will tell you that you should diversify but that means giving up some of the chance for big winnings too you probably want to be cautious with most of your money and go for the longer odds only with a small portion that you can afford to lose on if this is really stressing you out you may not want to play with individual stocks mutual funds have some volatility too but they 're inherently diversified to a greater or lesser extent they will rarely delight you but they wo n't usually slap you this way either

the answers here are all correct   this is 100 scam beyond any reasonable doubt   do n't fall for it   however i felt it valuable to explain what would happen were you to fall for this   it 's not all that hard to understand but it involves understanding some of the time delays that exist in modern banking today the most important thing to understand is that depositing a check does not actually put dollars in your account even though it appears to   a check is not legal tender for debts public and private   it 's a piece of paper known as a bill of exchange   it 's an authorization for a payee you to request that their bank pay you the amount on the check   a transaction made with a check does not actually draw to a close until your bank and their bank communicate and cause the actual transfer of funds to take place   this process is called clearing the check despite living in the modern times this process is slow   it can take 7 10 days to clear a check especially if it is an international bank   this is not good for the banking business   you can imagine how difficult it would be to tell a poor client who is living paycheck to paycheck that he ca n't have his pay until the check clears a week later   banks have an interest in hiding this annoying feature of the modern banking system so they do   when you deposit a check the bank will typically advance you the money an interest free loan in effect while the check floats i.e. until it clears   this creates the illusion that the money is actually in your account for most intents and purposes   presumably a bank would distinguish between the floating check and a cleared check if you tried to close out your account but otherwise it looks and feels like the money is in your hands of course if the check is because the payer had insufficient funds or the account simply did not exist your bank will not get the money   at this moment they will cancel any advances you received and notify you that the check bounced   again this happens 7 10 days later the general pattern of this scam is that they will pay you by a method which clears slowly like a check   they will then ask you to withdraw the money using a faster clearing method like a wire transfer or withdrawing the cash   typically they will be encouraging you to move quickly they are on a timetable when their check bounces the game is up   at this time it will appear as though the account has a positive balance but in fact it has a negative balance plus an advance on the check   this looks great until 7 10 days later when the check bounces   at that time the bank will cancel the advance and reality will set in   you will now have an open bank account legally opened by you in your own name which is deeply in debt   meanwhile the scammer walks away with all the money that you sent them which cleared quickly there are many variants which can hide the details   some can play games with check kiting to try to make your first check clear then try to rope you in for a more painful hit   some will change the instruments they use checks are the easy ones so they 're simply most common   do n't try to think maybe this one is legit   these scammers literally make a living off of making shady transactions look legit things i would recommend looking out for

yes absolutely   the hsa when used for medical expenses allows you to essentially pay for your medical expenses tax free even if you do n't have extra room in your budget you can fund the hsa as you incur medical expenses then withdraw money to pay the expenses and you 'll see an immediate tax benefit at tax time   however let 's say that you have plenty of room in your budget and you do n't have a lot of medical expenses you already contribute the maximum to your 401(k or ira and you want to do more the hsa acts like a retirement account in this case allowing you to contribute before tax money and let it grow untaxed   the hsa does have a huge benefit that no other retirement account has if you choose not to reimburse yourself for medical expenses but you keep track of the unreimbursed expenses you incur then you can reimburse yourself for these expenses at any point in the future completely tax free essentially your contributions are treated like a traditional ira but your withdrawals are treated like a roth ira and can be done at any age if you do n't acquire enough medical expenses you can still withdraw whatever is left at age 65 and those withdrawals will be taxed like a traditional ira   the hsa provides for tax free contributions and growth if used for medical expenses and tax deferred growth if withdrawn after age 65 without medical expenses

well primarily because that 's fraud and fraud prevents a debtor from receiving a discharge in bankruptcy court   fraud would be pretty easy to prove if you did n't have an income change and you have several lines of credit opened on and around the same day with almost no payments made toward them   additionally thanks to the reforms of the bankruptcy code if your income exceeds the median income of your state you 'll be forced in to a chapter 13 and committed to a repayment plan that allocates all of your disposable income to your creditors now if whoever posted that will attempt to simply not pay then negotiate repayment plans with their creditors the process will last far longer than 7 years   it takes a long time to be in default for enough time that a consumer creditor will negotiate the debt and this is assuming the creditor does n't sue you and get a judgement which could apply liens to any property you may own   the will likely cause you to pursue bankruptcy anyway only now you 're at least a few years beyond the point at which you ruined your credit

this is not an answer to all of your questions but merely an on one of your comments are there any other areas in the uk that would return rental yields    much above 10 net    shares i could withdraw the money and buy shares for the dividend income but it is hard to choose shares that yield more than about 6 and they are volatile i wrote a post about using shares to invest a pension pot you may find it of some interest of course the investing would take place within the pension wrapper so you 'd only be paying tax on the income taken out each year the other alternatives you mention suggest paying for the expertise and time of an ifa would be a very economical decision £ 1,000 to best use £ 150,000 seems a bargain to me some of the avenues you mention seem very risky from my understanding so someone to determine your tolerances and propose a holistic solution is a good path forward best wishes

i guess the opposite of being hedged is being unhedged typically a hedge is an additional position that you would take on in order to mitigate the potential for losses on another position i 'll give an example say that i purchase 100 shares of stock xyz at $ 10 per share because i believe its price will increase in the future   at that point my full investment of $ 1000 is at risk so the position is not hedged if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've lost $ 200   if the price of xyz increases to $ 12 then i 've gained $ 200 the profit loss curve has a linear relationship to the future stock price suppose that i decide to hedge my xyz position by purchasing a put option i purchase a single option contract corresponding to my 100 shares with a strike price of $ 10 and an expiration date in january 2013 for a price of $ this means that until the contract expires i can always sell my xyz shares for a minimum of $ 10   therefore if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've only lost $ 50 the price of the option contract compared to the $ 200 that i would have lost if the position was unhedged   likewise however if the price increases to $ 12 then i 've only gained a net total of $ 150 due to the money i spent on the hedge the details of how much money you would actually lose in the hedged scenario are simplified out above even out of the money options retain some value before expiration but pricing of options is outside of the scope of this post so as a more pointed answer to your question i would say that the hedged unhedged status of a position can be characterized by its potential for loss if you do n't have any other assets that will increase in value to offset losses on your position of interest i would call it unhedged

generally it goes by when they receive the check not when they cash the check though if the check was received prior to midnight on december 31st but after the bank closes they would probably let the tax payer decide to count it for the next year of course if the check is from person a to person b then the only issue is gift tax or annual limit calculations   if it is company to person then income tax could be involved   the irs calls this constructive receipt income    under the cash method include in your gross income all items of    income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year if    you receive property or services you must include their fair market    value in income example    on december 30 2011 mrs. sent you a check for interior    decorating services you provided to her you received the check on    january 2 2012 you must include the amount of the check in income    for 2012   constructive receipt    you have constructive receipt of    income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to    you without restriction you do not need to have possession of it if    you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you you    are treated as having received it when your agent received it example     interest is credited to your bank account in december 2012 you do not    withdraw it or enter it into your passbook until 2013 you must    include it in your gross income for 2012   delaying receipt of income     you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to avoid paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction example    jones a service contractor was entitled to receive a $ 10,000    payment on a contract in december 2012 she was told in december that    her payment was available at her request she was not paid until    january 2013 she must include this payment in her 2012 income because    it was constructively received in 2012   checks    receipt of a valid    check by the end of the tax year is constructive receipt of income in    that year even if you can not cash or deposit the check until the    following year example dr. received a check for $ 500 on december 31 2012 from a    patient she could not deposit the check in her business account until    january 2 2013 she must include this fee in her income for 2012 in general it is best not to cut it close if the check is to be counted as an january event it is best to send it in january if it is to be december event it is best to send it early enough to be able to say with confidence that the check arrived at the destination before the end of the year

in your case i believe the answer is that you do n't owe any taxes if your deductions exceed your income there is something called the alternate minimum tax to catch rich people who claim too many deductions basically it taxes their gross income at a lower rate but allows them no deductions if they make $ or more you are not in that tax bracket

actually the part is interesting because they actually are n't middlemen just faster buyer 's and sellers on the open market they just buy what one person is selling and sell it to someone else who is at the same time looking to buy so i guess the issue is the same time is n't the same for all parties concerned on the other hand both buyer and seller can set limits on the bounds of the price and only transact when someone meets their terms if you are willing to accept whatever the market will bear then it seems like you should be ok with getting it

there is nothing wrong with giving out data and statistics so companies can hire a more more diverse workforce   and i have absolutely no problem with what a company does internally to accomplish this goal     the problem i have is what you said last gt;if a company wants to be racist in their hiring i am ok with that company going away   that is the most heavy handed thing the government could do   even if a openly racist is only hiring whites   what right does the community government have to stop him   the racist is not hurting anyone   his only crime is only wanting to associate with individuals he wants too   yes less blacks will have less jobs but is it the responsibility of the racist to hire blacks no of course not   but if the community government wants to shut the racist down for his hiring practices then we do n't live in a county where rights and property is protected   we live in a country where we think that it is a right to force someone else to hire you

not all call options that have value at expiration exercise by purchasing the security or attempting to with funds in your account    on etns they often always settle in cash   as an example of an option i 'm currently looking at it settles in cash please confirm by reading the documentation on this set of options at but it is an example of this   there 's nothing it can settle into as you ca n't purchase the index only options on it   you may quickly look wikipedia at the difference between american style options and european style options for more understanding here interestingly i just spoke to my broker about this subject for a trade execution   before i go into that let me also quickly refer to joe 's answer   what you buy you can sell   that 's one of the jobs of a market maker to provide liquidity in a market   so when you buy a stock you can sell it   when you buy an option you can sell it   that 's at any time before expiration although how close you do it before the closing bell on expiration friday saturday is your discretion   when a market maker lists an option price they list a bid and an ask   if you are willing to sell at the bid price they need to purchase it generally speaking   that 's why they put a spread between the bid and ask price but that 's another topic not related to your question just note the point of them buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price that 's what they 're saying they 'll do now one major difference with options vs. stocks is that options are contracts so therefore we can note just as easily that you can sell the option on something particularly if you own either the underlying or an option deeper in the money   if you own the underlying instrument stock and you sell a call option on it this is a strategy typically referred to as a covered call considered a risk reduction strategy   you forfeit potential gains on the upside for money you receive in selling the option the point of this discussion is is simply what one buys one can sell   what one sells one can buy that 's how a market is supposed to work   and also not to think that making money in options is buying first then selling   it may be selling and either buying back or ideally that option expiring worthless now a final example   let 's say you buy a deep in the money call on a stock trading at $ 150 and you own the $ 100 calls   at expiration these have a value of $ 50   but let 's say you do n't have any money in your account to take ownership of the underlying security you have to come up with the additional $ 100 per share you are missing   in that case need to call   your broker and see how they handle it and it will depend on the type of account you have e.g. margin or not ira etc   generally speaking though the margin department makes these decisions and they look through folks that have options on things that have value and are expiring and whether they have the funds in their account to absorb the security they are going to need to own   exchange wise options that have value at expiration are exercised   but what if the person who has the option does n't have the funds to own the whole stock well ideally on monday they 'll buy all the shares with the options you have at the current price and immediately liquidate the amount you ca n't afford to own but they do n't have to   i 'm mentioning this detail so that it helps you see what 's going or needs to go on with exchanges and brokerages and individuals so you have a broader picture

you want to buy when the stock market is at an all time low for that day unfortunately you do n't know the lowest time until the end of the day and then you uh ca n't buy the stock now the stock market is not random but for your case we can say that effectively it is so when should you buy the stock to hopefully get the lowest price for the day you should wait for 37 of the day and then buy when it is lower than it has been for all of that day here is a quick example with fake data we have 18 points and 37 of 18 is close to 7 so we discard the first 7 points and just remember the lowest of those 7 we bear in mind that the lowest for the first 37 was 5 now we wait until we find a stock which is lower than 5 and we buy at that point this system is optimal for buying the stock at the lowest price for the day why we want to find the   best position to stop automatically ignoring why 37 we know the answer to in position n it 's as there are n toilets and we can select just 1 now what is the chance we select them given we 're in position n the chance of selecting any of the toilets from 0 to k is 0 remember we 're never going to buy then so let 's move on to the toilets from and onwards if is better than all before it we have this but might not be the best price from all past and future prices maybe is better let 's look at for we have k for we have k so we have this is a close approximation of the area under especially as x    so 0 + 0 + + k n x + + + ≈ k n x k and so ≈ k n x k now to simplify say that x = k n we can graph this and find the maximum point so we know the maximum or we can use calculus here 's the graph   here 's the calculus to apply this back to your situation with the stocks if your stock updates every 30 seconds and is open between and we have 6.5 hours = 390 minutes = 780 you should keep track of the lowest price for the first and then buy your stock on the next best price because x = k n the chance of you choosing the best price is 37 however the chance of you choosing better than the average stock is above 50 for the day remember this method just tries to mean you do n't loose money within the day if you want to try to minimise losses within the whole trading period you should scale this up so you wait 37 of the trading period e.g. 37 of 3 months and then select the maths is taken from mathematical way to choose a toilet finally one way to lose money a little slower and do some good is with giving loans to people is developing countries it 's like a bank account with a -1 interest which is only 1 lower than a lot of banks and you do some good i have no affiliation with them

normally when thinking about whether it 's worth it to start a small business the biggest factor is your time there 's a big difference between spending 10 hours to make a profit of $ 50 vs spending 1 hour to make a profit of $ 50 your scenario is quite different though in that you suggest your wife is considering teaching for free instead of accepting payment in this case the time factor almost goes away since if you accept payment there is very little extra time involved for depositing checks tracking income and filling out some extra forms come tax time from a financial point of view there is no reason to turn down the money if people are willing to pay it there may be other reasons to prefer doing it for free but taxes social security payments and the small extra effort to run the business would n't normally be among those reasons i do n't know what your reasons for possibly preferring to do it for free are but an alternative option to consider is to donate all of her income to charity

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

ponzi schemes or pyramid schemes are based on paying earlier investors from the money invested by the later ones for ponzi scheme the idea is generally to distribute some high consistent dividend payout based on the inflow of money from new investors as long as new investors are coming the scheme can be sustained for quite some time see the madoff 's example that over decades in the mean time the scheme operator can take some of the investment money to himself legally as fees and salary illegally as the scheme operator does n't actually have to put in any money other than some organizational expenses however at some point the new investors money wo n't be enough to pay all the existing investors inevitably sooner or later since the dividend payout grows with each new investor and there are no infinite exponential amount of new investors to cover for it that 's when the $ + hits the fan and sons of the start ending up hanging from the ceiling pyramid scheme is built on similar idea but the dividend payout varies based on the level of the investor i.e. the investor gets paid based on how many new ones he brought in and how many new ones rooted from them thus the incentive to bring new investors is directly shifted to the investors themselves the here are at the top and get the most payouts from all the rest of the participants they themselves usually put no or very little investment however the end result is the same could n't possibly be enough investors to sustain this model forever and it will inevitably fail at some point when such a scheme fails the paying fund ends up being bankrupt either due to cashflow problems not enough money in to pay money out or because all the money dries out usually both how to detect if the reports are not falsified which in most cases they are you 'll see clearly that there 's no actual investment income in the cash flow but the reports are usually falsified to conceal this exact fact so that 's where the independent auditors and regulatory oversight come in handy generally if an investment fund does n't have a reputable independent auditor stay away

i quite like the canadian couch potato which provides useful information targeted at investors in canada they specifically provide some model portfolios canadian couch potato generally suggests investing in indexed etfs or mutual funds made up of four components one etf or mutual fund tracking canadian bonds another tracking canadian stocks a third tracking us stocks and a fourth tracking international stocks i personally add a reit etf bmo equal weight reits index etf but that may complicate things too much for your liking canadian couch potato specifically recommends the tangerine portfolio if you are looking for something particularly easy though the management expense ratio is rather high for my liking anyway the website provides specific suggestions whether you are looking for a single mutual fund multiple mutual funds or prefer etfs from personal experience tangerine 's offerings are very very simple and far cheaper than the 2.5 you are quoting i currently use td 's e series funds and spend only a few minutes a year rebalancing there are a number of good etfs available if you want to lower your overhead further though canadians do n't get quite the deals available in the u.s. still you should n't be paying anything remotely close to 2.5 also beware of tax implications the website has several articles that cover these in detail

this is only true for countries where we do n't have a tax treaty if we have a tax treaty with the country then you would get foreign tax credits if you repatriated the money the reason us corporates do this is because us corporate tax rate is the second highest effective rate in the world at ~40 depending on the state you 're in    so if they want to repatriated cash from canada they 'd repatriate at the us rate and then receive foreign tax credits for the amount they paid in canadian taxes on balance they 'll have just paid the us rate

i d like to start by saying you re still doing this yourself and i do nt actually have all the info required anyway do nt send it but   descriptive statistical measures provide a thorough discussion of the meaning and interpretation of the four descriptive measures required in your analysis 1 arithmetic mean 2 variance 3 standard deviation and 4 coefficient of for example how are these measures related to each other in order to develop this discussion you may want to chapters 2 and 3 of your textbook this topic is an important part of your report can be easily interpreted i m guessing the mean is simply just the observed and then projected stock price for future models the standard deviation determines the interval in which the stock price fluctuates so you have like a curve and then on this curve theirs a bunch of normal distributions modeling the variance of the price plotted against the month   also the coefficient of variation is just so just read up on that and relate it to the meaning of it to the numbers you have   actually my stats are pretty rusty so make sure you really check into these things   but otherwise the formulas for part 4 is simple too you can compare means of a certain month using certain equations but there are different ones for certain situations   you can test for significance by comparing the differences of the means and if its outside of your alpha level then it probably means your company is significantly different from the sp index take mu of sp mu of   you can also find more info on interpreting the two different coefficients your given if you look up comparing means of linear regression models or something

i note that each response to me includes a personal insult   you might want to ask yourself why you feel the need to be rude   if you 're sure you 're right why not simply explain yourself to me   gt you 're advocating an incompetent business with an inefficient model to continue running just to keep people employed    i said nothing of the sort   in fact i pointed out that these businesses must die   i am simply deeply sad that these thousands of people must   any compassionate person would feel the same way   the fact that i 'm being downvoted at a huge rate indicates how few such people are    gt you 're further assuming that they 'll stay unemployed and no other more efficient firm will capitalize on the niche that opened up with sears passing   assume   current labor statistics tell us that these people should be expecting at least a year of unemployment   and things are particularly bad in the retail sector   and it 's not like there 's any mystery on who the more efficient firm is it 's amazon and to a lesser extent other online retailers   but more efficient actually means employs only a fraction of the number of workers of standard retailers   be honest do you expect most of these people to get a new job as good as their old mediocre job within a year

over time you 'll have more loans maybe a few store cards mortgage car loan etc   i 'm a fan of maximizing one 's wealth and the small rebate reward adds up over time so i 'm not against the store cards so long as you always pay the bill in full   as far as fico is concerned what they like to see may not necessarily be optimum for you i 'd suggest you go about your business and over time use the few cards that combine to give to the best benefit combination that works for you

the other answers assumed student loan debt and for that it 's rarely worth it unless your company only offers managed plans w/ really bad returns or the economy recovers to the point where banks are paying 5 again on money market accounts but if it 's high rate debt such as carrying a credit card debt and the current rate of returns on the 401k are n't that great at the time it would be worth doing the calculations to see if it 's better to pay them down instead if you 're carrying extremely high interest debt such as payday loans or similar it 's almost always going to be worth paying down that debt as quickly as possible even if it means forgoing matching 401k payments the other possible reason for not taking the matching funds are if the required contributions would put you in a significant bind if you 're barely scraping by and you ca n't squeeze enough savings out of your budget that you 'd risk default on a loan eg car or house or might take penalties for late fees on your utilities it might be preferable to save up for a bit before starting the contributions especially if you 've maxed your available credit so you ca n't just push stuff to credit cards as a last resort

i am actually partial to the idea of negative taxation systems here in australia we have the work for the dole program which is essentially what the author describes but it is inefficient and it would be far more efficient to dramatically reduce the minimum wage and introduce a negative tax rate or rather bracket the tax rate such that it enters negative territory at some point this way employers can afford to employ more staff and people would still be compensated through the tax system and end up reasonably well off so long as the compensation is fair i do n't see how this is not preferable to a tax and transfer system where the government taxes with one hand and gives with the other

short answer no there is no financial benefits for you to expect in a local currency even if some might give tiny discounts on local sales local currencies are attractive for small business or communities they are perfectly legal and starting to be popular in a lot of places local currencies encourage individuals and businesses to exchange goods and services locally   using them is like investing in your community it could give you the feeling of doing something good for your community check this article for a discussion on the subject   they should not be considered investments local currencies do not offer the same financial security and some could be like monopoly money but that would be another subject or question to debate   so to summarize no money to be made for your personal use but some real social and financial benefits for your community that be a kind of personal benefit for you

what the other 's said is right you build credit by paying over time keeping your balance under the halfway mark of your limit and paying it down over the course of a fair amount of periods yields the best results so if you have a limit of $ 1500 then charge a $ 600 credit and pay $ 100 + interest over 6 months best yet are loans with fix installments this behavior tells the credit agencies you are responsible and you pay your debts in their eyes you are a low risk high roi statistically speaking

the most fundamental observation of bond pricing is this bond price is inversely proportional to bond yields   when bond yields rise the price of the bond falls   when bond yields fall the price of the bond rises   higher rates are bad for bonds if a selloff occurs in the russian government bond space i.e. prices are going down the yield on that bond is going to increase as a consequence

of course best is a subjective term however relying on the resources of the larger institutions by pooling with them will definitely reduce your own burden with regards to the research and keeping track so yes investing in mutual funds and etfs is a very sound strategy it would be better to diversify and not to invest all your money in one fund or in one industry area that said there are more than enough individuals who do their own research and stock picking and invest with various degrees of success in individual securities some also more advanced strategies such as leveraging options futures margins etc these advance strategies come at a greater risk but may bring a greater rewards as well so the answer to the question in the subject line is yes for all the rest there 's no one right or wrong answer it depends greatly on your abilities time risk tolerance cash available to invest etc etc

it reminds me of the efficient market hypothesis except that just states in its weakest form that the current market price accounts for all information embedded in previous market prices in other words people buying today at 42 know it was selling for 40 yesterday and the patterns and such to say that stock is memoryless strikes me as not quite right to the extent that stocks are valued based on earnings much of what we infer about future earnings relies on past and present earnings one obvious counterexample to this memoryless claim is bankruptcy if a stock files bankruptcy and there is n't enough money to pay senior debt your shares are worth 0 in perpetuity

repurchase agreements are a way of financing a security position you have a collateralized loan where you give your security in exchange for cash let 's say you have a 10 year treasury note paying 3.5 while the repurchase rate is 0.5 you loan the security to someone with a promise to repurchase it from them some time in the future you   collect the 3.5 coupon and you pay the 0.5 interest clearly it makes no sense for someone to collect interest on money and also collect coupon payments and for the counter party it makes no sense to be not getting coupon payments and also to be paying interest this how one website explains the process during the transaction any coupon payments that come due belong to    the legal owner the borrower however when this happens a cash    amount equal to the coupon is paid to the original owner this is    called manufactured payment in order to avoid the tax payment on    the coupon some institutions will repo the security to a tax exempt    entity and receive the manufactured payment and avoid the tax coupon    washing i find this description to be the clearest during the life of the transaction the market risk and the credit risk    of the collateral remain with the seller because he has agreed to    repurchase the asset for an agreed sum of money at maturity provided    the trade is correctly documented if the collateral has a coupon    payment during the life of the repo the buyer is obliged to pay this    to the seller

gt thank you for the wealth of information   sure i hope my opinions are food for thought   gt 1 does that basically translate to less tax on poor wealthy to promote entrepreneurship   no your typical entrepreneur is a smart disgruntled employee who thinks they have a better way to do a job   if you want more entrepreneurs you should do things to help them succeed in a new company and minimize the risk   some ways to do this   create a government agency that offers programs that help new companies   guidance and funding are obvious candidates   advertising for small local business would help too   one of the most important would be getting talent together because a start up needs the talents of at least four different people to have a good chance of succeeding   establish guaranteed health care   a with a wife and kids may have a great idea but ca n't risk to leave his family with no health insurance for the two years it would take to get his idea off the ground   better enforce anti trust law   i believe small companies are stifled by big companies because the latter control too much of the market   if you want competitive markets you need to either break up or and monitor the big players   create a better safety net   it is a lot easier to go on your own if you know at least you wo n't starve   gt 2 rich using money to grow their own wealth but would n't that mean as a byproduct jobs will be made   in theory yes but i believe in practice the opposite happens   big companies can make significantly more money hoarding their market share rather than branching into new markets   here 's a true story of my last company with names changed   company a makes widgets   company b makes bookkeeping software for tracking widgets and is very successful controlling a majority of the market   company a buys company b at an inflated price   the government allows the sale on the condition that company a does not use company b 's information on the widget market to gain an unfair advantage   company a agrees and the buyout takes place   company a then approaches all of company b 's customers and says let us look at the data on your bookkeeping software and we will give you a 5 discount   most customers agree so company a now has all the data controlled by company b but this is not illegal because they got it from company b 's customers not company b.   company a proceeds to undercut the market because it now knows exactly how much their competitors widgets sell for   company a now controls a majority of the widget market and their market share continues to grow rapidly   by the way here is that bloomberg article i described earlier about repatriation being about articles/2017 05 of tax repatriation is better than the reality   gt;&gt   take home money is used for investment it is n't   gt 3 i do n't think i understand this one at all will you rephrase it for me   the argument is that we need to tax corporations less so they can invest more   here 's the problem investments are not taxed   a corporation 's tax is a percentage of their gross income minus their expenses   investment is an expense   therefore the more they invest the lower their tax bill   if you want companies to invest more raise their tax rate   gt 4 i did hear from my professor and the educational videos he had shown us that the capital tax is one of the highest among the other oecd nations   i need to walk back what i said earlier   the us corporate tax rate is one of the highest   does that mean us corporations pay the most tax   well it 's check does the u s have the highest corporate tax rate in the world   gt why ca n't we just close loop holes instead of choosing to slash capital tax   note that those go in opposite directions   closing loopholes would make companies pay more   slashing capital tax would have them pay less   perhaps doing both would be revenue neutral   i would be in support of that because i suspect loopholes benefit big companies a lot more than small ones because they have the resources to find and exploit those loopholes   that said people in power have been talking for 20 years about closing the loopholes   they never do   gray has an excellent video explaining why these loopholes are not going anywhere anytime watch?v =   gt 5 i think it 's in each company 's best interest to further their own agenda and that agenda usually means bad for the majority   yes that 's a much better way of saying what i meant   gt thank you in advance for your time   sure thanks for thinking asking questions and making up your own mind

on contrary of what mike scott suggested i think in case of euro doom it 's a lot safer if your savings were changed into another currency in advance beware that bringing your money into an euro core country like finland austria germany it 's useful if you think those banks are safer but totally useless to avoid the conversion of your saving from euro into your national currency in case of euro crash only the central bank will decide what happens to all the euro deposited wherever single banks even if they are deutsche bank or bnp or ing can not decide what to do on their own ecb european central bank might decide to convert euro into local currencies based on the account 's owner nationality therefor if you are greek and you moved your saving in a german bank the ecb might decide that your euro are converted into new even if they sit in a german bank account the thing is that if you ask to a finland bank in case of euro crash would you convert my euro into new they sure would answer no we ca n't which is true they can not because it 's only the ecb europe central bank the one that decides how an ordered euro crash has to be and the ecb might decide as i explained you above other central banks swiss fed etc would only follow the decisions of the ecb moreover in case of euro doom it 's highly probable that the euro currency looses a tremendous value compared to other currencies the loss would be huge in case the euro crash happens in a way i.e. a strong country like germany and their banks decides to get out and they start printing their own money w/o listening to the ecb anymore so even if your saving are in euro in germany they would loose so much value compared to other currencies that you will forever not to have converted them into another currency when you had the time to do it couple of advises 1 if you want to change you savings into another currency you do n't need to bring them into another bank country like us you could simply buy us shares bonds at your local bank shares bonds of a us company us gov will always be worth their value in dollars no matter in what new pathetic currency your account will be converted 2 but is there a drawback in converting my saving into another currency i.e. buying dollars in the form of us treasury bonds unfortunately yes the drawback is that in case this euro drama comes finally to an happy ending and germans decide to open their wallets for the time to save the currency the euro might suddenly increase its value compared to other currencies therefor if you changed your saving into another currency you might loose money i.e. us dollars looses value against the euro

it is not right to force people to buy any product or service period do you see how wrong this is i 'd wager that you and i both agree that getting health insurance is a responsible thing to do ok good but i do not agree that anyone should be forced to buy anything this is tyranny   regardless of what is responsible or not the government or anyone else for that matter has no right to force you to buy anything just for the simple fact that you breathe air obama signed into law a tax on all living people with the signing of obamacare so because you 're alive you are slapped with a tax until the day you die it 's a complete this mandate is just one of the terrible things about obamacare imagine what we could be forced to buy next the federal government forcing us to go to college or perhaps the federal government forcing all employers to employ no less than 20 people or maybe they want everyone to buy cable mandating that anyone buy anything is not right in the least and there is much more wrong with obamacare than just the mandate and these other points i made   forcing insurance companies to cover pre existing pe conditions without being able to charge more is another blow to our liberty and freedom when the government mandates that insurance companies must cover pre existing conditions and must do so without charging more you leave the door open for consumers to abuse this system obama effectively gave people the option to get insurance after they get sick without consequence of higher prices that is by definition not insurance and then when that person is no longer sick they can hop off their plan do you understand the economic effect of this this is the reason why insurance premiums are skyrocketing when someone hops on with a pe condition and then hops off during open enrollment that person is paying $ 100 for $ 1,000 worth of medical care my numbers of fictitious but the concept remains the same imagine if you had a business where customers paid a monthly fee of $ 50 so that at any time they may withdraw $ 1,200 when they needed it well the federal government decides to pass a law that says you can not deny people that do n't have a monthly subscription and need immediate financing and now people can come in and give you $ 100 and in return you give them $ 1,000 your business would be an epic fail except you did two things to combat this new law 1 you raised your customers monthly subscriptions from $ 50 to $ 75 and 2 you now require that monthly customers pay a $ 25 deductible before they are allowed to have their $ 1,200 as a business person these changes were necessary because you were not allowed to deny walk in customers that were exchanging their $ 100 for your $ 1,000 this is how obamacare is affecting the insurance market insurance companies have to find a way to not lose money raising premiums and deductibles for paying customers is the only way to do it   in a perfect world everyone buys health insurance before they are sick and despite the fact that we do n't live in a perfect world there were still ways to get health insurance and i 'm talking pre obamacare if you did n't have it before getting sick you could have gotten a job that offered medical coverage in a group insurance plan these plans always covered pe conditions these plans are still required to cover pe conditions   i am not a bad person i 'm not greedy either i believe in social support system for those that truly need it sometimes people are born into bad situations or sometimes people can slip up and hit some bad luck i am more than fine with helping those people out but when the government puts their hands too deep into my pockets it is n't just money they are grabbing i spend over 40 hours a week at a job that job is where i obviously make my money time is money and so when the government is constantly creating new welfare programs the government is taking time from my life this is time that i want to spend with my friends wife mother father sister and daughter time is limited for everyone and i want my time outside of my 40 hours at work that is my right that is all of our rights   you know even the crazy socialist bernie sanders says that those people that work 40 hours a week deserve to make a living wage well if companies were n't regulated so much we 'd sure as hell have more money in our pockets less government regulations means more competition more availability more choices and better prices look at the grocery store industry i do n't know the proper industry term we have shop rite acme whole foods publix wegmans 's costco traders joe 's and so many more look at how stocked our supermarket shelves are all the time the only shortages that ever happen are when forecasts call for and all the ice melt is gone other than that shelves are stocked food is fresh and prices are excellent and you do n't have just one brand of sliced bread or a single brand of peanut butter or regular butter or lettuce or soup meats on and on and on you have many brands for many products we have 13 different kinds of milk in our grocery stores milk soy milk whole milk 1 2 organic milk organic 1 the government did n't do any of this people did smart hard working people did this there is a market of consumers that want that stuff and people made business to supply the demand this is how things work this is why we are the greatest country on this planet in the history of this world   running water in your home central air life saving surgery drugs and physical therapy being able to turn on

forms 1099 and w2 are mutually exclusive employers file both not the employees 1099 is filed for contractors w2 is filed for employees these terms are defined in the tax code and you may very well be employee even though your employer pays you as a contractor and issues 1099 you may complain to the irs if this is the case and have them explain the difference to the employer at the employer 's expense through fines and penalties employers usually do this to avoid providing benefits and by the way also avoid paying payroll taxes if you 're working as a contractor lets check your follow up questions where do i pay my taxes on my hourly that means does the irs have a    payment center for the tax i pay if you 're an independent contractor 1099 you 're supposed to pay your own taxes on a quarterly basis using the form 1040-es check this page for more information on your quarterly payments and follow the links if you 're a salaried employee elsewhere i.e. receive w2 from a different employer then instead of doing the quarterly estimates you can adjust your salary withholding at that other place of work to cover for your additional income to do that you submit an updated form w4 there check with the payroll department on details is this a hobby tax no such thing hobby income is taxed as ordinary income the difference is that hobby can not be at loss while regular business activity can if you 're a contractor it is likely that you 're not working at loss so it is irrelevant what tax do i pay the city does this require a sole proprietor    license this really depends on your local laws and the type of work you 're doing and where you 're doing it most likely if you 're working from your employer 's office you do n't need any business license from the city unless you have to be licensed to do the job if you 're working from home you might need a license check with the local government these are very general answers to very general questions you should seek a proper advice from a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state for your specific case

for the clearing house only the routing number and the check amount which gets encoded before its presented to clearing is important the check numbers were put in as a fraud prevention mechanism to ensure that one check was only presented once and that it was issued to a particular account typically issued in sequence    so as your account is new the bank may have a mechanism to verify the checks maybe based on amount and other info if your volume of check issuing increases they may start putting in a check number to better track

my thoughts are that if you 've seen considerable growth and the profit amassed would be one that makes sense you would have to seriously consider selling now because it could take 's time to mimic that profit in the next 10 quarters or so   to if you bought a house for 100k and we 're renting it for say 1,000/month and we 're making $ profit and could sell it now for 125k it would take you 100 months to recoup that $ 25k profit or 8 years 4 months does n't it make sense to sell now you would have that profit now and could invest it somewhere else without losing that period of time and time is the emphasis here

if you 're losing money or breaking even you own a bad investment   the problem you have is that you are emotionally invested in your tenant that is n't a bad thing in general but it 's costing you money and unless interest rates fall enough to justify a refi or property taxes go down in your area that 's kind of unlikely to change   option 1 tell your wife that you are willing to accept a loss up to a certain level because of your long term relationship with your tenant in a perfect world the two of you would then discuss what the magic number would be where you got out and come to a compromise for example if you are comfortable losing up to $ 3,000 per year and she is unhappy with any loss you may agree on selling the house when your losses climb to $ 1,500 in a less perfect world it would cause an argument as she has already told you what she wants you to do   option 2 raise the rent to the break even point from what you 've said this will likely result in the loss of your tenant but you could then rent to someone else for significantly more   option 3 sell the house it 's an investment property which means it 's supposed to make money for you it can do that very quickly by way of a sale and then it 's no longer your problem option 4 sell the house to your tenant you bought it for $ 50,000 and it 's currently worth $ 150,000 roughly the problem you face is that property taxes have gone up and caused your mortgage to increase past your tenants ability to pay my guess is after 15 years your payoff is somewhere in the high $ 20 's to mid 30 's assuming you got a 30 year loan and have n't refinanced if you sell to her for say $ 75,000 or even up to $ 90,000 you will still make a profit wife is happy she will get a mortgage she can afford and be able to stay in the house you and the tenant are happy added bonus is that her property taxes would be lower assuming a different rate for investment property in your area i would discuss this at length with your wife as well before making such an offer   option 5 get a property management company as mentioned above they will keep a percentage but will remove your emotions from the equation altogether and turn the situation into a winner   i do n't know if your wife is right in saying you do n't have the stomach for this but i do think your heart is getting in the way in this particular situation i get the feeling that if your tenant was 25 years old and had only been renting from you since last october you would have no problem raising the rent to market levels at every renewal

this all happens at once and quickly not in order   so the hft floods the exchange with orders this is independent of anything they would be doing this no matter what simply in anticipation of finding someone who will want what they 're trying to buy    they then notice someone wants what they have a buy order for they at the same time cancel all orders that do n't fit this criteria at the same time they 're testing this guy to see what his price is so while they 're testing this guy they 're cancelling all orders that are above his strike price for that stock they let the right order go through for a lower price if they ca n't get a lower price they just forget it however they probably can because they were in line first they 're buying before this guy and after they know what he wants to pay     then they sell it to him

gold has value because for the most of the history of mankind 's use of money gold and silver have repeatedly been chosen by free markets as the best form of money gold is durable portable homogeneous fungible divisible rare and recognizable    until 1971 most of the world 's currencies were backed by gold   in 1971 the us government defaulted on its obligation to redeem us dollars by which most other currencies were backed in gold as agreed to by the bretton woods agreement of 1944   we did n't choose to go off the gold standard we had no choice foreign central banks were demanding in gold and the us did n't have enough we inflated too much    i think that the current swell of interest in gold is due to the recent massive increase in the federal reserve 's balance sheet plus the fast growing national debt plus a looming social security medicare crisis   people are looking for protection of their savings and they wish to opt out of the government bail outs government deficits government run health care and government money printing   they are looking for a currency that does n't have a counter party gold is money and nothing else jp morgan in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value if there were the government would have to make its holding illegal as was done in the case of gold if everyone decided for example to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods the financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves this is the shabby secret of the welfare statists against gold deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth gold stands in the way of this insidious process it stands as a protector of property rights if one this one has no difficulty in understanding the statists toward the gold standard alan greenspan
