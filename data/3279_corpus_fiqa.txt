as i see it with a debit card they    are taken kinda out of the game they    are not lending money it seems really    bad for them not exactly it is true that they 're not lending money but they charge a hefty commission from the retailers for each swipe which is pure profit with almost no risk one of the proposals considered or maybe approved already do n't know in congress is to cap that hefty commission which will really make the debit cards merely a service for the checking account holder rather than a profit maker for the bank on the other hand it 's    definitely good for individuals i disagree with that debit cards are easier to use than checks but they provide much less protection than credit cards here 's what i had to say on this a while ago and seems like the community agrees but why do we really need a credit    history to buy some of the more    expensive stuff because the system is broken it rewards people in debt by giving them more opportunities to get into even more debts while people who owe nothing to noone can not get a credit when they do need one with the current system the potential creditor can only asses the risk of someone who has debt already they have no way of assessing risks of someone with no debts to me all this credit card system    seems like an awfully nice way to make    loads of money backed by governments    as well well credit cards have nothing to do with it it 's the credit scores system that is broken if we replace the card with score in your question then yes you 're thinking correctly that of course is true for the us in other countries i have no knowledge on how the creditors assess the risks

credit cards are a golden goose for banks as they get to issue high interest loans and simultaneously generate alot of fee income debit cards are n't quite as good but they still generate substantial fee income ~2 of every credit non pin debit transaction goes to the bank and credit card network credit histories exist because they are the most effective tool available to predict whether you will pay back your loans or not you do n't need a credit history to buy most things you need a credit history to get a large loan think of it from perspective of a lender credit scoring is the bank 's way screening out people who are expensive to do business with it 's objective does n't discriminate on the basis of race sex or other factors and you have recourse if the rating agencies have incorrect information

you will be rolling over the proceeds since you can only deposit cash into an ira however this should probably not affect your considerations much since the pre rollover sale is non taxable within the 401k and the period of roll over itself when the cash is uninvested is relatively short so whatever investments you choose in your 401k you 'll just sell them and then buy them or similar investments back after the rollover to the ira if you 're worrying about a flash crash right on the day when you want to cash out that can definitely happen but it is not really something you can prepare for you can consider moving to money market several weeks before the potential date of your withdrawal if you think it will make you feel safer otherwise i do n't think it really matters

the points given by dumbcoder are very valid diversifying portfolio is always a good idea including metals is also a good idea investing in single metal though may not be a good idea    is pretty cheap now hopefully it will be for a while is undervalued compared to gold world reserve ratio is around 1 to 11 while price is around 1 to 60 both the above are iffy statements cheap is relative term there are quite a few metals more cheaper than silver copper for example undervalued does n't make sense its a of demand and supply today industrial use of silver is more widespread and its future what would happen if you are saying silver will appreciate more than other metals it again depends on country and time period there are times when even metals like copper have given more returns than silver and gold there is also platinum to consider in my opinion quite a bit of stuff is put in undervalued i.e. comparing reserve ratio to price in absolute is n't right comparing it over relative years is right what the ratio says is for every 11 of silver there is 1 gm of gold and the price of this 1 gm is 60 times more than silver true and nobody tell is the demand of silver 60 times more than gold or 11 times more than gold i.e. the consumption what is also not told is the cost to extract the 11 of silver is less than cost of 1 gm of gold so the cheapness you are thinking is   not 100 true

stock returns can not be evaluated on its own you need to take into account inflation and the return of other investment vehicles over the long run you want to earn more than your peers ie inflation or lose less than them stock lets you buy into the profits of a company managed by others so the fundamental question is do those company managers make better decision than average person of course there are times when they make awful decisions eg just before dotcom bubble and sometimes the best decision is to close the business but overall those people are much better educated have higher iq more etc and so over long time and across all the companies this is correct and hence the stock market premium

smallest risk of default would depend on where alice and bob live i suppose but lets assume they are in a lower yielding nation where default is not a big concern   remember for instance that greece was a lower yielding nation at one point and that the us has defaulted before let 's start with bob because he is easier to analyze   yield curves inversions generally pre date recessions which is generally not so good for bob as rates tend to drop during recessions and he will be at the short end of the curve so his bonds will be less sensitive   however he will generally get higher yields in good times to make up for this but these higher yields come with a price in that he is generally much more sensitive to yield changes and can get much larger swings in portfolio value first off as jb mentioned alice would likely own inflation linked il bonds   which behave fairly differently from bob 's bonds however to keep this simple lets say they live in a place without il bonds or il bonds are not a consideration   then generally alice has lower yielding bonds in good times but may do very well when the fed steps in during a crisis so who wins in the long run   likely who owns a mix of a broad index of stocks and bonds in a risk mix where she would n't have to sell in downturns   especially as would n't have to pay the trading costs of moving her whole portfolio between long and short bonds   between bob and alice however bob would likely win in the long run as the markets generally reward risk taking in the long run   still inflation even without the il bonds and general rate trends long term rates are historically low right now could have bob losing for long periods

imo the right path usually depends on how long you depend on staying in the home and how much you put down the idea behind paying the higher rate is that you can easily recoup $ 0.25 35 on the dollar in taxes if you go with the higher rate at least for the first few years but that benefit becomes less valuable over time as you pay more interest in the beginning of the loan it 's a good deal in many cases as the trend over the last few years is to put 5 or less down and most people stay in homes for around 7 years in your case you are putting down a substantial down payment and with only 4 years to 80 ltv or less if the market improves taking the lower rate with pmi makes more sense

you should be worried you have made the mistake of entering an investment on the recommendation of family friend the last think you should do is make another mistake of just leaving it and hoping it will go up again your stock has dropped from its high of $ that means it has to go up over 60 just to reach the high of $ you are correct this may never happen or if it does it could take a long long time to get up to its previous highs what is the company doing to turn its fortunes around take a look at some other examples airways   this stock reached a high of around $ 6 in late 2007 after a nice uptrend over a year and a half it then dropped drastically at the start of the gfc and has since kept falling and is now priced at just $ 1.15 reported its first ever loss earlier this year but its problems were evident much earlier aapl apple inc.   aapl reach a high of just over $ 700 in september 2013 then dropped to around $ 400 and has recovered a bit to about $ 525 still 25 below its highs and looks to be at the start of another downtrend how long will it take aapl to get back to $ 700 more than 33 from its current price ten network holdings limited   ten reached a high of $ in late 2004 after a nice uptrend during 2004 it then started a steep journey downwards and is still going down it is now priced at just $ 0.25 a whopping 94 below its high it will have to increase by 1600 just to reach its high of $ which i think will never happen can a stock come back from a drastic downtrend yes it can it does n't always happen but a company can turn around and can reach and even surpass it previous highs the question is how and when will this happen how long will you keep your capital tied up in a stock that is going nowhere and has every chance of going further down the most important thing with any investment is to protect your current capital if you lose all your capital you can not make any new investments until you build up more capital that is why it is so important to have a risk management strategy and decide what is your get out point if things go against you before you get into any new investment have a stop loss i would get out of your investment before you lose more capital if you had set a stop loss at 20 off the stock 's last highs you would have gotten out at about $ 28 higher than the current share price of $ if you do further analysis on this company and find that it is improving its prospects and the stock price breaks up through its current ranging band then you can always buy back in however do you still want to be in the stock if it breaks the range band on the downside in this case who knows how low it can continue to go this is my opinion as others would have theirs and what i would do in your current situation with this stock

hi u   short answer yes you do have to pay taxes in israel for all your   long answer all countries within the consider you as a fiscal resident in the country where you spend over half a year in 183 days and up if you do not spend that much time in any country there are other tying measures to avoid people not being fiscal residents in any country   since you are living in israel you will have to pay all your generated income in israel following the tax regulation that is in place there i am no tax lawyer so i can not help you there   having a lot of business internationally brings other headaches with it taking for example the u.s. there is a possibility that they taxes in their payments it is unlikely though as they have a tax treaty to prevent double taxation you can ask for this money to be returned from the u.s. or other countries through each country 's internal process   another thing to take into account is that you can be taxed in other countries for any revenue you generate in said country this is especially relevant for revenue that comes from real estate the country where the real estate is will tax you in the country and you will have to deduct these taxes paid in your country israel in this case if there is no tax treaty you might possibly be paying twice   i know you said you do promotion but i have to warn you about this because i ignore what other countries tax or do not tax so been giving more info wo n't hurt   if the us is the main and/or only country you will be doing business with i strongly recommend you real the tax treaty with lots of love and patience you can find it here or here   treaty amendment   if you are from israel and prefer it in here are the treaties in your language   treaty amendment    normally most irs departments have sections with very help on these sort of matters i 'd you to take a look at yours    last what i 've explained is the normal process that applies almost all over the world but each country has their own distinctions and you need to look carefully take what i said as a starting point and do your own research or ideally try to find a tax consultant lawyer who helps you   best of luck

over the last ten years you have the benefits of a good financial decision presumably your low mortgage has freed up money for other financial priorities there would be no harm in making a clean break by selling as is   on the other hand the resale value would probably be rather low considering the condition and the neighborhood i do n't want to assume too much here but if a potential buyer is interested in the house by virtue of not being able to afford a house in a better neighborhood or better condition their finances and credit history may make it difficult for them to be approved for a mortgage that would reduce the potential buyer pool and further reduce the sale price if you can pull more in rent than the mortgage you definitely have an opportunity to come ahead maybe window a c units and a repaired are enough if you 're renting your rental income would pay for that in less than a year even while paying your mortgage for you of course you do n't want to become a sleazy slumlord either

first to clear up your misconceptions the balance is not merely made up of deductible and non deductible contributions   there are also earnings implied in the balance i.e. the whole reason you invest in the first place is to realize some return on investment   that return a.k.a the earnings are included in the balance of the account   the balance is the sum total of everything in the account the bottom line generally speaking basis for an account is all of the money that has been contributed deposited to the account   in the context of an ira as described in the article however they are using basis to refer to only the non deductible contributions   of note however is that basis specifically excludes earnings   if you have deposited say $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next then your basis is $ 10,000 even if the balance has grown to say $ 12,000 which includes the earnings as may be evident by now earnings are not equivalent to deductible contributions   earnings may arise from such contributions but they are not the same   rather earnings are the net positive investment results from all contributions   again if you had contributed $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next and the balance has grown to $ 12,000 then the earnings portion is $ 2000 so to interpret what happened in the specific example provided over the years the account holder contributed deposited a total of $ 15,000 into his account   these must have been non deductible contributions in the case of the ira in order to arrive at basis of $ 15,000 over time and with the deposits that $ 15,000 grew to $ 24,000 i.e. earned $ 9,000 in earnings then the nearly 50 drop caused the balance to decay to $ 13,000   this means all $ 9,000 of his earnings were wiped out plus $ 2000 of the original basis the remaining $ 13,000 is all basis that is considered to be original money deposited to the account no earnings in effect the account has lost $ 2000 of basis because $ 15,000 was deposited and only $ 13,000 remains   simplistic way of looking at it   a $ 15,000 investment resulted in a final $ 13,000 sale i.e. a net loss of $ 2000 it does n't matter that it hit $ 24,000 in the meanwhile it could have hit $ 250,000 in value and then dropped to $ 13,000 and the net result would be the same a loss of $ 2000 in basis traditional ira earnings are always tax deferred i.e. whether earnings arise from deductible or else non deductible contributions when one takes a distribution withdraws from an ira and the distribution includes earnings the earnings portion is always taxable income   does n't matter if the earnings arose from one kind of contribution or the other i do n't think in this example there were any deductible contributions whatsoever does that make sense help

i 'm glad you did n't say they were the only causes of the bubble and i hope you did n't mean to   but i wo n't argue that those were not partially to blame   i also wo n't say i personally was not partially to blame   now i certainly do n't want to defend the banks at least not a lot of them but i disagree with some of your assertions for one thing they are getting blamed for making loans to readily available and now they are being blamed not by you for not making the money readily available     have you financed any homes   if so did you just go to a bank and get a loan   i 'm sure some people do that but i do n't know anyone who ever has   i go to a loan agent and get a much cheaper loan   and i think part of the problem is that many of these agents have only one overriding objective to enable you to qualify for a loan so they can get their commission   they know all the rules and reasons people get turned down so they play the system and get people loans who should not get them   i do n't really think the banks are as they allow this and in many cases know about it unofficially   but i do n't think it 's a conspiracy by the banks i think the banks were simply naive and thought that the past was a good indicator or the future so the loans were safe because they would get the house if the owner defaulted and the house would be worth at least the value of the equity the owner had after the down payment   lots of people made mistakes on both sides   you can call it a conspiracy if you want but i 've found that most conspiracy theories were simply not real     other than that i totally agree with you

this is a supplement to the additional answers    one way to generate passive income is by taking advantage of high interest checking saving accounts   if you need to have a sum of liquid cash readily available at all times you might as well earn the most interest you can while doing so   i 'm not on any bank 's payroll so a google search can yield a lot on this topic and help you decide what 's in your best interest pun intended      more amazingly some banks will reward you straight in cash for simply using their accounts barring some criteria   there 's one promotion i 've been taking advantage of which provides me $ flat irrespective of my account balance   again i am not on anyone 's payroll but a google search can be helpful here   i 'd call these passive as once you meet the promotion criteria you do n't need to do anything else but wait for your money    of course none of this will be enough to live off of but any extra amount with minimal to zero time investment seems to be a good deal    if people do want links for the claims i make i will put these up   i just do not want to advertise directly for any banks or companies

you got out in time great but how did you know when to get back in the internet is littered with threads by people who got out in advance or during then did n't get back in in time because the did n't feel real some people are still sitting out just hoping against hope the market crashes but it probably wo n't to those 2009 levels   i recommend looking at trinity wiki results as a place to start getting a sense of portfolio longevity when totally out of the market the reality is that all cash which is basically a zero duration bond is a dangerous position as is all stocks a balanced portfolio gives you diversification the only free lunch in investing   better to not try and time your way in and out of the market but rather glide within a range benjamin graham recommends no more less than if you want to skip the research headaches stick with a total bond or intermediate term bond fund or google around for lazy portfolios   the real key is not to let emotions drive your decisions it always feels different this time until it is n't much better to set a target portfolio of stocks bonds rule of thumb imagine you might lose half the stock portion in a downturn then ride it out that way you do n't have to worry about being at one extreme or the other

canadian here the us is our biggest customer so we were impacted economically i expected that within a year or two of the us housing collapse we would also be hit but something else happened when the us dropped interest rates like a stone we were also forced to drop interest rates this meant that suddenly money was being handed out for very very cheap so cheap it was almost free if you had a decent job and good credit the housing market here for a brief moment and then continued climbing it never stopped until some new rules were implemented aimed mostly at foreign buyers and investors and put in place this year it appears however that this current drop in prices may be a temporary dip the average cost of a home in toronto is still around $ 1 m cad and our real estate is still among the most expensive in the world if you look at how much we pay compared to our incomes   in some places houses have basically tripled over the past decade   my point here is that canadian home owners were not impacted negatively by the 2008 crisis in fact once the free money started flowing and prices went up accordingly canadian home owners were enriched as a direct result of the 2008 us housing crisis the situation is clearly unsustainable and the market is irrational it 's easy to say that we are in a bubble but it is   impossible to tell when it will crash in canada it 's harder to walk away from mortgage debt if you 're underwater on your home and the bank forecloses on you and sells the house for less than you owe you still owe the bank the remainder of the money in most provinces

the decision as to what counts as income is up to the bank you 'll need to ask them whether or not rental income can be included in the total i can offer some anecdotal evidence when i applied for a mortgage to buy my home i already had a rental property with a buy to let mortgage on it initially the bank regarded that property as a liability not an asset because it was mortgaged however once i was able to show that there was a good history of receiving enough rent they chose to ignore the property altogether i.e. it was n't regarded as a liability but it was n't regarded as a source of income either more generally as says residential mortgages are computed based on affordability which is more than just a multiple of your salary to answer your specific questions covered above it 's up to the bank if you 're married and you do n't have a written tenancy agreement and you 're not declaring the rent on your tax return then it seems unlikely that this would be regarded as income at all conversely if your partner is earning why not put their name on the mortgage application too buy to let mortgages are treated differently while it used to be the case that they were assessed on rental income only nowadays lenders may ask for proof of the landlord 's income from other sources note that a btl can not be used for a property you intend to live in and a residential mortgage can not be used for a property you intend to let to tenants at least not without the bank 's permission

whether or not you make money here depends on whether you are buying or selling the option when you open your position   you certainly would not make money in the scenario where you are buying options at the open   if fact you would end up loosing quite a lot of money you do not specify whether you are buying or selling the options so let 's assume that you are buying both the call and the put   we 'll look a profitable trade at the bottom of my answer buying an in the money call option with a strike price of $ 90 when the underlying asset price is $ 150 would cost you a small fraction over $ 6000 = 100 x $ 60 since the intrinsic value value of the option is $ 60   add to this cost any commission charged by your broker buying an out of the money put option with a strike price of $ 110 when the underlying asset price is $ 150 would cost you a small premium lets say a premium of something like $ 0.50   the option has no intrinsic value only time value and a volatility value so the exact cost would depend on the time to expiry and the implied volatility of the underlying asset since the strike price is well out of the money being about 27 below the underlying asset price the premium would be small   so assuming the premium of $ 0.50 you would pay $ 50 for the option plus any commission applicable the cash settlement on expiry with an underlying settlement price of $ 100 would be a premium of $ 10 for each of the two options so you would receive cash of 100 x $ 10 + $ 10 = $ 2000 less any commission applicable   however you have paid $ 6000 + $ 50 to purchase the options so you realise a net loss of $ $ 2000 = $ 4050 plus any commissions applicable thus you would make a profit on the put option but you would realise a very large loss on the call option on the other hand if you open your position by selling the call option and buying the put option then you would make money for the sale of the call option you would receive about $ 6000   for the purchase of the put option you would pay about $ 50 on settlement you would pay $ 1000 to buy back the call option and you would receive about $ 1000 when selling the put option thus you net profit would be about $ 6000 $ 1000 for the call position and $ 1000 $ 50 for the put position   the net profit would then total $ less an commissions payable

my instinct says that there should be no difference your instincts are right your understanding of math is not so much you sold $ 100 k at the current price of but ended up buying at you earned that 's 100 in usd 50 in rub you bought for the current price of $ 100 k but sold later for $ 200k. you earned $ 100 k 100 in usd which at that time was equal you earned that 's 50 in rub so as your instincts were saying no difference the reason percentages are different is because you 're coming from different angles for the first case your currency is rub for the second case your currency is usd and in both cases you earned 100 if you use the same currency for your calculations percentages change but the bottom line is the same

you will be charged a stock borrow fee which is inversely related to the relative supply of the stock you are shorting ib claims to pay a rebate on the short proceeds which would offset part or all of that fee but it does n't appear relevant in your case because it is a bit strange to me that ib would not require you to keep the cash in your account as they need the cash to the stock borrow with the lending institution   in fact per t the short position requires an initial margin of 150 which includes the short proceeds as described by investopedia in the first table of figure 1 a short sale is initiated for 1,000    shares at a price of $ 50 the proceeds of the short sale are $ 50,000    and this amount is deposited into the short sale margin account along    with the proceeds of the sale an additional 50 margin amount of    $ 25,000 must be deposited in the account bringing the total margin    requirement to $ 75,000 at this time the proceeds of the short sale    must remain in the account they can not be removed or used to purchase    other securities here is a good answer to your question from the street even though you might see a balance in your brokerage account after    shorting a stock you 're actually looking at a false credit according    to one big brokerage firm that money is acting as collateral for the    short position so you wo n't have use of these funds for investment    purposes and wo n't earn interest on it and there are indeed costs associated with shorting a stock the    broker has to find stock to loan to you that might come out of a    broker 's own inventory or might be borrowed from another stock lender

most companies are taken over one can reasonably guess that company x will be taken over for a price p at some future point in time then the company has a value today that is less than price p by a large enough margin so that the investor will likely make out when the company finally is taken over at some unknown point in time the exception is a company like microsoft or apple that basically grow too large to be taken over but then they eventually start paying dividends when they become mature again the trick during the non dividend paying period e.g. ten or fifteen years ago is to guess what dividends will be paid in some future time and price the stock low enough today so that it will be worthwhile for the buyer

it is going to save you more money in the long run to pay at once with cash if you take out a loan you will pay interest on the balance costing you money if you pay off the balance immediately there is no difference between the options and your question becomes irrelevant   there is no credit rating benefit to placing large purchases on your cards especially since your credit is fine my advice is to pay in cash in this case mostly because it makes you feel the purchase this is what you are describing in your question this instinct helps you recognize potential problems instead of masking them with debt questions like do i need this   am i myself financially with this purchase   am i holding enough cash on hand for emergencies you may be fine in these areas but i would still argue that cash makes you a better buyer because the expense feels much more significant making you more cautious and   you are right to feel these things before dropping a large sum of money let it inform you and help you make better decisions do n't mask it or be paralyzed by it

yield can be thought of as the interest rate you would receive from that investment in the form of a dividend for stocks or interest payments on a bond   the yield takes into account the anticipated amount to be received per share unit per year and the current price of the investment    of course the yield is not a guaranteed return like a savings account   if the investment yield is 4 when you buy it can drop in value such that you actually lose money during your hold period despite receiving income from the dividend or interest payments

i 'm in a similar situation first a 529 plan can be use for qualifying international schools   there are 336 for 2015 which includes many well known schools but also excludes many schools especially lower level or vocational schools and schools in non english speaking countries i ran 3 scenarios to see what the impact would be if you invested $ 3000 a year for 14 years in something tracking the s&p 500 index for each of these scenarios i considered 3 cases a state with 0 income tax a state with the median income tax rate of 6 for the 25 tax bracket and california with an income tax rate of for the 25 tax bracket california has an addition 2.5 penalty on unqualified distributions   additionally tax deductions taken on contributions that are part of unqualified distributions will be viewed as income and that portion of the distribution will be taxed as such at the state level vanguard 's 500 index portfolio has a 10 year average return of   vanguard 's s&p 500 index fund has a 10 year average return of before tax and after taxes on distributions use a 529 as intended use a 529 but do not use as intended invest in a s&p 500 index fund in a taxable account given similar investment options using a 529 fund for something other than education is much worse than having an investment in a mutual fund in a taxable account but there 's also a clear advantage to using a 529 if you know with certainty you can use it for qualified expenses   both the benefits for correct use of a 529 and the penalties for incorrect use increase with state tax rates i live in a state with no income tax so the taxable mutual fund option is closer to the middle between correct and incorrect use of a 529   i am leaning towards the investment in a taxable account

it all depends on the country   in the us mobility at the top is reasonably high ie first generation millionaires first generation billionaires etc       in other western countries mobility at the top is very poor   this is typically due to regulation and taxes that make it incredibly difficult for small businesses to be compliant and compete ie hire a bad employee as a small startup and it can cripple the business if you can not easily fire them      mobility at the bottom is reversed    getting out of abject poverty in the us is incredibly difficult almost impossible   in other western countries it is not easy but far easier than the us thanks to those social safety nets

you and your daughter need to consult a lawyer   generally the court decides how the family debts get split in a divorce and it sounds like the court decided that this student debt belongs solely to your daughter and not her husband   whether that was the correct decision or not depends on lots of details but of course your daughter did n't help herself at all by getting a cheap divorce and not having her own attorney   at this point you and your daughter should consult a good attorney show him or her the divorce decree and the loan paperwork and he or she should be able to tell you if anything can be done   as far as your own personal exposure to the debt as the cosigner that depends on the paperwork you signed and is another question for the attorney

you are assuming 100 occupancy and 100 rent collection   this is unrealistic   you could get lucky and find that long term tenant with great credit that always pays their bills but in reality that person usually buys a home they do not rent long term   so you will need to be prepared for periods of no renters and periods of non payment   the expenses here i would expect could wipe out more than you can make in profit based on your numbers have you checked to find out what the insurance on a rental property is   i am guessing it will go up probably 200 500 a year possibly more depending on coverage   you will need a different type of insurance for rental property have you checked with your mortgage provider to make sure that you can convert to a rental property    some mortgages mine is one restrict the use of the home from being a rental property   you may be required to refinance your home which could cost you more in addition if you are under water it will be hard to find a new financier willing to write that mortgage with anything like reasonable terms you are correct you would be taking on a new expense in rental   it is non deductible and the irs knows this well    as littleadv 's answer stated you can deduct some expenses from your rental property i am not sure that you will have a net wash or loss when you add those expenses   if you do then you have a problem since you have a business losing money   this does not even address the headaches that come with being a landlord by my quick calculations if you want to break even your rental property should be about this accounts for 80 occupancy and 80 rental payment   if you get better than that you should make a bit of a profit do nt worry i m sure the house will find a way to reclaim it

switzerland was once known for its high regard for private property rights   recently it is has started to violate those rights by forcing banks to turn over the names of account holders to the us government   not a great trend another aspect that makes switzerland an attractive place for people and businesses is the swiss 's neutral policy   the swiss government is not deploying the swiss military around the globe to fight terrorism to spread democracy to advance its own power or other such murderous government programs   the swiss people do not have to worry about the payback that arrives because of such government programs the swiss were traditionally extreme advocates of individual gun rights which allows the people to provide protection for themselves against others and against the government   this too is changing read section on the enemy within in a not so favorable direction i also the swiss franc was the last major currency to sever its tie to gold   the currency use to be highly desired due to its tie to gold   i think the currency is still highly regarded but the swiss central bank is participating in the currency war and has attempted multiple times in the past couple of years to its currency so it does not appreciate against the euro or dollar

you are making an assumption that may not be true to me some apartment debt i paid had already been sold to a collections agency before i actually paid it typically debts are sold to a debt buyer whereas a collection agency works on commission to collect debts on behalf of the creditor if your debt was actually sold you should have been notified in writing of this fact and who the new creditor was i suspect your debt was not sold because if it was the apartment complex would not have been legally allowed to cash your check when you finally paid them therefore it is most likely that the collection agency was working on commission and the apartment complex never informed them that you had settled your debt as for what to do about it here are 3 options ordered by likelihood of success good luck and if you do n't mind please update us later on what you did and what the result was your experience will be helpful for others having this issue in the future

we need a new kind of economy that is actually economic that saves rather than the one we have now that is largely based on waste   we need more jobs and higher wages so that everyone can work a little less hours and have the time to go back to doing a few things for themselves like gardening or even walking their own dog instead of paying someone to do it   we need to include the to grave costs of products into the price so that someone can get paid to take it apart and actually recycle it instead of land filling it and we need to build products better in the first place so that each item lasts longer before needing to be recycled   the last 2 3 decades we have been so focused on getting a lot of stuff as cheap as possible we need to reverse that and buy less individual items of a higher quality so that they last a while i am willing to spend more to buy a tv that will last 30 years like my parents tv did today 's flat screens seem to be doomed at 2 years   we also need to focus on rebuilding and repairing what we were given by our parents and grandparents the nations roads bridges pipelines water systems and landmark building all of these things need to be repaired before they are beyond hope   unfortunately none of these things are going to happen

gt asset prices are high and not matched by real world performance   see i know a lot of people are saying this but i 'm not entirely sure this is true even if some tech stocks are artificially boosting the market to crazy levels can you say it 's not warranted the potential for many are far beyond what we see today i do n't see the current tech stock boom being unable to fulfill like the 1990s boom and subsequent bust the infrastructure and logistics were n't there in 1999 they are now   beyond tech businesses are doing pretty well up and down earnings reports are looking good stocks are high but still somewhat based on real numbers same could be said for real estate the demand is real the prices are high but it 's based on demand   the danger is what we 're missing just like in 2008 chances are there is a fiction out there maybe the fiction is in these tech stocks maybe it is on mortgages again i 'm not seeing it there were people prior to 2008 sounding alarm bells about the real estate market i have n't seen the equivalent today in fact i 've seen more people trying to figure out how the heck the next correction will come and nobody really can answer it at this rate there might not be a built in cause and might come externally like trump going nuts and launching nukes or another terrorist attack

someone entering a casino with $ 15 could employ a very simple strategy and have a better chance of walking out with $ 16   unfortunately the person would have a non trivial chance about one in 14 of walking out with $ 0 if after losing $ 15 the person withdrew $ 240 from the bank and tried to win $ 16 the person would have a better chance of succeeding and ending up ahead holding the original $ 15 plus the additional $ 240 plus $ 1 but would have at that point about a one in 14 chance from that point of losing the $ 240 along with the original $ 15   measured from the starting point you 'd have about a 199 out of 200 chance of gaining $ 1 and a one out of 200 chance of losing $ 240 market timing bets are like that   you can arrange things so you have a significant chance of making a small profit but at the risk of a large downside   if you have n't firmly decided exactly how much downside you are willing to accept it 's very easy to simultaneously believe you do n't have much money at risk but that you 'll be able to win back anything you lose   the only way you can hope to win back anything you lose is by bringing a lot more money to the table which will of course greatly increase your downside risk the probability of making money for the person willing to accept $ 15 of downside risk to earn $ 1 is about 93   the probability of making money for the person willing to accept $ 255 worth of risk is about   it 's easy to see that there are ways of playing which have a chance of winning and that there are ways of playing that only have a downside risk   unfortunately the ways of playing that have the smaller risk do n't have anything near a 99.9 chance of winning and those that have a better chance of winning have a much larger downside risk

if you have a 20,000 balance and a 8.75 interest rate you should be paying between $ 145 and $ 150 in interest each month with the balance going to principal   and that times 20,000 is as interest is compounded daily it 'll be a little higher than that   if the minimum is below $ 145 then you are not covering the interest i suspect that is what is happening here and they 're reporting interest paid that was n't covered in a prior month assuming you have some months where you only pay the statement minimum which is less than the total accrued interest assuming you 're in the us or most other western countries your loan servicer should be explaining the exact amount each payment that goes to principal and interest   i recommend calling them up and finding out exactly why it 's not consistent what should be happening assuming you pay more than the amount of interest each month is the interest should go down very slowly each month and the amount paying off principal should go up also slowly   eg etc until eventually the interest is zero and your loan is paid off   it probably wo n't go this quickly for this size of loan you 're only paying off a tiny percentage of principal each month $ or so you wo n't make too much headway at this rate    even adding another $ 25 would make a huge difference to the length of the loan and the amount of interest paid but that 's another story    you will eventually at this rate pay off the loan at $ 200 a month for all 12 months this is n't dissimilar to a 30 year mortgage in terms of percent interest to principal in fact it 's better   $ 50 a month times twelve is $ 600 400 payments would take care of it so a bit over 30 years   however as you go you pay more principal and less interest so you will actually pay it off in 15 years if you continue paying $ 200 a month exactly what you may be seeing in your case is a combination of things in months you pay less ie $ 100 say the extra $ 45 in interest needs to go somewhere   it effectively becomes part of the principal but from what i 've seen that does n't always happen directly ie they account it differently at least for a short time up to a year in my experience this is because of tax laws if i understand correctly the amount you pay in interest is tax deductible but not the amount of the principal so it 's important for you to have as much called interest as possible   thus if you pay $ 100 this month and $ 200 next month that total of $ 300 is paying of interest and $ 10 of principal just as if you 'd paid it $ 150 each month if you had any penalties such as for late payments those come out off the top before interest they may sometimes take that out as well all in all i strongly suggest having an enforced minimum on your end of the interest amount at least that prevents you from being in a situation where your loan grows   if you ca n't always hit $ 200 that 's fine but at least hit $ 150 every single month   otherwise you have a never ending cycle of student loan debt that you really do n't want to be in separately on the $ 1000 payment as long as you make sure it 's not assigned in such a way that the lender only accepts a month 's worth at a time which should n't happen but there are shady lenders it should n't matter what is called principal and what is called interest   the interest wo n't go up just because you 're making a separate payment it 'll go down   the portion that goes to interest will go to paying off the amount of interest you owe from the time of your last payment plus any accrued but unpaid interest plus principal   you wo n't have the option of not paying that interest and it does n't really matter anyway it 's all something you owe and all accruing interest it only really matters for accounting and taxes   double check with your lender on the phone and on their website if possible that overpayments are not penalized and are applied to principal immediately or within a few days anyway and you should be fine

before investing absolutely follow the advice in mbhunter 's answer there is no safe investment unless you count your mattress and even there you could find or simple inflation taking a chunk out of your change   there is only maximizing your reward for a given level of risk and there is always risk this question should be somewhere on the q&a site for its comprehensive list of sources for information on asset allocation   the tag is also going to have tons of good information for you to answer your question on what slice of the pie is devoted to what you can check out some common portfolios given by u. s. experts for u. s. investors these should be convertible into australian funds another portfolio that is like all those above loosely based on modern portfolio theory for maximizing reward for a given level of risk is the gone portfolio a common denominator amongst these portfolios is that they emphasize index funds over mutual funds for their long term performance and preference lazy management yearly rebalancing is a common suggestion as the maximum level of involvement over active management   you can see more lazy portfolios

most financial advisors are actually financial product salesmen   their job is to sweet talk you into parting with as much money as possible either in management fees or in commissions kickbacks on high fee investment products which come from fees charged to you inside the investment   this is a cutthroat business for the salesmen themselves   realistically that is how they feed their family and i empathize but i ca n't afford to buy their product   i wish they would sell something else these people prey on people 's financial lack of knowledge   for instance you put too much importance on returns   why   because the salesman told you that 's important   it 's not   the market goes up and down that 's normal   the question is how much of your investment is being consumed by fees   how do you tell that and generally if you 're invested well   you compare your money 's performance to an index that 's relevant to you   you 've heard of   the s&p 500 that 's an index relevant to us investors   take 2015 the s&p 500 was $ on january 2 2015   it was $ on december 31 2015   so it was flat   it dropped 0.7 if your us investments dropped 0.7 you broke even   if you made less that was lost to the expenses within the investment or the investment performing worse than the s&p 500 index   i lost 0.8 in 2015 the extra 0.1 being expenses of the investment try 2013 s&p 500 was $ on december 28 2012 and $ on dec. 27 2013 that 's growth   that 's amazing but it also means is holding even with the market   if your salesman proudly announced that you made 18 problem all this to say when you say the investments performed poorly do n't go by absolute numbers find a suitable index and compare to the index   a lot of markets were down in 2015 16 and that is not your investment 's fault   you want to know if were down compared to your index    because that reflects either a lousy funds manager or high fees    this may leave you wondering where can i invest that is safe and has sensible fees   i do n't know your market but here we have discount brokers which allow self selection of investments charge no custodial fees and simply charge by the trade commonly $ 10   many mutual funds and etfs are index funds with very low annual fees 0.20 1 in 500 or even less     how do you pick investments look at any of numerous books starting with john bogle 's classic common sense on mutual funds book which is the seminal work on the value of keeping fees low   if you need the cool confident professional to hand hold you through the process a fee only advisor is a true financial advisor who actually acts in your best interest   they honestly recommend what 's best for you but beware many commission driven salespeople pretend to be fee only advisors   the good advisor will be happy to advise investment types and let you pick the brand fidelity vs vanguard and buy it in your own discount brokerage account with a password you do n't share frankly finance is not that hard   but it 's made hard by impossibly complex products that do n't need to exist and are designed to confuse people to conceal hidden fees   avoid those products   you just do n't need them   now you really need to take a harder look at what this investment is like i say they make these things unnecessarily complex specifically to make them confusing and i am confused   although it does n't seem like much of a question to me   1.5 a quarter is 6 a year or 60 in 10 years to ignore compounding if the market grows 6 a year on average so growth just pays the fees they will consume 60 of the $ 220,000 or $   as far as the $ 60,000 for that kind of money it 's definitely worth talking to a good lawyer because it sounds like they misrepresented something to get your friend to sign up in the first place   put some legal pressure on them that $ 60k penalty might get a lot smaller    for instance they 'll recommend which has a 5.25 buy in fee front end load and a 1.23 per year fee expense ratio compare to with zero load and a 0.20 fee   that front end load is kicked back to your broker as commission so he literally ca n't recommend there 's no commission his company would and should fire him for doing so

here 's a good link that can answer your question how to take delivery of a futures contract the relevant part states prior to delivery day they inform customers who have open long positions that they must either close out the position or prepare to take delivery and pay the full value of the underlying contract by the same token traders with short positions are informed that they must close out their trades or prepare to deliver the underlying commodity in this case they must have the required quantity and quality of the deliverable commodity on hand    on the few occasions that a buyer accepts delivery against his futures contract he is usually not given the underlying commodity itself except in the case of financials but rather a receipt entitling him to fetch the wheat or corn from warehouses or distribution points i hope this helps good luck

i had a similar situation when i was in college the difference was that the dealer agreed to finance and the bank they used wanted a higher interest rate from me because of my limited credit history the dealer asked for a rate 5 percentage points higher than what they put on the paperwork i told them that i would not pay that and i dropped the car off at the lot with a letter the sale they were n't happy about that and eventually offered me financing at my original rate with a $ 1000 discount from the previously agreed upon purchase price what i learned through that experience is that i did n't do a good enough job of negotiating the original price i would suggest that your son stop answering phone calls from the dealership for at least 1 week and drive the car as much as possible in that time if the dealer has cashed the check then that will be the end of it he owes nothing further if the dealer has not cashed the check he should ask whether they prefer to keep the check or if they want the car with 1000 miles on the odometer this only works if your son keeps his nerve and is willing to walk away from the car

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

it means that supply of labor is greater than demand therefore wages are suppressed as people compete over the few jobs available   the unemployment rate is misleading because people drop off the statistic even though in a functional sense they 're still looking for work   many of the open positions available are n't in immediate need of filling a lot of job ads have laundry lists of nice to have qualities and skills that most experienced people do n't have    from the employer 's perspective they 'd rather hold out for the dream candidate and make existing employees work more unpaid overtime than take a risk hiring someone who does n't meet their dreams

i would have to disagree with the other responders in technical analysis of stock charts various short and long term moving averages are used to give an indication of the trend of the stock in the short and long term as compared to the current price i would prefer to use the term moving average ma rather than average as the ma is recalculated every day or at appropriate frequencies for your data on the period you are using i would also expand on the term moving average there are two that are commonly used going back to the question of the value of this number for example if the current price is above the 200 day and also above the 30 day then the stock is broadly trending upwards conversely if current price is below the 200 day and also below the 30 day then the stock is broadly trending downwards these numbers are chosen on the basis of the market you are trading in the volatility and other factors for another example of how a number of moving averages are used together please have a read of 's multiple moving average though this does not use moving averages as large as 200 days

i hope you 're not blaming the banks for the housing price inflation   it 's called supply and demand and is mostly caused by people possibly like you who have unreasonable expectations about the future value of real estate and thought it would keep rising unrealistically forever   the bank 's crime was to lend money recklessly to people who could not really afford it   the buyer 's crime was to buy a home they could not afford with the expectations that it would go up in price and they could either flip it or refinance   the real criminals might be the real estate agents who convinced the buyers they could afford it and helped them find an avenue to get the money   there were are a lot of unscrupulous or simply bad real estate agents out there but they too were naive enough to think houses would continue to rise   tl;dr   we are all to blame   calling owners slumlords and blaming them and the banks for your misfortune will only hurt you and make you forever the victim

here 's the detailed section of irs pub 590 it looks like you intended to have a trustee to trustee conversion but the receiving trustee dropped their ball   the bad news is a rollover contribution needed to be done in 60 days of the distribution   there is good news you can request an extension from the irs with one of the reasons if there was an error by one of the financial institutions involved other waivers    if you do not qualify for an automatic waiver you can apply to the irs for a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement to apply for a waiver you must submit a request for a letter ruling under the appropriate irs revenue procedure this revenue procedure is generally published in the first internal revenue bulletin of the year you must also pay a user fee with the application the information is in revenue procedure 2016 8 in internal revenue bulletin 2016 1 available at     in determining whether to grant a waiver the irs will consider all relevant facts and circumstances including whether errors were made by the financial institution other than       those described under automatic waiver earlier whether you were unable to complete the rollover due to death disability incarceration restrictions imposed by a       foreign country or postal error whether you used the amount distributed for example in the case of payment by check whether you cashed the check and how much time has passed since the date of distribution you can also see if you can get etrade to recharacterize the equity position to your desired target ira   the positive here is that the allowed decision window for calendar year 2016 rollovers is october 15 2017 the negatives are this is irrevocable and restricts certain distributions from the target for a year unlikely to impact your situation but you know trust but verify anonymous internet advice and it requires etrade to recognize the original transaction was a rollover to a roth ira which they currently do n't   but if their system lets them put it through you could end up with the amount in a traditional ira with no other taxable events to report which appears to be your goal    recharacterization faq

which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover emergency funds are for emergencies which to me means expenses that are unanticipated and ca n't be covered out of normal cash flow   oil changes are not an emergency and should be part of your normal budget   car house repairs and doctor visits might be an emergency depending on the severity and the urgency e.g. do i need to fix this now or can i save up and fix it for known predictable expenses that are infrequent christmas birthdays car insurance home insurance taxes if it 's not part of your mortgage payment i use an escrow account   i calculate how much i 'll need for all of those things put together over the year and set aside a fixed amount each paycheck to ensure that i have enough to cover each item   you could do something similar for minor doctor visits car repairs etc   estimate how much you might spend and set aside some money each month if you find you 're spending more than you thought just increase the amount   you can use envelopes for each type of expense have a separate checking account for those whatever   the point is to set it aside and make sure you have enough left over to cover your known expenses the whole point of an emergency fund is to be able to pay cash for emergencies rather than borrowing to pay them and dealing with interest late fees etc

these are the things to focus on do not put yourself in debt with a car there are other better solutions   1 get a credit card unless you already have one this and get the best cash back or points card you can get at the best rate   start with buying gas and groceries every month do not run the balance up pay the card off every single month this is important never carry a balance above 25 of your credit limit   every 8 months or so call your credit card company and ask for a credit line increase they should be able to do this without pulling your credit you are only looking for the automatic increment that they can automatically approve this will help increase your available credit and will help keep your credit utilization low only do this is you are successfully doing the other bullet points above   2 pay all of your bills on time this includes everything from water electricity phone bill etc never be late setup automatic payments if you can   3 minimize the number of hard credit inquiries is particularly important when you are looking for your mortgage lender do not let them pull your credit automatically you should be able to provide them your credit score and other information and get quotes from those lenders do not let them tell you then ca n't do this they can   plan when you close a credit line closing them will do two things lower your credit limit often times increasing your credit utilization and it may hurt your average age of credit open one credit card and keep it forever   note credit karma is a great tool you should check your score monthly and see how your efforts are influencing your score i also like citi credit cards because they will provide you monthly with your fico score which credit karma will only provide transunion and equifax   this is educational information and you should consider talking to a banker lender who can also give you more detailed instructions on how to get your credit improved so that they can approve you for a loan   many people can get their score above 720 in 1 2 years time going from no credit doing the steps described above it does take time be patient and do n't fall for gimmicks

there can be federal estate tax as well as state estate tax due on an estate but it is not of direct concern to you estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent not by the beneficiaries and so you do   not owe any estate tax as a matter of fact most estates in the us do not pay federal estate tax at all because only the amount that exceeds the federal exemption $ 5.5 m is taxable and most estates are smaller state estate taxes might be a different matter because   while many states exempt exactly what the federal government does others   exempt different usually smaller amounts but in any case estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax before distributing the inheritances as joetaxpayer 's answer says more succinctly what you inherit is net of estate tax if any what you receive as an inheritance is not taxable income to you either if you receive stock shares or other property your basis is the value of the property when you inherit it thus if you sell at a later time you will have to pay taxes only on the increase in the value of the property from the time you inherit it the increase in value from the time the decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income to you   exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment of traditional iras 401ks pension plans etc that you inherit that contain money on which the decedent never paid income tax distributions from such inherited accounts are mostly taxable income to you any part of post tax money such as nondeductible contributions to traditional iras that is included in the distribution is   tax free annuities present another source of complications for annuities within iras even the irs throws up its hands at explaining things to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into pub 950 saying in effect talk to your tax advisor for other annuities questions arise such as is this a tax deferred annuity and whether it was purchased with pre tax money or with post tax money etc   one thing that you should check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum   distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly quarterly semi annual or annual payments annuities   in particular have heavy surrender charges if they are terminated early and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance   company issuing the annuity had planned on happening   so taking a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the lump sum but because the increase in agi might reduce deductions for medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized deductions that can be claimed increase taxability of social security   benefits etc you say that you have these angles out and so i will merely re beware the surrender charges

as others have pointed out your bond funds should have short durations preferably not more than about 2 years if you are in a bond fund for the long haul meaning you do not have to draw on your bond fund a short time after interest rates have gone up it is not a big issue the fund 's holdings will eventually turn over into higher interest bearing paper if bonds do go down you might want to add more to the fund(s see my comment on age specific asset allocation below keep in mind that some stocks are interest sensitive for example utility stocks which are used as an income source and their dividends compete with rates on cds which are much safer right now cd rates are very low this could change it 's possible that we may be in an unusually sensitive interest rate period that might have large effects on the stock market yet to be determined the reason is that rates have been so low for such a long time that folks that normally would have obtained income streams from bonds have turned to dividend bearing stocks some believe that recent market rises are due to such people seeking dividends to enhance cash inflows if and emphasis on if this is true we could see a sharp drop in the market as sell offs occur as those who want cash streams move from stocks to ultra safe government insured cds only time will tell if this is going to play out if retirement for you is 15 + years in the future and the market goes down bonds or equities good stuff it 's a buying opportunity in whatever category has dropped most important is to keep an eye on your asset allocation and make sure it is appropriate to your age you did not state the percentages in each category so further discussion is impossible on that topic with more than 15 years to go i personally would be heavily weighted on the equity side mostly mid cap and some small equity funds or etfs in both domestic and international markets as you age shuffle some equities into fixed income bonds cds and the like work up an asset allocation plan start thinking about it now do n't wait

you walk into the finance company with a written quote from the supplier for the equipment you want to buy you then fill out forms and sign a promissory note the finance company then writes out a check to the supplier for the amount of the quoted equipment usually you need to provide at least 3 things they will require you to provide your social security number and sign a document allowing them to check your credit history which they will look up using the social security number note that banks will generally give better rates on a personal loan than a finance company people usually only use finance companies when their credit is so bad that a bank will not loan them money heating and cooling companies that provide equipment will often loan the money to buy that equipment as a point of advice it is generally poor financial management to take out personal loans and may indicate a person that is wasting money or be in financial difficulties for personal loan items furniture cars clothing jewelry etc you are far better off saving money to buy the item not borrowing beyond your means if you need a new furnace and it is an emergency for example if it were winter which it is not and your furnace could not be repaired then that might justifiable but borrowing money at a high rate to just upgrade a furnace or get a luxury like ac is unwise

being into business since years and having clients worldwide i receive a lot of payments via wire transfers some in business and some in personal checking accounts i have never been charged by my bank for any incoming wire and by the way i bank with hsbc and boa in the us actually the charges on the account depends on the type of account you are opening holding with the bank with a tight competition in the finance and banking industry you can always demand the bank for the services you want and the pricing you want the best thing to do is ask your bank if they can wave those incoming wire charges for you and if not you have a whole bunch of options

if the index goes up every single day during your investment you would indeed be better off with 2x etfs assuming no tracking errors however this is basically never the case indexes fluctuate up and down and the problem is with these sorts of etfs you double your win on the upside but your downside is more than double if an index goes up 10 one day and down 10 the next you lose 1 of the value of your investment 1.1 0.9 if you are using 2x etfs you lose 4 of the value of your investment 1.2 0.8 not 2 if you are using 3x etfs you lose 9 of the value of your investment 1.3 0.7 not 3 so if the index will continue to rise during your holding period yes you are better off with these 2x or 3x etfs if the index falls on some days but rises most other days the added downside is all but certain to make you lose money even though the stock trends upward that 's why these etfs are designed for single day bets over the long term the volatility of the stock market combined with your exponentially increased downside guarantees you will lose money

do you want to do it pre or post correction if you 're bearish on the market the obvious thing to do is short an index i would say this is kind of dumb the main problem is that it may take months or years for the market to crash and by then it will have gone up so much that even the crash does n't bring you profit and you 're paying borrowing fees meanwhile as well you need to watch the portfolio also when you short sell you 'll get a bunch of cash which you most likely will want to invest but once you invest it the market can spike and your short position resulting in negative remaining cash since you already spent it at that point you get a margin call from your broker if you check your account regularly not a big deal but bad things can happen if you treat it as a fire and forget strategy these days they have inverse funds so you do n't have to borrow anything the fund manager borrows for you i 'd say those are much better the less cumbersome choice is to simply sell call options on the index or buy puts these are even cash options so when you exercise you get lose money not shares you can even arrange them so that your potential loss is capped but honestly same goes for shorts it 's called a stop loss you could also wait for the correction and buy the dip less worrying about shorts and such but of course the issue is timing the crash usually the crashes are very quick and there are several pre crashes that look like it bottomed out but then it crashes more so actually very difficult thing to tell you have to know either exactly when the correction will be or exactly what the price floor is and set a limit buy hope your crystal ball works yet another choice is finding asset classes uncorrelated or even with the broader market for instance some emerging markets developing countries some sectors individual stocks that are not inflated bonds gold and so on can have these characteristics where if s&p goes down they go up buying those may be a safer approach since at least you are still holding a fundamentally valuable thing even if your thesis meanwhile shorts and puts and the like are purely speculative

during the day market and limit orders are submitted at any time by market participants and there is a bid and an ask that move around over time   trades occur whenever a market order is submitted or a limit order is submitted that at a price that matches or exceeds an existing limit order   if you submit a market order it may consume all best price limit orders and you can get multiple prices changing the bid or ask at the same time   all that stuff happens during the trading day only what happens at the end of the day is different   a bunch of orders that were submitted during the day but marked as on close are aggregated with any outstanding limit orders to create a single closing price according to the algorithm established by the exchange   each exchange may handle the details of this closing event differently   for example the nasdaq 's closing cross or the nyse 's closing auction the close is the most liquid time of the day so investors who are trading large amounts and not interested in intraday swings will often submit a market on close or limit on close order   this minimizes their chance of affecting the price or crossing a big spread   it 's actually most relevant for smaller stocks which may have too little volume during the day to make big trades but have plenty at the close   in short the volume you see is due to these on close orders the spike in volume most likely has no special information about what will happen overnight or the next day   it 's probably just a normal part of the market for illiquid stocks

if markets are efficient which they are n't but anyways the frequency of dca investments should n't yield any meaningful difference in return   the one possible item to note is that if you 're able to invest more frequently you 'll have more money exposed to the effects of compounding for longer which may increase return however there are also transaction costs to consider which may render something like continuous dca ing ineffective    that same compounding effect also negates the potential benefits of dca altogether making it more logical to lump sum your investments    you may be conflating dca with simply making additional cash every week that 's available for investment if that 's the case again lump sum as early as possible should yield the best results   this is n't financial advice read the sidebar disclaimers

i 'll start with the bottom line below the line i 'll address the specific issues becoming a us tax resident is a very serious decision that has significant consequences for any non american with > $ 0 in assets when it involves cross border business interests it becomes even more significant especially if switzerland is involved the us has driven at least one iconic swiss financial institution out of business for us tax residents from the irs fincen so in a nutshell you need to learn and be afraid of the following and many more the best thing for you would be to find a good us tax adviser there are several large us tax firms in the uk handling the us expats there go to one of those and get a proper assessment of all your risks and get a proper advice you can get burnt really hard if you do n't prepare and plan properly now here 's that bottom line q will i have to submit the accounts for the swiss business even    though i m not on the payroll and the business makes hardly any    profit each year i can of course get our accounts each year but    they will be in swiss german that 's actually not a trivial question depending on the ownership structure and your legal status within the company all the company 's bank accounts may be reportable on fbar see link above you may also be required to file form q will i need to have this translated is there any format procedure    to this will it have to be translated by my swiss accountants and    if so which parts of the documentation need to be translated all us forms are in english if you 're required to provide supporting documentation during audit or if the form instructions require it with filing you 'll need to translate it and have the translation certified depending on what you need your accountant will guide you i was told that if i sell the business and property after i a    that i will be liable to 15 tax of the profit i 'd made   q is this correct no you will be liable to pay income tax the rate of the tax depends on the kind of property and the period you held it for it may be 15 it may be 39 depends on a lot of factors it may also be 0 in some cases i    also understand that any tax paid on selling in switzerland will be    deducted from the 15 may be may be not what you 're talking about is called foreign tax credit the rules for calculating the credit are not exactly trivial and from my personal experience you can most definitely end up being paying tax in both the us and switzerland without the ability to utilize the credit in full again talk to your tax adviser ahead of time to plan things in the most optimal way for you i will effectively have all the paperwork for this as we 'll need to    do the same in switzerland but again it will be in swiss german q would this be a problem if its presented in swiss german of course if you need to present it again most likely only in case of audit you 'll have to have a translation translating stuff is not a problem usually costs $ per page depending on complexity unless a lot of money involved i doubt you 'll need to translate more than balance sheet bank statement i know this is a very unique set of questions so if you can shed any    light on the matter it would be greatly appreciated not unique at all you 're not the first and not the last to to the us however you need to understand that the issue is very complex taxes are complex everywhere but especially so in the us i suggest you not do anything before talking to a us licensed cpa ea whose practice is to work with the eu uk expats to the us or us expats to the uk eu

it 's simply supply and demand    first demand if you 're an importer trying to buy from overseas you 'll need foreign currency maybe euros   or if you want to make a trip to europe you 'll need to buy euros   or if you 're a speculator and think the usd will fall   in value you 'll probably buy euros unless there 's someone willing to sell you euros for dollars you ca n't get any   there are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world   if more want to buy usd than that demand will positively influence the price of the usd as measured in euros   if more people want to buy euros well vice versa there are so many of these transactions globally and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously that the prices exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it   if people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars i.e. if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks by exchanging their dollars for stock then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher   when the stock market crashes you 'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars this represents a lot of demand for dollars then there 's supply it may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there or that supply only changes when bernanke prints money but there 's actually a lot more to it than that   if you 're coming from europe and want to buy some usd from the bank well how much usd does the bank have and what does it mean for them to have money   the bank gets money from depositors or from lenders   if one person puts money in a deposit account and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage the same dollar is being used by two people   the home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account and the same dollar might get lent out again   in economics this is called the multiplier effect the full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re lending    since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions the number of transactions being conducted sometimes on credit affects the supply of money demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash   if i fear the stock market i might keep all my money in dollars   this takes cash away from companies who could invest it takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions and leaves it waiting under my mattress   you could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions the full picture can be a bit more complicated if you look at every way currencies are used globally with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures but this gives the basic story of where prices come from that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces    the bank just facilitates transactions   if the last price exchange rate is 1.2 dollars per euro and the bank gets more requests to buy usd for euros than euros for usd it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even   if the usd gets more expensive at some point fewer people will want to buy it or want to buy products from the us that cost usd   the bank maintains a spread like buy for 1.19 and sell for so it can take a profit you should think of currency like any other commodity and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter   the value of currency is merely a convention but it works   the currency is needed in transactions so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods services and other currencies   as supply and demand for this and other commodities goods services fluctuate so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions a official basket of goods and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes inflation etc   the official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis

at least for liquid markets the downside of being a market maker is what we call negative selection specifically if you 're both bid and offered in a market trying to collect your spread then as the market goes up you 'll tend to sell the whole way up and vice versa so if you 're not smart about it you can end up losing a lot of money    being a good market maker then involves either being able to smarter about when to be aggressively bid and offered and when to pull back or being able to hedge them quickly before they really hurt you the first probably would require more sophisticated algorithms while the second requires good speed and execution strategies

my understanding is that losses are first deductible against any capital gains you may have then against your regular income up to $ 3,000 per year   if you still have a loss after that the loss may be carried over to offset capital gains or income in subsequent years as you suspect a short term capital loss is deductible against short term capital gains and long term losses are deductible against long term gains   so taking the loss now might be beneficial from a tax perspective   i say might because there are a couple scenarios in which it either may not matter or actually be detrimental if you do n't have any short term capital gains this year but you have long term capital gains you would have to use the short term loss to offset the long term gain before you could apply it to ordinary income   so in that situation you lose out on the difference between the long term tax rate 15 and your ordinary income rate potentially higher if you keep the stock and sell it for a long term loss next year but you only have short term capital gains or no capital gains next year then you may use the long term loss to offset your short term gains first or your ordinary income    clear as mud the whole mess is outlined in irs publication 550 finally if you still think the stock is good but just want to take the tax loss you can sell the stock now to realize the loss then re buy it in 30 days   this is called tax loss harvesting   the 30 day delay is an irs requirement for being allowed to realize the loss

capital is only a token restriction when a company is incorporated a maximum number of shares is specified in the legal documentation most companies will make this an extremely large number so they never face that limitation   see here you would n't necessarily expect the stock price to change the reason a company issues new stock is as a way to raise capital although new stock is issued the cash raised by the sale becomes an asset on the company 's balance sheet   there 's a good worked example in this wikipedia article following a rights issue the liabilities of the company will increase to account for the increase in owner 's equity but the assets will also increase by the same amount with the cash received whether the stock price changes will depend upon what price the stock is issued at and on the market 's opinions about the company 's growth potential now it has new capital to invest   if the new stock is issued at the same price as the current market price there 's no particular reason to expect the share price to change again wikipedia has more detail when new stock is issued it is usually offered to existing shareholders first in proportion to their current holding   if the shareholder decides to purchase the new stock in full then their position wo n't be diluted   if they opt not to buy the new stock they will now own a smaller percentage of the company as their stocks will make up a smaller part of the now larger number of shares

gt that said the non profit also was likely to enroll about 1,000 students at nominal tuition levels whereas the for profit is likely to enroll tens of thousands with dozens of staff doing nothing but making sure their students get the largest possible student loans   i get what you are saying the non profit is n't causing as much long term damages as these for profit johnny come has anyone taken the numbers and really crunched them   i feel like the problem is the perverse incentives created by the student loan system there is n't anything inherently wrong with for profit colleges but there are issues under the current system because of the way we extend credit to students anytime credit is available the big corrupt banks are not far behind   i say get rid of the loan programs and see how these for profit schools adjust i think they would probably be able to adjust more quickly and possibly even get better than the non profit schools due to their lack of legacy contracts and traditions

in many most cases luxury cars are leased rather than purchased so the payments on even an expensive car might not be as high as you 'd expect for simplicity take a $ 100,000 car if you were to buy that in cash or do a standard five year auto loan that would be incredibly expensive for all but the wealthiest of people but a lease is different when you lease a car you are financing the car 's depreciation over the lease term so let 's suppose that you 're signing up for a three year lease the car manufacturer will make an estimate of what that car will be worth when you bring it back in three years this is called the residual value if this number is $ 80,000 that means the is only financing the $ 20,000 difference between the car 's price and its residual value after three years rather than the full $ 100,000 msrp at the end of the lease he or she just turns the car back in luxury cars are actually especially amenable to leasing because they have excellent brand power just because of the name on the hood there are many people who would be happy to pay a lot for a three year old mercedes or bmw with a or low range car the brand is not as powerful and used cars have a lower residual value as a percentage of the msrp than luxury cars so do n't look at an $ 80,000 luxury car and assume that the owner has paying for the entire $ 80,000

a mutual fund 's return or yield has nothing to do with what you receive from the mutual fund the annual percentage return is simply the percentage increase or decrease of the value of one share of the mutual fund from january 1 till december 31 the cash value of any distributions dividend income short term capital gains   long term capital gains might be reported separately or might be included in the annual return   what you receive from the mutual fund is the distributions which you have the option of taking in cash and spending on whatever you like or investing elsewhere or of re investing into the fund without ever actually touching the money regardless of whether you take a distribution as cash or re invest it in the mutual fund that amount is taxable income in most jurisdictions in the us long term capital gains are taxed at different lower rates than ordinary income and i believe that long term capital gains from mutual funds are not taxed at all in india you are not taxed on the increase in the value of your investment caused by an increase in the share price over the year nor do you get deduct the loss if the share price declined over the year it is only when you sell the mutual fund shares back to the mutual fund company that you have to pay taxes on the capital gains if you sold for a higher price or deduct the capital loss if you sold for a lower price than the purchase price of the shares be aware that different shares in the sale might have different purchase prices because they were bought at different times and thus have different gains and losses   so how do you calculate your personal return from the mutual fund investment if you have a money management program or a spreadsheet program it can calculate your return for you if you have online access to your mutual fund account on its website it will most likely have a tool called something like personal rate of return and this will provide you with the same calculations without your having to type in all the data by hand finally if you want to do it personally by hand i am sure that someone will soon post an answer writing out the gory details

they represent two payment processing mechanisms that just happen to be available on one product rather like having and hdmi on you laptop your account number and sort code relates to the bank account your long number expiry and relate to the card it is perfectly possible and not uncommon to have two different cards on the same account which would have their own card numbers etc the bacs chaps and systems use the account numbers   these transactions are practically irreversible and work through the interbank transfer system and should be considered direct money transfers electronic cash the long digits are used by mastercard visa amex etc and go through their own payment systems   these payments are indirect and may or may not be reversible as the private payment network visa etc has some accountability they work like electronic cheques this is why debit card transactions can cause you to go overdrawn you are writing a promise to pay from an account   it is up to the bank to block the card if you have no money vs a chaps payment that checks the money is there before moving it it is easier but still hard to recover money lost through visa fraud than bacs credit cards have only the long number etc while savings accounts non checking accounts have only account numbers depending on where you are different laws will likely cover debit card vs money transfer payments   in the uk direct debit guarantee is the most common protection on the bacs system while standing orders and faster payments give you little legal power   debit cards will give you some protection because the payment system stands between you and the bank account so if you did n't make the transaction you should be able to reclaim the money card not present fraud   if you did make the transaction but the vendor failed to supply or goods were faulty then a chargeback system exists where you may also be able to reclaim   a bank transfer you make is and refund can only be claimed through court for faulty goods

i have heard that it is better for your credit score to pay them down over time will it make much of a difference i have never heard that however the financial institutions who are charging you an amount of interest which was at one time in the not so distant past classified and punishable in state criminal codes really enjoy you thinking that way you are clearly capable of doing the math yourself while i do n't know the exact numbers i am totally confident that you will find in about 5 or 10 minutes if that long that eliminating debt of any kind in your life will pay an immediate return that beats the great majority of other investments in terms of risk reward after the immediate financial return there is a and even greater long term benefit basic principle highest rates first perhaps this decision could be considered slightly less important than deciding not to smoke during your youth but i would put it as a close second you are already in a position where you can see the damage that your prior decisions about financial debt have produced run the clock back to the time in your life when you were debt free now pay off that debt with the big check and start from zero now turn on your psychic powers and predict the same amount of time in the future with the same amount of money do n't even try to adjust for inflation just use flat dollars without losing the money which you have given to the financial institutions during this previous part of your life do you now see why the financial institutions want you to think about slowly paying them off instead of waking up tomorrow without owing them anything

i would just do a loan for a different number of years on your new mortgage for example if you just spent 10 years paying off your first house then for your second close the first mortgage upon selling and then open a 20 or 25 year mortgage and the loan end date as well as the payment should remain similar this would be more do able if you paid ahead a little to compensate all the early on interest you have to eat so if you want to finish around the same time you could look into doing that since you 'll have more equity to make a stronger down payment

you can not contribute directly to that 401k account if you no longer work at the sponsoring company you have to be on their payroll   you can however roll the 401k over into an ira and contribute to the ira note that in both cases you are only allowed to contribute from earned income which includes all the taxable income and wages you get from working or from running your own business as long as you are employed and have made more than $ 5k this year you should have no problem i am not certain whether contributing your $ 5k to a roth ira would help you achieve your tax goals someone else here certainly can advise

i suspect you were downvoted because you wanted to increase the size of the pie rather than argue about what percentage of it everyone gets and the fed is a bigger today than energy for wealth inequality   wealth creation is a far more sustainable and way to create value for the individual lower energy = more wealth freed up for other things   the 1970 's were the beginning of the totalitarian seizure of many areas of our economy by central education healthcare yes fossil fuels accelerated on their exponential cost curve but the big impacts came from gov't

ethically you and your landlord should always report both income and expense as there technically exists a service and a rent so it is subject to taxation on the other hand it can be considered an exchange of a simple favour and if it does n't involve a money exchange or any profits i am assuming that you are not selling what you or your landlord produce on the market no value can be calculated thus no taxation can be applied this changes though if a contract is involved as a legal value can be estimated caution these subjects can vary on an extreme level of of what can and can not be claimed as income and expense which can vary per country state province and even per judge as well as the nature and sector of the work also if you intend to formalize this relationship the type of contract and reporting forms do vary per state as well so it might be best to confirm it with a local legal advisor to avoid unfortunate surprises

i 'm sorry but your math is wrong   you are not equally likely to make as much money by waiting for expiration share prices are moving constantly in both directions   very rarely does any stock go either straight up or straight down   consider a stock with a share price of $ 12 today   perhaps that stock is a bad buy and in 1 month 's time it will be down to $ 10   but the market has n't quite up to this yet and over the next week it rallies up to $ 15 if you bought a european option let 's say an at the money call expiring in 1 month at $ 12 on our start date then you lost   your option expired worthless if you bought an american option you could have exercised it when the share price was at $ 15 and made a nice profit keep in mind we are talking about exactly the same stock with exactly the same history over exactly the same time period   the only difference is the option contract   the american option could have made you money if you exercised it at any time during the rally but not the european option you would have been forced to hold onto it for a month and finally let it expire worthless of course that 's not strictly true since the european option itself can be sold while it is in the money but eventually somebody is going to end up holding the bag nobody can exercise it until expiration the difference between an american and european option is the difference between getting n chances to get it right n being the number of days til expiration and getting just one chance   it should be easy to see why you 're more likely to profit with the former even if you ca n't accurately predict price movement

the question is how does $ for 6.5 years fit into your budget or to put it another way what wo n't you be spending that money on housing food vacations retirement fund investments though you can invest your car fund in the meantime building a hefty emergency fund kids college funds saving for a down payment on a home charity etc are all other places that money could go i do n't know what your needs are today let alone 6.5 years into the future but i 'd encourage you to consider all your financial goals and evaluate where this expense would fit   it seems your plan is to save up to the total cost of the car and then buy it in cash that 's a valid strategy but it means you 'll have no car unless you already own one for 6.5 years   do you need a car if so what will you drive in the meantime and even if you already own another car outright you 'll have gas and maintenance expenses if you do n't need a car then $ 100,000 is a rather extravagant purchase for something we just established you do n't need would you be happier having this expensive car in 6.5 years or having a series of less expensive cars starting now or buying a used model of the expensive car sooner or having no car at all also a lot can change in 6.5 years cars will evolve and there 'll be different models and options available maybe your salary will have doubled or maybe you 'll be unemployed you could be living in a different city have a different commute and maybe you 'll need a minivan to haul kids around or live in a place with bad winters and want a drive you 'll also need to be prepared for the additional expenses that generally come with expensive cars such as higher insurance and maintenance rates and parking could be costly if you live in an expensive city   the other option of course if the car is truly something you need want and can afford would be to save up a sizable down payment and finance the rest so you can get the car sooner finally there 's nothing wrong with saving your money for 6.5 years building up that fund and then what makes the most sense for you at that time maybe it will the car maybe something else but the nice thing about having savings is that it gives you more options

almost all major no load mutual fund families allow you to do the kind of thing you are talking about however you may need an initial investment of between $ 1000 to $ 3000 depending on the fund   once you have it however annual fee 's are usually very little and the fees to buy that companies funds are usually zero if it 's a no load company vanguard etc   with the larger companies that means you have a pretty large selection of funds but generally each fund has a minimum initial purchase once that 's met then you can buy additional amounts in small quantities without a problem for someone on a smaller budget many low cost brokers etrade as mentioned by scottrade as mentioned by myself in another similar question today allow you to start with smaller initial balances and have a small selection of funds or etf 's that you can trade from without commission   in the case of scottrade they have like 15 etf 's that you can trade comission free   check with the various low cost brokerages such as etrade scottrade and tdameritrade to see what their policies are and what if any funds etf 's they allow you to trade in without commissions keep in mind that for mutual funds there may still be a fund minimum initial investment that applies be sure to check if that is the case or not   the lack of any minimum investment makes etf 's a slightly more attractive option for someone who does n't have the buy in that many funds require

intellectually and logically it should n't bother me for a second to charge something for a buck   it 's a losing proposition for the merchant but their immediate business costs should be of little concern to me   they 're making a choice to sell that item to me at that price and by accepting that means of payment right   but the more i charge as opposed to paying cash the more cash back i get in my old ish age i 've gotten a little and will pay cash more often for smaller amounts because i understand the business costs but it 's not a matter of caring what other people think accepting credit cards or not is a business decision   it 's usually a good one   but with that decision come the rules which up until about a year ago meant that merchants could n't set a minimum charge amount   now that 's not the case merchant account providers can no longer demand that their merchant clients accept all charges though they are allowed to set a minimum amount that is no lower than $ 10.00 in the end it 's a matter of how much you 're willing to pay in order to influence people 's thinking of you because the business financial benefits of doing one or the other are pretty clear

there are many aspects to consider in deciding what sort of company you want to form instead of an s corporation you should determine whether it would be better to form a limited liability company llc limited partnership lp or even a professional company pc littleadv is correct there is minimal benefit in forming an s corp with you and your wife as the shareholders if you will be the only contributor worker there are costs associated with an s corporation or any corporation that might outweigh benefits from more favorable tax treatment or personal protection from liability filing fees and disclosure rules vary from state to state for example my father was a who had no employees other than my grandmother she worked for free in a state with income taxes he was advised that a pc was best in new mexico while an s corp was better in florida there are no personal income taxes in florida   the only way to know what to do requires that you consult an accountant a good one for guidance

it depends on your bank 's terms which may in turn be influenced by laws and regulations but most banks calculate interest on a per day basis so if you leave the money in the account for more than a day it will generate interest however it will most likely be so little that you could make more money doing any kind of paid work in the time it took you to write this question

so america puts its cost of emissions right into the tax on a gallon of gas instead waiting to tax until you buy a certain amount of gas   my point is this   is almost exactly like the cap amp trade policy obama wanted to pass about a year ago   america is up in arms when they have to pay another cap amp trade tax in another country when they are on their soil but when we want to cap amp trade here its ok because its all for the environment   also i do n't like at all so i do n't support any emissions taxes

there 's a bit of confusion here   michael 's article you linked is focused on the issue of post tax 401(k deposits for those new to this it sounds like we are talking about roth 401(k money not so the roth ira was introduced in 1998 and the roth 401(k in 2006 before 06 people had the ability to deposit more to their 401(k than the pretax limit of $ 15,000 into the account as after tax deposits my understanding is that these funds were analogous to the non deducted ira deposits for those outside the income limits   michael goes on the point out that now with the addition of roth 401(k and roth iras there are folk with pre and post tax 401(k funds and trying to crack them for transfer to traditional ira and roth ira may be problematic   aside from a recent thread here there are separate accounts for the roth 401(k and traditional 401(k and it 's possible for the traditional to contain post tax money which given the recent introduction of the roth 401(k conversion should be easily

long term gov't bonds fluctuate in price with a seemingly small interest rate fluctuation because many years of cash inflows are discounted at low rates   this phenomenon is in a high interest rate environment for example just the principal repayment is worth p + what it will be in 30 years at 4 while an overnight loan paying an unrealistic 4 is worth essentially the same as the principal p + this is more profound in low interest rate economies because taking the countries undergoing the present misfortune one can see that their overnight interest rates are double us long term rates while their long term rates are nearly 10x as large as us long term rates   if there were much supply at the longer maturities which have been restrained by interest rates only manageable by the highly skilled or highly risky a 4 increase on a 30 bond is only about a 20 decline in bond price while a 4 increase on a 4 bond is a 50 decrease the easiest long term bond to manipulate quantitatively is the perpetuity where p is the price of the bond i is the interest payment per some arbitrary period usually 1 year and r is the interest rate paid per some arbitrary period usually 1 year   since they are expressly linked a price can be implied for a given interest rate and vice versa if the interest payment is known or assumed at a 4 interest rate the price is at the price is a 1 increase in interest rates and a 0.8 decrease in price longer term bonds such as a 30 year or 20 year bond will not see as extreme price movements the constant maturity 30 year treasury has fluctuated between 5 and 2.5 to now from before the great recession til now so prices will have more or less doubled and then reduced because bond prices are inversely proportional to interest rates as generally shown above at shorter maturities this phenomenon is negligible because future cash inflows are being discounted by such a low amount   the one month bill rarely moves in price beyond the bid ask spread during expansion but can be expected to collapse before a recession and rebound during

i 'm just trying to visualize the costs of trading say i set up an account to trade something forex stock even bitcoin and i was going to let a random generator determine when i should buy or sell it if i do this i would assume i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss your question is what a would call an ill posed problem   it makes it a challenge to answer   the short answer is no   we will have to consider three broad cases for types of assets and two time intervals let us start with a very short time interval   the bid ask spread covers the anticipated cost to the market maker of holding an asset bought in the market equal to the opportunity costs over the half life of the holding period   a consequence of this is that you are nearly guaranteed to lose money if your time interval between trades is less than the half life of the actual portfolio of the market maker   to use a dice analogy imagine having to pay a fee per roll before you can gamble   you can win but it will be biased toward losing now let us go to the extreme opposite time period which is that you will buy now and sell one minute before you die   for stocks you would have received the dividends plus any stocks you sold from mergers   conversely you would have had to pay the dividends on your short sales and received a gain on every short stock that went bankrupt   because you have to pay interest on short sales and dividends passed you will lose money on a net basis to the market maker   maybe you are seeing a pattern here   the phrase market maker will come up a lot now let us look at currencies   in the long run if the current fiat money policy regime holds you will lose a lot of money   deflation is not a big deal under a commodity money regime but it is a problem under fiat money so central banks avoid it   so your long currency holdings will depreciate   your short would appreciate except you have to pay interest on them at a rate greater than the rate of inflation to the market maker finally for commodities no one will allow perpetual holding of short positions in commodities because people want them delivered   because insider knowledge is presumed under the commodities trading laws a random investor would be at a giant disadvantage similar to what a chess player who played randomly would face against a grand master chess player   there is a very strong information asymmetry in commodity contracts   there are people who actually do know how much cotton there is in the world how much is planted in the ground and what the demand will be and that knowledge is not shared with the world at large   you would be fleeced can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do    worst than random say if i had to guess the roll of a dice my    chance of being correct ca n't be less than a physicist a con man a and a statistician would tell you that dice rolls and coin are not random   while we teach fair coins and fair dice in introductory college classes to simplify many complex ideas they also do not exist   if you want to see a funny version of the dice roll game watch the 1962 japanese movie   it is an action movie but it begins with a dice game    consider adopting a bayesian perspective on probability as it would be a healthier perspective based on how you are thinking about this problem   a frequency approach always assumes the null model is true which is what you are doing   had you tried this will real money your model would have been falsified but you still would n't know the true model yes you can do much worse than of the time   even if you are trying to be fair you have not accounted for the variance extending that logic then for an inexperienced trader is it right to    say then that it 's equally difficult to purposely make a loss then it    is to purposely make a profit because if i can purposely make a loss    i would purposely just do the opposite of what i 'm doing to make a    profit so in the dice example if i can somehow lower my chances of    winning below it means i would simply need to bet on the    other 5 numbers to give myself a better than 83 chance of winning if the game were fair but for things like forex the rules of the game are purposefully changed by the market maker to maximize long run profitability   under us law forex is not regulated by anything other than common law   as a result the market maker can state any price including prices far from the market with the intent to make a system used by actors losing systems such as to trigger margin calls   the prices quoted by forex dealers in the us move loosely with the global rates but vary enough that only the dealer should make money systematically   a fixed strategy would promote loss you are assuming that only you know the odds and they would let you profit from your percentage chance of winning so then is the costs of trading from a purely probabilistic point of    view simply the transaction costs no matter what my chances can not    be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is    greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction    cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit no the cost of trading is the opportunity cost of the money   the transaction costs are explicit costs but you have ignored the implicit costs of foregone interest and foregone happiness using the money for other things you will want to be careful here in understanding probability because the distribution of returns for all of these assets lack a first moment and so there can not be a mean return   a modal return would be an intellectually more consistent perspective implying you should use an all or nothing cost function to evaluate your methodology

as with many questions here while littleadv is correct the real answer is each bank may handle this differently in my case i was experimenting with my balance to see the impact of utilization and i overpaid the current bill before the bill was issued    the prior balance was paid but then i sent a payment to bring my account to a credit balance further down the statement appears the line   your account has a credit balance we can hold and apply this balance    against future purchases and cash advances or refund it if you would    like a check mailed to you in the amount of the credit balance simply    call us and speak to a representative you can also see that the revolving credit available is above the line of credit implying that someone with a $ 5000 credit line wanting to charge a $ 6000 engagement ring can send a higher payment to the account and then make that charge

sorry for your loss like others have said debts can not be inherited period in the us however assets sometimes can be made to stand for debts in most cases credit card debt has no collateral and thus the credit card companies will often either sell the debt to a debt collector or collections agency sue you for it or write it off collecting often takes a lot of time and money thus usually the credit card companies just sell the debt to a debt collector who tries to get you to pay up before the statute of limitations runs out that said some credit card companies will sue the debtor to obtain a judgement but many do n't in your case i would n't tell them of your loss let em do their homework and waste time do n't give them any info and consult with a lawyer regarding your father 's estate and whether his credit card will even matter often unscrupulous debt collectors will say illegal things per the fdcpa to pressure anyone related to the debtor to pay do n't cave in make sure you know your rights and record all interactions calls you have with them you can sue them back for any fdcpa some attorneys might even take up such a case on contingency i.e they get a portion of the fdcpa damages you collect do n't pay even a penny this often will extend or reset the statute of limitations time for the debt to be collectable i.e ex if in your state the statute of limitations for credit card debt is 3 years and you pay them $ 0.01 on year 2 you just bought them 3 more years to be able to collect tl;dr ianal most credit card debt has no collateral so do n't pay or give any info to the debt collectors anytime you pay it extends the statute of limitations consult an attorney for the estate matters and if the debt collectors get too aggressive and record their calls and sue them back

one estimate is to sell today estimate the taxes and determine how much cash you need to set aside over the next 12 months the is no way to calculate what impact dividends and capital gains the funds will have because unlike interest they are n't guaranteed the other complexity is that the funds themselves could drop in value in that case the dividends and capital gains may not even be enough to get you back to even i use mutual funds to invest over the long term with the idea of spending the funds over decades when needing to save for a short term goal i use banking products they are guaranteed not to lose value and the interest changes are thus easier to predict

it is true as noted that you generally do not know when stock that you 're holding has been loaned by your broker to someone for a short sale that you generally consent to that when you sign up somewhere in the small print and that the person who borrows has to make repay and dividends the broker is on the hook to make sure that your stock is available for you to sell when you want so there 's limited risk there there are some risks to having your stock loaned though   the main one is that you do n't actually get the dividend   formally you get a substitute payment in lieu of dividends   the payment in lieu will be taxed differently   whereas qualified dividends get reported on form 1099-div and get special tax treatment substitute payments get reported on form 1099-misc box 8 is just for this purpose   substitute payments get taxed as regular income not at the preferred rate for dividends the broker may or may not give you additional money beyond the dividend to compensate you for the extra tax whether or not this tax difference matters depends on how much you 're getting in dividends your tax bracket and to some extent your general perspective if you want to vote your shares and exercise your ownership rights then there are also some risks   the company only issues for the number of shares issued by them   on the broker 's books however the short sale may result in more long positions than there are total shares of stock financially the extra longs are offset by shorts but for voting this does not balance i 'm unclear how this is resolved i 've read that the the brokers essentially depend on shareholder apathy but i 'd guess there 's more to it than that if you want to prevent your broker from loaning out your shares you have some options

as mhoran_psprep and others have already said it sounds like the sale is concluded and your son has no obligation to return the car or pay a dime more the only case in which your son should consider returning the car is if it works in his favor for example if he is able to secure a similar bargain on a different car and the current dealer buys the current car back from your son at a loss if the dealer wants to buy the car back your son should first get them to agree to cover any fees already incurred by your son after that he should negotiate that the dealer split the remaining difference with him suppose the dealership gave a $ 3000 discount and your son paid $ 1000 in title transfer registration and any other fees such as a cashier 's check or tax if applicable the remaining difference is $ 2000 your son should get half that   in this scenario the dealer only loses half as much money and your son gains $ 1000 for his trouble

as you point out the main benefits of a pension retirement account over a traditional cash taxable account are the legal and tax benefits   most western countries establish a specific legal definition for an account which is often taxed less or not at all relative to taxable accounts and which contains some protection for the owner in case of a bankruptcy   the typical drawbacks for investing within such structures are limited investment choice limited withdrawal rights either in terms of age or rate of withdrawal and maximum contributions   the benefits are usually very clear and your decision whether or not to open a pension retirement account should depend on a careful weighing of the benefits and drawbacks as to whether you may end up with less than you started that depends on what you invest in   as with all of finance you must take more risk to get more return   although the choices inside a pension retirement account may be worded somewhat differently they are usually fundamentally no different than some of the most popular investments available for ordinary taxable accounts

a reason that the wealth has never and will never trickle down is because as society goes on the wealth transfer only happens between upper tiers of society   it used to be that the rich would spend their money and many people would benefit from it in a society small business owners were pretty much all their were and the only people who had monopolies were the rail and oil lines   as time went on more major organizations up for news food computers etc now wealth transfers only between the top tiers and the lower tiers only get the crumbs the higher tier chooses to pay them which is significantly less than they used to whereas employees used to cost a reasonable value to a company they are now almost entirely expendable assets exceptions made for certain portions of history   i am of the opinion that much like history the cycle is going to repeat shortly the occupy wall street being a precursor to another wage fight between the rich and poor with the dissemination of knowledge being much easier more people are getting the general idea that they 're getting shafted they want to be rich although not necessarily because the rich are wealthy they simply want to be able to increase their class mobility that 's been dying a slow death for the past 20 years and quite by the bank bail out   it 's unfortunate a sizable portion of the population actually sides with the 1 of people actively preventing them from moving up gaining more mobility and improving the quality of their life i sincerely hope that at some point in the near future people realize this before the lower class goes and starts busting heads

gt;do you think that someone like gm does not create any indirect jobs gm is basically just a final of components made by others   during it 's peak employment years gm largely owned and manufactured the vast majority of it 's own components   of course there were still a lot of raw materials suppliers as well as minor component suppliers but the gm of 1970 was a far different and much more vertically integrated operation than it was just a decade or two later   the comment about worldwide employment misses the mark here the west is outsourcing our manufacturing   yes but you need to dig deeper than cheap labor for the reasons why a lot of it has to do with the post 1971 fiat dollar and the advent of leveraging everything in sight in part as an absurd inflation hedge and in part because finance saw a way of profiteering off the sale of the assets selling the farms out from underneath the farmers so to speak and subsequently firms needed to make substantially more than their previous profit margins in order to cover the interest costs etc   gt;we on the other hand are doing the opposite we 're going to end up with no middle class the only jobs available here will be for a small number of very highly specialized skills like hedge fund managers and the people who mow their lawns   no eventually the dollar will either become so watered down if it does n't collapse entirely along with an increase in the cost of overseas labor and a rising expense of goods transport in many ways only possible on large bulk scales will create a different scenario one in which manufacturing which has not entirely left the us by any means will stage a comeback but it will be a long slow climb back and we are probably a decade or more before the tide turns

if i had to take sides i 'd think that it would be better to be able to divide up the entirety of your savings into big buckets as others are saying in their answers if not in physically accounts then at least conceptually let 's say you 're 45 years old and have $ 350,000 in various accounts   i would argue that you should at the very least know this level of detail so if you get in a really really bad accident that costs $ 100,000 you know at least conceptually that now you 're in a better position to revise your goals   maybe you decide that real estate is n't all that and you allocate the entire shortfall to that item and reallocate it to start the first safety program in the country so now it looks like this but had you not the funds to begin with you would n't have known where you stood

first you are not a loser nor an idiot you have avoided many debt mistakes and have a stable income this move will be good for you and your family and an opportunity to continue to build your life together the fact you are even thinking about this and asking questions shows that you are responsible to your rent buy question ben miller has a great summary in his answer i have nothing more to add except that you already know you can not buy that question is not really your main problem you need some financial goals and then you need a plan to achieve those goals as you become more educated about finances it can be like drinking from a fire hose trying to analyze too much information can you and make you freak out that you are messing everything up try this   think about where you want to be in 5 years or so write down with your fiance some of those dreams and goals maybe things like finish college buy a house pay off student loans wedding have more kids etc as you prioritize these things you will see that some are short term goals and some are long term then you lay out a step by step plan to get there by focusing on each step at a time you see more success and are more motivated   as you see movement towards your goals you will be willing to sacrifice more to get there you will be willing to rent a cheaper place with less room to make more headway on these things this will be a several year plan which is why it is so important to define your goals at the beginning this will give you motivation and the mental toughness to follow through when it is difficult

the typical deal is you can put 10 of your gross pay into the espp the purchase will occur on the last deposit date usually a 6 month period at a 15 discount to the market price   so the math is something like this your return if sold the day it 's purchased is not 15 it 's 100/85 or 17.6 minor on my part i suppose   also the return is not a 6 month return as the weekly or bi weekly deductions are the average between the oldest 6 mo and the most recent uh zero time maybe a week this is closer to 3 months the annualized rate is actually pretty meaningless since you do n't have 4 opportunities to achieve this return it 's important only if the cash flow hit causes you to borrow to support the espp purchases the risk is whether the stock drops the 15 before you can execute the sell to take advantage of the gain   of course the return is gross you need to net for taxes   edit to respond to comment below when i said meaningless i meant that you ca n't take the 17.6 annualize it to per year and think your $ 1000 will compound to $ it 's as meaningless as when an investor gets a 10 gain on a stock in one day and with 250 trading days per year decides his $ 1000 will be worth $ 2 quadrillion dollars after a year the 17.6 is significant in that it 's available twice per year for a true 38 return over a year but if borrowing to help the cash flow that rate is really over 3 months

this would depend on what transfer methods your forex broker allows most will allow you to have a check or wire transfer sent best thing would be to call email your broker and ask how to get the money into your account keep in mind many brokers will force you to withdraw using the same funding method you used to deposit up to the amount of the deposit for example if i fund my forex account with $ 500 on a credit card and make $ 500 profit i now have $ 1,000 sitting in my forex account the broker will force me to withdraw $ 500 as a credit to my credit card before allowing me to use another withdrawal method this is an anti money laundering precaution

stocks are regarded as an inflation hedge because when your money is worth less everything else is worth more i.e. stocks are more expensive go up simply because your money is worth less but not because of better earnings across individual companies so that general idea can effect sentiment whereby if everyone believes it then more people buy stocks if they think there will be a lot of inflation but it does n't explain actual behavior whether more people buy hold or sell it 's worth noting that individual companies and stocks also may be adversely affected by inflation since their own assets or accounting may already be outside of the currency and/or they may already be engaging in their own hedging

i am quite sure you can set up an office in your basement for a lot less than $ 15,000 do n't build any walls install any flooring or upgrade the ceiling just install more lights and plugs set up your desks and what not in whatever corner is furthest from like the laundry room or the furnace the kids and the nanny get the main floor just let the whole living room be a giant for example this gives you the separation you need to work at home but you can hear if something really needs your attention   when the kids go off to school you can the basement into a for kids who do n't always need supervision using the money you are no longer spending on the nanny to install real walls a drop ceiling and so on your office stuff can move up to the main floor or to a spare room upstairs if you had one but it was n't usable during the baby years when upstairs generally has to be quiet as the kids get older the basement can get tailored to what and teens like this is essentially what we did and our square and child counts match yours almost precisely we did eventually convert our garage to and finished space and it spent time as an office with staff coming in each day then some time as a teen think video games and loud music after the business rented office space outside the house but if you do n't intend to hire staff for your business you do n't need to do this part we did the majority of the basement wiring ourselves and got an electrician to hook it into the panel and check our work the budget would probably be less than 10 of the guess from your real estate agent

i agree with you completely that many college graduates are grossly for the real world and that many might not want to work with their hands   you 're even right that a non graduate can make 40k a year in a trade   but if you think that labor jobs are some hidden answer that can solve unemployment you 're nuts   it 's no secret that work is drying up in most areas   that means less hours to go around instead of older workers retiring they 're staying on the job as long as possible in order to maintain the retirement they envisioned for themselves

your suggestion seems a bit too extreme handing auditing responsibility to a government body agency would just create its own set of problems and other conflicts of interest for example opinions could be subject to politics increased bureaucracy laziness due to monopoly hell if the government audited the statements they would have the power to authorize only accounting policies that maximized a company 's tax payout   the audit only firm proposal by the european commission seems to be the more reasonable solution to try to avoid conflicts of interest firms that audit companies are less likely to issue adverse qualified opinions on them since those companies were simply following the firms own consulting advice which seems to be the heart of the problem even though the sox nearly eliminated that but if the audit business was effectively separated from accounting firms other practices and audit only companies sprung up then other problems would arise audit only firms would still be unwilling to piss major clients off by issuing qualified opinions and lose future business also since the audit business is not really the present firms money maker costs to audit would only increase to ensure that audit only firms are profitable

would you expect your parents to charge you interest if you borrowed from them yes if they said so when the money was borrowed   no if there were no terms communicated when the money was borrowed expectations need to be clearly laid out up front what is your advice i think you are asking the wrong question of whether or not you should charge interest   the real issue is that you are concerned about the borrowing which are really turning out to be gifts the money amounts are not the issue as much as the lack of responsibility   going back to your children and asking for interest will not fix this issue   this is my advice this is a difficult process and may not go over well with your children remember that this is not hurting them you are actually hurting them more by allowing them to put off developing good habits independence and maturity   it is hard to see someone make choices that hurt themselves and others but you can not prevent them from making that choice if they never feel the results of that choice they will lack the motivation to change

i 'll start by saying that if this is being explored to scratch a specific itch you have then great if this was a cold call it 's probably safe to ignore it certain whole life products they vary in quality by carrier can make sense for very high earners who are looking for additional tax preferred places to store money   so after you ira 401(k etc options are maxed out but you still have income you 'd like to hide from taxes whole life can be a potential vehicle because gains and death benefit are generally exempt from income taxes   be on the look out for loads charged to your money as it comes in to the policy   life insurance in general is meant to keep your dependents going without having to sell off assets in the event of your death   people may plan for things like school tuition mortgage property tax for your spouse   if you own a business with a couple of partners it 's somewhat common for the partners to buy policies on each other to buyout a spouse to avoid potential operating conflicts   sometimes there can be estate planning issues if you 're looking to transfer assets when you ultimately pass it can make sense to form a trust and load cash in to a whole life policy because death benefits can be shielded from income tax and the estate tax calculation the current estate tax exemption is about $ 5.5 million today judging from your numbers you might actually be close to that including the net value of the homes   obviously though the tax rules are subject to change and you need to be deliberate in your formation of the trust in order to effectively navigate estate tax issues   you seem to have a very solid financial position from this perspective it looks like your spouse would be in good shape    if you are specifically attempting to manage potential estate tax liability you should probably involve an financial planner with experience forming and managing trusts and you should be very involved with the process because it will absolutely make your finances more complicated

the deadline for roth conversions is december 31st   more precisely roth conversions are considered to have happened in the tax year the distribution was taken this creates a kind of loop hole for people who do an ira rollover not a trustee to trustee transfer technically you can take money out of your traditional ira on december 31st and hold it for 60 days before deciding to roll it over into either another traditional ira or a roth ira if you decide to put it in another traditional account it is not a taxable event   but if you decide to put it in a roth account the conversion is considered to have happened in december unfortunately non trustee rollovers are tricky for one the source trustee will probably take withholding that you will have to make up with non ira funds and rollovers are to a certain number per year also if you miss the 60-day deadline you will have to pay an early withdrawal penalty with some exceptions if you really want to push the envelope you could try to do this with a 60-day rule extension but i would n't try it source oddly basically reverse roth conversions have a deadline of october 15th of the year after the original roth conversion it is reversing so you could do the conversion in december then you have up to 10 months to change your mind and undo the conversion with a recharacterization again this is tricky business at the very least you should be aware that the tax calculations for recharacterization are different if you convert the funds into a new empty roth account vs an existing roth account with a previous balance honestly if you want to get into the recharacterization business you can probably save more on taxes by converting in january before stock market climb rather than simply converting in the year your tax brackets are low that is the typical recharacterization strategy source

sales tax and luxury tax is what you will have to pay tax wise and they are non refundable in most cases but the rules vary area to area   this really tripped up some friends of mine i had come from england   the rules are complicated and regional   sales tax is anywhere from 0 to and are not usually applied to raw foods   luxury taxes are usually state level and only apply to things most people consider a large purchase jewelry cars houses etc not things your likely to buy small normal jewelry usually does n't count diamond covered clock probably has a luxury tax for sales tax it can change a lot do n't be afraid to ask people ask all the time it 's normal i personally add 10 to what i buy sales tax in my city is 7 county is 6.5 state is 6 so you can get different rates depending on what side of the street you shop on some times   under normal circumstances you do not get a refund on these taxes some states do give refunds usually however the trouble of getting that refund is n't worth it unless making a large purchase   you are not exempt from paying sales tax depending on where you go you may get asked business are exempt if they are purchasing things to re sell only the end customer pays sales tax   depending on where you go online purchases may not be subject to sales tax though they might that again depends on city county and state laws normally you will have to pay sales tax at the register it will be calculated into your total and show as a line item on your receipt also some products have other non refundable taxes rental car taxes fuel taxes and road taxes are all likely taxes you will have to pay   areas that have a lot of tourists usually but not always have more of these kinds of taxes   friendly note don't buy dvds here they wo n't work when you get home i know you did n't ask but this catches a lot of people same for electronics in many cases specially optical drives and wireless

aside from employer 401(k matches which may double your money immediately paying off debts is almost always the best place to start paying off a debt early is a zero risk operation and will earn you n% where n is your interest rate is that a good deal for a zero risk return the closest equivalent today aug 24 2012 is that you can earn about on 10-year treasury bonds unless you have a really really good interest rate or the interest is tax deductible paying off your loan will offer an excellent risk adjusted return so you should do that the really good interest rate is typically a mortgage or student loans mortgage interest is also tax deductible at least for now in those cases you 're not going to gain nearly as much by paying the loan early and the loan is large larger than the amount you want to have in risk free investments you want to invest for returns as well so you can save for retirement instead in a 401(k or similar account and take on a little risk

if you have 100 of your money in one security that is inherently more risky than splitting your money 50/50 between two securities regardless of the purported riskiness of the two securities the calculations people use to justify their particular breed of diversification may carry some assumptions related risk reward calculations   but these particular do n't change the fact that spreading your money across different assets protects your money from value variances of the individual assets   splitting your $ 100 between apple and microsoft stock is probably less valuable less well diversified than splitting your money between apple and whole foods stock but either way you 're carrying less risk than putting all $ 100 in to apple stock regardless of the assumed rates of return for any of these companies stock specifically edit i 'm sure the downvotes are because i did n't make a big deal about correlation and measuring correlation and standard deviations of returns and detailed portfolio theory   measuring efficacy and justifying your particular allocations that generally uses data from the past to project the future is all well and good   fact of the matter is if you have 100 of your money in stock that 's more stock risk than 25 in cash 25 in bonds and 50 in stock would be because now you 're in different asset classes   you can measure to your hearts delight the effects of splitting your money between different specific companies or different industries or different market or different countries or different fund managers or different whatever metrics and doing any of those things will reduce your exposure to those specific allocations    it may be worth pointing out that currently the hot recommendation is a plain vanilla market tracking s&p 500 index fund that just buys some of each of the 500 largest us companies without any consideration given to risk correlation over standard deviation calculating actively managed funds   if you ask me that speaks volumes of the true efficacy of hyper analyzing the purported correlations of various securities

only you can decide whether it 's wise or not given your own personal circumstances brexit is certainly a big risk and noone can really know what will happen yet the specific worries you mention are certainly valid additionally you might find it hard to keep your job or get a new one if the economy turns bad and in an extreme no deal scenario you might find yourself forced to leave though i think that 's very unlikely house prices could also collapse leaving you in negative equity if you 're planning on staying in the same location in the uk for a long time a house tends to be a worthwhile investment particularly as you always need somewhere to live so owning it is a hedge against prices rising even if prices do fall you do still have somewhere to live if you 're planning on going back to your home country at some point that reduces the value of owning a house if you want to reduce your risk consider getting a mortgage with a long term fixed rate there are some available for 10 years which i 'd hope would be enough to get us over most of the brexit volatility

bank have their own capital deposits from depositors and lend money to borrowers    in a liquidity problem it is typically that either the borrowers are taking time to repay they are not yet or there is more pressure on withdrawals from depositors or there is a short term of mismatch between deposits and loans in all these valid scenarios fed does lend out the banks to met these short terms obligations    banks fail when the losses are actually booked in comparison to the overall capital or loss would materialize for example the mortgage crisis in us meant that quite a few banks the actual loss had materialized or would have any ways materialized in such situations the short term leading does not help and they would burn it out anyways as the borrowers are not paying back any time soon
