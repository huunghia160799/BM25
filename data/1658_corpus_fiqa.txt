it appears as others have said that companies are not required to state this on as any sort of asset i remembered a friend of mine is a lawyer specializing in intellectual property rights so asked him and confirmed that there 's no document companies are required to file which states all patent holdings as assets there are two ways he suggested for finding out once you find a company you 're interested in can search patents by company using one of the two following us patent office website 's advanced search company for example entering into the google without the quotation marks will find patents by google the other is a google patent search

sec filings do not contain this information generally you can find intangible assets on balance sheets but not as detailed as writing down every asset separately only aggregated at some level may be as detailed as specifying patents as a separate line although even that i would n't count on companies may hold different rights to different patents in different countries patents are being granted and expired constantly and unless this is a pharma industry or a startup each single patent does n't have a critical bearing on the company performance

nuclear plants + nuclear fuel rod storage facilities together take up a lot of space    also to go back to one of your earlier points i tried looking up the comparison in mining between nuclear and solar panels but could n't find anything however i think they are similar not one being more or less than the other the processes are not too dissimilar you have to get what you 're mining for then wash it down and it with chemicals but if you saw the amount of land that was displaced to get one piece of uranium that would n't even make up an entire fuel rod you might not think solar had the heavier mining load besides solar generates electricity while the fuel rods have a set amount of energy so solar will end up paying for itself rather than having to mine for more of a radioactive element once your fuel rods are spent    not sure i explained that last part too well but solar starts at 0 and goes to infinity in terms of how much electricity is generated while nuclear fuel rods start at 100 and go down to 0 so i think solar is the better bet   edit i also agree that energy is really hard to solve every source has their drawbacks unfortunately except cold fusion lol

as other 's have said paying off the student loan first makes the most sense because of that said are you planning on staying in your house for a particularly long time   if so refinancing your mortgage into a fixed rate loan might be the best use of your money long term   not sure how much time is left on your arm before the rate starts to float but if rates rise your mortgage could quickly become more expensive than your student loan

the technical answer is defined by the laws of state you live in but most all states with a sales tax have some form of use tax where if you buy something in another state for use in your home state you are technically liable for sales tax on it regardless of whether the merchant charged you tax on it or not i do n't think many people actually pay the use taxes and enforcement generally seems rare

this does nt happen in germany why labor gets half the board seats   when corps cut everyone gets cuts everyone shares the pain when corps do well everyone does better they do nt chop up a corp and sell it off for parts they do nt send all the jobs to china    this is also how you get things like this   how germany builds twice as many cars as the u.s. while paying its workers twice as sites builds twice as many cars as the u s while paying its auto workers twice as   just remember it is the unions keeping american from and yet they get paid less than their german counterparts that live in an economy the fraction of our size    if you look at gdp per person we are 6th on the planet and germany wiki    what does all this mean everyone is getting part of the economic growth and the meme that the right go off on that unions are destroying business in the us is bs we have a much richer country than germany we should be paying our workers even more than them we can afford to they sure as shit can afford to with less money per person to go

i remember seeing a post forever ago about how millionaires are nt investing and someone a millionaire themselves claimed it was because of the current economic political climate made them unsure which then this other person assuming a millionaire to come in and respond to them talking about how trump was going to cut taxes concerns over student loan defaults were overblown etc etc basically saying to invest because it 's going to be alright   none the less that stuck with me for some reason so it 's interesting to see how it 's all going to turn out because it 's clear the millionaires are n't unified on what the future has in store and i take that more as a sign for troubled waters ahead than anything else

probably the best way to investigate this is to look at an example first as the commenters above have already said the log return from one period is at time t price at time which is approximately equal to the percentage change in the price from time to time t provided that this percentage change is not big compared to the size of the price note that you have to use the natural log ie log to the base e button on a calculator here the main use of the log return is that is a proxy for the percentage change in the price which turns out to be mathematically convenient for various reasons which have mostly already been mentioned in the comments but you already know this your actual question is about the average log return over a period of time what does this indicate about the stock the answer is if the stock price is not changing very much then the average log return is about equal to the average percentage change in the price and is very easy and quick to calculate but if the stock price is very volatile then the average log return can be wildly different to the average percentage change in the price here is an example the closing prices for pitchfork oil from last week 's trading are 10 5 12 5 10 2 15 the percentage changes are 1.4 1 6.5 where means -50 etc the average percentage change is or on the other hand the log returns for the same period are 2 and the average log return is about if we used this as a proxy for the average percentage change in the price over the whole seven days we would get 6.8 instead of which is wildly wrong the reason why it is wrong is because the price fluctuated so much on the other hand the closing prices for united marshmallow over the same period are 10 11 12 11 12 13 15 the average percentage change from day to day is and the average log return is so in this case the log return is very close to the percentage change and it has the advantage of being from just the first and last prices because the properties of imply that it simplifies to notice that this is exactly the same as for pitchfork oil so one reason why you might be interested in the average log return is that it gives a very quick way to estimate the average return if the stock price is not changing very much another more subtle reason is that it actually behaves better than the percentage return when the price of pitchfork jumps from 5 to 12 and then crashes back to 5 again the percentage changes are + 140 and for an average of + 82 that sounds good but if you had bought it at 5 and then sold it at 5 you would actually have made 0 on your money the log returns for the same period do not have this disturbing property because they do add up to 0   what 's the real difference in this example well if you had bought $ 1 worth of pitchfork on tuesday when it was 5 and sold it on wednesday when it was 12 you would have made a profit of $ 1.40 if you had then bought another $ 1 on wednesday and sold it on thursday you would have made a loss of $ overall your profit would have been $ this is what the average percentage return is calculating on the other hand if you had been a long term investor who had bought on tuesday and hung on until thursday then quoting an average return of 82 is highly misleading because it in no way corresponds to the return of 0 which you actually got   the moral is that it may be better to look at the log returns if you are a buy and hold type of investor because log returns cancel out when prices fluctuate whereas percentage changes in price do not but the flip side of this is that your average log return over a period of time does not give you much information about what the prices have been doing since it is just price of periods since it is so easy to calculate from the initial and final prices themselves you commonly wo n't see it in the financial pages as far as i know   finally to answer your question does knowing this single piece of information indicate something about the stock i would say not really from the point of view of this one indicator pitchfork oil and united marshmallow look like identical investments when they are clearly not knowing the average log return is exactly the same as knowing the ratio between the final and initial prices

keep in mind that all of the information below assumes that being said here are some examples of national tax laws relating to barter transactions obviously this is n't an exhaustive list but based on my grossly non representative sample i think it 's fairly safe to assume that barter transactions are more likely taxable than not   you 're referring to a barter system in the united states the irs is very specific about this see the section titled bartering   bartering is an exchange of property or services the fair market    value of goods and services exchanged is fully taxable and must be    included on form 1040 in the income of both parties the irs also provides more details bartering occurs when you exchange goods or services without    exchanging money an example of bartering is a plumber doing repair    work for a dentist in exchange for dental services you must include    in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods    and services received in exchange for goods or services you provide or    may provide under the bartering arrangement generally you report this income on form 1040 schedule c pdf    profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez pdf net    profit from business if you failed to report this income correct    your return by filing a form 1040x pdf refer to topic for    amended return information so yes the net value of goods or services is most likely taxable according to the australian tax office barter transactions are and deductible for income tax    purposes to the same extent as other cash or credit transactions her 's revenue and customs states that if you supply services or goods new or second hand and receive other    goods or services in payment there are two separate supplies you must account for vat and so must your customer if they 're    vat registered the vat treatment is the same as for part exchanges    you must both account for vat on the amounts you would each have paid    for the goods or services if there had been no barter and they had    been paid for with money searching the website of the federal tax service for the russian word for barter does n't yield any results but that might be because even between google translate and the rest of the internet i do n't speak russian that being said i did manage to find this translated from the first full paragraph of the russian beginning with на the tax on personal income is paid by citizens of the russian    federation with all types of income received by them in the calendar    year either in cash or in kind since bartering would probably qualify as an in kind transaction it would likely be taxable   the south african revenue service includes barter transactions in the supply of goods taxed under the vat   the term supply is defined very broadly and includes all forms of    supply and any derivative of the term irrespective of where the    supply is effected the term includes performance in terms of a sale    rental agreement instalment credit agreement or barter transaction look for section 3.6 supply and taxable supply found on of the current version of the linked document

i suppose this could really depend on the part of the world you 're in but there are still many instances of emergencies that need cash you have to decide how much cash is the right amount but i still recommend having $ 1,000 or so in liquid cash it can really make a huge difference let me give a few examples   bad weather i live in florida and after a hurricane if you want gas food or water you 're going to need cash atm networks are the last to get repaired same for internet cell services are not at the top of the list you could be 4 5 days without access to your accounts if you need anything in that time frame it 's cash or the red cross children as a foster parent we keep some cash on hand because as kids come in to our care we want to get them in school right away how are they going to eat you ca n't give them your plastic you have n't had time to setup lunch accounts or the like cash always works along those same lines are bus tickets clothes supplies and what not not everywhere will take an atm card and if your money is tied up in a stock then what are you supposed to do for 3 days tell your new kid that he ca n't eat big emergency problems like your car breaks down on the interstate sure it can get to the dealership and yes they will add the tow to your bill and sure you have a few days to pay it while your car gets fixed but how are you going to get around not all taxis take plastic around here   almost none of the busses take plastic even though they are supposed to lost wallet or id theft lose your wallet good luck getting into your bank accounts it can take weeks to establish your id after you lose it in some cases you want your id but you need your birth certificate you have to go to the state of birth and request it oh but wait to travel you need an id no problem send away for it but wait you need to send them money to mail it to bad all your money is tied up   running or so you need to for some reason no big deal but all your money is in a place you ca n't get to it how do you put gas in your car lets stick with it and say you get to cash out an account of some kind guess what they 're not going to mail it to some random address now you 're stuck fighting support centers to get them to understand that you need your funds delivered to new york even though you live in florida   in short you do n't need $ 100,000 in liquid funds but there are a few cases that you need something liquid you also make a lot of assumptions for example not every one will have health insurance or a heath problem that is covered by their insurance some serious home repairs are down payment upfront car problems like an accident that means you need a rental can totally be up front especially if credit cards ca n't be used

i am in a different situation because i earn more than i spend but i have found that i need to make the money inaccessible if i want to really avoid spending it   i used to just throw my paychecks into a high yield savings account but eventually the balance was large enough that a large purchase did n't seem like that much because i would have had so much left in the account after the purchase   it was way too easy for me to spend way too much now i invest my savings automatically   the obvious benefit is my money has a much higher growth rate than a simple savings account especially with fed interest rates so low   i invest most of my savings in retirement accounts where there are severe penalties for withdrawing prior to retirement age   then i invest a significant portion to a regular brokerage account where the money is invested in stock and bond funds   this money is accessible within a few days of whenever i need it   the remainder of my savings goes into a savings account as cash i can get to at any time   all 3 accounts grow with every paycheck market fluctuations aside    this system helps me to categorize my savings as never ever touch retirement accounts touch only if i can wait 3 days and am willing to pay taxes brokerage account or touch whenever you need it with no penalties savings account   if my savings account grows too much i 'll move money from there to the brokerage account where it has more growth potential   the longer my money is invested in the brokerage accounts the less taxes i 'll need to pay when i sell withdraw the funds so that 's even more incentive for me to keep those funds where they are i have credit cards so in my opinion having to wait 3 days for funds from my investment account to become accessible is considered accessible in an emergency because my credit cards can be used to cover a large purchase for 3 days and as long as i pay it off within the grace period there 's no interest charged tl;dr investing is probably the smartest way to both grow your money and prevent the urge to spend it right away   my advice is to start with a 401(k or ira as soon as you can since the younger you are the more time until retirement that your money has to compound   investing $ 100 more a month can mean hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in your account when you 're ready to retire

var does not capture overall risk it allows you to say a statement based on our model of the time losses will not exceed x.   the problem is    1 how accurate is the statement out of sample   2 what is the marginal value of this number are the choices i make better or worse   3 even with a confidence level what is the cost to the organization if a decision is made when the model is wrong   personally when running multiple strategies you always need to factor in model risk in your asset allocation trading i.e. either shut down or reduce exposure when assumptions are violated or run something else for example when correlations between strategies increases it is logical to downsize exposure to those strategies as the risk factor to equity has increased   1 in the grand context of a bank financial institution if the var is wrong we can bankrupt or negative so we may want to diversify revenue streams by avoiding that risk for example correlations increase across asset classes   2 sizing is a key problem for banks as the question is does model error across various platforms fi eq transactions etc happen at the same time

gt home solar does n't need to completely replace grid power a 70 reduction in demand would be sufficient to reduce generation requirements to only existing hydro wind nuclear plants   that is exactly where the problem is when your home solar and battery is out of power then your grid without traditional backup is out of power as well so in the end you need your grid to supply power in the 30 of time when your renewable plus some storage has none at the same time all household equipped like yours are out of power as well so either the grid power company has conventional backup or huge storage of course the cost of these must be levied over the 30 of time they are used not economically attractive   so you expect as a household to be able to just get energy from the grid power company when it is necessary for you as a backup are you ready to pay the triple rate during that time

most of the recommendations are just total market allocations   within domestic stocks the performance sometimes large cap outperform sometimes small cap outperform you can see the chart here examine year by year   conventional wisdom is to buy the entire market if large cap currently make up 80 of the market you would allocate 80 of domestic stocks to large cap   same case with international stocks developed if japan and uk make up the largest market internationally then so be it   similar case with domestic bonds it is usually total bond market allocation in the beginning   then there is the question of when you want to withdraw the money if you are withdrawing in a couple years you do not want to expose too much to currency risks thus you would allocate less to international markets if you are investing for retirement you will get the total world market   then there is the question of risk tolerance bonds are somewhat negatively correlated with stocks when stock dips by 5 in a month bonds might go up by 2 under normal circumstances they both go upward bond stock allocation ratio is by age i ’m sure you knew that already   then there is the case of modern portfolio theory there will be slight adjustments to the etf weights if it is found that adjusting them would give a smaller portfolio variance while sacrificing small gains you can try it yourself using excel solver   there is a strategy called sector rotation google it and you will find examples of the winners periodically it is difficult to time the rotation but healthcare has somehow consistently outperformed nonetheless those recommendations you mentioned are likely to be market allocations again   the robo advisors list out every asset allocation in detail to make you feel overwhelmed and resort to using their service in extreme cases they can even break down the holdings to digit standard industrial classification codes or break down the bond duration etc   some robo advisors would suggest you as many etf as possible to increase trade commissions if it is n’t commission free for example suggesting you to buy vb instead a vti

there is not a special rate for short term capital gains   only long term gains have a special rate   short term gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate see here   hence if you 're in the 25 bracket your short term gain would be taxed at 25   the ira withdrawal as you already mentioned would be taxed at 25 plus a 10 penalty for 35 total   thus the bite on the ira withdrawal is larger than that on a non ira withdrawal as for the estimated tax issue i do n't think there will be a significant difference there   the reason is that traditional ira withdrawals count as ordinary taxable income see here   this means that when you withdraw the funds from your ira you will increase your income   if that increase pushes you too far beyond what your withholding is accounting for then you owe estimated tax   in other words whether you get the money by selling stocks in a taxable account or by withdrawing them from an ira you still increase your taxable income and thus potentially expose yourself to the estimated tax obligation in fact there may be a difference   as you note you will pay tax at the capital gains rate on gains from selling in a taxable account   but if you sell the stocks inside the ira and withdraw that is ordinary income   however since ordinary income is taxed at a higher rate than long term capital gains you will potentially pay more tax on the ira withdrawal since it will be taxed at the higher rate if your gains are long term rather than short term   this is doubly true if you withdraw early incurring the extra 10 penalty   see this question for some more discussion of this issue in addition i think you may be somewhat misunderstanding the nature of estimated tax   the irs will not ask you for a quarterly estimated tax when you sell stock   the irs does not monitor your activity and send you a bill each quarter   they may indeed check whether your reported income with info they received from your bank etc but they 'll still do that regardless of whether you got that income by selling in a taxable account or withdrawing money from an ira because both of those increase your taxable income quarterly estimated tax is not an extra tax it is just you paying your normal income tax over the course of the year instead of all at once   if your withholdings will not cover enough of your tax liability you must figure that out yourself and pay the estimated tax see here if you do n't do so you may be assessed a penalty   it does n't matter how you got the money if your taxable income is too high relative to your withheld tax then you have to pay the estimated tax   typically tax will be withheld from your ira distribution but if it 's not withheld you 'll still owe it as estimated tax

this is more clearly defined in the eitc for purposes of the earned income tax credit then no it is not earned income   see publication page 18 specifically scholarship or fellowship grants not reported on a form a scholarship or fellowship grant that was n't reported to you on a form w-2 is n't considered earned income for the earned income credit further form describes unearned income and explicitly includes scholarships again not on for form unearned income includes all taxable    income other than earned income as defined later    unearned income includes taxable interest ordinary    dividends capital gains including capital gain    distributions rents royalties etc it also includes taxable    social security benefits pension and annuity income    taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on    form w-2 unemployment compensation alimony and    income other than earned income received as the    beneficiary of a trust so unless it was reported on a w-2 i.e. it 's for some sort of employment it 's not considered earned income   h t for that link the definition on the instructions of form is not particularly different though it 's more general earned income includes wages tips and other amounts received for personal services performed   scholarships do n't seem to fit any more into that so i would say they do not

setting aside for the moment the very relevant issue of whether you need the full amount quickly i 'll just tackle comparing which option gives you to maximum amount of money in terms of real dollars the trick is unless you think inflation will suddenly reverse itself or stop entirely not likely $ 50 k today is worth a lot more than $ 50 k in 20 years if you do n't believe me consider that just 30 years ago the average price for a mid level new car was around $ 3k when you grandfather says he got a burger for a nickel he is n't talking about 2010 dollars   so how do you account for this well the way financial people and project managers do it to estimate how much to pay today for $ 1 at some point in the future is through a net present value npv calculation you can find a calculator here in your question you gave some numbers for the payout but not the lump sum prize amount going solely on what you have provided i calculate that you should take the lump sum if it is greater than $ which is the net present value of 20 years of $ 50 k payments assuming 3 annual inflation which is fairly a fairly reasonable number given history however if you think the out of control gov't spending is going to send inflation through the roof possible but not a given then you almost certainly would want the lump sum i suppose in that scenario you might want the lump sum anyway because if the govt starts on their obligations doing it to a small number of lottery winners might be politically more popular than cutting other programs that affect a large number of voters

you can evaluate portfolio raw returns or risk adjusted returns to evaluate raw returns i would personally compute the total returns over the time period in question for both portfolios   to compute total returns split the time into a bunch of by the dates at which you contributed money   compute each return by dividing the value of the portfolio at the end of the but before adding additional cash on that day by the value at the beginning of the after adding cash on that day   then multiply all these returns together   finally subtract 1   that 's your total return for the portfolio where you did n't add any money it 's easy just divide the end value by the beginning and subtract 1 whichever has a higher return performed better to compute risk adjusted returns get the portfolio returns from both portfolios daily or monthly and use to regress on a benchmark portfolio return something like the s&p500   the intercept of the regression is a measure of the risk adjusted of your portfolio   higher the better   more sophisticated models will do multiple regression using a few benchmark portfolios at the same time

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

for those who do n't know credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you   when you fill them out and spend them you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account   you should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions that having been said when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds   they want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored   if your teller does n't know the answer to that question you 'll need to find someone at the bank who does   if you do n't like the answer they give you you 'll need to find another bank i would think that if the credit card is from chase and you are trying to deposit a credit card check into a chase checking account they should be able to do that instantly   however bank policy does n't always make sense

in addition to alex b 's excellent overview i 'd like to add a few more bits of advice first of all one term you should know is commercial real estate which is precisely what this is there is a business element but it is strictly and almost entirely intertwined to the underlying real estate which makes this a special category of business which is generally considered simply commercial real estate just like office buildings shopping malls etc all real estate and businesses value are based on alternatives what other options are there in appraisal these are generally called comparables a professional appraiser is generally available for commercial real estate of this type while a full official commercial appraisal can run into the thousands many most all appraisers are willing to sell you a simplified version of their service which can be called a letter of opinion and can help you get an idea for the market price what other similar commercial properties are running for a loan company would strictly require this but if you are thinking of an all cash or form of seller financing this would technically be optional your best bet is to read about some of what is involved in commercial real estate appraisal and evaluation and you may even want to speak with commercial loan officers even if you do n't know that you want to get a loan to acquire the property it 's their job to help inform you about what is required and what they look for so they can be a potential resource beyond your own research as well with this said the only way to estimate value and conveniently the best way is to look at other properties and by others i mean that you should really not consider buying absolutely anything until you 've viewed at least 6 10 other options in some depth and you probably want to double or triple that number if you are looking to make this the last big business transaction of your life if you do n't you 'll be relying on little more than dumb luck to carry you through which in this area of business you do n't want to do because the dollar amounts and liabilities involved can bankrupt you in no time flat with that general advice out of the way here 's a tiny nutshell version of valuation of commercial real estate there are a few key parts involved in commercial real estate land improvements buildings stuff like that income and wages   land the value of the land is based upon what you could sell it for as is that is to say who else might want it this alone has many important factors such as zoning laws the neighborhood including your neighbors water utilities on the land someone may have insisted the land not be paved into a parking lot or really anything like that alternative uses could you put a golf course on it or is the land suitable for a big building or farming etc and is this in a growing area where you might hope the value will increase over the next decade or decrease or basically stay flat and possibly cause losses compared to inflation improvements anything on the land is both an asset and a liability it 's an asset because it could add to the value of the land but it might also reduce the land value if it with alternate land uses it 's a liability both in the legal sense and in that it requires maintenance if you want to rent them out especially that means concern about any foundations involved roofs sewage tanks utilities that are your responsibility pipes poles wires as well as any sort of ac heating you may have and so on these things are rarely free and absolutely can eat you alive income ah the best part the constant influx of cash but wait is it a constant influx some businesses are purely seasonal summer only winter only some are year round but have peak times and others do n't really have a peak to speak of if you are renting are there issues collecting or with people over staying how about damage making a mess getting and disturbing others regardless there is obviously some income and this is usually the most dangerous part of the equation i say dangerous because people absolutely lie like dogs on this part all the time it 's easy to cook the books assuming they even attempt to keep proper books in the first place businesses of this form often have a lot of cash business that 's easy to hide from uncle sam or sometimes even the owners themselves if there are employees involved and fake and some people are just shoddy and the info is just wrong but there will clearly be some kind of yearly income involved what does this matter well how much is there how much is tied to the owners personal friends do business and they will leave if the ownership management changes in commercial real estate the income will be calculated for a fiscal year and then there is something called a multiple which is market dependent let 's say the whole place takes in $ 100k in rent a year as part of buying this business you are buying not just assets but expected future income in some commercial areas the multiple is as little as .5 to 2 which means that the going rate is about 6 24 months worth of income as part of the purchase price so with 100k rent a year that means of the purchase price is attributable to the income of the business and if business is half of what you thought it would be that means the net value of the whole enterprise decreases by on top of the reduced income every year you own it income provides cash flow which should pay all the expenses cleaning up from wind storms replacing windows that are broken hauling off trash replacing a well that ran dry and then the extra that remains is positive cash flow if you take out a loan then ideally the cash flow would also pay that completely so long as you do n't have any big unexpected expenses in the year and still have some left over for yourself wages well that money does n't collect itself there 's sales keeping the books collecting the rent performing maintenance customer service cleaning paying the bills keeping the insurance people happy handling emergencies and everything else involved with running the business someone is going to do it and the biggest error people make here is not to put any value on their time and to make it so they can never afford to take a vacation again pay yourself and give yourself the flexibility to pay others when you ca n't or do n't want to do it all yourselves so what 's the point of all this how do you actually make any money in two ways 1 selling the whole thing later and 2 cash flow for 1 it 's important that you not be in a situation where you are betting that in the future there will be a person richer and dumber than i am now if the current owner wanted 2 million then 1 mil then less over multiple years this suggests either he is delusional about the value of his place and most property owners are or that its actually hard to find a buyer for such a business you are going to want to make sure you understand why that is because most of the value of real estate is well in the real estate itself for 2 you need cash coming in that 's considerably more than the cost of running the place also cash flow can strongly change the value of the business for resale depending on the multiple this can make a huge difference or prevent you from selling the thing at all   you mentioned you want to put in more cabins more marketing sales efforts etc that 's great but first that would mean added investment beyond the purchase price is it legally and physically practical to add more cabins and what is their current utilization rate if they are only renting 10 of their current capacity increasing capacity may be premature this will also vary through the year so you may find there is a problem with being sold out sometimes but only for a small percentage of the time which means you 'll be adding buildings only to have them used for a fraction of the year which will be very hard to make a profit from if cash flow is good ideally even being enough to cover a loan payment to help cover the purchase price and remember that commercial real estate loans are much smaller loan to value ratios than in residential real estate there is one final barrier to making money the damn non regular maintenance roofs wells and wooden walls all have a sad tendency to cost you nothing right up until the point they cost you $ on a single day is there enough cash flow to make these sort of and if you plan to be there for years they are a certainty not put you in the poor house this was rather long but i hope this overview helps you appreciate all that you 'll need to look into and be cautious of during your future en commercial real estate is generally costly and high risk but also can be high reward you 'll need to compare many opportunities before you can get a feel for what is a good deal and what is a terrible one you 'll need to consider many factors such as resale value and cash flow income which they will have to tell you and you can assume is not true due to ignorance or malice as well as maintenance and liabilities before you can begin to really estimate the value of an enterprise of this sort there are people who can help you like appraisers and commercial brokers but ultimately you 'll need to do a lot of research and comparisons yourself to help you make a good decision   finally there is no very simple method for evaluating commercial real estate value you need a variety of information and you must be skeptical of what you are told because of the very large sums of money involved it is doable lots of people do it but you must take care and do your due diligence so you do n't get bankrupted by a single bad purchase

the commenters who referred you to the prisoner 's dilemma are exactly correct but i wanted to give a more detailed explanation because i find game theory quite interesting   the prisoner 's dilemma is a classic scenario in game theory where even though it 's in the best interests of two or more players to cooperate they fail to do so wikipedia has a simple example using prisoners but i 'll use a simple example using and charles who are fund managers at fidelity and charles schwab respectively   to make the table shorter i abbreviated a bit inc = increase fees keep = keep fees the same dec = decrease fees here is the dilemma itself in the table that shows the resulting market shares if each fund manager follows the course of action in question   while this example is n't mathematically rigorous because i completely fabricated the numbers it makes a good example the most profitable course of action would be both fund managers agreeing to increase their fees which would keep their market shares the same but increase their profits as they earn more fees however this wo n't happen for several reasons   because economies of scale exist in the market for investment funds it 's reasonable to assume in a simple example that as funds grow larger their costs decrease so even though a fund manager decreases his fees the other players this decrease wo n't be enough to reduce their profits in fact the increased market share resulting from such a decrease may well dominate the decreased fees and lead to higher profits the prisoner 's dilemma is highly applicable to markets such as these because they exist as oligopolies i.e. markets where a relatively small number of established sellers possess considerable market power if you actually wanted to model the market for donor advised funds using game theory you need to take a few more things into account obviously there are more than two firms it 's probably a valid assumption that the market is an oligopoly with significant economies of scale but i have n't researched this extensively   there is more than one time period so some form of the prisoner 's dilemma is needed the market for donor advised funds is also complicated by the fact that these are philanthropic funds this may introduce tax implications or the problem of goodwill and institutional opinion of these funds although both funds increasing their fees may increase their profits in theory institutional investors may look on this as a pure profit seeking and take their funds elsewhere for example they may choose to invest in smaller funds with higher fees but better reputations while reputation is important for any company it might make more of a difference when the fund investment vehicle is philanthropic in nature   i am by no means an expert on game theory so i 'm sure there are other nuances to the situation that i 'm unaware of

1 link 2 it does n't matter if they can or do what matters is if they are investing not trading in it more than banks are investing in businesses if that is the case it is then businesses as a whole will see the inflation first and commodities will be playing the entire time but mostly when the investments hit recession   i will invest in the market again after they lose their invested value in historical terms the best time was to invest in them was 1980 1938 and 1900 and the best time to get out was 1929 1960 's and 2000 but to bet against them right now with the dollar is meaningless because the fed is deflating the currency as they go down so it 's like running on a treadmill by holding silver i am essentially short the market only difference is instead of holding a devaluing currency cash i 'm holding a real money which is increasing in value   there 's nothing simpler than investing in commodities for the long term people lose when they are making monthly daily trades in them anyone who bought and held on to gold in 2000 did it for $ 300 and they 've made infinitely more than the majority of people investing in blue chips because they 've lost value and much more than those who invested in bonds and that trend is n't going to stop unless the government lets the dollar deflate in which case the dollar will come to gold instead of the other way around until they are in equilibrium again historically the dow has an average of being 2 ounces of gold peaking at 50 and at .5 if it hits .5 again like it has everytime this occurs in the past then either gold will be $ 20000 or the dow will be 4000 you pick

simplest way to answer this is that on margin one is using borrowed assets and thus there are strings that come with doing that thus if the amount of equity left gets too low the broker has a legal obligation to close the position which can be selling purchased shares or buying back borrowed shares depending on if this is a long or short position respectively investopedia has an example that they walk through as the call is where you are asked to either put in more money to the account or the position may be closed because the broker wants their money back what is maintenance margin a maintenance margin is the required    amount of securities an investor must hold in his account if he either    purchases shares on margin or if he sells shares short if an    investor 's margin balance falls below the set maintenance margin the    investor would then need to contribute additional funds to the account    or liquidate stocks in the account to bring the account back to the    initial margin requirement this request is known as a margin call as discussed previously the federal reserve board sets the initial    margin requirement currently at 50 the federal reserve board also    sets the maintenance margin the maintenance margin the amount of    equity an investor needs to hold in his account if he buys stock on    margin or sells shares short is 25 keep in mind however that this    25 level is the minimum level set brokerage firms can increase but    not decrease this level as they desire example determining when a margin call would occur assume that an    investor had purchased 500 shares of 's stock the shares were    trading at $ 50 when the transaction was executed the initial margin    requirement on the account was 70 and the maintenance margin is 30    assume no transaction costs determine the price at which the investor    will receive a margin call answer calculate the price as follows $ 50 1- = $ 1 0.30 a margin call would be received when the price of 's stock fell    below $ per share at that time the investor would either need    to deposit additional funds or liquidate shares to satisfy the initial    margin requirement most people do n't want margin calls but stocks may move in unexpected ways and this is where there are mechanisms to limit losses especially for the brokerage firm that wants to make as much money as possible cancel what trade no the broker will close the position if the requirement is n't kept basically think of this as a way for the broker to get their money back if necessary while following federal rules this would be selling in a long position or buying in a short sale situation the margin investor walks through an example where an e mail would be sent and if the requirement is n't met then the position gets exited as per the law

a few thoughts you said   to me it makes sense that if he accidentally put his own money in when he was n't supposed to he could just take it out and pay the tax on it and be fine in this case he would be putting his own after tax money in and would n't be able to deduct it so the act of putting it in and taking it back out in the same tax year would be as if the transaction never occurred at all he would not have to pay the tax on it as for this question is there any penalty to his employer if they contribute to an hsa on his behalf knowing that he is not eligible and that the money will be an excess contribution it 's good that your son is prepared to treat it as regular income and pay the appropriate taxes however the employer should be the one doing that they should be treating it as regular income and taking out fica and paying their end of fica too if they are n't doing that technically they are breaking the law the employer really should n't be making the contributions at all and if they ever bothered to correct this this article suggests that the employer may be legally allowed to drain the hsa account and take their money back out of it but only for the same tax year apparently they can do this without your son 's consent if that 's true it may make sense to withdraw all money from that account immediately as soon as the money arrives since they can not take the money back if it is no longer there once the money leaves the hsa account the employer has no choice but to change it to income and if they do n't your son must declare it as such which it sounds like he is prepared to do this does n't really answer your question of whether or not the employer can be i would assume yes but not too badly the worst case scenario for them would probably be just having to pay all the back fica on those funds if they are n't doing so already maybe an interest penalty as well all that being said i 'd recommend talking to an accountant the most important thing you want to be sure of is that your son can not possibly be liable for any wrongdoing particularly i would get confirmation on pulling money out of the hsa that you know should n't be there in the first place just to make sure there is no possible way to get dinged for that

it makes sense for a lot of people it 's basically weather insurance it 's useful for farmers bad weather ruining a harvest airlines abnormally high amount of increasing cost of delayed flights hotels rain making people visit less ski resorts not enough snow and other businesses that can be negatively impacted by extreme weather variations   if they systematically slightly overpay for this protection the speculator can make money on net helping these businesses reduce the volatility of their cashflows which is important because they need to pay their overhead costs every year   edit the derivatives themselves also allows the people selling weather insurance to hedge their exposure on the market

paying off your loan in full will most likely not help your credit score and could potentially even hurt it because car loans are installment loans and thus differ from consumer credit lenders really only like seeing that you responsibly pay off your loans on time they do n't really care if you pay it off early lenders like seeing open lines of credit as long as you manage them well the hard inquiry will simply lower your credit score a few points for up to two years so from a credit score perspective you 're really not going to help yourself in this scenario although it 's not like you 're going to be plummeting yourself either

look i think the thought process for falsely believing physics knowledge is a requirement to understand examples illustrating a completely different topic is as follows   you do n't understand calculus ode topic the teacher gives an example you still do n't get it therefore you falsely believe that if you had understood the context of the problem you would understand the solution this is twisted and backwards reasoning    let 's say i am learning subtraction if the teacher says wants to make for that he needs 10 if he currently has 6 how many more does he need well kids this is just a subtraction problem 10 6 = 4 it is completely okay who cares what or are if you know great if not you can still understand the subtraction problem

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

how is the business organized if as a general partnership or llc that reports as a partnership you will be getting distributed to you each year your ownership of the earnings or loss but note this is a paperwork transfer on the form k-1 which must then carryover to your tax return it does not require the transfer of cash to you if organized as an s corp you should be holding shares of the company that you may sell back to the s corp generally as outlined in the original articles of incorporation the annual dividend earnings remaining after all expenses are paid should be distributed to you in proportion to the shares you hold if a c corp and there is only one class of stock that you also hold a percentage of the only profits that must be distributed proportionally to you are declared dividends by the board of directors most family run business are loosely formed with not much attention paid to the details of partnership agreements or articles of incorporation and so do n't handle family ownership disputes very well from my experience trying to find an settlement is the best and least expensive approach to separation from the business but if this ca n't be done or there is a sizable value to the business you may have to get your own legal counsel

as mentions you would have to decide what type of properties you would like to invest in are you after negatively geared properties that may have higher long term growth potential usually within 15 to 20 km from major cities or after positive cash flow properties which may have a lower long term growth potential usually located more than 20 km from major cities   with negative geared properties your rent from the property will not cover the mortgage and other costs so you will have to supplement it through your income the theory is that you can claim a tax deduction on your employment income from the negative gearing benefits mainly those on higher tax brackets and the potential long term growth of the property will make up for the negative gearing over the long term   if you are after these type of properties michael has some books on the subject on the other hand positive cash flow properties provide enough rental income to cover the mortgage and other costs they put cash into your pockets each week they do n't have as much growth potential as more inner city properties but if you stick to the outer regions of major cities instead of rural towns you will still achieve decent long term growth if you are after these type of properties margaret has some books on the subject my preference is for cash flow positive properties and some of the areas has mentioned i am personally invested in the and surrounding areas   with negatively geared properties you generally have to supplement the property with your own income and generally have to wait for the property price to increase so you build up equity in the property this then allows you to refinance the additional equity so you can use it as deposits to buy other properties or to supplement your income the problem is if you go through a period of low stagnate or negative growth you may have to wait quite a few years for your equity to increase substantially with positively geared properties you are getting a net income from the property every week so using none of your other income to supplement the property you can thus afford to buy more properties sooner and even if the properties go through a period of low stagnate or negative growth you are still getting extra income each week over the long term these properties will also go up and you will have the benefit of both passive income and capital gains i also agree with regarding doing at least 6 months of research in the area s you are looking to buy visit open homes attend auctions talk to real estate agents and get to know the area this kind of research will beat any information you get from websites books and magazines you will find that when a property comes onto the market you will know what it is worth and how much you can offer below asking price another thing to consider is when to buy most people are buying now in australia because of the record low interest rates below 5 this is causing higher demand in the property markets and prices to rise steadily many people who buy during this period will be able to afford the property when interest rates are at 5 but as the housing market and the economy heat up and interest rates start rising they find it hard to afford the property when interest rate rise to 7 8 or higher i personally prefer to buy when interest rates are on the rise and when they are near their highs during this time no one wants to touch property with a six foot pole but all the owners who bought when interest rates where much lower are finding it hard to keep making repayments so they put their properties on the market there ends up being low demand and increased supply causing prices to fall it is very easy to find bargains and negotiate lower prices during this period because interest rates will be near or at their highs the economy will be starting to slow down so it will not be long before interest rates start dropping again if you can afford to buy a property at 8 you will definitely be able to afford it at 6 or lower plus you would have bought at or near the lows of the price cycle just before prices once again start increasing as interest rates drop read and learn as much as possible from others but in the end make up your own mind on the type of properties and areas you prefer

interest rate swaps are used to transfer risk from one party to another they can be used to transfer many types of risk but most common are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk   there are a few key concepts that i have noticed most people have trouble with which are below   1 the notional amount this is the amount that the two legs the floating and fixed will be based on if you think about each leg as a loan the notional amount would be the principal however in a swap this amount never changes hands rather it is just an amount used to calculate what the dollar amount exchanged should be    2 the floating and fixed legs are the interest rates that will be exchanged the fixed leg will always pay out the same amount no matter the changes in the market while the floating rate will change periodically depending on market conditions as a side note it is often agreed that only the difference in the two rates will be paid rather then sending the money back and forth    3 and finally it is important to note that at the inception of the swap the notional value will always be 0 many people miss this but when you think about it no company would want to sign a deal the from inception puts them in a loosing position    i hope that helped without a more specific question all i can do is list random facts about swaps and hope they are useful to you

close warning i may be off a bit here i 'm sure someone will correct me if so traditional 401k or ira money goes in pre tax so yes you avoid paying tax on it now grows untaxed taxes are due when you retire and start taking money back out of the account but your income including these withdrawals is likely to be lower than your peak earning years so your tax rate will be lower you do n't avoid all the tax but you delay it and hopefully reduce it and by doing so there 's more money in your account earning returns roth 401k or ira money goes in after taxes you do pay income tax now however all returns on the money are untaxed i believe and you pay no tax when you 're eligible to withdraw the funds   either or both kinds of 401k may be eligible for some percentage of matching funds from your employer there are some incentives for them to offer this benefit i believe that even if you 're doing a roth 401k the matching funds legally have to go in as traditional plan and yes as that implies it is possible to split your contribution between the two styles note the matching funds are free money if your plan offers a match it is highly recommended that you contribute enough to your 401k to capture the maximum match

the fee to withdraw cash from an atm using your credit card as opposed to your debit card is akin to the merchant fees paid by any business that accepts your credit card as payment these fees range from around 2.75 of the transaction to upwards of 5 and are charged to the merchant the fees are split among the various vendors that provide the infrastructure to conduct the credit card transaction resulting in the merchant receiving the money and the charge on your credit account these fees are used by each vendor to cover their costs and ultimately generate a profit note most vendors in the value chain do not receive any revenue from any interest you may pay on your outstanding balance therefore when you withdraw cash from an atm you are paying the merchant fees instead of whatever merchant you are purchasing goods services from with the cash withdrawn

could it be done yes it could subject to local law a variant of such an approach has been suggested for those countries experiencing collapse of demand one might consider whether whether it applied to secured loans such as mortgages unsecured loans or both whether it would be capped at a certain absolute say £ 100k or proportional first 50 of each mortgage whether it would cover first homes only or all homes and so on   these details would radically change the feasibility and consequences of any such intervention see the related question such a policy of debt cancellation would have several consequences beyond initial stimulation of demand that would need additional policies to deal with them inflation the resultant surge in demand would in the absence of any other intervention result in a massive surge in inflation there are some interesting questions about whether this burst of inflation would be a one off or not one could make an argument that as housing has become much more affordable at least for home owners it would increase the downward pressure on wages which would be in itself counter inflationary in the medium long term nevertheless it would be injecting much more money into the economy than has been seen in qe to date so the risks would be of extraordinarily high inflation which might or might not get entrenched in order to manage the short term risk and long term inflation expectations it might be necessary to incorporate a lot of tightening either fiscal higher taxes and/or lower public spending or monetary higher interest rates unwinding qe new requirements for higher core capital for banks moral hazard there are risks of moral hazard for individuals however as a society we were prepared to accept the moral hazard for financial institutions and their staff so that may or may not be an issue it is likely to be a question of long term expectations if the expectation is that this is at most a once in a lifetime occurrence then the consequential risk from moral hazard ought to be lower excess profits to lenders lenders will typically work on the basis of a certain proportion of defaults so paying off all loans effectively gives them an artificial boost to their profits worsening balance of payments there is to a degree a prisoners dilemma facing nations here pressing the reset button on personal debt across many of the countries experiencing demand collapse would benefit all of them however if just one such country were to do it alone they alone would increase domestic demand resulting in a large increase in imports but no significant increase in exports

what is the importance or benefit of the assumption that high risk is preferable for younger people investors instead of older people law of averages most high risk investments stocks for examples including mutual funds take any stock market some have data for nearly 100 years on a 15 year or 30 years horizon the year on year growth is around 15 to 18 percentage again depends on which country market etc equally important every stock market in the same 15 year of 30 year time if you take specific 3 year window it would have lost 50 or more value as one can not predict for future someone who is 55 years if he catches wrong cycle he will lose 50 a young person even if he catches the cycle and loses 50 he can sit tight as it will on 30 years average wipe out that loss

free file is not software by the irs   free file is actually a partnership between the irs and the free file alliance a group of tax software companies   the software companies have all agreed to provide a free version of their tax software for low income taxpayers according to the free file alliance faq the alliance was formed in 2002 as part of a presidential initiative to improve electronic access to government   you can read all the excruciating details of the formal agreement pdf between the irs and the alliance but basically the participating software companies get exposure for their products and the possibility of up selling services such as state tax return software

my original point to this post was that this asset bubble is playing out in slow motion just like others have in the past this of a recovery will bump along the bottom for years if history is a guide eg 1934    this is long term pain for the average middle class person underwater mortgages stagnating wages and here in dc overpriced houses completely out of line with median incomes    it 's been a recovery for the wealthiest in society but everyone else is sinking or water economic indicators are not a reflection of the average middle class persons struggle take a look at what said last week to a group of nobel winners    you are telling me that no one got a heloc on the speculative value of their house between 2000 2007

ask the company if they can make an adjustment for the next paycheck if they ca n't then do the following increase the number of federal exemptions by 1 in 2014 a personal exemption reduces your apparent income by $   if you are in the 10 tax bracket and you are paid every two weeks you will see the amount of taxes withheld drop by $ or the 13 paychecks later change it back if you are in the 15 tax bracket and you are paid every two weeks you will see the amount of taxes withheld drop by $ or then 9 paychecks later change it back if you are in the 25 tax bracket and you are paid every two weeks you will see the amount of taxes withheld drop by $ or then 5 paychecks later change it back remember the money is n't gone it has just been transferred prematurely to the federal treasury   you could also wait until you complete your taxes this spring then see if you needed to make an adjustment to your exemptions if you normally get a large refund then you should be increasing your exemptions anyway if you are always writing a check to the irs then you were n't getting enough withheld also make sure that payroll has the correct numbers most companies include the number of federal and state exemptions on the paycheck stub or the pdf of the stub

take some of the commentary on home buying forums with a grain of salt i too have read some of the commentary on these forums such as myfico or zillow and rarely is the right advice given or proper followup done typical 401k withdrawals for home purchase would not be considered a hardship however most employer 401k plans will allow you to take a loan for 401k as long as you provide suitable documentation statement real estate contract good faith estimate or some other form of suitable documentation as described by the plan administrator   for instance i just took a 401k loan to pay for closing costs and i had to provide only the real estate contract could i not follow through with the contract sure but what if i am found out for fraud then the plan administrator would probably end up turning the distribution into a taxable distribution i would n't go to jail in this hypothetical situation i am only stealing from myself but the law states that certain loan situations are not liable for tax as long as that situation still exists in the home loan situation my employer allows for a low interest 10 year loan my employer also allows for a pre approved loan for any purpose this would be a low interest 5 year loan   there is also the option to not do a loan at all but normally that is only allowed after you have exhausted all your loan options and the government makes it intentionally harsh 30 penalty at least to discourage people from dumping their tax free haven 401k accounts that all being said many plans offer no prepayment penalty so like my employer has for us i can pay it all back in full whenever i want or make micropayments every month otherwise it comes out of my pay stub biweekly so if it were to fall through i could just put it all back like it never happened though with my plan there is a cooling off period of 7 days before i can take another loan keep in mind that if you leave your employer then the full amount becomes a taxable distribution unless you pay it back within a certain period of time after leaving the employer   whether this fits your financial situation is up to you but a loan is definitely preferred over a partial or full withdrawal since you are paying yourself back for your rightly earned retirement which is just as important

first you 've learned a very good lesson that quite a few people miss out on notice how easy it is to get out of debt when you get a windfall of money   the trouble is that if a person does n't have the behavior to maintain their position they will end up in the same place   many lottery winners end up being poor in the long run because their behavior is the problem not their finances if you feel that you 're going to end up in debt again this means simply that somewhere in your finances your expenses exceed your income   simply put there 's only two fundamental things that can be done you can do one or the other or both   over budgeting i prefer automation automate your bills and spending by setting up a bill and spending account and when the money 's gone it 's gone you can tell yourself at that point i have to find another source of income before i spend more   this not only helps you show where your money is going now it also puts a constraint on your spending which sounds like most of the problem currently   many of my friends and i make our saved invested money very hard to access so that we ca n't get it immediately like putting it in an account that will require three or four days to get to the purpose of this is to shape your behavior into actions of either increasing your income decreasing your spending or both

you owe only $ to pay off your loan now possibly less    from what you say about your loan tell me if i got this right 30 year loan $ original loan amount 9 annual interest rate $ monthly payment you have made payments payment number is not due until late 2019 possibly early 2020 if i have correctly figured out what you have done you have been making monthly payments early by pulling out payment coupons before they are due and sending them in with payment   you are about 4 years ahead on your payments    if i have this correct if you called the bank and asked what is my payoff amount if i want to pay this loan off tomorrow they would answer something like $   when you pay a loan off early you do n't just owe the sum of the coupons still remaining   in your case you owe at least $ 16,000 less indeed if there is some way to convert your 4 years of pre payments into an early payment you would owe even less than $   i do n't know banking law well enough to know if that is possible    you should stop pulling coupons out of your book and paying them early   any payments you make between now and when your next payment is actually due late 2019 sometime you should tell the bank you want applied as an early payment   this will bring your total owed amount down much faster than pulling coupons out of your book and making payments years early    if there is someone in your family who understands banking pretty well maybe they can help you sort this out   i do n't know who to refer you to for more personal help but i really do think you have more than $ 16,000 to gain by changing how you are paying your mortgage    good luck

i think the key to this question is your last sentence because it 's applicable to everyone high net worth or not how would one determine whether they are better off without insurance in general insurance is a net good when the coverage would prevent a catastrophic event if a catastrophic event does n't happen oh well you wasted money on insurance if it does happen you just saved yourself from bankruptcy these are two separate outcomes so taking the average cost of a catastrophic event and weighing that against the more expensive insurance premiums is not practical this is a way of reducing risk not of maximizing returns let the insurance company take the risk they benefit from having a pool of people paying premiums and you benefit because your own life has less financial risk now for something like cheap home electronics insurance is a bad idea this is because you now have a pool of potential risks and your own life experience could be close to the average expected result meaning you 'll pay more for insurance than you would just replacing broken things this answer is another good resource on the topic so to your question at what point in terms of net worth does someone 's house become equivalent to you and your toaster remember that if you have home fire insurance you are protecting the value of your house because that loss would be catastrophic to you but a high net worth individual would also likely find the loss of their house catastrophic unless they are billionaires with multiple mansions then it is quite likely that regardless of wealth a significant portion of their worth is tied up in their home even 10 of your net worth would be a substantial amount   as an example would someone worth $ 1 m have only a 100k home would someone worth $ 10 m have only a $ 1 m home depends on where they live and how similarly if you were worth $ 10 m you might not need extra insurance on your toyota camry but you might want it if you drive a $ 1 m ferrari not to mention that things like auto insurance may cover you for liability which could extend beyond the value of your car into medical and disability costs for anyone in an accident in fact being high net worth may make you more vulnerable to lawsuits making this insurance even more important in addition high net worth individuals have insurance that you or i have no need of things like insurance business operation insurance life insurance used to secure bank loans   so yes even high net worth individuals may fear catastrophic events and if they have so much money why would n't they pay to reduce that risk insurance provides a service to them the same as to everyone else it 's just that the items they consider too cheap too insure are more expensive than a toaster edit to counter concerns in some other answers which say that insurance is always a bad idea imagine you are in a esque episode of let 's make a deal hall shows you two parallel universes each with 100 doors you must choose your universe then choose a door the first universe is where you bought insurance and behind every door is a penalty of $ 200 the second universe is where you did n't buy insurance and behind 99 doors is nothing with one random door containing a penalty of $ 10,000 on average playing the game times you will come out ahead 2:1 by not buying insurance but you play the game only maybe 3 times in your life so which universe do you choose   now you might say i can cover the cost of a 10k penalty if it happens but this is exactly the point insurance unless already required by law is a net good when it covers catastrophic losses if you are wealthy enough to cover a particular loss you typically should n't buy that insurance that 's why no one should insure their toaster this is not a question of average returns it is a question of risk reduction

investopedia 's explanation of overbought an asset that has experienced sharp upward movements over a very short period of time is often deemed to be overbought determining the    degree in which an asset is overbought is very subjective and can    differ between investors technicians use indicators such as the relative strength index the stochastic oscillator or the money flow index to identify securities    that are becoming overbought an overbought security is the opposite of one that is oversold something to consider is the potential buyers and potential sellers of a stock in the case of overbought there are many more buyers that have appeared and driven the price to a point that may be seen as high and thus may well come down soon if one looks at the first explanation for oversold consider the flip side of this a real life scenario here would be to consider airline tickets where a flight may be that could also be seen as oversold in that more tickets were sold than seats that are available and thus people will be bumped as not all tickets can be honored in this case for a stock scenario of oversold consider how ipos work where several buyers have to exist to buy the shares so the investment bank is n't stuck holding them which sends up the price since the amount wanted by the buyers may be more than what can be sold the price shifts in bringing out more of one side than the other is the point you are missing in shifting the price up this attracts more sellers to satisfy the buyers however if there is a surge of buyers that flood the market then there could be a perception that the security is overbought in the sense that there may be few buyers left for the security and thus the price may fall in the near term if the price is coming down this attracts more buyers to achieve the other side the potential part is what you do n't see and i wonder if you can imagine this part of the market the airline example i give as an example as you do n't seem to think either side of buying or selling can be overloaded in the case of an oversold flight there were more seats sold than available so yes it is possible stocks exist in finite quantities as there are only x shares of a company trading at any one time if you look into the concept of a float

there were several areas where the mortgage and car loan have affected your credit   the mortgage had the following impacts the car loan purchased shortly after the house had the following impacts you did not mention your payment history but since you had an 800 prior to the house purchase we can assume that your payment history is current nothing late you did not mention your credit utilization but you want to keep your utilization low various experts suggest 10 20 and 30 as thresholds   the down payment on the house likely drained your available funds and replacing the car may have also put stress on your funds   and when you buy a house often there are additional expenses that further strain budgets my guess is that your utilization percentage has increased   my suggestion would be to reduce your utilization ratio on your revolving accounts   and since you have plenty of credit lines you might want to payoff the car your chase card has a good age which helps with age of credit and though you will find experts that say you should only have 2 4 revolving accounts credit cards other experience shows that having accounts with age on them is a good thing   and having a larger number of accounts does not cause problems unless you have higher utilization or you miss payments you did not mention whether the chase card has any fees or expenses as that would be a reason to either negotiate with chase to reduce or eliminate the fees or to cancel the card have you checked your credit report for errors   you can get a free report from each of the three bureaus once per year

you might want to read about about the coase theorem   in law and economics the coase theorem attributed to ronald coase describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities the theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights in practice obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent bargaining this is similar to what you are asking each country has an endowment of gold and they must create a set amount of money to represent their endowment of gold this will establish an exchange rate if i have 5 tons of gold and you have 5 tons and i print 10 dollars and you print 20 then one of my dollars is worth two of your dollars   thus the amount of money is not   it 's the exchange rate between the countries if all the nations know each other 's gold endowment then we will have a perfect exchange rate if we do n't then currency printing will vary but arbitrage should drive it to an accurate price   gold and diamonds are both valuable in part due to scarcity but gold has been used as a measure of value because it 's been historically used as a medium of exchange people just realized that swapping paper was safer and cheaper than physically transporting gold but the idea of gold as a measure of value is present because that 's how it 's always been nobody creates these procedures but organizations like the imf ecb fed reserve etc implement monetary policy to regulate the money supply and arbitrage drives exchange rates to fair values

actually i do n't know if you remember but the security pre 9/11 was pretty good they had a vested interest in doing their jobs as they were hired by the airport and had that were n't nationalized from a organization that is guaranteed funds no matter what   having solid locking doors on the has now prevented future 9/11 attacks quite honestly the odds of you being in a terrorist attack pre 9/11 were million s times less than getting into a car accident so no i do n't think 9/11 should be used to drastically push an agenda via security theater that has no purpose other than to test the tolerance of the population for rights reduction

you can save a bit by getting an interior cabin but it can be a bit weird to be in a room with no window and no natural daylight   it 's strangely really easy to lose all track of time especially if you do n't set an alarm   we spent very little time in our outside of sleeping or changing clothes etc so imho there 's no reason to overspend on the otoh a room along the outside of the ship will cost more but might be worth the cost difference   you do n't need a full or any of that however a simple window even if partially by something really changes the feel of the room and makes it a lot less cave like johnfx covered just about everything else i 'd have had to say

hey i hope i did nt come off as harsh on you   i 'm not sure how much i can help but i d be glad to give you tips on getting you name in the door with the big companies and other career y advice   if you have n't already though please read this article on negotiating from the perspective of an   i do n't think anyone truly enjoys negotiating but with experience it becomes much easier and more natural   see yourself as an asset because you obviously are if they are offering their money to you   and in reading your post let me say this   never see your company as your friend   yeah you might be friends with your boss and coworkers you all might be in a league and hangout but when it comes to the hours of 9 5 to someone somewhere in your chain of command you are a line item that costs them x amount of money and makes them x amount   do n't forget that and do n't let yourself have feelings towards the company   if the company is n't smart enough to hire a backup even after you have advised them to do so that is their doing and any repercussions are for them to take   i 'm not saying be but if you ever ever start to think about making or not making a major decision such as not leaving a company that is bad for your bottom line in exchange for helping out the company or due to feeling in some way towards the company stop forget your feelings and do what logic alone tells you to do   you and your company are not friends   if the company can find someone cheaper to do your job they will do so with no feelings towards you   and the being solo part yeah that s not a good way to go early in your career   i 've made it my objective to surround myself with people smarter than me who are willing to guide me even at the cost of current financial gains simply because as a young professional learning from others is one of the top priorities for me now   running solo being shoved to a corner to do your work alone is a huge no no imo

in one personal finance book i read that if a company is located in a country with credit rating x it ca n't have credit rating better lower i.e. further from aaa level than x. this is simply wrong real world evidence proves it wrong automatic data processing adp exxon mobile xom johnson johnson jnj and microsoft msft all have a triple a rating today even though the united states does n't toyota tm remained triple a for many years even after japanese debt was downgraded the explanation was the following country has rating x because risk of doing business with it is x and so risk of doing business with any company located in that country automatically ca n't be better than x. when reading financial literature you should always be critical let 's evaluate this statement first off a credit rating is not the risk of doing business that is way too generic specifically a credit rating attempts to define an individual or company 's ability to repay it 's obligations buying treasuries constitutes as doing business with the gov't but you can argue that buying stamps at usps is also doing business with the gov't and a credit rating wo n't affect the latter too much   so a credit rating reflects the ability of an entity to repay it 's obligations what does the ability of a government to repay have to do with the ability of companies in that country to repay not much certainly if a company keeps it 's surplus cash all in treasuries then downgrading the government will affect the company but in general the credit rating of a company determines the company 's ability to pay

difference between a limit and market order is largely a trade off between price certainty and timing certainty if you think the security is already well priced the downside of a limit order is the price may never hit your limit and keep trading away from you you 'll either spend a lot of time amending your order or sitting around wishing you 'd amended your order   the downside of a market order is you do n't know the execution price ahead of time this is typically more of a issue with illiquid instruments where even smaller orders may have price impact for small trades in more liquid securities your realized price will often resemble the last traded price hope that helps both have a purpose and the best tool for the job will depend on your circumstances

we do n't have all the relevant numbers to give you the perfect answer knowing your income is pretty important for this question but since you have 200 k in student loans i 'm going to guess and hope you probably make more than 80k yr which is the cutoff for deducting student loan interest it starts phasing out once you make over 65 k and fully phases out at 80 k or 160 k if you 're married even if you make less than 65 k you can only deduct a max of in student loan interest and you 'll be maxing that out for at least the next 4 years so my take is throw it at the student loan your mortgage interest is probably fully deductible which means your mortgage interest rate is effectively reduced by your tax bracket e.g. if you are in the 28 tax bracket a 4 mortgage rate would effectively become outside of that if you were to make minimum payments on your mortgage and student loans starting now as soon as your student loan is paid off i would start making that same student loan payment amount towards your mortgage this way you wo n't have any change in cash flow but it will significantly lower the term of your mortgage which is what would happen if you choose to pay down the mortgage now but then you do n't get the tax advantage on the difference

hey currently in treasury it 's good in some ways and bad in others every role has it 's pluses and minuses   some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company you get a cursory view of what everyone is doing all the time but you do n't really ever get in depth views of any one area it 's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies wo n't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department you get to look at bond and commercial paper markets if that 's interesting to you you get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important you 're the first to know if the company is gon na go bankrupt it 's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move but it 's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility it 's one of the only corporate finance roles that 's closer to front office than mid or back office   if you are just joining corporate treasury you 'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity after that you would move into bond stuff management corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk after that you 'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and m&amp;a activity which is the real cool shit    that 's what came off the top of my head do you have any specific questions

the benefits and taxes thing in my opinion is the most people do n't realize that the cost to the company for a full time employee with benefits can be 2x or even 3x the amount they see in their paycheck   health plans are extremely expensive even if you are having money taken from your check for health insurance it is often just a fraction of the total cost and the employer is subsidizing the rest   more expensive benefits that contractors do n't typically get are 401 k matches and paid vacation days when contractors call in sick or do n't work because it is a national holiday they do n't get paid for that day also see that line on your paycheck deducting for social security and medicare that is only half of the tax the employer pays an equal amount that is not shown on that statement also they pay taxes that go towards unemployment benefits and may be required to pay higher taxes if they churn through a lot of full time employees you can usually let contractors go with relative impunity for the unemployment tax reasons not paying for people 's days off or benefits a lot less paperwork and less risk to the business associated with committing to full time employees all provide value to the company thus companies are willing to pay more because they are getting more   think of it like a cell phone contract if you commit to a three year contract it can be a pain expensive to get out of the deal early but you will probably get a better rate in exchange for the risk being shifted to your end of the deal

the safe harbor provision is based on the tax you or the prior year so in 2016 this helped you as your tax was substantially increased from 2015 however by the same token in 2017 your safe harbor amount is going to be very high therefore if 2017 is similar you will owe penalties the solution here is to make estimated tax payments in the quarters that you realize large gains this is exactly what the estimated tax payments are for your estimate tax payments do not have to be the same in fact if you have a sudden boost in earnings in quarter 3 then the irs expects that quarter 3 estimated tax payment to be boosted

a call gives you the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at a particular price the price called the strike price is fixed when you buy the option let 's run through an example aapl trades $ you think it 's going up over the next year and you decide to buy the $ 280 call for $ 12   here are the details of this trade your cost is $ 1200 as options are traded on 100 shares each you start to have the potential to make money only as apple rises above $ 280 and the option trades in the money it would take a move to $ for you to break even but after that you are making $ 100 for each dollar it goes higher at $ 300 your $ 1200 would be worth $ 2000 for example a 16 move on the stock and a 67 increase on your money on the other hand if the stock does n't rise enough by january 2011 you lose it all   a couple points here american options are traded at any time if the stock goes up next week your $ 1200 may be worth $ 1500 and you can sell if the option is not in the money its value is pure time value there have been claims made that most options expire worthless this of course is nonsense you can see there will always be options with a strike below the price of the stock at expiration and those options are in the money of course we do n't know what those options were traded at   on the other end of this trade is the option seller if he owns apple the sale is called a covered call and he is basically saying he 's ok if the stock goes up enough that the buyer will get his shares for that price for him he knows that he 'll get $ the $ 280 plus the option sale of $ 12 for a stock that is only $ today if the stock stays under $ 280 he just pocketed $ 12 4.6 of the stock value in just 3 months this is why call writing can be a decent strategy for some investors especially if the market goes down you can think of it as the investor lowering his cost by that $ 12 this particular strategy works best in a flat to down market of course in a fast rising market the seller misses out on potentially high gains   i 'll call it quits here just to say a put is the mirror image you have the right to sell a stock at a given price it 's the difference similar to shorting a stock as opposed to buying it if you have a follow up question happy to help edit apple closed on jan 21 2011 at $ the $ 280 call would have been worth $ vs the purchase price of $ 12 nearly 4x return a gain in just over 4 months for a stock move of 26 this is the leverage you can have with options any stock could just as easily trade flat to down and the entire option premium lost

there is a lot of your financial information that the selling agent handles in the course of a real estate transaction including but not limited to your pre approval letter which states what maximum purchase price might be closing costs and interest rate are not details they would know unless you shared that with them given that that is done after you go binding   i agree with in that while in absolute monetary terms the higher amount should always be more attractive the selling agent wants to ensure the transaction goes as smoothly as possible with contracts falling through due to first time buyers not making it through mortgage underwriting it is in the seller 's interest and thus the seller 's agent 's concern that the buyer not present such hurdles insofar as a higher down payment is a signal for that then i can understand why it would be more attractive

it 's not that they do n't want to pay it it is that there is now an economic incentive to do it people can no longer be turned down because of a preexisting condition    that means that i should wait until i break my arm to sign up for insurance then once it 's better i should cancel it again that is simply what makes sense economically only people who are sick need insurance if sick people can not be turned down

yes you can do this buy placing a conditional order to buy at market if the price moves to 106 or above once the price hits 106 your market order will hit the market and you will purchase the stock at 106 or above you can also place a tack profit order at 107 linked to your initial conditional buy order so that once you buy order is executed and you buy at 106 a take profit order will be executed only if the price reaches 107 or above   if the price never reaches 106 neither your market buy order or take profit order will hit the market and you wo n't buy or sell anything

people agree to sell stocks when a company does bad but remember when you sell the stock of a company that in your estimation did bad someone else had to buy otherwise there is no sale the someone else who bought your shares evidently disagrees with your assessment did you sell because the company did n't earn a profit at all did it not earn a profit because it 's in a dead end business that is slowly but inevitably declining to zero something like sears holdings or did it not make a profit because it is in an emerging market that will possibly someday become hugely profitable something like tesla inc. did you sell because the company made a profit but it was lower than expected did they make a lower than expected profit because of lower sales why were the sales lower is the industry declining was the snow too heavy to send the construction crews out did the company make a big investment to build a new plant that will in a few years yield even higher sales and profits what are the profits year over year increasing declining usually investors are willing to pay a premium that is more than expected for a stock in a company with robust growth   as you can see the mere fact that a company reported a profit is only one of many factors that determine the price of the shares in the market

okay i think i managed to find the precise answer to this problem it involves solving a non linear exponential equation but i also found a good approximate solution using the taylor series see below for a spreadsheet you can use let 's start by defining the growth factors per period for money in the bank and money invested    now let s be the amount ready to be invested after periods so the first of that money has earned interest for n periods that is   the key step to solve the problem was to fix the total number of periods considered so let 's introduce a new variable t = the total number of time periods elapsed so if money is ready to invest every periods there will be separate investments and the future value of the investments will be   this formula is exact in the case of integer t and n and a good approximation when t and n are not substituting s we get the version of the formula which explicitly depends on n   fortunately only a couple of terms in fv depend on n so we can find the derivative after some effort   equating the derivative to zero we can remove the denominator and assuming t is greater than zero we can divide by the constant t   to simplify the equation we can define some extra     then we can define a function f(n and write the equation as   note that g and r are all constant from here there are two options use newton 's method or another numerical method for finding the positive root of f(n this can be done in a number of software packages like matlab etc or by using a graphics calculator solve approximately using a taylor series polynomial i will use this method here the taylor series of f(n around is   the series to the first three terms we get a polynomial with constant coefficients   using r g and defined above let and be the coefficients of the taylor series for f(n     then   n should be rounded to the nearest whole number to be certain check the values above and below n using the formula for fv using the example from the question for example i might put aside $ 100 every week to invest into a stock    with an expected growth of 9 p.a but brokerage fees are $    for how many weeks should i accumulate the $ 100 before investing if i    can put it in my high interest bank account at 4 p.a until then using newton 's method to find roots of f(n above we get n = using the closed form approximate solution we get n = checking this against the fv with t = evenly divisible by each n + 1 tested therefore you should wait for n = 14 periods keeping that money in the bank investing it together with the money in the next period so you will make an investment every 14 + 1 = 15 weeks here 's one way to implement the above solution with a spreadsheet stackexchange does n't allow tables in their syntax at this time so i 'll show a screenshot of the formulae and columns you can copy and paste formulae   copy and paste column a copy and paste column b results   remember n is the number of periods to accumulate money in the bank so you will want to invest every weeks in this case every 15 weeks

serious question i do n't work in finance but i always hear how the big finance firms only hire the best and brightest and if they do n't know anything they 'll pick it up quickly how is it possible that those who work in derivatives find it that difficult to explain them 's definition of derivatives is essentially what is taught to any beginner so i do n't quite understand how anyone with a finance background would find it difficult to explain at least at a very general level

i visited annualcreditreport.com to get my annual credit report   it is only the report not the score or fico score   this is the only outlet i know of that allows you to get your report for free without a bunch of strings attached or crap to sign up for and cancel later it was very easy   i was wary of putting in my private information but how else can they possibly pull you up read the instructions carefully   you go to each bureau to fetch your report and they give you a free report but they push hard to try and sell you a score or a report service   it is easy to avoid these if you read carefully once you get a report   you have print it out or you ca n't see it again for another year   each bureau has a different site with different rules and different identity checks to get in   again read the instructions and it is n't hard instead of printing i just saved the page as html   you get one html file and a folder with all the images and other stuff   this suits me but you might like to print after you get each report you have to click a link to back to the annualcreditreport.com site   from there you go to the next bureau regarding a score   everybody does it differently   free does fico but anybody who pulls your credit can generate a score however they like so getting a score is n't anywhere near as important as making sure your report is accurate you can use to simulate a score from one of the bureaus i ca n't easily see which one at the moment   it is as easy as annualcreditreport.com and i have no issue getting a simulated score and report card

technically no according to the dictionary a folio is a single sheet and a portfolio is a folder or case for keeping your in finance your collection of investments is called your portfolio probably because your broker before the digital age would keep the records of what each of his clients held in separate portfolios   however i have seen the word folio used as a short for portfolio and if you google investment folio you will see it used this way mainly in names of financial firms

as the name says its for income earned in a foreign country if you have been paying us income tax on this while living in the us nothing is going to change here you should be informing yourself on how to avoid double taxation in your new country of residence passive income earned abroad dividends interest also do not fall under this exemption   the purpose of the foreign earned income exclusion is to make it easy for expats who work abroad to avoid double income taxation without going through the complicated process of applying for tax credits the us is the only industrial country that taxes its residents regardless of where they reside that is also why it only goes to about $ 100,000 a year if you are a high earner they want to make it more difficult also as a side note since you are going to be abroad for a year i will point out that if you have more than $ 10,000 in foreign accounts at any point in the year you need to declare this in an fbar form this is not advertised as well as it should be and carries ridiculous penalties for non compliance i ca n't count the number of times i have heard a us expat say that they were unaware of this

as the ceo of a company larger than most but certainly much smaller than his i 'd like to say this kind of hyperbolic bullshit is a fine example of what is wrong with discourse in this country if you get any tax increase at all you might as well shut down your company my ass    now let me be clear i do n't want to pay more taxes and i do n't mean to imply anything of the sort but grown ass privileged men pretending to be and acting like spoiled eight year old brats does nothing constructive this kind of bullshit shuts down reasonable debate about the way things should be   here 's the real scoop i would hire more people and buy more inventory and put more into capital investment if i paid less taxes but i would also bring home more money in my pocket as well   as americans we have some huge financial problems in both the public and private sectors there are multiple potential solutions with differing ideas being held by smart people on all sides we should be attempting to appreciate and learn from one another to reach solutions like responsible goddam adults not pulling douchey like this to see who can get the most media attention secondarily the media should be ashamed of peddling this nonsense at the expense of society   tl;dr fuck this guy and the media he rode in on

yeah true that counseling people to avoid the negatives has been more beneficial in my life than great recommendations even one mistake and you 're up shit 's creek and i will say i have the knowledge to help people to avoid mistakes but sometimes it into mud unfortunately if this was n't a new account then it might give you an indication of how i 've done this in the past most of the time it takes too much explaining to get people up to speed though   a word to the wise i 'd recommend being open to switching industries everyone in finance is pretty toxic and all ended up there because of money end up chasing the cfa cancer into three exams grad school nonsense corporate jobs or the dream in high finance small shops where the founders do n't think they need another smart hard working person even if if it 's obvious they do   i remember reaching out and counseling a firm on selling a position that i felt was really stupid it was not at all in line with their investing objectives and also was one i would never touch the guy actually agreed with me did n't hire me i was after a job did n't sell the position and lost them approx $ 12 million within 12 months with my math on their 's   i only reach out to firms i respect which works out to about 1 firm per 100k people in population from what i 've seen in a city like pittsburgh this was only 4 shops that means there are maybe 200 people in the us who would make a hiring decision on me for what i like to do but i 've stopped playing that game   i now run a healthcare business i started it was hard as hell to open but i now run circles around people because nobody actually is in the business of the industry the doctors nurses etc are all extremely bright just not in my area makes for a much more fun

it all has to do with risk and reward the risk is that interest rates will rise   to entice you to go with the variable they make it so it is cheaper if interest rates never rise your job is to guess whether interest rates are likely to go up or not in a first approximation you should go fixed the bank employs very smart people whose entire job is to know whether interest rates will go up or not those people chose the price difference between the two and it 's sure to favour the bank that is the risk of extra payments you 'll make on the variable is probably more than the but some people ca n't sleep at night if their payments or more realistically the interest part of their payments might double if that 's you go fixed if that 's not you understand that the actually has to be turned up a bit to get more people to go variable because of the sleeping at night feature think long and hard about your budget and what would happen if your payment jumped if you could handle it variable might be the better choice personally i have been taking variable on my mortgage for decades and now i do n't have one and never once regretted it i also my oldest child to take variable on her mortgage over this century so far if rates up they did n't tick up to the level the fixed was offered at mostly they have sat flat but if ever there was a world in which past performance does not predict future results it would be interest rate trends do your own research

well as far as anecdotal evidence goes my so is working on a undergraduate finance degree at u of t and has been hired at the canadian office of a large american bank in a field related to ib   that said if it 's possible to be hired at the canadian office of an american bank presumably it is possible to apply and cross over to an american branch in the future all you need is to be able to get your foot in the door and be re hired to another position as an insider with references from your md director and associate   another piece of anecdotal evidence is that many of her superiors have degrees in other subject areas the reality is they 're looking for smart people pedigree is probably reasonably unimportant   i 'm not sure if this information is transferable to work as a quant though in many ways your discipline would be more technical or skill based and require less character from the applicant and more competency   as for montreal the only two schools americans know of are mcgill and u of t generally in that order everyone will know of mcgill and about half of those people will know of u of t i can imagine that either of the two schools would be an excellent choice i am biased toward u of t for personal reasons and also because it is located directly beside bay street so the networking opportunities for the variety of international banks and private wealth managers are definitely there but i would n't knock mcgill from a reputation perspective    i think the reality is that while you should consider your options carefully whatever option you choose will be based on a lot of over thinking it 's unavoidable and a good thing but ultimately i imagine meaningless if you 're smart driven and connected you will get the job regardless of which of those two schools you choose

the professional financial advisors do have tools which will take a general description of a portfolio and run monte carlo simulations based on the stock market 's historical behavior after about 100 simulation passes they can give a statistical statement about the probable returns the risk involved in that strategy and their confidence in these numbers   note that they do not just use the historical data or individual stocks there 's no way to guarantee that the same historical accidents would have occurred that made one company more successful than another or that they will again past performance is no guarantee of future results but general trends and patterns can be roughly modelled which makes that a good fit for those of us buying index funds less good for those who want to play at a greater level of detail in the hope of doing better but that 's sorta the point to beat market rate of return with the same kind of statistical confidence takes a lot more work

if you sell a stock you do n't own it 's called a short sale you borrowed the shares from an owner of the stock and eventually would buy to close on most normal shares you can hold a short position indefinitely but there are some shares that have a combination of either a small float or too high a short position that shares to short are not available   this can create a short squeeze where shorts are burned by being forced to buy the stock back   last when you did this you should have instructed the broker that you were selling to open or selling short in the old days when people held stock certificates you were required to send the certificate in when you sold today the broker should know that was n't your intention

also bear in mind you need to pay a deposit which is around the same price as a monthly payment they will also need to do a credit history check on you and since you are a foreigner you wo n't have any there are some renters who care less but mostly serious renters will require it some can require an employment confirmation or even a bank account details it is very complicated and difficult for a foreigner   as in comments mentioned a contract is minimum 1 year the deposit is returned when you leave and the place is left in good condition i would not expect the full amount returned as many renters require a professional cleaning or some even the walls you can do it yourself and give them a receipt but you end up paying for it   what i would suggest is some type of a sharing house where people share rooms in one house but that option has negatives another option is where you even share a room it all depends on where you want to live it is very different if you are in a big city like new york or somewhere in suburbs the prices also vary it 's good to have friends in the usa that can help you especially if you are n't planning on staying too long

two years ago i wrote an article titled student loans and your first mortgage in response to this exact question posed by a fellow blogger   the bottom line is that the loan payment does n't lower your borrowing power as it fits in the slice between 28 total housing cost and 38 total monthly debt burden when applying for a loan   but the $ 20 k is 20 down on $ 100 k worth of house with median home prices in the us in the mid high $ you 're halfway there   in the end it 's not about finance it 's a question of how badly you want to buy a house if i got along with the parents i 'd stay as long as i was welcome and save every dollar i could save for retirement save for as large a downpayment as you can and after you buy the house pay the student loan aggressively i moved out the week after i graduated

according to gov.uk you can only apply for student finance if since you do n't fulfill the criterion 2 and 3 you are technically not eligible for student finance since you have received information from student finance england that you can apply for the maintenance loan you should either write to them or call them again to confirm the information given to you

fact check not true   their median net worth dropped 39 percent from 2007 to 2010 while their mean net worth which is what the title of this post implies went down percent over the same period   other things worth noting the 2007 net worth values were adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index cpi u rs and were based on the interviews of families in 2010 and in 2007    here 's the source article from the fed pdf pubs

my gut reaction is to agree with you then i realize that i 'm shopping for a laptop that would have been a ten years ago and planning to spend about $ 500 i think there 's going to be a tipping point in 3d printing where it will just explode and with the platform vendors locking their platforms down figure a lot of the are going to explode in that direction    pick the date you think we 'll be able to print an electric motor or at least the parts so it can be assembled and i would n't be shocked if by that date some geek has actually printed him herself a car

the suggestions towards retirement and emergency savings outlined by the other posters are absolute must dos   the donations towards charitable causes are also extremely valuable considerations if you are concerned about your savings consider making some goals   if you plan on staying in an area long term at least five years consider beginning to save for a down payment to own a home   a rent versus buy calculator can help you figure out how long you 'd need to stay in an area to make owning a home cost effective but five years is usually a minimum to cover closing costs and such compared to other goals that might be worthwhile are a fully funded new car fund for when you need new wheels the ability to take a longer or nicer vacation a future wedding if you 'd like to get married some day and so on   think of your savings not as a slush fund of money sitting around doing nothing but as the seed of something worthwhile yes you will only be young once   however being young does not mean you have to be from sex in the city buying extremely expensive designer shoes or live like a on   dave ramsey is attributed as saying something like live like no one else so that you can live like no one else   many people in their 30s and 40s are struggling under mortgages perhaps long left over student loan debt credit card debt auto loans and not enough retirement savings because they had fun while they were young   do you have any remaining debt   pay it off early instead of saving so much perhaps you 'll find that you prefer to hit that age with a fully paid off home and car savings for your future goals kids college tuitions early retirement etc   maybe you want to be able to afford some land or a place in a very high cost of living city in other words now is the time to set your dreams and allocate your spare cash towards them   life 's only going to get more expensive if you choose to have a family so save what you can as early as possible

you are getting totally hosed mate assume you live in the house for ten years can get a normal 30 year mortgage and house prices average at 3 annually you could get a mortgage at 3.8 so your monthly payment would be $ 560 a month   $ 60 a month difference over 10 year is $ 7200 because you are paying down on a   conventional mortgage you would owe after 10 years   on top of that the house would have appreciated by $   you would have to give you parents $ of that   so by avoiding a normal loan it 's costing you an extra $

the standard interpretation of can i afford to retire is can i live on just the income from my savings never touching the principal to estimate that you need to make reasonable guesses about the return you expect the rate of inflation your real costs remember to allow for medical emergencies major house repairs and the like when determining you average needs not to mention taxes if this is n't all tax sheltered and then build in a safety factor you said liquid assets and that 's correct you do n't want to be forced into a reverse mortgage by anything short of a disaster an old rule of thumb was that properly invested you could expect about 4 real return after subtracting inflation that may or may not still be correct but it makes an easy starting point if we take your number of $ 50k year today 's dollars and assume you 've included all the tax and contingency amounts that means your nest egg needs to be or $ i 'm figuring i need at least $ 1.8 m liquid assets to retire the $ 1.5 m you gave would under this set of assumptions allow drawing up to $ 60k year which gives you some hope that your holdings would mot just maintain themselves but grow giving you additional buffer against emergencies later having said that some folks have suggested that given what the market is currently doing it might be wiser to assume smaller average returns or you may make different assumptions about inflation or want a larger emergency buffer that 's all judgement calls based on your best guesses about the economy in general and your investments in particular   a good financial advisor not a broker will have access to better tools for exploring this using techniques like monte carlo simulation to try to estimate both best and worst cases and can thus give you a somewhat more reliable answer than this rule of thumb approach but that 's still probabilities not promises another way to test it find out how much an insurance company would want as the price of an open ended inflation adjusted $ 50k a year annuity making these estimates is their business if they ca n't make a good guess nobody can admittedly they 're also factoring the odds of your dying early into the mix but on the other hand they 're also planning on making a profit from the deal so their number might be a reasonable one for self insuring too or might not or you might decide that it 's worth buying an annuity for part or all of this paying them to absorb the risk in the end ya pays yer money and takes yer

people treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace in the hole when it comes to financial difficulty but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize what is an emergency first you have to define what an emergency is   is it a lost job   is it an unplanned event pregnancy perhaps   is it a medical emergency   is it the death of you or your spouse also what does it mean to be unplanned   is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency   is one month of planning an emergency   two only you can answer these questions for yourself but they significantly shape your financial strategy   planning is highly dependent on your cashflow and for some people it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work   for others they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month also you have to consider the length of the emergency   job loss is rarely permanent but it 's rarely short as well   the current average is weeks that 's 7 months money in an emergency there are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency a good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account   some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other   however some of these are correlated for example in 2008 three things happened   the stock market crashed unsecured debt dried up and people faced financial emergency lost jobs cut wages   if you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit you 'd be up a creek because the value of your investments suddenly decreased and you ca n't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit however if you had a one or more of cash savings unemployment income and unemployment insurance you would probably have been ok budgeting for an emergency when you say financial emergency most people think job loss   however the most common cause of bankruptcy in the us is medical debt   depending on your insurance situation this could be a serious risk or it may not be    people say you should have of your monthly income in savings because it 's an easy back of the envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk but it 's not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you to properly budget for an emergency you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency generally having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk mitigation strategy   but it 's not a panacea for every kind of emergency

there are exactly zero experts in the field of personal finance that would advise having an emergency fund liquid assets available to meet sudden obligations like illness car accident ac breaks etc that is sub $ 1,000    if you have less than $ 1k in liquid assets you either a. must live at home with your parents b. very broke or c. being very irresponsible i think an emergency fund of $ 10k is really the sweet spot i ca n't imagine anyone reasonable funding the shit out of their 401k ira etc and having less than $ 1k cash

it 's simple look children are basically an debt and if a couple is poor they ca n't adequately pay that debt and their own lifestyle costs if those who ca n't afford that debt simply delayed or from that would very easily solve the poverty problem permanently so long as the next generation followed the same this next generation would also have more of a surplus since their parents had to have had a surplus before having kids ad infinitum this is exactly what happened in my own family so i know it 's possible   ultimately most poor people only have their parents to blame

first bear in mind that you 're talking about having an average of saved up at any given time if you spend all your stipend every quarter at a steady rate you 'll start out with all of it and have none left at the end of the quarter along with any long term savings you manage to build up over time in today 's low interest rate environment of ~1 interest rates we 're talking about approximately £ interest so it 's not worth a huge amount of effort to this you mentioned a bonus but looking at the charter savings website i do n't actually see one listed for either the cash isa or the savings accounts you mention in general banks in the uk actually use bonus rates as a short term measure to suck in new customers and the bonuses typically expire after a while leaving you with a worse rate also i do n't think either of the rates you mention is guaranteed they are both listed as variable in reality i doubt they will go down too much more given that the likely next move in uk interest rates is upwards the typical main advantage of an isa is its tax free nature but from your question i assume you do n't have any other income so you wo n't need to pay tax on any interest you earn outside an isa either also given that your budget is quite tight and you expect to spend most or all of your stipend there 's no advantage to using an account where you can build up long term tax free savings even if you do have a few thousand pounds left over by the end of your phd you 'll easily be able to put those into an isa at that point given the annual limit of £ 20k. you 're right not to want to take any risks with the money and there are n't really any risk free investments other than savings accounts available at least on the you 're talking about so overall i 'd just go for the return edit as 's answer points out you will probably be able to find a loss leader current account that actually offers more interest than a savings account you 'll need to either use a single current account and manage your budgeting carefully or use a second current account as your savings account and make sure to set things up to satisfy the requirements of the account you choose such as incoming payments or outgoing direct debits

assuming the numbers you gave are forecasted 2013 annual income you should really use an average and give the lender 1 number as long as you can provide documentation to back it up lenders are n't as sophisticated as considering your monthly income fluctuations into their underwriting algorithm   if you 're not tied down to your existing lender i highly recommend you to shop around there is n't an universal lending requirement you 'll be surprised at how flexible they are not as a recommendation to get around the rules but just finding a lender that 'll work with your situation try personal finance forums such as or to find low cost lenders

no investing in gold is a bad idea gold at these prices is completely useless there are many other precious metals that are far more useful    it seems highly unlikely you will make a large return and the downside is huge if the world economy is gold will halve very quickly perhaps more    a great piece of advice i have had while investing is if the shoe shine boy tells you to buy sell i.e. when the general public think it is a good idea to invest in a certain product you have already missed the boat   you have missed the gold boat   unfortunately most safe are exhausted chf jpy gold etc at the moment there are n't any safe places   nok is probably your best bet but beware of intervention see around sep last year

the setting of interest rates or repurchase rates varies from country to country as well as with the independence of the central bank there are a number of measurements and indices that central bankers can take into account this is a limited overview but should give an indication of just how complex tracking inflation is let alone attempting to control it   house prices are in the mix but which house or which price the choice of what to measure faces the difficulty of attempting to find a basket which really affects the majority regularly and not everyone is buying several new houses a year so the majority are ring from fluctuations in prices at the capital end but not from the interest rate end and this is only when the various agencies statistics central bank labour etc are independent   in countries like venezuela or argentina government has taken over release of such data and it is frequently at odds with individual experience links for the us and for australia

how do treasury auctions work first the us government will issue a notice indicating how much money it would like to borrow below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise $ 23 billion   the announcement indicates the date of the auction march 8th 2011 in the example as well as deadlines for competitive am and noncompetitive am bids if you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times competitive bid the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security all treasuries are priced in $ 100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner $ 100 when the security matures $ 100 is the face or par value noncompetitive bid the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement these bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction there is a limit of $ 5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction for competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35 of the total offering in order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let 's go back to the example the table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the $ 23 billion being issued the bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a $ 100 par value note bid 1 $ 5 billion max price do n't care bid 2 $ 10 billion max price do n't care bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 notice there is a total of $ 40 billion in bids the auction is only for $ 23 billion this means some bids will go unfilled the ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid to cover ration for our example it is $ a high bid to cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders a low ratio indicates weak demand a ratio under 2.0 is considered weak the bids are filled in the following manner results of our example auction bid 1 $ 5 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 2 $ 10 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 10 billion filled at $ 95 bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 only $ 3 billion filled at $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 not filled bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 not filled once the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction below is the actual results of the auction   there are some additional items that are reported from the auction high rate this is the highest yield or the lowest price that was accepted at the auction for our example this would be $ 95 allotted at high this is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield or lowest accepted price for our example the last $ 3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be $ = 13 price price as determined by the auction median rate half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above low rate the lowest yield or highest price submitted for the competitive bids the announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories there is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as this stands for system open market account this represents treasuries that are held by the federal reserve if the federal reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries for our example auction the fed had no bills maturing at the time if they did then the fed would also get the same price determined at the auction here is an article i wrote with a little more detail on the auction process   i 've included my sources at the end of the article as for treasuries being a safe investment   i 'm not so sure   right now the yield on 10 years is around 2.5   who in their right mind would lend money to the government for 10 years at 2.5   not me

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

americans have this blind faith in american car companies   when i started dating my gf ago her parents were hard core american car buyers her mom had a brand new top of the line   that car had so many problems that the cost of ownership had to be outrageous   the one thing that was a constant problem is it had factory 18 in alloy and the tires kept going bald on the inside like way before they should have her mom kept taking it to the dealership to get the problem fixed because you should n't have to get new tires every 15k miles   they said all sorts of crap like the kit was wrong and god knows what else   i think that was they last straw for them because she got rid of it and got a kia which has had no problems   the one brand i would absolutely never buy is a chevy   that company has continually produced shit vehicles that cost a fortune to own for the last 30 years they wonder why they almost went out of business well when you can buy a honda and get 200k miles from your investment without having the car in the dealership twice a year with major repairs and terrible warranties that do n't cover shit people will end up buying that lasts

ach transfers are reversible and traceable so what 's stopping them is the ease and the speed with which they would be caught when you give a check you have to provide some information to the payee so that they could cash it you ca n't withhold the bank or the account number how would they charge you so it has to be on it and if it is on it it can be put on any other fake check that is why checks come also with your signature and are always available for you to inspect when they 're cashed if you notice something out of the ordinary check you did n't give ach transfer you did n't authorize on your statement it is your responsibility to notify the bank within x period of time 60 days i think of the statement and it will be dealt with so the best way to protect yourself would be to keep an eye on your account and verify that the transactions that you see are all authorized and do it frequently keeping large amounts of cash on your checking account is never a good idea regardless also since checks are inherently unsafe try to only give checks to people you trust and use bill pay or credit cards with anyone else

goodness i wish i could put away half my paycheck not to rain on your parade but a 6-month emergency fund is not quite very good   it is the typical starting time frame   personally i would feel more comfortable with a 2 + year fund   that is a bit extreme but only because many of us can barely seem to make it around to a 6-month fund   so we focus on the more attainable goal i say you do all three   make saving money your priority but do enjoy some of it in moderation   do not plan on making any big purchases with it but know that you will eventually be able able to do so   money not spent is worthless idle money is worthless   make some hopefully prudent investments with some of your money    a small portion of that investment portfolio can should be in speculative investments   maybe even as much as 20 of your investment portfolio since you are young   consider that money gone and you will hopefully be surprised by one of those speculative investments   that is the crucial point earmark a small portion of your investment portfolio which you are willing to lose   however do not gamble with it   research the hot emerging technologies for example and find a way to make an investment so in summary you may have more money that you know what do with right now   however that does not mean you need to go out and spend it all   trust me as you get older you will think of plenty of good uses for that money

some things you should consider balance transfer debt consolidation if you get approved for the citibank 2 year interest free credit card on balance transfers you will need another loan of $ 18 k to consolidate your other debt if you can not get approval for the credit card you may need to get consolidation loan approval for your full $ 35 k of debt this approval again will depend on your income and your ability to make repayments as it sounds like you do n't have any assets you may have to get an unsecured loan which comes with higher interest rates remember a consolidation loan is only worthwhile if you can get an interest rate lower than your current interest rates and if you pay as much as possible to reduce the term of the loan and the total interest you end up paying you have n't given the interest rate for the consolidation loan but lets assume you could get one at 12 p.a over a 3 year period for a loan of $ 18 k you would have to pay $ per week together with the $ per week you would have to pay the credit card balance transfer your total repayments per week for the first 2 years would be $ then $ per week for the 3rd year this option sounds affordable but without knowing what your income and current expenses are it is hard for others to determine for sure if you had to get a consolidated loan for the full $ 35 k at say 12 p.a then your weekly repayments would be $ over a 3 year period this looks to be achievable too being disciplined as you said you will need to be very disciplined in order to get out of this debt you will need to set up a proper budget and watch every dollar you spend you will need to restrict any spending on credit cards and getting any new personal loans you say you will keep a small credit limit to pay for ongoing online payments for courses make sure you uses a 55 day interest free credit card preferably with no annual fee for this and pay the full amount due every month so you do n't end up paying any more interest on this card in case of death would my debts pass on to my next of kin or family if your debts are unsecured which personal loans and credit cards are then no your next of kin or family will not have to pay your debts if you die when you die any money or assets which would be sold in your estate will first be used to pay off any of your debts if there is not enough money or assets in your estate then your remaining debts may not need to be paid other people are only responsible for paying your debts after you die if bankruptcy an alternative to bankruptcy is a part 9 debt agreement as i mentioned in my answer to your previous question in this case you will still need to pay off at least part of the debt but will not be charged any further interest on the debt this is not as severe as bankruptcy but as i mentioned before should not be taken lightly like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever bankruptcy or a debt agreement should only be used as a last resort if you are unable to undertake any other option and remember even if you do take this course of action you will still need to be disciplined now and into the future so you do n't end up in a similar situation again

i think the consensus is that you ca n't afford a home now and need to build more of a down payment 20 is benchmark you may also need to pay mortgage insurance if you are below that and all considered it takes up too much of your monthly budget you did n't do anything wrong but as mentioned by ben you are missing some monthly and yearly costs with home ownership   i suggest visiting a bank or somewhere like banker to discuss accurate costs and regulations in your area i know the feeling of considering paying more now for the very attractive thought of owning a home in 30 years after interest you need to consider that you are paying almost double the initial principle so do n't rush for something you can do a year or two down the line as a major commitment   one major point that is n't emphasized in the current answers you have a large family two children a dog and a cat   i do n't know the kid 's ages but given you are in your early twenties and your estimated monthly costs they are probably very young before the point they really put any stress financially but you need to budget them in exponentially some quick figures from experience closing costs including inspections mortgage origination fee lawyer fees checking the history of the home for liens etc which will set you back minimum 5 depending on the type of purchase short sales foreclosures are more expensive because they take longer insurance home and flood will depend on your zoning but you can expect anywhere between $ 100 300 a month for many zones it is mandatory   also depending on if it 's a coop $ 800 + + or a townhouse type you will need to pay different levels of monthly maintenance for the as a cooperative fee   at an estimate of a 250 k home all your savings will not be able to cover your closing costs and all 250k will need to be part of your base mortgage so your base monthly mortgage payment at around 4 will be $ 1,200 a month it 's too tight   if it was a friend i would highly suggest against buying in this case to preserve financial flexibility and sanity at such a young age

you 're partially correct at least in my understanding of this yes the tax credit can be carried forward to future years but since it is non refundable it will reduce your tax liability solely depending on your tax situation this may result in a bigger refund or it may not in an example if you 've had $ 3 k withheld from your paycheck toward your income tax and this is also an accurate reflection if your tax liability then taking the would reduce your tax liability enabling you to be eligible for a refund due to having already pre paid more tax than you 're liable for

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

banks make less profit when long rates are low compared to short rates banks lend for long term purposes like five year business loans or 30 year mortgages they get their funds from mostly short term deposits which can be emptied in days banks make money on the difference between 5 and 30 year rates and short term rates it is the difference and not the absolute level of rates that determines their profitability a bank that pays 1 on cds and lends at 3 will make money during the 1970s short rates kept rising and banks were stuck with 30 year loans at 7 from the early part of the decade when short rates rose to double digits around 1980 and they lost money

banks do n't want to manage property   they despise the fact that they have all of these foreclosures that they ca n't sell   they just want to loan you the money at x% and collect the fees and interest the value of a reverse mortgage to the lender is that it 's a collateralized loan against a property   when the owner exits the property it 's attached to the property and must be paid back before the property is sold   they carefully consider the age of the recipient equity in the property etc when they decide how much to pay the owner so that the chances of the loan going underwater are minimized

in general you are allowed to deduct up to $ 50/month per student see page 4 but only if you are n't reimbursed in your case since you are receiving a stipend the full $ 2000 will be treated as taxable income but the question of is it worth it really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what you 'll get from the experience suppose you actually spend $ 1000/month to host them and if your combined tax rate is 35 you 'll pay $ 700 in additional taxes each month but you 'll still profit $ 300 each month if your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit you could consider creating a business out of it if you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which in the above example would be $ 1000/month keeping with that example you would now pay taxes on $ 1000 instead of $ 2000 which would be $ 350 meaning your profit would now be $ increasing your profit by $ 350/month you will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route my advice assume you wo n't be going the business route and then figure out what your break even point is based on your tax rate the formula is max you can spend per month without losing money = 2000 2000 t e.g. if t = 35 the break even point is $ 1300 side note my family hosted 5 students in 5 years and it was always a fantastic experience but it is also a very big commitment teenagers eat a lot and they drive cars and go on dates and play sports and need help with their homework especially english papers and they do n't seem to like bed times or imho it 's totally worth it even without the stipend

in fact buybacks were often considered a vehicle for insider trading especially prior to 1982   for instance prior to the reagan era executives avoided buybacks due to fears that    they would be prosecuted for market manipulation but under sec rule    adopted in 1982 companies receive a safe harbor from market    manipulation liability on stock buybacks if they adhere to four    limitations not engaging in buybacks at the beginning or end of the    trading day using a single broker for the trades purchasing shares    at the prevailing market price and limiting the volume of buybacks to    25 percent of the average daily trading volume over the previous four    weeks

each way you go is a little bit of a gamble    owning equity in the company is best in situations where you can trade and sell that equity or where the dilution of your royalty product would affect your returns or if you can maintain a certain equity stake without working at the company or if you can hold out on taking equity to reinvest profits for the purposes of growth    the royalty is best in situations where you 're getting a portion of the gross since you get paid as a creditor no matter how the company is performing or if you intend to collect royalties after you leave the company now for your situation if your royalties are fluctuating with profit instead of gross and your equity is tied to your continued partnership and not subject to potential growth then they 're pretty much both for the same thing you 've removed the particular advantages for each way of receiving payment if the company ever does buy out or go public how much of your additional x earning a month would you have to then re invest to get an equity stake   and for royalties if another developer came aboard or your company bought another company how much would this dilute your ip contribution so aside from the gambling nature of the issue i 'm not sure your tax calculation is right   you can take equity profit as dividend as long as you 're collecting a sufficient salary this prevents a business from declaring all profits as a dividend   this would put those profits into a different tax bracket 15 capital gains or if all profits are split you could take part as salary part as dividend   as well as someone who 's making active income off of their ip not passive income you 're supposed to file a schedule c not a schedule e so your royalties would include your self employment taxes   the schedule e is for royalties where the author is n't actively in the field or actually self employed in that area or if you own royalties on something you did n't create   should you keep the royalties then go to another job field or retire then your royalties could go on a schedule e.   now a tax advantage may exist on a schedule c if you can write off certain health and business expenses reducing your income that you ca n't on a schedule e though it 'd probably be difficult to write off more than the adjusted self employment cost savings of a schedule e.

educating everyone is a cultural investment but not necessarily a good fiscal investment for the govt   200 years ago being able to read and perform arithmetic pretty much guaranteed you an ok job because it was a rare skillset   the government decided that everyone being able to read and do basic maths would be a good thing so they force us all to pay for it and they force us all to attend school so most of the country has a basic education that 's obviously a good thing but it does n't guarantee everyone in the country a good job if 1000 's of people have the same skillset and are all applying for the same job it 's impossible to differentiate job candidates in the job market a skill that everyone has is effectively valueless    the same thing is happening with college we have tons of college graduates that are all applying for the exact same jobs and we as a society have produced more people to do that small group of jobs and have n't produced any people to do other jobs somewhat ironically immigrant workers do a lot of the work we should be doing ourselves but we all went to college and all want to do the same good high paying etc jobs and there 's too many of us and not very much demand for the skills we can deliver   so giving secondary educations to even more people would n't be a bad thing in and of itself but it would n't help anyone find work

no they can not refuse to provide you with the current balance or a balance history the other answers point you to resources that are available to help you put pressure on the dealership the bottom line is that you now know that you have the right to the details and to audit their recording of the transactions you should now use that information and demand a better response in writing if they have to give you a response in writing they ca n't deny the answer they gave in a court of law later on they understand this and they will take you more seriously if you send a letter make sure to keep copies of the letter and send it with certified delivery

you 're conflating llc with corporation they 're different animals llc does not have s or c designations those are just for corporations i think what you 're thinking about is electing pass through status with the irs this is the easiest way to go the company can pay you at irregular intervals in irregular amounts the irs does n't care about these payments the company will show profit or loss at the end of the year those payments to you are n't expenses and do n't reduce your profit you report this on your schedule c and pay tax on that amount your state tax authority will have its own rules about how this works alternatively you can elect to have the llc taxed as a corporation i do n't know of a good reason why someone in your situation would do this but i 'm not an accountant so there may be reasons out there my recommendation is to get an accountant to prepare your taxes at least once if your situation is the same next year you can use the previous year 's forms to figure out what you need to fill in the investment of a couple hundred dollars is worthwhile on the question of buying a home in the next couple of years yes it does affect things pass through status probably does n't affect much if all of your income is coming from self employment be prepared for hassles when you are shopping for a mortgage you can ask around maybe you have a friendly loan officer at your credit union who knows your history but in general they will want to see at least two years of self employment tax returns you can plan for this in advance talk to a couple of loan officers now to see what the requirements will be that way you can plan to be ready when the time comes

i think the real answer to your question here is diversification   you have some fear of having your money in the market and rightfully so having all your money in one stock or even one type of mutual fund is risky as all get out and you could lose a lot of your money in such a stock market based investment   however the same logic works in your rental property   if you lose your and are unable to find a new one right away or if you have some very rare problem that insurance does n't cover your property could become very much not a break even investment very quickly   in reality there is n't any single investment you can make that has no risk   your assets need to be balanced between many different market investments that includes bonds us stocks european stocks cash etc   also investing in mutual funds instead of individual stocks greatly reduces your risk another thing to consider is the benefits of paying down debt   while investments have a risk of not performing if you pay off a loan with interest payments you definitely will save the money you would have paid in interest    to be specific i 'd recommend the following plan

i suppose you can calculate the rate of return on buying a home in terms of appreciation expenses inflation taxes etc   nothing wrong with that the method justkt came up with is accurate but when you get the number out i would n't worry if the return is negative why   because you 've lived there and enjoyed the house the whole time i 'm assuming anyway that this is your residence you 're purchasing   if you come out even the slightest bit ahead congratulations   you had a free place to live the whole time plus you made a little money on the deal if you lost money then oh well   you still had a place to live

it may be true that nearly everything in a high end store that does not sell goes to an outlet store that does not mean that everything in an outlet store came from a high end store the article states around 50 of some brands sales come from outlet stores there is no way that all of that 50 was originally in one of their higher end stores

our banking system is pretty archaic compared to europe 's   i never realized it until i started managing bank accounts overseas for work   i manage many in the u.k. with their banking system you can send money to any person or company using a sort code amp account similar to our routing and account and it 's free simple and reaches the other account within 2 hours    you can include invoice s etc    it 's the same banks that we have over here hsbc citi etc i imagine the only reason why they have n't rolled it out over here is because they make a lot of $ $ $ off of wires in the us similar concept but we pay $ 30 60 per each domestic transfer and it can take days   when my boss moved over here from uk and opened a personal bank account he was horrified to find out that the bill pay function in online banking sent paper checks and that you could n't just send money to people companies easily and immediately   the infrastructure and technology is already in place at the big banks but the banks make big fees off offering us archaic features and too few americans realize it can be so much easier until we legislate that banks offer us the better services that already exist elsewhere i doubt we 'll get them

your goal of wanting to eliminate your debts early is great generally you can save more money by paying off loans with higher interest rates first however it sounds like you are excited about the idea of eliminating one of your car loans in two months   there is nothing wrong with that it is good to be excited about eliminating debt   i like your plan pay off the $ loan first then apply the $ monthly payment to the $ loan   you 'll have that loan paid off almost 3 years early   perhaps you 'll find some additional money to apply to it and get rid of it even earlier after you 've eliminated both car loans save up that $ 1000/month for your next car   that will allow you to pay cash for it which will allow you to negotiate the best price and save interest   0 loans are not free money other answers will tell you to wait as long as possible to pay off your 0 loan but i think there can be good reasons to eliminate smaller loans first regardless of interest

this may not exactly answer your question but as a small business owner i would highly recommend having a professional handle your taxes it is worth the money to have it done correctly rather than doing something wrong and getting audited or worse having penalties assessed and owing more than you thought would be possible i would recommend this especially if this is how you make your primary income you can always write it off as a business expense

for us stocks it 's a bit of a gamble many actively managed funds underperform the market indexes but some of them outperform in many years with an index you will get average results with an active manager you might do better than average so you can view active management as a higher risk potentially higher reward investment approach on the other hand if you want to diversify some of your investments into international stocks bonds junk bonds and real estate reits active management is highly likely to be better than indexing for these specialized areas specialized knowledge and research is needed

you have no recourse on the spot to do anything to the vendor other than pay the fee pay cash or walk away   if you 're on a mission with longer term horizon than immediate satisfaction your options will vary by state   if you 're in a state where the fees are legal and the owner is potentially violating an agreement with the card company you can report the vendor to the card company   they may or may not really care   if you 're in a state where the fee is actually illegal you 'd need to see what options you have with the local authorities you should keep in mind that if the vendor is violating an agreement that 's between the vendor and the card company only you have absolutely no rights to enforce that agreement   you only have legal rights if you 're a party to the agreement in question or if the law gives you some special rights specific to given circumstances the lawyers call this having standing   likewise if the vendor is doing something that 's not consistent with the agreement between you and the card company you also have no claim against the vendor because the vendor is not party to your agreement with the card company although you might have a claim against the card company

equation m x 12 + = worst case scenario cost where m equals the monthly cost and is the maximum out of pocket amount   so if a plan costs $ 500 a month and the maximum out of pocket amount is $ 12,000 which in a worst case scenario you would pay it 's almost always over the deductible $ 500 x 12 + 12,000 = $ 18,000 most people look at the deductible but be aware this is incorrect in a worst case   the last one maximum out of pocket really hurts most people because they overlook it deductible vs. out of pocket maximum the difference between your deductible and an out of pocket maximum is    subtle but important the out of pocket maximum is typically higher    than your deductible to account for things like co pays and    co insurance for example if you hit your deductible of $ 2,500 but    continue to go for office visits with a $ 25 co pay you ’ll still have    to pay that co pay until you ’ve spent your out of pocket maximum at    which time your insurance would take over and cover everything new in    2016 embedded out of pocket maximums one change in 2016 is that even    with an aggregate deductible one person can not pay more than the    individual out of pocket maximum within a family plan even if the    aggregate deductible is more than the individual out of pocket    maximum which is $ for 2016 for instance even if the overall    aggregate deductible was $ 10,000 a single person in that family plan    could not incur more than $ in out of pocket expenses in 2017    the out of pocket maximum will increase to $ after they hit    that number insurance covers everything for that person even as the    rest of the family is still subject to the deductible from your question thanks not sure i totally follow you my question is essentially    say a typical large employer x gives you healthcare as a benefit on    top of your salary in fact how much does that cost corporation x    each year ie meaning in the us about how much does that typically    cost a corporation x each year that 's a good question because they may qualify for tax advantages by offering to a number of employees and there may be other benefits if they encourage certain tests like blood work and they waive the monthly fee   more than likely using the above equation may be the maximum that they 'll pay each year per employee and it might be less depending on the tax qualifications   you can read this answer of the question and it appears they are paying within the range of these premiums listed above this

  yes lithium is not a rare metal but when demands rise very fast supply tend to lag this is why oil price hikes happened historically   eventually it would even put but if the production rose as quickly as you describe we would be having lithium shortage which would translate into price hikes which would then lower to demand of such cars using those batteries

you 're an idiot there is no such thing as statistical heresy picking any given stretch of time will create an assumption the last year has had historically crazy low volatility but if they were using a one year sample in it would be the most incredibly conservative var in history on the other hand using historical volatility from the past 50 years would make no sense either does the stock market in 1985 look anything like today 's what about the liquidity of pretty much any derivatives market there is no right way to measure var any way you do it involves assumptions and tweaks that are entirely subjective   also var can be over a variety of confidence intervals 99 or 95 are standard with 95 being more common because that 's two standard deviations in a normal distribution and hey that 's what they used
