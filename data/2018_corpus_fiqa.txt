to a certain extent small cap companies will in general follow the same trends as large cap companies the extent of this depends on numerous factors but a prime reason is the presence of systemic risk i.e. the risk to the entire market in simple terms is the risk that your portfolio will approach as you increase its diversification and it 's why hedging is also important   that being said small cap businesses will in general likely do worse than large cap stocks for several reasons this was is certainly the case in the great recession   small cap businesses have on average higher betas which is a measure of a company 's risk compared to the overall market this means that small cap companies on average outperform large cap companies during boom times but it also means that they suffer more on average during bear times the debate over whether or not the standard beta is still useful for small cap companies continues however some economists feel that small cap companies are better measured against the russell 2000 or similar indexes instead of the s&p 500   small cap companies may face problems accessing or maintaining access to lines of credit during the great recession major lenders decreased their lending to small businesses which might make it harder for them to weather the storm   on a related point small businesses might not have as large an asset base to use as collateral for loans in bad times one notable large cap company that used its asset base to their advantage was ford which gave banks partial ownership of its factories during hard times this a gave ford a good amount of cash with which to continue their short term operations and b gave the banks a vested interest in keeping ford 's lines of credit open ford struggled but it never faced the financial problems of gm and chrysler   despite political rhetoric about main street vs. wall street small businesses do n't receive as much government aid in times of crisis as some large cap companies do for example the small business lending fund a brilliant but poorly implemented idea in 2010 allocated less than $ 30 billion to small businesses the actual amount loaned was considerably less compare that to the amounts loaned out under tarp discussions about corporate lobbying power aside small businesses are n't as crucial to the overall stability of the financial system small businesses do n't always have the manpower to keep up with changes in regulation when the dodd frank act passed large banks as an example could hire more staff to understand it and adapt to it relatively easily small banks however do n't always have the resources to invest in such efforts   there are other reasons some of which are industry specific but these are some of the basic ones   if you want visual confirmation that small cap businesses follow a similar trend here is a graph of the russell 2000 and s&p 500 indexes   here is a similar graph for the russell 2000 and the dow jones industrial average    if you wanted to confirm this technically and control for the numerous complicated factors overlap between indexes systemic risk seasonal adjustment etc just ask and i 'll try to run some numbers on it when i have a chance keep in mind too that looking at a pretty picture is no substitute for rigorous financial econometrics a basic start would be to look at the correlation between the indexes which i calculate as and respectively as you can see they 're pretty close once again however the reality is more complicated technically and a sufficiently detailed analysis is beyond my capabilities just a quick side note these graphs show the logarithm of the values of the indexes which is a common statistical nuance that is used when comparing time series with radically different magnitudes but similar trends   s&p500 and russell 2000 data came from yahoo finance and the dow jones industrial average data came from federal reserve economic data fred per usual i try to provide code whenever possible if i used it here is the stata code i used to generate the graphs above this code assumes the presence of and downloaded from yahoo finance and downloaded from fred in the current directory   fidelity published an article   on the subject that you might find interesting and seeking alpha has several pieces related to small cap vs. large cap returns that might be worth a read too

there are obviously lots of complexities here and there are rules against price or market manipulation that are somewhat due to the rules inclusion of the 's intent but generally speaking you can publicly promote the value of a company whose stock you own provided that you now if you the value of a company publicly and sell it immediately thereafter pump and dump the regulators might suggest that your actions imply that you did n't believe it was so wonderful and were misleading the public to move the price      that said a fair might be that you loved it for all the reasons you said at lower price but thought it had run its course once it got to higher price    again if it can be demonstrated that your reason for praising it was to push the price higher your intent may land you in hot water this is n't legal advice or a full analysis but if essentially declared his honest reasons for loving a stock in which he is invested and discloses that investment letting others know he is biased he 's probably ok especially if he intends to hold it long term

first of all dilip 's answer explains well how the business deductions generally work for most big expenses you depreciate it however in some cases you need to capitalize it which is another accounting method when you capitalize your expense it becomes part of the basis of the product you 're creating since you 're an engineer this might be relevant for you talk to your tax adviser how exactly you deduct depreciate capitalize things and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions even in the us different states have different laws and the irs and state laws do n't have to conform unfortunately for example the limitations on sec 179 deduction in 2010 2011 were 20 times higher on federal level than in the state of california this could have lead to cases where you fully deducted your expense on your federal tax return but need to continue and depreciate it on your state return or vice versa good tax adviser is crucial to avoid or manage these cases

a simple way to ask the question might be to say why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down why is borrowing someone else 's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one why is n't it just the inverse of going long a simple way to think about it is this to make money by trading something you must buy it for less than you sell it for   this applies to stocks like anything else   if you believe the price will go up then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price   but if you believe the price will go down the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later   if you buy the stock and it goes down any sale you make will lose you money i 'm still not sure i fully understand the point of your example but one thing to note is that in both cases i.e. whether you buy the share back at the end or not you lost money   you say that you made $ 5 on the share price dropping but that is n't true at all you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases   you paid $ 20 for the shares but only got $ 15 back you lost $ 5 or in the other version of your example paid $ 20 and got back $ 5 plus the depreciated shares if you had bought the shares for $ 20 and sold them for say $ 25 then your account would end up with a positive $ 5 balance that is what a gain would look like   but you ca n't achieve that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and later sell them for less at a guess you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses   it is true that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and sell them for $ 15 you lose only $ 5 whereas if you buy them for $ 20 and sell for $ 10 you lose the larger amount of $ 10   but those are both losses   selling early as the price goes down does n't make you any money it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later

possibly living beyond her means but i assume that was the business gross and 300 k in utah is not that great i have no idea what the margin is in the plant nursery business or how many employee 's she had but i bet her personal income was closer to 100k. once people stopped buying plants to fix up their homes to flip it was all over for her i 'm sure    the bigger problem is that this is playing out for millions of other people that relied on housing for an income from real estate sales people loan brokers builders construction workers simply everything downstream of housing has been hit hard and many many people are in this same boat or soon will be    the really bad thing is there is no quick fix for all these people as housing is not coming back for years if not decades so basically we have a whole segment of the economy that has been decimated and these people have no where to turn it 's not going to be pretty any way you look at it

i have my own top 10 list coming straight from the management of   1 values    i write a lot on this blog about the importance of values and i feel there is no exception here   fundamentally believes in human equality and the importance of each individual otherwise there is no way he could commit to such a mission   these values originated from him but they 've now throughout the organization and every individual believes in them   2 consistency   this is an extension of values because when your values are solid and clear your behaviors and actions will flow from that   there are no contradictory policies that would confuse employees   everyone is equal and all aspects of the organization from salary profit sharing job titles power working hours leadership and vacations reflect that   3 peer pressure   there is nothing more effective for keeping order than peer pressure   all the rules in the world ca n’t replace the power of your friends and colleagues holding you accountable   it ’s much more meaningful than a top down approach   the pressure is real it has teeth since peers can come together and fire employees that are n’t doing their job   4 profit sharing   touchy open management is nothing without something real to back it up and 23 pre tax profit sharing is as real as it gets   everyone is motivated because they know they will get rewarded for their hard work and it also ensures that peer pressure is working well   they also get creative with this giving employees the option of deferring 25 of their salary until the end of the year at which time they might get a bonus resulting in a 150 of their original salary depending on the business unit ’s performance   5   giving people freedom and responsibility without the tools to get things done is a recipe for disaster   all opinions are heard and there is value in the work of every employee nobody has an excuse for why they ca n’t get things done   6 small business units   each business unit is small enough so that everyone involved understands everything that is going on and the outcomes no way people can self organize if a unit is hundreds of people large the magic number for the maximum effective size for a group is 150 and will not allow a business unit to go beyond that   7 total transparency   goes to great lengths to ensure everyone knows how their financials are even to the extent of displaying them in an easy to understand cartoon there are no secrets and this demonstrates trust and respect   8 no symbols of inequality   there are no offices with huge windows reserved parking spaces or other symbols that clearly show differences between employees everyone plays by the same rules and everyone feels valued   9 purpose   purpose is the cheapest way to align an organization   when everybody feels their works is valuable they know why they are doing it and take pride in it things naturally align themselves everyone feels like they are part of something important   10 long term thinking private company   can you change corporate culture in a few days months even not particularly if it is deeply ingrained   also how quickly do managers resort to short term solutions such as layoffs budget cuts or other forms of control to try and reduce expenses the moment things go badly even under deep pressure the company must stay the course and believe in the value of the open system   you can bend but you ca n’t break and revert to old school management with private companies this is probably a lot easier than with public companies that are measured on quarterly performance   full post here

the answer to this question requires looking at the mathematics of the qualified dividends and capital gains worksheet start with taxable income which is the number that appears on line 43 of form 1040   this is after the adjusted gross income has been reduced by the standard deduction or itemized deductions as the case may be as well as the exemptions claimed    then subtract off the qualified dividends and the net long term capital gains reduced by net short term   capital losses if any to get the non cap gains part of the taxable income assigning somewhat different meanings to the numbers in the ops question let 's say that the taxable income is $ 74 k of which $ 10 k is long term capital gains leaving $ 64 k as the the non cap gains taxable income on line 7 of the    since $ 64 k is smaller than $ k not $ k as stated by the op and this is a return $ k $ 64 k = $ 8.5 k of the long term capital gains are taxed at 0 the balance $ 1.5 k is taxed at 15 giving $ 225 as the tax due on that part    the 64 k of non cap gains taxable income has a tax of $ if i am reading the tax tables correctly and so the total tax due is $ + 225 = $   this is as it should be the non gains income of $ 64 k was assessed the tax due on it $ 8.5 k of the cap gains were taxed at 0 and $ 1.5 k at 15 there are more complications to be worked out on the for high earners who attract the 20 capital gains rate but those are not relevant here

what would be the best strategy to avoid paying income taxes on the    sale after i move to another us state leaving the us and terminating your us residency before the sale closes otherwise consider checking your home country 's tax treaty with the us in any case for proper tax planning you should employ a licensed tax adviser an ea cpa or an attorney licensed in your state the one you 'd be when the sale closes no one else is legally allowed to provide you tax advice on the matter because the company abroad is i have control over when    and e.g. in how many chunks the earnings of the sale flow into my    llc so i can plan where i live when that money hits my us account i 'm not familiar with the term in this context but form what i understand your description its a shell corporation under your own control this means that the transfer of money between the corporation and your llc is of no consequence you constructively received the money when the corporation got it not the llc your fundamental misunderstanding is that there 's importance to when the money hits your us bank account this is irrelevant the us taxes your worldwide income so it is taxed when you earn it not when you transfer it into the country as opposed to some other countries for example india or the uk as such in your current scheme it seems to me that you 're breaking the us tax law this is my personal impression of course get a professional advice from a licensed tax professional as i defined earlier

you 're right things can get a little out of hand on reddit the prior post is gone now so i ca n't really remember but the gist of what i meant earlier was that your logic did n't line up in that the price of a stock is indicative of it 's value but does n't equate to it 's value the price is a combination of the perceived intrinsic valuation of the company as well as sentiment the price can go up if people are buying but it does n't necessarily mean the company 's value or financial conditions are improving though it can it 's a common trap to fall into and can lead one to ignore for example revenues falling or other metrics deteriorating merely because the stock price continues up so it must be getting better and better   sorry not a very coherent response if you 're unsure feel free to pm me

quite a lot changed since back then so i consider it highly unlikely that you could point to one single cause you can think about it more clearly when you remove money from the equation know that money is only an intermediary in the exchange of goods and it is in fact the exchanged goods that matter so to your question you produce some goods and exchange them for the goods you consume the amount of goods that you can exchange what you produced for determines your quality of life so what parts could change   1 you could actually produce less the increase in productivity is really hard to accurately measure because even if you know for a fact that one worker 's increased when buying a machine maybe that comes at a cost of less productivity in other areas   2 not everything that you pay for does actually increase your quality of life for example speeding tickets do n't other stuff might increase your quality of life but in a manner that you do n't easily recognize for example more prisoners that you pay for might reduce your chance of being mugged however if you 're not being mugged on a regular basis you would n't notice   3 other people get a higher percentage most countries tax rates rise with rising income so when the currency is being devalued tax rates rise relative to your purchasing power in addition to other taxes and fees that might be introduced or increased but even without government your bosses might simply take a bigger cut of the company 's earnings   4 we might produce the wrong stuff if more stuff gets produced that you do not want the production of the stuff you do want will decline even if total productivity is increased   and that is only what i can think of from the top of my head you will probably find that all of those happen and most likely other causes as well

is it worth it you state the average yield on a stock as 2 3 but seem to have come up with this by looking at the yield of an s&p500 index   not every stock in that index is paying a dividend and many of them that are paying have such a low yield that a dividend investor would not even consider them   unless you plan to buy the index itself you are distorting the possible income by averaging in all these you are also assuming your income is directly proportional to the amount of yield you could buy right now   but that 's a false measure because you are talking about building up your investment by contributing $ month   no matter what asset you choose to invest in it 's going to take some time to build up to producing $ 20k year income at that rate   investments today will have time in market to grow in multiple ways given you have some time immediate yield is not what you should be measuring dividends or other investments on in my opinion   income investors usually focus on yield on cost a measure of income to be received this year based on the purchase price of the asset producing that income   if you do go with dividend investing and your investments grow the dividends themselves on a regular basis it 's not unheard of for to be north of 6 in 10 years   the same can be true of rental property given that rents can rise achieving that with dividends has alot to do with picking the right companies but you 've said you are not opposed to working hard to invest correctly so i assume researching and teaching yourself how to lower the risk of picking the wrong companies is n't something you 'd be opposed to i know more about dividend growth investing than i do property investing so i can only provide an example of a dividend growth entry strategy many dividend growth investors have goals of not entering a new position unless the current yield is over 3 and only then when the company has a long consistent track record of growing eps and dividends at a good rate a low debt cashflow ratio to reduce risk of dividend cuts and a good moat to preserve competitiveness of the company relative to its peers   amongst many other possible measures   they then buy only on dips or where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal p e at the same time that they have faith that they 've valued the company correctly for a 3 + year or longer hold time there are those who self report that they 've managed to build up a $ dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years   check out dividend growth investor 's blog for an example   there 's a whole world of dividend growth investing strategies and writings out there and the commenters on his blog will lead to links for many of them i want to point out that income is not just for those who are old   some people planned and have achieved the ability to retire young purely because they 've built up an income portfolio that covers their expenses    assuming you want that the question is whether stock assets that pay dividends is the type of investment process that with you or if something else fits you better   i believe the op says they 'd prefer long hold times with few activities once the investment decisions are made and is n't by significant work to identify his investments   both real estate and stocks fit the latter but the of dividend growth stocks and hands off property investing which i assume means paying for a property manager are a better fit for the former   in my opinion the biggest additional factor differentiating these two is liquidity concerns   post tax stock accounts are going to be much easier to turn into emergency cash than a real estate portfolio   whether that 's an important factor depends on personal situation though

there are only two ways to increase your savings you are young and both of these are likely to happen you will be promoted and get raises and your loans will be paid off removing the loan payment it would seem that you need only to wait a year or so and there will a lot more than $ 87 left over each month and your savings will grow almost without any action from you but somehow that is not what happens in real life as people get older they need more than they did before larger home more expensive things etc and they never manage to get around to saving so it 's great that you are wondering how to do it but you are not truly making it a priority you mention that you also pay spend for friends the internet play joy cloth gifts book etc and this entirely optional spending is the difference between such precision and 90 of your salary in other words it is 17 18 or more than your rent think about that for a moment every month you spend more than your rent on friends play joy books and good old etc if you were to cut that in half you could save 8 or 9 of your salary maybe after your next raise you can get that up to 10 how can you cut that optional fun stuff in half well i do n't know because i do n't know what it is and i suspect you do n't either so track it for a month or two are you getting takeout food or coffee every day are you always the one who pays when you go out with friends do you eat in restaurants a lot do you always wear the latest buy $ 500 shoes pay people to do your nails or dye your hair buy a new phone every year have the top end phone plan top end cable plan you have to know where that worth of money goes every month then you can figure out how to send some of it to savings instead   in some ways you are in a hard generation your parents did n't need to save for their retirement because they had you and they know you will send money home for them but you probably do n't expect the same from the children you do n't have yet so you have to save for yourself this is a challenge if you were saving the money you send your parents you 'd be fine yet you do n't want to reduce what you send they need it still people have faced bigger challenges and overcome them start by understanding where your fun money is going then look at how to send some aim for half of that to savings instead you wo n't regret it

i 'm surprised by all these complicated answers yes @victor you can create a form that asks people to put down their financial information but you want to be careful and not put off potential tenants by asking for too many details depending on the op 's typical tenants an extensive background and credit check may not be necessary for example if i have proof that someone is a graduate student at the local university that 's usually good enough for me because i am willing to bet that they will follow my contract   bidding war does n't sound doable you advertise a price correct you can only be down not up   so my suggestion is to look at other rental advertisements in the area compare what you 're offering location quality of house cleanliness amenities etc to the competition and price accordingly if you 're getting a flood of interest then you 're probably pricing below the average price in your area or you live in an area where demand is just much higher than supply in which case you can also raise your rent

i 'm going to subtly and change the obvious advice there are three ways to deal with negative cashflow not two you 're currently studying for a degree you do n't say what country you 're in or how your studies are funded but most people in the us uk and a fair number of other countries run up debts while studying for a degree they do this because a degree is valuable to them they ca n't avoid it because the tuition alone costs more than most students can generate in income never mind their living expenses so by all means look for savings 1 clearly strangers on the internet ca n't just think up ways for you to spend less money without knowing anything about what you do spend money on but you can at least list your expenditures for yourself and see what 's necessary consider also how much fun you want your studies to be 4 years in a cold house to avoid paying for heating and never going out with friends to avoid spending on unnecessary stuff is all very well but with hindsight you 'll regret yourself if you 're ever well off enough to pay back whatever you would have borrowed to use for heating and fun only do 2 if it does n't affect your studies or if the money you 're paid justifies delaying the valuable asset you seek to acquire a degree leading perhaps to a better job but at least to the capacity to do a full time job rather than fitting work around your studies there are some jobs that are really good fits for students reasonably low hours that do n't clash with classes and some jobs that are terrible if these fail resort to 3 i do n't mean dishonest book keeping i mean accept that you are going to borrow money in order to pay for something of value that you can account as an asset work out now what you 'll need to borrow and how you think you can pay it back make sure the sum is worth it budget for that stick to your budget you 'll still have negative cashflow nothing changes there but your capital account looks fine personally i would n't actually put a monetary value on the degree i 'm not that bothered about the accounts and it 's really difficult to be accurate about it you can just consider it more than i expect to borrow and be done with it studying costs money once you 've graduated you probably are n't going to be back here saying i want to buy a house but i have no capital and i do n't want to go into debt are you although if you are the answer happens to be islamic mortgage i do n't know whether islamic banks have an equivalent answer for student debt since they ca n't own a share of your degree like they can a share of your home unless you 're a muslim presumably the ways that islamic finance avoids interest payments would not in any case satisfy your desire to be not in debt

i do n't think its a taxable event since no income has been constructively received talking about the rsu shareholders here i believe you 're right with the irc and the basis of the rsu is the basis of the original stock option probably zero edit see below however once the stock becomes vested then it is a taxable event not when the cash is received but when the chance of forfeiture diminishes even if the employee does n't sell the stock and is an ordinary income not capital that is my understanding of the situation do not consider it as a tax advice in any way i gave it a bit more though and i do n't think irc is relevant you 're not doing any exchange or conversion here because you did n't have anything to convert to begin with and do n't have anything after the conversion your iso 's are forfeited and no longer available basically you treat them as you 've never had them what happened is that you 've received rsu 's and you treat them as a regular rsu grant based on its vesting schedule the tax consequences are exactly as i described in my original response you recognize ordinary income on the vested stocks as they vest your basis is zero i.e. the whole fmv of the stock at the time of vesting is your ordinary income it should also be reflected in your w2 accordingly

stock prices are indeed proportional to supply and demand the greater the demand for a stock the greater the price if they are would this mean that stock prices completely depend on how the public feels thinks about the stock instead of what it is actually worth this is a question people have argued for decades literature in behavioral finance suggests that investors are not rational and thus markets are subject to wild fluctuation based on investor sentiment the efficient market theory emt argues that the stock market is efficient and that a stock 's price is an accurate reflection of its underlying or intrinsic value this philosophy took birth with harry 's efficient frontier and eugene fama is generally seen as the champion of emt in the 1960 's and onward   most investors today would agree that the markets are not perfectly efficient and that a stock 's price does not always reflect its value the renowned professor benjamin graham once wrote in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine this suggests that prices in the short term are mainly influenced by how people feel about the stock while in the long run the price reflects what it 's actually worth for example people are really big fans of tech stocks right now which suggests why linkedin stock has such a high share price despite its modest earnings relative to valuation people feel really good about it and the price might sustain if linkedin becomes more and more profitable but it 's also possible that their results wo n't be absolutely stellar so the stock price will fall until it reflects the company 's fundamentals

when purchasing a condo in a university town it is almost guaranteed that the prices will be inflated as a result   this is because you are competing not only with single home primary residence homeowners but also with a multitude of investment buyers and landlords who want to purchase a rental property   universities are popular rental markets due to their stability there will always be students looking for a place to live and as a result the areas attract investors more than other markets this can work in your favor however   if you do n't mind sharing your residence with other students and you do n't mind the part time work that being a landlord requires you can live much cheaper and even make money over the next few years as your roommates pay your bills   owning a primary residence rental property also brings a lot of tax benefits because you can claim expenses and depreciation against your income   this could benefit your father who could be a co owner and would certainly benefit from the write offs against his higher tax bracket the real trick that makes or breaks the experience is finding mature responsible roommates who will cause the minimum amount of headache   if this part of the equation is missing it can lead to distractions from school and even legal worries when you have to think about things like unpaid rent and/or

it depends on what stocks you invest in or whether you invest in an index as all stocks are not created equally if you prefer to invest directly into individual stocks and you choose ones that are financially health and trending upwards you should be able to easily outperform any indexes and get your 30 return much quicker but you always need to make sure that you have a stop loss placed on all of your stocks because even the best performing companies can go through bad patches the stop loss prevents you from losing all your capital if the share price suddenly starts going south and turns into a downtrend

so you 've already considered relocation here are a few additional things to consider with respect to negotiating a signing bonus if any would you be leaving a position where you are eligible for an upcoming bonus profit share or other special incentive payout such as a stock option or rsu vesting date   a signing bonus can help offset the opportunity cost of leaving a previous job when an incentive payout date is near at the new company would you be required to wait some pre defined period to be eligible to participate in the pension or retirement savings plan with employer basic or matching contributions if you were receiving ongoing employer contributions in your previous company 's plan and would need to wait say six months before participating in the new company 's plan a signing bonus can offset lost employer contributions in the interim consider funding your own ira in that time would you be required to give up something else of value to you that your previous employer was providing such as an expensive laptop that is not expected to otherwise be replaced by the new company whether they offer a signing bonus and how much you can expect to negotiate is based on a lot of factors and you 'll need to play it by ear   remember what bonus means a payment or gift added to what is usual or expected in particular remember also that a signing bonus is a one time thing   in general it 's more important to consider the overall ongoing compensation package salary and incentive plans vacation retirement benefits health benefits etc and whether those meet your long term needs

there is some merit to it in that federal gross receipts are largely uncorrelated with tax wp content federal personal income tax rates tax    there are two somewhat perverse consequences of that fact first raising taxes does n't raise revenues meaning we ca n't actually pay for free stuff from uncle sam merely by adding an offsetting tax increase   and second raising taxes on group x ie the rich to make them pay their fair share flat out does n't work it 's effectively just kicking them in the balls because we grudge them for having more money than we do   now as to whether or not lowering taxes really encourages companies to hire more and pay better that 's an entirely separate issue from whether or not it 's revenue neutral from the perspective of the federal government   fortunately we have a recent historical example reagan did exactly that which in a period of corporate greed and erosion of workers rights not seen since the end of the days of the robber barons   so on the front end trump 's not wrong on the back end he 's trying to sell us unicorn

your corporation would file a corporate income tax return on an annual basis one single month of no revenue does n't mean much in that annual scheme of things total annual revenue and total annual expenses are what impact the results in other words yes your corporation can book revenues in say 11 of 12 months of the year but still incur expenses in all months many seasonal businesses operate this way and it is perfectly normal you could even just have say one super awesome month and spend money the rest of the year heck you could even have zero revenue but still incur expenses startups often work like that at first you 'd need investment funding personal credit a loan or retained earnings from earlier profitable periods to do that of course as long as your corporation has a reasonable expectation of a profit and the expenses your corporation incurs are valid business expenses then yes you ought to be able to deduct those expenses from your revenue when figuring taxes owed regardless of whether the expenses were incurred at the same approximate time as revenue was booked as long as the expense was n't the acquisition of a depreciable asset some things your company would buy such as the computer in your example would not be fully deductible in the year the expense is incurred depreciable property expenses are deducted over time according to a schedule for the kind of property the amount of depreciation expense you can claim for such property each year is known as capital cost allowance a qualified professional accountant can help you understand this one last thing you wrote write off that is not the same as deduct however you are forgiven because many people say write off when they actually mean deduct for tax purposes write off rather is a different accounting term meaning where you mark down the value of an asset e.g. a bad loan that will never be repaid to zero in effect you are recognizing it is now a worthless asset there can be a tax benefit to a write off but what you are asking about are clearly expense deductions and not write offs they are not the same thing and the next time you hear somebody using write off when they mean deduction please correct them

the point of title insurance is that when you buy a house it is possible that you may eventually find out that the seller did n't actually own the property either because they were trying to deceive you or some transfer of ownership in the past was n't carried out properly if that happens you can find yourself with no house and still owing the the purchase price hardly anybody can afford to take that kind of hit which is why you need some form of protection against it the traditional way of doing this was to get a lawyer to do a title search in which they check that everything in order however this costs tens of dollars at least to do the work for every sale and hardly ever finds anything title insurance is a company volunteering to take the hit for you if there turns out to be a problem in return for a payment of less than the title search would cost in essence they are saying that it 's cheaper to take the risk than do the work what are the statistics this report seems to indicate that payout is around 5 of premium but title insurance is a one off premium and the payout can theoretically happen many years down the line however it is almost certain that the insurance companies have done the math and believe that selling this insurance will be profitable for them so they believe that payouts are going to be substantially less than 100 is title insurance worth it for you if the payout is 5 of premiums the in a purely statistical sense it is not worth it you would on average gain more by not taking it however that is true of almost all insurance the policy is there to protect you in the unlikely but not impossible event where you would otherwise lose a huge amount of money unless you can afford to lose the value of your house you need some form of protection we 've already seen that the only other form of protection is a title search and they cost more the other issue is that if you are taking a mortgage your will absolutely insist that you have either a title search or title insurance there is no other way and title insurance is the cheaper of the two in this case it is best to look on the title insurance as simply a cost of doing business it 's irrelevant whether it 's worth it or not you ca n't do the transaction without it

i do n't believe there is any particular structural or financial reason that outgoing wire transfers cost so much in canada their costs are no higher than other countries and lower than many   wires seem to be an area where the canadian banks have decided people do n't comparison shop so it 's not a competitive advantage to offer a better price the rates you quoted are on the low side $ 80 for a international wire is not unusual and hsbc charges up to $ 150 there are several alternative ways to transfer money domestically in canada if the recipient banks at the same bank it 's possible to go into a branch and transfer money directly from your own account to their account i 've never been charged for this   the transfer is immediate   but it could n't be done online last time i checked for transfers where you do n't know the recipients bank account you can pay online with interac e transfers offered by most canadian banks   it 's basically e mailing money   it usually costs $ 1 to $ 1.50 per transfer and has limits on how much you can send per day week each of the banks also have a bill pay service but unlike similar services in the us where they mail a paper check if the recipient is n't on their system each canadian bank has a limited number of possible payees mostly utilities governments major stores

average person 's life i 'm going to say there is no normal debt level here 's the standard life pattern so it really depends on your situation it 's way too spread out to quote a normal figure cost of debt vs gain from assets and risk of income you need to strike a sweet spot based on someone who is more educated in finance will probably be able to run a tighter and more aggressive financial strategy whereas someone who is educated in say creative media may not be able to do as good of a job running your life as a business someone here mentioned this i think it 's very true unless you intend on living day to day with no financial strategies much of our lives parallel businesses both need to pay tax both look for low risk high growth strategies and both will hopefully have a purpose that goes beyond bringing in $ $ $

imagine a married couple without a mortgage but live in a house fully paid for they pay state income taxes and property tax and make charitable deductions   that together total $ that is $ 1 below the standard deduction for 2015 therefore they do n't itemize   now they decide to get a mortgage $ 100,000 for 30 years at 4 that first year they pay about $ 4,000 in interest now it makes sense to itemize that $ 4,000 in interest plus their other deductions means that if they are in the 25 bracket they cut their tax bill by $ 1,000 these numbers will decrease each year   if they have a use for that pile of cash such as a new roof or a 100 sure investment that is guaranteed make more money for them then they are losing in interest it makes sense but spending $ 4,000 to save $ 1,000 does n't using the pile of cash to pay off the new mortgage means that the bank is collecting $ 4,000 a year so you can send $ 1,000 less to uncle sam

i place 90 of the blame on carly and then the board that bitch was primed by her contract to gut and the company   when a board links a ceos remuneration to annual profit it makes unscrupulous individuals do things which have clear and obvious negative long term impacts but which will hike the annual profit for this year and another year or so but then turn badly negative   because carly is a little bitch and wanted to extract as much money as was humanly possible from her position at hp she on the most disastrous set of actions possible   the direct result is what we see now   ceo compensation should never be linked to profitability for an individual year but to their performance throughout their tenure and then beyond   it 's my belief a ceo should take a base salary of no more than 50 times the mean worker 's salary is not the average because that simply encourages the board to enrich the management team rather than the workers   if the company is profitable for a single year ceos should receive a large bonus say no more than 20 times the mean salary at the company   and 3 years after the ceo leaves he 'd be entitled to another round of payments base on long term performance of the company this means ceos have a duty and a very large responsibility to ensure that their replacement is actually a better ceo than they are   when board members leave there 's no incentive to them personally to ensure their replacement is even capable let alone excellent   the other issue i have with ceos is their stock options or stock grants i believe all companies should have strict rules about stock ownership by the board they must own a certain number of shares and those shares must be purchased before they join the board and demonstrably not by any mechanism which the company pays for   directors and officers with no personal investment interest in the performance of the company are a concern

since you 've already maxed out your 401k and your ira if you wanted to invest then it would either be in a brokerage account or a 529 if you have intend on going back to school as to investing versus paying off your loans the interest on them are small enough that it will depend on your preference   if you need the cash flow for investment purposes ie if you are going to buy an investment property then i would pay off the car loan first otherwise i would invest the money    since you 've already expressed that you would n't be too interested in paying the mortgage off early i 've left that off the table i would prioritize car loan over mortgage for the cash flow reason   if you do open a brokerage account make sure you are minimizing your taxes by putting the right type of assets in a tax advantaged account

a few points that i would note call options could the bond be called away by the issuer this is something to note as some bonds may end up not being as good as one thought because of this option that gets used tax considerations are you going for corporate treasury or different ones may have different tax consequences to note if you are n't holding the bond in a tax advantaged account e.g roth ira ira or 401k convertible or not some bonds are known as since the bond comes with an option on the stock that can be worth considering for some kinds of bonds inflation protection some bonds like tips or series i savings bonds can have inflation protection built into them that can also be worth understanding in the case of tips there are principal adjustments while the savings bond will have a change in its interest rate default risk some of the higher yield bonds may have an issuer go under which is another way one may end up with equity in a company rather than getting their money back on the other side for some one could have the risk of the bond not quite being as good as one thought like some detroit bonds that may end up in a different result given their bankruptcy but there are also revenue bonds that may not meet their target for another situation that may arise some bonds may be insured though this requires a bit more research to know the credit rating of the insurer as for the latter question what if interest rates rise and your bond 's value drops considerably do you hold it until maturity or do you try to sell it and get something that has a higher yield based on face value

gt;it 's the lion 's share of the annual expenditures in the health sector and up there   dude no healthcare is almost 4 trillion dollars a sites u s healthcare spending in the us none of the links you posted show that the majority of that cost is due to regulation even if we did spend billions and billions on drug research that 's still a minor piece of the whole pie   gt;if you do n't have a problem with it then contribute the share of your income you see fit voluntarily but who entitled you to decide for others that they have to do the same   i advocate uh because it would save us money all of even folks like you who do n't envision being old or sick even rich people who are able to pay ridiculously high premiums without feeling it because it brings the total cost of healthcare down as a segment of the economy care for which we currently pay twice as much as other developed publications issue us health care from a global perspective this is n't about handouts this is about saving american money and doing the right thing    gt;but i 'd prefer the us to cut subsidies to 0 replace them with nothing and finally lower taxes which will eventually leave a lot more people with enough money to easily get private insurance just without the administrative effort and without forcing people to partake   a simple example to show why this is purely wishful thinking in the us a heart stint which is a big deal when you need one is 50k. in the uk it 's in spain it 's the median savings for american families is 5k. that means prices in the us need to come down 90 in order for people to be able to afford life saving surgeries    do you really honestly believe that cutting taxes and allowing mom and pop surgery centers or correspondence course md schools will bring prices down that much if so do you really think we 'll have favorable health outcomes that way    because remember money is n't the only objective here healthy americans is the desired outcome of this process    a minority against their will is the right thing to do   the world is more nuanced than that and this is in general why i think the left tends to look down on the right alot very black and white very is or is n't no reasonable person thinks that asking the wealthy or businesses to help pay to maintain the house they live in with us is the same thing as slavery or even exploitation    and do you really think they 're paying their fair share now romney paid 15 in taxes man trump likely has n't paid taxes in years apple paid 0 the list goes on and on they 've built a tax system so complex that the only people paying are you and me and they 're so slick with this shit that people like you come out here and defend them while they fuck the both of us shit blows my mind    gt;you can try to seek refuge behind sources but you ca n't refute the moral argument with those   i 've sourced every argument i 've made clearly that 's not seeking refuge that 's having an informed opinion    for the latter you claim taxation is theft    if that 's the case then i claim it 's ok to steal to heal sick people

this is the bird 's eye view of how shorting works when you place an order to sell a stock short your broker attempts to grab the desired number of shares from any accounts of its other customers and makes them available for you to sell if no other customers own shares of this stock then generally you are out of luck it is more complicated like that in practice but this is just an overview     your odds are better if the particular stock has a large float i.e. a large number of shares that are actually available for trading and its short ratio is low which means relatively few shares    are currently being sold short also a large brokerage may be more likely to have access to the shares than a small niche market broker    the example you 've given 's list is a $ 600 m small cap with a comparatively low float and though i have n't been able to glean the short ratio it appears that a lot of investors are bearish on this stock and probably already had the same idea to short it   there is really no way to find out if a specific broker has shares in inventory available for shorting short of forgive the pun checking directly with the broker

that is a loaded question but i 'll give it a shot   first things first you need to determine if you are ready to invest in stocks   if you have a lot of high interest debt you would be much better served paying that off before investing in stocks   stocks return around in the long run so you 'd be better off paying off any debt you have that is higher than most people get their start investing in stocks through mutual funds in their 401k or a roth ira   if you want to invest in individual stocks instead of mutual funds then you will need to do a lot of reading and learning you will need a brokerage account or if you have a stock in mind they might have a dividend reinvestment plan drip that you could invest in directly with the company you will have to compare the different brokerage firms to determine which is best for you   since you seem to be internet savvy i suggest you use a discount brokerage that let 's you buy stocks online with cheaper commissions   a good rule of thumb is to keep commissions below 1 of the amount invested once you have your online brokerage account open with money in there the process of actually buying the stock is fairly straightforward   just place an order for the amount of shares you want   that order can be a market order which means the purchase will occur at the current market price   or you can use a limit order where you control at what price your purchase will occur there are lots of good books out there for beginners   personally i learned from the motley fool and last but not least is to have fun with it   learn as much as you can and welcome to the club

one of things i 've learned about trading on the stock market is not to let your emotions get to you greed and fear are among them you may be overthinking why not keep it simple if you think it can go up to $ 300 a share put in a stop loss at $ x amount where you would secure your invested money along with some gains if it goes up let it go up if it does n't well you got an exit   then if it goes up change your stop loss amount higher if you are feeling more optimistic about the stock   and by the way a disciplined investor would stick to their strategy but also have the to rethink it on the fly such as in a situation like you are in just in my opinion anyway but congrats on the gain some gains are better than none

you should plan 1 3 months for an emergency fund   saving 6 months of expenses is recommended by many but you have a lot of goals to accomplish and youth is impatient   early in your life you have a lot of building saving that you need to do you can find a good car for under $ 5000   it might take some effort and you might not get quite the car you want but if you save for 5 6 months you should have a decent car   my son is a college student and bought a sedan earlier this year for about $ 4000 onto the house thing   as you said at $ 11,000 expenses yearly plus about $ 10,000 saved you are making low 30 's   using a common rule of thumb of 25 for housing you really can not afford more than about $ 600 for housing you probably want to wait on that first house for awhile down payments really should be about 20 and depending upon the area of the country a modest house might be $ 120,000 or $   even on a $ 120,000 the 20 down payment would be $ 24,000 as you have student loans $ 20,000 you should put together a plan to pay them off perhaps allocating half your savings amount to paying down the student loans and half to saving as you are young you should have strong salary gains in the first few years and once you are closer to $ you might find the numbers working better for housing my worry is that you are spending $ 22,000 out of about $ for living expenses   that you are saving is great and you are putting aside a good amount   but you want to target saving 30 40 if you can

yes when i place an order with my broker they send it out to the exchange for individual investors what are some cons and pros of trading on     the exchanges directly versus indirectly via brokers i may be highly doubt it but from my understanding you can not trade directly through an exchange as a retail investor bats allows membership but it is only for   your firm must be a registered broker dealer registered with a self regulatory organization and connected with a clearing firm no apple aapl is listed on the nasdaq so trades go through the nasdaq for aapl caterpillar inc cat is listed on the nyse so trades go through the nyse   the exchange you trade on is dependent on the security if it is listed on the nyse then you trade on the nyse as a regular investor you will be going through a broker when looking to purchase a security it is more important to know about the company and less important to know what exchange it is listed on since there are rules a company must comply with for it to be listed on certain exchanges it does make a difference but that is more the case when speaking about a stock listed over the or nyse it is not important when asking nyse or nasdaq selecting a broker is something that 's dependent on your needs you should ask your self what s important to me do i want iphone android do i need fancy trading tools generally all the brokers you listed will most likely do the trick for you some review sites brokerage review   online broker review 2012 barron 's 2012 online broker review

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

in theory the term of the bond does not affect the priority   it does not matter whether a junior subordinated debenture is due in one year or sixty it is still lower priority than a secured note   on the other hand if the secured note is secured by something that is not worth as much as the note the excess is an unsecured debt in practice the term of the bond has two effects short term debt holders are more likely to get out just before the company goes broke   sometimes their efforts to get out are exactly what causes the company to go broke   commercial paper is even more fickle than banks all other things being equal and depending on the terms of the loan some bonds get priority over bonds of the same type that are issued later   for example your first mortgage usually takes precedence over your second mortgage

there is nothing conceptually wrong with it   if you like it that way go ahead the only thing to watch out for is bank policies that effectively penalize having many small accounts   for instance some banks charge you a fee for checking accounts with a balance below a certain minimum but will waive the fees for accounts with a higher balance   you may be able to avoid such fees by judicious management of your funds or by switching to a different bank but it 's something to be aware of   the interest rates on savings accounts also often vary with the balance making many small balances less efficient than one big balance   however right now at least in the us interest rates on savings accounts are so low that the difference here is likely to be minimal

not specifically a stream but there are royalty companies that operate based on a similar concept with a royalty a party will pay upfront to a another party usually a product manufacturer oil gas producer or miner and in return they will receive a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of the goods   for example company a owns 100 sections of land which carry mineral rights and they would like to drill on the land to produce oil gas however company a does not have the capital to produce the resource company b a royalty company agrees to provide upfront capital to company a in return for a royalty sometimes fixed sometimes sliding scale based on other factors the royalty is calculated based on a percentage of the sales proceeds that company a receives from the sale of their oil gas production   in this way royalty companies act similarly to streaming companies where they provide upfront capital and in return receive a cash flow stream that is dependant on another party 's actions what is different is that the selling price is not fixed instead it is the of proceeds that is fixed at least in the short term   in canada royalty and freehold royalties do exactly this

let me run some simplistic numbers ignoring inflation you have the opportunity to borrow up to what matters and varies is your salary case 1 you make 22 k after graduation you pay back 90 a year for 30 years paying off at most 2700 of the loan in this case whether you borrow or 28,000 makes no difference to the paying off you would do best to borrow as much as you possibly can treating it as a grant case 2 you make 100 k after graduation you pay back over 7 k a year if you borrowed the full 51 after 7 or 8 years it would be paid off yeah yeah inflation interest but maybe that might make it 9 years in this case the more you borrow the more you have to pay back but you can easily pay it back so you do n't care invest your and savings into something long term since you know you wo n't be needing to draw on them case 3 you make 30 k after graduation here the payments you have to make actually impact how much disposable income you have you pay back a year and over 30 years that 's about 25 k of principal it will be less if you account for some even most of the payment going to interest not principal anything you borrow above 25 k or the lower more accurate amount is free if you borrow substantially less than that by using your sponsorship savings and summer job you may be able to stop paying sooner than 30 years but even if you borrow only 12 k or half the more accurate number it will still be 15 years of payments running slightly more realistic versions of these calculations where your salary goes up and you take interest into account i think you will discover for each possible salary path a number that represents how much of your loan is really loan everything above that is actually a grant you do not pay back the less you are likely to make the more of it is really grant on top of that it seems to me that no matter the loan grant ratio   borrow as much as you can from this rather bizarre source appears to be the correct answer in the cases where it 's all loan you have a lot of income and do n't care much about this loan payment borrowing the whole 51 k lets you invest all the money you get while you 're a student and you can use the returns on those investments to make the loan payments

a company would have significantly less capital to pay a skilled worker at that point though keep that in mind    so to circle back now    small businesses make up a decent amount of our gdp and job creation    let 's say you have had it working someone else and want to strike out on your own you decide to start an e commerce site reselling from a factory on amazon simple enough set up online marketing made simple through amazon google and facebook but you do n't have any idea how to translate that info into quickbooks and push out the financial info needed for taxes payroll etc    you need to hire a bookkeeper to sort it out but it os only 5 hours worth of work per week do you hire them as a salaried employee giving them a liveable wage or pay them the rate you agreed upon for those 5 hours

so with any debt be it a loan or a bond or anything else you have two parts the principal and the interest the interest payment is calculated by applying the interest to the principal most bonds are bullet bonds which means that the principle remains completely outstanding for the life of the bond and thus your interest payments are constant throughout the life of the bond usually paid semi annually typically part of the purpose of these is to be indefinitely refinanced so you never really pay the principal back though it is theoretically due at expiration   what you are thinking of when you say a loan from a bank is an amortizing loan with these you pay an increasing amount of the principal each period calculated such that your payments are all exactly the same including the final payment   bonds just like bank loans can be bullet partially amortizing you pay some of the principle but still have a smaller lump sum at the end and fully amortizing one really common bullet structure is 5 non call 3 which means you are n't allowed to pay the principle down for the first three years even if you want to this is to protect investors who spend time and resources investing in you

i hope that there are no significant differences between the things you list once the formulas for compounding interest are understood i will again lay out these formulas below   first definition of the variables r means total return ratio the sum of all money you get both dividends or interest payments and return of initial capital   i is a ratio it is the percent divided by 100 then added to one 1.104 p means the number of periods in which the interest rate is paid and compounded   r = i = p =   once you have r you multiply it by the amount of your initial investment to find out how much total money is returned   for simplicity the following amounts are approximate 2 = 1.104 ^ 7 1.104 = 7 =   so to double your money in seven years you need a yearly interest rate of if compounded yearly

i 'm assuming you are buying bond mutual funds or bond etfs here not the actual bonds directly there are a significant variety of different types of bond funds reflecting the sort of bonds they invest in for example you can invest in risky non commercial grade bonds also known as junk bonds or you can invest in short term bonds which are much safer but return much less there 's no such thing as the average bond so let 's go for somewhere in the middle let 's go for 3 return after fees now it 's fairly simple math you want $ 3,000 a month or $ 36,000 a year to generate that sort of return you 'd need to invest $ if we are more optimistic we could go for a 4 return after fees that reduces your investment to $ 900,000 note that it would almost certainly not make sense to invest all that money in bonds instead you 'd want to invest in a mix of stocks and bonds this could likely reduce your risk while increasing your expected return

i would second the advice to not do this real estate ownership is complex to begin with involving a constant stream of maintenance financing and other decisions   it is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit a couple but at least spouses are forced to compromise friends are not and you can end up with long running conflicts and financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships and friendships are no exception if you want your friendship to do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment my advice would be to steer clear no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property but it will be 100 yours and will save tons of headache since you are still considering this deal it 's a great time to politely change your mind and walk away believe me a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration good luck

just look at for manufacturing and then compare population sizes   if you 've got 4x the people and you 're only producing slightly more than another country in finished goods what does that say about your manufacturing sector   is it a world beater or an also ran     also of course most of the margin for those products is realized post manufacture   selling shit to consumers is hard     also consider things like this gt;this is partly because a large share of chinese production costs consists of imports from other countries and 2010 demonstrate this by examining the production costs of an iphone in 2009 it cost about $ 179 in china to produce an iphone which sold in the united states for about $ 500 thus $ 179 of the u.s. retail cost consisted of chinese imported content however only $ was actually due to assembly costs in china the other $ reflected costs of parts produced in other countries including $ for parts made in the united states     the us adds more value to the manufacturing process of an iphone forgetting design entirely than the country that ends up with the credit for its manufacture

something very similar to this was extremely popular in the uk in the late 1980s   the practice has completely vanished since the early 2000s   reading up on the uk endowment mortgage scandals will probably give you an excellent insight into whether you should attempt your plan endowment mortgages were provided by banks and at their peak were probably the most popular mortgage form   the basic idea was that you only pay the interest on your mortgage and invest a small amount each month into a low fee endowment policy   many endowment policies were simply index tracking and the idea being that by the end of your mortgage you would have built up a portfolio sufficient to pay off your mortgage and may well have extra left over in the late 1990s the combination of falling housing market and poor stock performance meant that many people were left with both the endowment less than their mortgage and their house in negative equity

i speak from a position of experience my bs and ms are both in comp sci i know very little about loans or finances that is very unfortunate as you are obviously an intelligent human being   perhaps this is a good time to pause your formal education and get educated in personal finance   to me it is that important i study computer science and am thus confident that i will be able to find work after i finish school this kind of attitude can lead to trouble   you will likely have a high salary but that does not always translate into prosperity   personal finance is more about behavior then mathematics   i currently work with people that have high salaries in a low cost of living area   some have lost homes due to foreclosure some are very limited in their options because of high student loan balances   some are millionaires without hitting the ipo startup lotto   the difference is behavior it 's possible that someone in my family will be able to cosign and help me out with this loan this is indicative of lack of knowledge and poor financial behavior   this kind of thing can lead to strained relationships to the point where people do n't talk to each other   never co sign for anyone and if you value the relationship with a person never ask them to co sign i 'll be working as a ta again for a $ 1000 stipend yikes   why in the world would you work for 1 k when you need 4 k   you should find a way to earn 6 k this semester so you can save some and put some toward the loans you already acquired   accepting this kind of situation raises red flags on your attitude towards personal finance   and yes it is possible you can earn that waiting tables and if you can find a part time programming gig you can make a lot more then that   consider working as a ta and wait tables until you find that first programming gig i am just about done with my undergraduate degree and will be starting graduate school at the same university next semester to me this is a recipe for failure in most cases   you have all your financing options to date and are planning to go backwards even more   why not get out of school with your bs and go to work   you can save up some of your ms tuition and most companies will provide tuition reimbursement    computer science software engineering can be a fickle market   right now things are going crazy and times are really good   however that was not always the case during my career and unlikely for yours   for example just this year i my highest rate of pay that occurred in 2003   i was out of work most of 2004 and for part of 2005 i actually made less then when i was working while in college   in 2009 my company cut our salaries by 5 but the net cost to me was more like a 27 cut   in 2001 i worked as a contractor for a company that had a 10 reduction in full time employees yet they kept us contractors working    recently i talked with a recruiter about a position doing which is what i am doing now   it required a high level security clearance which is not an easy thing to get   the rub was that it was located in a higher cost of living area and only paid about 70 of what i am making now   they required more and paid less but such is the market   you need to learn about these things good luck

for starters like some other people have said just talk to someone in ib and get some advice on how to break in and what it 's really like i 've spoken to people in ib and learned that it 's really just not going to be for me in response to your four questions   1   get your degree at depaul and wait a few years to get your masters you do n't need an mba for ib and it 'll be a lot harder to go to a prestigious grad school without significant work experience and a solid network   1 it definitely would n't hurt for you to double major in cs but if you do you 're going to have to keep your grades up and still stay sharp in both majors you do n't want to have a 3.0 and have both it 'll kill your chances you 're going to need at least a 3.8 if you 're under that it 's gon na be a lot harder to get anywhere    1 if there are other industries you want to turn to then sure i used to be interested in ib but now i 'm leaning more towards private equity and working with reg d. clients 1031 exchanges etc    1 network if you are n't already seriously get out there and network like hell but do n't just cold call random people you really need to make meaningful connections with people and continue to stay in contact with them you can also learn a lot from wso and various ib books guides etc i have a bunch of that stuff on my google drive from a friend if you want it    and some general   do n't stress about the school you go going to a prestigious school really does help but if you work hard enough make the right connections and are good at what you do you can land a role in ib i know several people that have gone into ib from my school and i would consider us maybe a grade c state school it 's possible   i 'd also recommend looking more at a boutique and middle mark companies rather than your bulge bracket banks it 'll have less competition and could be easier to break into and like some other people are said you really need to get that junior year internship if you want to make it into ib but if you ca n't get into ib right after school do n't fret go somewhere get some experience get your certifications series 7 series 63 etc and try again   know your technicals you need to be able to walk through a dcf an lbo and all of the financial statements in an interview there are billions of guides on how to do this but you need to know this   stay on top of current events just be well versed in how the market is doing which industries are hot right now and what 's not and why   know your story believe it or not but your story and how that aligns with a companies culture is really important i have a friend that did n't make it into a certain firm solely because they just did n't think he was a good enough fit for their culture i want to make a lot of money wo n't work instead think more along the lines of i want to challenge myself   good luck man

in financial theory there is no reason for a difference in investor return to exist between dividend paying and non dividend paying stocks except for tax consequences   this is because in theory a company can either pay dividends to investors who can reinvest the funds themselves or reinvest its capital and earn the same return on that reinvestment and the shareholder still has the choice to sell a fraction of their holdings if they prefer to have cash that theory may not match reality because often companies pay or do n't pay dividends based on their stage of life   for example early stage mining companies often have no free cashflow to pay dividends they are capital intensive until the mines are operational on the other side longstanding companies may have no projects left that would be a   good fit for further investment and so they pay out dividends instead effectively allowing the shareholder to decide where to reinvest the money therefore saying dividend stock can be a proxy for talking about the stage of life + risk and return of a company saying dividend paying implies long standing blue chip company with relatively low capital requirements and a stable business likewise growth stocks non dividend paying implies new startup company that still needs capital and thus is somewhat unproven with a chance for good return to match the higher risk so in theory dividend payment policy makes no difference in practice it makes a difference for two reasons 1 you will most likely be taxed differently on selling stock vs receiving dividends which one is better for you is a specific question relying on your jurisdiction your current income and things like what type of stock how long you hold it for example in canada if you earn ~ < $ 40k your dividends are very likely to have a preferential tax treatment to selling shares for capital gains but your province and specific other numbers would influence this in the united states i believe capital gains are usually preferential as long as you hold the shares for a long time but i am not 100 on this without looking it up 2 dividend policy implies differences in the stage of life risk level of a stock this implication is not guaranteed so be sure you are using other considerations to determine whether this is the case   therefore which dividend policy suits you better depends on your tax position and your risk tolerance

based on the additional comment you gave i would recommend that you keep the capital from the businesses separate as much as possible   it sounds like you wo n't get into any trouble legally if you make loans or transfers of capital from one business into the other but i would suggest that you keep detailed records of any transfers that you do make   the reason why is that in any business it is important to know the economics of how your business makes money if you find yourself making transfers repeatedly then your business model may be bad even if your transfers are only to deal with the cost of poor customers it could still mean that your business model needs to be adjusted   but if it 's a question of the timing of cash flows then there 's really nothing wrong with taking some of the money from your successful pants operation and building up more working capital in your shop

the essential difference b n adr and a common share is that adr do not have voting rights common share has   there are some adr that would in certain conditions get converted to common stock but by and large most adr 's would remain adr 's without any voting rights if you are an individual investor this difference should not matter as rarely one would hold such a large number of shares to vote on general meeting on various issues the other difference is that since many countries have regulations on who can buy common shares for example in india an non resident can not directly buy any share hence he would buy adr thus adr would be priced more in the respective market if there is demand for example technologies an india company has adr on nyse this is more expensive around 1.5 times the price of the common share available in india at current exchange rate thus if you are able to invest with equal ease in hk have broker trading account etc consider the taxation of the gains in hk as well the tax treatment in us for overseas gains then its recommended that you go for common stock in hk else it would make sense to buy in us

it is possible to consolidate mortgages with nationwide in some circumstances quote from their website it is possible to consolidate different mortgages and other debts such as personal loans and credit cards however it does depend on your individual circumstances including the exact type of loans you want to consolidate and whether you are still in a special deal period i personally would be amazed if you could n't get them all in one mortgage without changing provider but i would n't be at all surprised if they forced you to have this one mortgage as a new mortgage rather than adding balances to an existing one my reasoning is as follows coming at it from a different angle whatever there was that required your further borrowing to be in new mortgages rather than added to your existing mortgage will also preclude your multiple mortgages being added to one of your existing mortgages

it 's bringing together something really old with something new and unrelated in a way that is   natural farm fresh produce which makes us think about touching the earth and being in the sunshine with dirt plants and animals around + something that with and connection between people who exist only as consumers   i wf in part because i the shopping experience which had comfortable lighting not freezing aisles emphasized less processed foods and tells you where your food came from i hope that does n't change    the other thing i loved about wf is that it was not overly ad saturated like a safeway would be for example i do n't want to see giant signs from pushing garbage cereal or super bowl promotions encouraging over the top enthusiasm for sub par items to me i find that kind of consumerism depressing whole foods did n't do that   but i guess that 's over

your house is not an asset it is a liability assets feed you eat you robert kiyosaki from a cash flow perspective your primary residence ie your house is an investment but it is not an asset if you add up all the income your primary residence generates and subtract all the expenses it incurs you will see why investment gurus claim this perform the same calculations for a rental property and you 're more likely to find it has a positive cash flow if it has a negative cash flow it 's not an asset either it 's a liability a rental property with a negative cash flow is still an investment but cash flow gurus will tell you it 's a bad investment while it is possible that your house may increase in value and you may be able to sell it for more than you paid will you be able to sell it for more than all of the expenses incurred while living there if so you have an asset   some people will purchase a home in need of repair live in it and upgrade it sell it for profit exceeding all expenses and repeat these people are flipping houses and generating capital gains based on their own hard work in this instance a person 's primary residence can be an asset how much of an asset is calculated when the renovated house is sold

this answer assumes based partly on your and some simplifying assumptions as i see it you have a few options get a mortgage to buy your sister out this avoids any ongoing involvement of your sister which may or may not be a good thing it means you will be paying interest to a bank or similar financial institution make an arrangement to buy the house in installments in combination with some kind of rent likely to be a complex option to set up buy the house using a loan from your sister potentially agree a private mortgage to protect your sister in the event you fail to pay if interest is paid then it is likely to attract tax simply pay your sister rent let her keep ownership of her half of the house either forever or until you have saved up the cash to buy her out rent is likely to attract tax whatever option you go with i would you get advice on any local legal tax issues and drawing up the contracts if you do go into an arrangement that keeps your sister involved make sure you discuss the what ifs upfront and build them into your agreement if you can't won't pay what happens can she insist that the house is sold and the proceeds split in some way can she rent our her half of the house to someone else

so i was working at my dad 's store yesterday so he can take a day off and i do n't have that much experience i occasionally fill in whenever he needs to take a day off for something so yesterday i thought it was my lucky day cause i had two groups of people come in and buy nearly 500 $ worth of items each but with credit cards now once again i do n't have that much experience with this type of work i just sold them the stuff but the procedure was the same as with any other group of people buying multiple items show them multiple stuff bargain and eventually they buy the stuff i entered the price on the machine they put in the card they put in the pin they signed the receipt and it was the end of that turns out both groups used stolen cards so i get a call from my brother today saying both cards were stolen and we might not get the money for the stuff but i pretty much followed the procedure i was told to its just i do n't know why we would n't get the money back

here is a quick and dirty explanation of options in a nutshell you pay a certain amount to buy a contract that gives you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price at some date in the future they come in a few flavors   i 'll give you $ 100 if you let me buy 10,000 shares of xyz for $ 10 more    per share than it is trading at today any time before    august 10th i 'll give you $ 100 if you promise to buy 10,000 shares of xyz from me    for $ 10 less per share than it is trading at today if i ask before august 10th there are also two main types based on the expiration behavior   there are lots of strategies that employ options too many to go into   two key uses are leverage buying call options can give you a much higher return on your investment than just investing in the actual stock however with much higher risk of losing all of your investment instead of just some of it when the stock drops hedging if you already own the underlying stock put options can be used to buy down risk of serious drops in a holding

i also had a student loan and glad you are taking a good look on interest rate as it really makes a huge difference one of the strategies i followed was since my credit improved as i stepped out of school i took advantage of a good 0 percent credit card i applied for discover and got a decent credit limit there are 2 particular things you are looking for in a credit card in this situation   usually the initial $ 0 transaction charge is only for a couple of months so ensure you take advantage of that what is the benefit imagine being able to pay off that higher interest rate balance with 0 and not have to worry about it immediately that way you save on the interest you would be paying and stress as well watch out for although you have to ensure that you do payoff the money you paid through the 0 percent credit card which may have been put off for a year or even 15 months or so other wise you may have to pay it all at once as the offer is expiring note for credit cards ensure to note when the 0 is expiring as that is usually not mentioned on the statement and you may have to call the customer service i was in a similar situation and was able to pay it all off fairly quickly i am sure you will as well

hi we are looking to connect with uk medical technology companies and other relevant people who could help us complete a project we are currently working on   we are currently representatives of a consortium of based in the middle east and iran     with the lifting of international sanctions by the 5 + 1 group of nations and in early 2016 on iran has resulted in our clients being very interested in purchasing and becoming official distributors off medical equipment from the uk   i have had some lengthy discussions with this team in dubai and and i 'm told the the domestic persian market has a very deep sense of of affiliation with german italian and french companies whom have been involved more in the persian gulf region than britain since 2012   one key point i did however notice is the demand and respect that british tech commands   this has encouraged our team to take on this project to help these guys access the products they require    they are interested in buying from uk manufacturing and reselling it as official distributors to the domestic persian markets population     they are also very interested in with and acquiring the licences to uk medical technologies which they would like to then buy the rights too or licence franchise for their locality and they have the capacity to invest in manufacturing this product in the middle east working in conjunction with the uk companies   an example of how this has worked in the past is the french car manufacturer working in collaboration with iranian engineering company to produce and manufacture car   which looks very much like a but is infact designed and developed   specifically for the local market and is also manufactured locally   this is a huge success and we feel we can imitate its success in our plan too   i have been in discussions with a number of sources where i could possibly complete this project through   i have come to know from my research globally within this sector that there are approx 3500 medical technology companies registered in the uk    all specialising in various fields   i was wondering is there a database anywhere which i ca n't access to see whom and where these companies are exactly in the uk     i have until now   established that between 70 80 of companies worldwide in med tech field are based in or affiliated with either the usa or israel   with the majority of the remaining 20 of companies being european or japanese   there are also many between euro companies which was quiet pleasing for me to see     we fully understand that the usa under trump have the sanction for usa   however our understanding is that we in the uk are not at present restricted by sanctions to trade with iranian companies    we strongly feel that the british medical technology sector here in the uk could benefit considerably it could also help it to progress   and grow to take a bigger global market share as well bring in 100s of millions in revenues for the uk economy   we strongly feel that with brexit negotiations in the pipeline as well as the geo political situation that the world finds itself in right now that this is the right time to work in collaboration with this consortium and help them with completion of this project successfully and   we strongly feel though that the due diligence carried in any trade deals needs to be within a framework of eu uk regulations and in compliance with any un or other sanctions we are un aware off   we had been planning to use due diligence guidelines from the usa when dealing with iranian companies however we feel this is the main reason why france and germany along with italy are winning all the contracts in iran and with the help of relevant government departments we would like to develop our own plan for this based on the current situation   we would like this to be the beginning of a number of high level trade deals we are in negotiations with right now with high level middle eastern business in dubai kuwait     we feel britain has missed it to france and germany when it comes to iran and would like to work with all the relevant departments to create a due diligence plan which is effective and helps us reach our goals   i would appreciate any advice you can give us in this respect   thanks   star senior project manager

there is empirical data to suggest deregulation in healthcare would drive down prices in a free market where prices are transparent prices go down    as to your pharmaceutical example that is a form of protectionism regulation the reason why epipen is able to charge that price is because they have a patent protection protectionism that lasts through 2025 lack of there is no substitute    if there were a reform in pharma laws that made pharmaceutical company have to share their patents for licensing costs similar to how cellular providers must provide access to their networks for a fee then the price would go down    market forces do reign supreme it is supply and demand as simple as that if there is a market with a lot of profit in a free market participants will enter the market until the profit drops down to zero that is why you can not charge 10 dollars for a big mac in the same city where a mcdonalds 1 mile away charges 5 dollars

to follow up on quid 's comment the share classes themselves will define what level of dividends are expected note that the terms common shares and preferred shares are generally understood terms but are not as precise as you might believe   there are dozens hundreds of different characteristics that could be written into share classes in the company 's articles of incorporation as long as those characteristics are legal in corporate law in the company 's jurisdiction so in answering your question there 's a bit of an assumption that things are working as usual note that private companies often have odd quirks to their share classes things like weird small classes of shares that have most of the voting rights or shares with shotgun buyback clauses as long as they are legal clauses they can be used to help control how the business is run between various shareholders with competing interests things like parents anticipating future family infighting and trying to prevent familial struggle you are unlikely to see such weird quirks in public companies where the company will have additional regulatory requirements and where the public wo n't want any shock at unexpected share clauses in your case you suggested having a non cumulative preferred share with no voting rights but that does n't impact dividend payment there are two salient points left related to payout that the articles of incorporation will need to define for the share classes 1 what is the redemption value for the shares this is usually equal to the cost of subscribing for the shares in the first place it represents how much the business will need to pay the shareholder in the event of redemption recall 2 what is the stated dividend amount this is usually defined at a rate that 's at or a little above a reasonable interest rate at the time the shares are created but defined as $ share for example the shares could have $ 1 share dividend payment where the shares originally cost $ 50 each to subscribe this would reflect a rate of payment of about 2 typically by corporate law dividends must be paid to preferred shares to the extent required based on the characteristics of the share class some preferred shares may not have any required dividends at all before any dividends can be paid to common shares so if $ 10k in dividends is to be paid and total preferred shares require $ 15k of non cumulative dividends each year then $ 0 will be paid to the common shares the following year $ 15k of dividends will once again need to be paid to the preferred shares before any can be paid to the common shares

yes this happens a lot and in many cases companies do n't even know this is happening collateralized debt obligations frequently contain pieces of the same financial products where it is not obvious what the underlying asset is it gets complicated to explain but i can make an analogy to a portfolio of stocks you might create your portfolio contains companies and those companies also own some of the other companies in your same portfolio the value of all the companies in your portfolio are very even though you thought you made diversified investments under the idea that they ca n't all do poorly at the exact same time except they can if the value of the company 's shares are solely based on the value of other company 's shares but nobody noticed that none of them have an actual robust operations this was a key factor of the financial disaster around 2008 but this problem was solved with the addition of additional disclaimers that all investors agree to so they know what they are buying

all great answers the only thing i did n't see mentioned was that student loans are not in a bankruptcy so for example if you took money that could have gone to student loans and poured it into other debt then for some reason declared bankruptcy later your student load debt would remain while other debt would be discharged essentially that money would have been better spent on the student loan this is n't to advocate that you should pay down student loans with the intent of declaring bankruptcy or that this makes it a better decision necessarily just a factor that is sometimes forgotten

yes timing does matter using a simple rate of change indicator over the past 100 days and out with a 50 day moving average i have plotted the s&p 500 since the start of 2007   the idea is to buy when the roc indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when the roc indicator crosses below the zero line i have compared the results below of timing the markets from the start of 2007 to dollar cost averaging starting from the start of 2007 and investing every 6 months $ 80k is invested in both cases   for the timing the market option $ 80k was invested at the start of 2007 then the total figure was sold out when a sell signal was given then the total amount reinvested when a new buy signal was given for the dca option $ 5000 was invested every 6 months starting from the start of 2007 until the last investment at the start of july 2014 the results are below   timing the markets results in more than double the returns not including dividends and brokerage edit it has been brought up that i have n't considered tax in my timing the market option so i have updated my timing the market spread sheet to take into account both long term and short term cgt in the usa for someone on the highest tax bracket the results are below   the result is still almost a 2x higher returns for the timing the markets option   also note that even with the dca option you will have to sell one day and pay cgt on any profits there however the real danger with the dca option is if you need to sell during a market downturn and not make any profits at all

when you invest in a property you pay money to purchase the property you did n't have to spend the money on the property though you could have invested it in the stock market instead and expected to make a 4 annualized real rate of return or thereabouts so if you want to know whether something 's a good investment ask whether your annual net income will be more or less than 4 of the money you put into it and whether it is more or less risky than the stock market and try to judge accordingly predicting the net income though is a can of worms doubly so when some of your expenses are n't dollar denominated e.g. the time you spend dealing with the property personally and others need to be amortized over an unpredictable period of time how long will that furnace repair really last moreover your annualized capital gain and rental income is also unpredictable rent increases in a given area can not be expected to conform to a predetermined mathematical formula ultimately it is impossible to predict in the general case if it were possible we probably would have skipped that last housing bubble so no single simple formula exists

the gift issue as explained to me by the mortgage officer at our credit union is that they look at the average balance of your checking savings accounts of the 3 6 months prior to mortgage issuance date they look at the average balance to make sure you are financially stable beyond what your income and credit score indicate with an average balance of $ 2500 the bank will reasonably presume you cannot make a $ 10k down payment by not using the $ 10k gift from dad you 're showing the bank that you 're more financially stable than if it came in and went right back out that looks like you 're a free spender and it will cast doubt on your willingness ability to repay the loan presuming your average balances are already ok the best way to utilize the gift from dad is in one of the following manners in my opinion

you 'll still lose a little bit if you buy a put option at the current price   no such thing as free hedging let 's say you have 100 shares of iau that you bought for exactly $ 12.50 per share   this is $ 1,250   now let 's say you bought a put option with a strike price of $ 13 that expires in april 2011   the current price for this option is $ 1.10 per share or $ 110   you can sell your iau for $ 1,300 any time before the expiration date but this leaves $ 60 in time value the price of the options will always have a time component that is a premium on the difference between the current price and the strike price   oh forgot to add in commissions to this

for now we can pay off our debt in united states dollars if we lose our reserve currency status we would have to pay it off with a different currency if we continued printing money we would be our currency against the new reserve currency which would mean that after we took on too much debt we would n't really be able to pay our creditors back after exchanging our devalued currency for the new one on the international markets we are lucky enough not to have to worry about this now but i think op was referring to all countries in these situations other countries do n't have the luxury of just printing out massive amounts of money to pay off their debts that is why i am saying that america has a very view of reality when it comes to deficit spending we would n't have that any more if the un followed through with its suggestion to create a global reserve currency or reverted back to the gold standard i do n't think the second option is nearly as realistic but we never know

if you sell a stock you do n't own it 's called a short sale you borrowed the shares from an owner of the stock and eventually would buy to close on most normal shares you can hold a short position indefinitely but there are some shares that have a combination of either a small float or too high a short position that shares to short are not available   this can create a short squeeze where shorts are burned by being forced to buy the stock back   last when you did this you should have instructed the broker that you were selling to open or selling short in the old days when people held stock certificates you were required to send the certificate in when you sold today the broker should know that was n't your intention

the short answer is that the people who know are n't saying lisa blog author at ft has made a effort at figuring it out but working from what is publicly known and making some reasonable assumptions she ca n't even find $ 1 billion of losses much less 9    all we know for sure is that jpm sold massive amounts of protection on a particular cds index roughly that means that they sold insurance on a group of 125 companies and they would lose money if one of those companies went bankrupt or looked like it might go bankrupt and make money if those companies look less likely to go bankrupt    however they were certainly combining that position with other offsetting positions since their banking business loses money when companies go bankrupt it would make sense if they protected themselves with an even more massive position that made money when companies went bankrupt    a common strategy is to bet that the price of 1 thing will go up and the price of a very similar thing will go down so you are protected and can make money if both prices go up or if both go down however if the 2 things are not as similar as you thought you can lose money from both bets that 's what seems to have happened to jpm   dimon has basically said that jpm screwed up their calculations and positions that they thought were offsetting were not     what also seems likely is that other companies figured out that jp morgan had massive amounts of certain things that they needed to sell so jpm was forced to sell at bad prices you never want to play poker against someone who can see your hole cards   so my speculative theory is that the main point of the trading was to protect jpm if other companies went bankrupt but they did it with a complicated strategy that included selling protection they got the calculations wrong and then they were forced to sell at bad prices to other companies who knew they had to sell

when a stock is going to become public there 's a level of analysis required to figure out the range of ipo price that makes sense for a company that 's somewhat mature and has a sector to compare it to you can come up with a range that would be pretty close for the recent linkedin it 's tougher to price a somewhat unique company running at a loss in a market rich with cash looking for the next great deal if one gives this any thought an opening price that 's so far above the ipo price represents a failure of the underwriters to price it correctly it means the original owners just sold for far less than the market thought they were worth on day one the day of ipo the stock opens similar to how any stock would open at 9:30 there are bids and asks and a price at which supply the ask and demand bid balance for this ipo it would appear that there were enough buyers to push the price to twice the anticipated open and it 's maintained that level since   it 's possible to have a different system in which a dutch auction is used to make the shares public in theory this can work it 's just not used commonly

your first and second paragraphs are two different cases moving money between a checking account and a savings account will credit cash and debit cash making a gl transaction unnecessary unless the amounts in the two bank accounts are tracked as two separate gl accounts you might have account cash checking and account cash savings in that case a movement of money between these two accounts should be tracked by a transaction between the gl accounts credit checking debit savings it wo n't affect your balance sheet but depending on your definition of liquidity of assets   it might affect working capital on your statement of cash flows if you consider the savings account illiquid then money moved to it is a decrease in working capital basically what you are creating with your store credit accounts for each client is an unearned revenue account when clients pay you cash for work you have n't done yet or you refund money for a return as store credit instead of cash the credit is a liability account balancing an increase in cash inventory or an expense if you 're giving credit for free perhaps due to a mistake on your part you would debit a store credit expense account this can be split out client by client in the gl if you wish avoiding the need for a holding account the way you want to do it you 'd have a client holding account it must be unique in the gl and to the client and yes it is a liability account to transfer to holding you simply debit unearned revenue and credit client holding logging the transaction as transfer of client store credit or similar moving liability to liability balance sheet does n't change then as you sell goods or services to the client you debit accounts receivable and credit revenue then to record the payment you credit ar and debit client holding up to its current credit balance after which the client pays you cash and you debit that or the client still owes you to zero out a remaining balance on the holding account debit client holding and credit unearned revenue i do n't think the holding account the way you want to use it is a good idea if you want to track each customer 's store credit balance with a gl account then create specialized unearned revenue accounts for each client who gets a store credit named for the client and containing their balance zero or otherwise if you do n't care about it at the gl level then pool it in one unearned revenue account have one store credit account if you must and track individual amounts off the books

i 'm going to post this as an answer because it 's from the gofundme website but ultimately even they say to speak with a tax professional about it   am i responsible for taxes us only while this is by no means a guarantee donations on gofundme are    simply considered to be personal gifts which are not for the most    part taxed as income in the us however there may be particular    case specific instances where the income is taxable dependent on    amounts received and use of the monies etc      we 're unable to    provide specific tax advice since everyone 's situation is different    and tax rules can change on a yearly basis we advise that you    maintain adequate records of donations received and consult with your    personal tax adviser      additionally wepay will not report the funds    you collect as earned income it is up to you and a tax professional    to determine whether your proceeds represent taxable income the    person who 's listed on the wepay account and ultimately receives the    funds may be responsible for taxes      again every situation is    different so please consult with a tax professional in your area en us i responsible for taxes us and here 's a blurb from which adds to the confusion but enforces the speak with a professional idea crowdfunding services have to report to the irs campaigns that total    at least $ 20,000 and 200 transactions money collected from    crowdfunding is considered either income or a gift this is where things get a little tricky if money donated is not a    gift or investment it is considered taxable income even a gift could    be subject to the gift tax but that tax applies only to the gift    giver non taxable gifts these are donations made without the expectation of getting something    in return think of all those fans who gave money to    gofundme to help the cost of tom ’s nfl fine    for those fans are n’t expecting anything in return    except maybe some satisfaction so their donations are considered    gifts under irs rules an individual can give another individual a    gift of up to $ 14,000 without tax implications so unless a fan    is particularly generous his or her gofundme gift wo n’t be taxed taxable income now consider that same fan donating $ 300 to a business    venture if the fan receives stock or equity in the company in return    for the donation this is considered an investment and is not taxable    however if the business owner does not offer stock or equity in the    company the money donated could be considered business income and the    recipient would need to report it on a tax return

when you buy a share of stock you are almost always buying from someone who previously purchased that share and now wants to sell it the money minus broker 's fee goes to that other investor which may be a person a company rarely the company that issued the stock but that will occasionally be the case an investment fund the market maker for that stock for definition of that term or anyone else they owned a small percentage of the company you bought it from them and gave them the money for it just as you would buy anything else you do n't know or care who you bought from they do n't know or care who they sold to the market just found a buyer and seller who could agree on the price there are a very few exceptions to that the company may repurchase some of its own shares and/or sell them again depending on its own financial needs and obligations for example my own employer has to purchase its own shares periodically so it has enough on hand to sell to employees at a slight discount   through the employee stock ownership program but you generally do n't know that 's who you 're selling to it happens like any other transaction and during the initial public offering if you 're lucky privileged enough to get in on the first wave of purchases you 're buying from the investment bank that 's managing this process though that 's an almost vanishingly rare case for retail investors like us we 're more likely to get the shares after someone has already pushed the price up a bit but really when you buy a share the money goes to whoever you bought it from and that 's all you can know or need to know

actually you 're missing the key feature of cdos   most cdos use much to our economic misery ultimately a system call   to simplify this idea i 'll make a two example   suppose i buy mortgages covering a face value of $   because they are subprime if i just put them in a pool and finance them with bonds the rating will be lousy and most investors will shun them at least investors who are safety oriented   what i do is divide them into two tranches   one bond issue is for $ 100,000,000 and another for $   the idea is that any defaulting mortgage comes out of the latter bond issue   i 'll probably keep these bonds the lower   thus buyers of the first issue are safe unless defaults exceed $   then the rating agencies rate the first issue aaa and it gets snapped up by investors   in a strict sense it is basically the entire $ backs up the first bond issue in reality many cdos had multiple tranches with the lowest being retained by the underwriters and the other tranches sold as bonds of various ratings

the way deductions work normally does not take into account what account the transaction was made using   i.e. you report your gross income your deductions and they subtract the deductions from the income   what 's left is your taxable income    the tricky part comes with pre tax contributions to tax advantaged accounts like 401(k   those plans require the contributions to be made by your company   since contributions to 529 plans are not deductible on your federal income taxes the money is not going to be directly deposited so it does not matter how the money goes into the plan   just make sure you keep a record of your contributions

why would it not make more sense to invest in a handful of these    instead of also having to carry the weight of the other    450 some of which are mostly just baggage first a cap weighted index fund will invest more heavily in larger cap companies so the baggage you speak of does take up a smaller percentage of the portfolio 's value not that cap always equates to better performance there are also equal weighted index funds where each company in the index is given equal weight in the portfolio if you could accurately pick winners and losers then of course you could beat index funds but on average they 've performed well enough that there 's little incentive for the average investor to look elsewhere   a handful of stocks opens you up to more risk an enron in your handful would be pretty devastating if it comprised a large percentage of your portfolio additionally since you pay a fee on each transaction $ 5 in your example you have to out perform a low fee index fund significantly or be investing a very large amount of money to come out ahead you get diversification and low fees with an index fund

take the case where a stock has just two owners a and b both at $ 10 one of them sells his shares to c at $ 11   now b has made $ 1 in profit but is no longer an owner of the stock a has n't sold anything but his shares are worth 10 more due to the last traded price printed c has bought shares at $ 11 and the price is $ 11 so technically he has n't lost any money in a larger market there are winners and losers every day on a single stock but they may not remain owners of a stock there could be days in which those that remain owners are all winners say when a stock goes up to an all time high and all those that are currently owners have an average buy price lower than the last traded price and the reverse applies too   it is of course more complicated say you own a stock and let someone else borrow it for a short selling opportunity he sells it in the market for each uptick in price you win the short seller loses and the guy he sold it to also wins a person that has a covered call on a stock is not a winner beyond a point and so on

the amount stated is the total amount of money the customer will be paying to the company how much profit that will translate into is dependent on the type of contract   some types of contracts cost plus fixed fee they are paid what it costs to complete the contract plus a fee on top of that that fee represents their profits the costs will include salary benefits overhead equipment supplies firm fixed price they perform the service and they get paid a fixed amount if their costs are higher than they forecast then they may lose money if they can be more efficient than they forecast then they make more money time and materials they are paid for completing each sub task based on the number of hours it takes to complete each sub task plus materials this is used to hire a company to maintain a fleet of trucks if the trucks are used a lot they will need more standard maintenance plus additional repairs based on the type of use they pay x for labor and y for materials for an oil change but a for labor and b for materials for a complete engine rebuild   there are many variations on these themes some put the risk on the customer some on the company   how and when the company is paid is based on the terms of the contract some pay x% a month others pay based on meeting some pay based on the number of tasks completed in each time period some contracts run for a specific period of time others have an initial period plus option years the article may or may not specify if the quoted amount is the minimum amount of the contract or the maximum amount the impact on the stock price is much more complex much more needs to be known about the structure of the contract and who will be providing the service to determine if there will be profits some companies will bid to lose money if it will serve as a bridge to another contract or to fill a gap that will allow them to delay layoffs

equal weighted indexes are not theoretically meant to be less volatile or less risky they 're just a different way to weigh stocks in an index if you had a problem that hurt small caps more than large caps an equal weighted index will be hurt more than a market cap weighted one   on the other hand if you consider that second rung companies have come up to replace the top layer it makes sense to weigh them on par   history changes on a per country basis in india for instance the market 's so small at the lower cap end that big money only the large caps which go up more in a liquidity driven move but in a more secular period like the last 18 months we see that smaller caps have outperformed

generally investing in index tracking funds in the long term poses relatively low risk compared to short term investment aka speculation no one says differently however it is a higher risk than money market savings bonds the reason for that is that the return is not guaranteed and loss is not limited here volatility plays part as well as general market conditions although the volatility risk also affects bonds at some level as well while long term trend may be upwards short term trend may be significantly different take as an example year 2008 for s&p500 if by any chance you needed to liquidate your investment in november 2008 after investing in november 1998 you might have ended up with 0 gain or even loss had you waited just another year or liquidated a year earlier the result would be significantly different that 's the volatility risk you do n't invest indefinitely even when you invest long term at some point you 'll have to liquidate your investment higher volatility means that there 's a higher chance of downward spike just at that point of time killing your gains even if the general trend over the period around that point of time was upward as it was for s&p500 for example for the period 1998 2014 with the significant downward spikes in 2003 and 2008 if you invest in major indexes these kinds of risks are hard to avoid as they 're all tied together so you need to diversify between different kinds of investments bonds vs stocks as the books parrot and/or different markets not only us but also foreign

does the sentence apply for etfs and etf companies no the value of an etf is determined by an exchange and thus the value of the share is whatever the trading price is thus the price of an etf may go up or down just like other securities money market funds can be a bit different as the mutual fund company will typically step in to avoid breaking the buck that could happen as a failure for that kind of fund to wit    must etf companies invest a dollar in the etf for every dollar that an    investor deposited in this etf no because an etf is traded as shares on the market unless you are using the creation redemption mechanism for the etf you are buying and selling shares like most retail investors i 'd suspect if you are using the creation redemption system then there are baskets of other securities that are being swapped either for shares in the etf or from shares in the etf

i think the key point that 's making the other commenters misunderstand each other here is the concept of deductions i can only speak for the uk but that 's only a concept that business owners would understand in this country   for things like child credits or low income tax credits we do n't get paid them at the end of the tax year but into our bank accounts every couple of weeks all year round therefore we have nothing to deduct if we work for a company and have business expenses then the company pays for them if we make interest on our savings the bank pays it for us we make money at our jobs and the employer works out what taxes and national insurance we owe based on a tax code that the government works out for us annually which we can challenge   to be fair it 's not like we 're free from bureaucracy if we want to claim these benefits there are often lots of forms if you want child benefit or disability allowances for instance we just apply as soon as we 're eligible rather than waiting to get a lump sum rebate so it appears to be a very different system and neither is inherently better than the other though i 'm personally glad i do n't usually have to fill in a big tax return myself which i only did one year when i was self employed i 'd be interested to know since google has let me down which countries use the american system and which the british or czech

it used to be quite easy for students to get credit cards when i was in college in the early 1980s credit card companies set up tables in the student center and offered low limit cards along with free t shirts on an almost daily schedule the credit card act of 2009 made this much more difficult for banks if you have a bank or credit union account the first thing i would do is talk to them about getting a card some banks offer a visa student card specifically for college students my daughter was able to get one when she turned 18 just before starting college the credit limit is very low $ 200 for increasing each year until the limit is $ 500 during senior year after graduation it converts to a regular visa account with a limit that depends on post graduation income and the now established 4 years of credit history the visa web site has a list of banks offering this type of card now i will give you the same unsolicited advice i gave my daughter and the same advice i think most others here would give you for building credit this kind of card is excellent but you should still use it very sparingly and pay off the balance every month make it a hard rule to never pay interest on a credit card bill i told her to charge perhaps one or two purchases totaling no more than $ each month and pay them off as soon as the statement arrives this is much easier if you have a deposit account at the same bank since you will be able to pay the bill instantly on line have your employer direct deposit your paychecks into that bank account if at all possible

i wrote a spreadsheet < < it may not be obvious this is a link to pull down the spreadsheet a while back that might help you you can start by putting your current salary next to your age adjust the percent of income saved 14 for you and put in the current total   the sheet basically shows that if one saves 15 from day one of working and averages an 8 return they are on track to save over 20x their final income and at the 4 withdrawal rate will replace 80 of their income remember if they save 15 and at retirement the 7.65 fica goes away so it 's 100 of what they had anyway for what it 's worth a 10 average return drops what you need to save down to 9 i say to a young person try to start at 15 better that when you 're 40 you realize you 're well ahead of schedule and can relax a bit than to assume that 8 9 is enough to save and find you need a large increase to catch up   to answer specifically here there are those who concluded that 4 is a safe withdrawal rate so by targeting 20x your final income as retirement savings you 'll be able to retire well   retirement spending needs are not the same for everyone when i cite an 80 replacement rate it 's a guess a rule of thumb that many point out is flawed the real number is your true spending need which of course can be far higher or lower the younger investor is going to have a far tougher time guessing this number than someone a decade away from retiring the 80 is just a target to get started it should shift to the real number in your 40s or 50s as that number becomes clear   next i see my original answer did n't address social security benefits the benefit is n't linear a lower wage earner can see a benefit of as much as 50 of what they earned each year while a very high earner would see far less as the benefit has a maximum a $ 90k earner will see 30 or less the social security site does a great job of giving you your projected benefit and you can adjust target savings accordingly   2016 update the prior 20 years returned cagr considering there were 2 crashes one of which was called a mini depression is pretty remarkable for what it 's worth my adult investing life started in 1984 and i 've seen a cagr of for forecasting purposes i think 8 long term is a conservative number   to answer member comment the 10 years from 2006 2015 had a cagr of time has a way of averaging that lost decade the 00 's to a more reasonable number

in addition to what others have said i think it is important to consider that government retirement assistance whatever it is called in each instance is basically a promise that can be revoked i talked to a retired friend of mine just yesterday and we got onto that subject she mentioned that when she was young the promise was for 90 of one 's pay paid by the government after retiring it is very different today yes you can gamble that you wo n't need the saved money and thus decide not to save anything what then if you do end up needing the money you did not set aside but rather spent you are just now graduating college and assuming of course that you get a decently paying job are likely going to have loads more money than you are used to if you make an agreement with yourself to set aside even just 10 15 of the difference in income right from the start that is going to grow into a pretty sizable nest egg by the time you approach retirement age then you will have the option of continuing to work maybe part time or quitting in a way you would not have had otherwise now i 'm going to pull numbers out of thin air but suppose that you currently have $ 1000/month net before expenses and can get a job that pays $ net starting out 10 15 of the difference means you 'll be saving around $ 100/month for retirement in 35 years assuming no return on investment pessimistic but works if returns match inflation and no pay rises that will still be over $ that 's somewhere on the order of $ added to your retirement income for 25 years multiply with whatever inflation rate you think is likely if you prefer nominal values it becomes even more if you save a significant fraction of the additional pay if you save 1/3 of the additional money note that you still effectively get a 50 raise compared to what you have been living on before that gives you a net income of $ 1500/month instead of $ 1800 $ 500/month more rather than $ 800/month more which grows into about $ 110 k in 35 years assuming no return on investment nearly $ 400 per month for 25 years $ 100 per week is hardly chump change in retirement and it is still quite realistic for most people to save 30 of the money they did not have before

i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by this statement   as a libertarian myself the only thing that 's really surprising to me is that it was keynes who said it it 's pretty much standard fare for socioeconomic thought to decry corporatism rent seeking while simultaneously praising and capitalism as we understand it to be   all this is saying to me is that keynes understood what capitalism was but recommended what he recommended anyhow which is unfortunate but not really surprising now that i think about it given how the chicago school operates in general

i was in a similar situation and used fx trading to hedge against currency fluctuations i bought the new currency when the ppp implied valuation of my old currency was high and was able to protect quite a bit of purchasing power that i would have lost without the hedge unfortunately you get taxed for the gain you made but still helpful    in terms of housing market you could look into a ireland reit index but it may not correlate well with the actual house prices you are looking for

from the irs perspective there 's no difference between your taxes and your sole proprietorship 's taxes they 're all just your taxes while i could see it being very useful and wise to track your business 's activities separately and use separate bank accounts and the like this is just a convenience to help you in your personal accounting and not something that needs to relate directly to how tax forms are completed or taxes are paid when calculating your taxes if you want to figure out how much you owe vs. how much your business owes you 'll have to do so yourself one approach might be just to take the amount that your schedule c puts as income on your return and multiply by your marginal tax rate another approach might be to have your tax software run the calculations as though you had no business income and see what just your personal taxes would have been without the business if you think of the business income as being first and should use up the lower brackets rather than your personal income maybe do it the other way around and have your software run the calculations as though you had only the business income and no other personal investment income and see what the amount of taxes would be then once you 've figured out a good allocation the actual mechanics of paying some personal tax amount from your personal bank account and some business tax amount from your business bank account are up to you i 'd probably just transfer the money from my business account to my personal account and pay all the taxes from the personal account writing two separate checks one from each account that total to the correct amount i 'm sure would work just fine as well you can probably make separate payments from each account electronically through direct pay or as well as long as all taxes are paid by the deadline i do n't think the irs is too picky about the details of how many payments are made

a lot will depend on wether you have in your possession the physical share documents or just numbers in your brokerage portfolio electronic shares are not traceable as they do not exist as individual entities etrade certainly knows who bought how much but no concept of which ones lets say et buys 1000 shares of acme their database looks like this now they sell 400 shares to bob bob sells 200 alice buys 100 skipped one transaction for did alice get 100 shares out of et 's original 1000 or did she get 100 shares that were previously owned by bob or 27 from et and 73 from et another less exact way to picture the process is one share is of liquid if you return to the pot it becomes indistinguishable from the rest

while derivative pricing models are better modeling reality as academia invests more into the subject none sufficiently do if for example one assumes that stock returns are for the purposes of pricing options like black scholes does the only true dependent variable becomes log standard deviation otherwise known as volatility producing the infamous volatility smile which disappears in the cases of models with more factors accounting for other mathematical moments such as mean skew and etc   still these more advanced models are flawed and suffer the same extreme time mispricing as black scholes   in other words one can model anything however one wants but the worse the model the stranger the results since volatility for a given expiration should be constant across all strikes and is with better models in the case of pricing dividends these can be adjusted for the many complexities of taxation but the model becomes ever more complex and extremely expensive for each eventuality   furthermore with more complexity in any model the likelihood of discovering a closed form in the short run is less for equities in a low interest rate not high dividend yield not low volatility low dividend tax environment the standard swap pricing models will not provide results much different from one where a single low tax rate on dividends is assumed if one is pricing a swap on equity outside of the bounds above the dividend tax rate could have more of an effect but for computational efficiency applying a single assumed dividend tax rate would be optimal with instead of d in a formula where d is the dividend paid and x is the tax rate in short a closed form model is only as good as its assumptions so if anomalies appear between the actual prices of swaps in the market and a swap model then that model is less correct than the one with smaller anomalies of the same type   in other words if pricing equity swaps without a dividend tax rate factored more closely matches the actual prices than pricing with dividend taxes factored then it could be assumed that pricing without a dividend tax factored is superior   this all depends upon the data and there does n't seem to be much in academia to assist with a conclusion if equity swaps do truly provide a tax advantage and both parties to a swap transaction are aware of this fact then it seems unlikely swap sellers would n't demand some of the tax advantage back in the form of a higher price   a model is no defense since volatility curves persist despite what black scholes says they should be

this is a great question i 've been an entrepreneur and small business owner for 20 + years and have started small businesses in 3 states that grew into nice income streams for me i 've lived off these businesses for 20 + years so i know it can be done first let me start by saying that the rules regulations requirements and laws for operating a business small or large legally for the most part are local laws and regulations depending on what your business does you may have some federal rules to follow but for the most part it will be your locality state county city that determines what you 'll have to do to comply and be legal also though it might be better in some cases to incorporate and even required in some circumstances you do n't always have to there are many small businesses think etc that get income from their business operations and do so as individuals of course everyone has to pay taxes so as long as you property record your income and expenses and properly file your tax returns every year you are income tax legal   i wo n't try to answer the income tax question here though as that can be a big question also though you certainly can start a business on your own without hiring lawyers or other professionals more on that below when it comes to taxes i definitely recommend you indeed plan to hire a tax professional even if it 's something like h&r block or jackson etc in some cities there might even be free tax preparation services by certain organizations that want to help the community and these are often available even to small businesses in general income taxes can be complicated and the rules are always changing i 've found that most small business owners that try to file their own taxes generally end up paying a lot more taxes than they 're required to in essence they are overpaying running a business and making a profit can be hard enough so on to of that you do n't need to be paying more than you are required to   also i am going to assume that since it sounds like it would be a business of one you that you wo n't have a payroll that is another area that can be complicated for sure ok with those generics out of the way let me tackle your questions related to starting and operating a business since you have the idea for your business pretty figured out will you have to pay any substantial amount of money to attorneys or advisors or accountants or to register with the government not necessarily since the rules for operating a business legally vary by your operating location where you will be providing the service or performing your work you can certainly research this on your own it might take a little time but it 's doable if you stick with it some resources the state of florida where i live has an excellent page at you might not be in florida but almost every state will have something similar what all do i need to do to remain on the right side of the law and the smart side of business   all of the answers above still apply to this question but here are a few more items to consider you will want to keep good records of all expenses directly related to the business if you license some content stock images for example you 'll want to document receipts these are easy usually as you know directly if you subscribe to the apple developer program which you 'll need to if you intend to sell apps in the apple app stores the subscription is an expense against your business income etc you will want to keep good records of indirect costs these are not so easy to figure out and where a good accountant will help you when this becomes significant but these are important and a lot of business owners hurt themselves by not considering these what do i mean well you need an office in order to produce your work right you might need a computer a phone internet electricity heat etc all of which allow you to create a working environment that allows you to produce your product the irs and state tax authorities all provide ways for you to quantify these and count them as legitimate business expenses no you ca n't use 100 of your electric bill since your office might be inside your home and the entire bill is not just for your business but you are certainly entitled to some part of that bill to count as a business expense again i do n't want to get too far down the income tax rabbit hole but you still need to keep track of what you spend you must keep good record of all your income this is especially important when you have money coming in from various sources a payroll gifts from friends business income from clients and/or the app stores etc do not just assume that copies of your bank deposits tell the whole story bank statements might tell you the amount and date of a deposit but you do n't really know where that money came from unless you are tracking it the good news is that the above record keeping can be quite easy with something like quicken or quickbooks or many many other such popular programs you will want to ensure you have the needed licenses not necessarily required at all for a lot of small businesses especially home based businesses depending on your business activity you might want to consider business liability insurance again this will depend on your clients and/or other business entities you 'll be dealing with some might require you to have some insurance   will be efforts even be considered a business initially until some amount of money actually starts coming in   this might be a legal accountant question as to the very specific answer from the pov of the law and taxing authorities however consider that not all businesses make any money at all for a long time and they definitely are a business for instance twitter was losing money for a long time years and no one would argue they were not a business again deferring to the attorneys cpas here for the legal answer the practical answer is that you 're performing some business activity when you start creating a product and working hard to make it happen i would consider acting as a business regardless what things do i need to do up front and what things can i defer to later especially in light of the fact that it might be several months to a couple years before any substantial income starts coming in this question 's answer could be quite long there are potentially many items you can defer   however one i can say is that you might consider deferring incorporation an individual can perform a business activity and draw income from it legally in a lot of situations for tax purposes this is sometimes referred to as schedule c income i 'm not saying incorporation is a bad thing it can shield you from a lot of issues but i am saying that it 's not necessary on day 1 for a lot of small businesses having said that this too can be easy to do on your own many companies offer services so you can incorporate for a few hundred dollars if you do incorporate as a small business of one person i would definitely consider a tax concept called an s corp to avoid paying double taxes but here too we 've gone down the tax rabbit hole again

the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index   that means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant the dow divisor   the value of the dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the   this has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price   that is if a stock costing $ 100 per share goes up by 1 that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $ 10 per share goes up by the same 1 now look at the price of google   it 's currently trading at just a under $ 700 per share   most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $ 30 and $ 150 so if google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index   that means that relatively small in google 's price would completely dominate the index on any given day   until june of 2014 apple was in the same boat with its stock trading at about $ 700 per share   at that time apple split its stock and after that its stock price was a little under $ 100 per share   so post split apple might be a candidate to be included in the dow the next time they change up the components of the index   since the dow is fixed at 30 stocks and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors this probably would n't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason   correction apple is in the djia and has been for a little over a year now   mea the dow 's price weighting is unusual as stock indices go   most indices are weighted by market capitalization   that means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value   this causes large companies like apple to have a lot of influence on those indices but since market capitalization is n't as arbitrary as stock price most people see that as ok   also notice that i said company and not stock   when a company has multiple classes of share as google does market cap weighted indices include all of the share classes while the dow has no provision for such situations which is another albeit less important reason why google is n't in the dow   keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the s&p 500   the answer is currently 505 finally you might be wondering why the dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations   the answer is that the dow averages go back to 1896 when charles dow used to calculate the averages by hand   if your only tools are a pencil and paper then a price weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market cap weighted index with hundreds of constituents about the dow jones averages dow constituents and prices apple 's stock price chart the split in 2014 is marked   note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve

3 5 years is long enough of a timeframe that i 'd certainly invest it assuming you have enough which $ 10k is   even conservatively you can guess at 4 5 annual growth if you invest reasonably conservatively 60/40 mix of stocks bonds with both in large etfs or similar you should have a good chance to gain along those lines and still be reasonably safe in case the market tanks    of course the market could tank at any time and wipe out 20 30 of that or even more even if you invest conservatively so you need to think about that risk and decide if it 's worth it or not   but particularly if your 3 5 year time frame is reasonably flexible i.e. if in 2019 the market tanks you can wait the 2 3 years it may take to come back up you should be investing and as usual the normal warnings apply   past performance is not a guarantee of future performance we are not your investment advisors and you may lose 100 of your investment

your questions seek answers to specifics but i feel that you may need more general help there are two things i feel that you need to learn about in the general category of personal finance   your asking questions about investing but it is not as important imho as how you manage your day to day operations    for example you should first learn to budget   in personal finance often times living on a budget equates to poor or low income    that is hardly the case   a budget is a plan on how to spend money   it should be refreshed each and every month and your income should equal your expenses   you might have in your budget a $ 1200 trip into the city to see a concert hardly what a low income person should have in theirs secondly you need to be deliberate about debt management   for some they feel that having a car payment and having student loans are a necessary part of life and argue that paying them off is foolish as you can earn more from investments   others argue for zero debt   i fall in the later   using and carrying a balance on high interest ccs and having high leases or car payments are just dumb   they are also easy to wander into unless you are deliberate    third you need to prepare for emergencies   engineers still get laid off and hurt where they are unable to work   they get sued   having the proper insurance and sufficient reserves in the bank help prevent debt now you can start looking into investments    start off slow and deliberate with investing   put some in your company 401 k or open some mutual funds on the side   you can read about them and talk with advisers for free at fidelity and vanguard   read books from the library most of all do n't get caught up in too much hype   things like forex options life insurance gold silver are not investments   they are tools for sales people to make fat commissions off the ignorant       you are fortunate in that engineers are very likely to retire wealthy   they are part of the second largest demographic of first generation rich   the first is small business owners    to start out i would read millionaire next door and stop acting rich   for a debt free approach to life check out financial peace university by dave ramsey video course   his lesson on insurance is excellent    i am an engineer and my wife a project manager we found life changing and regretted not getting on board sooner   along these lines we have had some turmoil recently that became little more than an inconvenience because we were prepared

gt the fact that there is way more educated people than is even remotely necessary    yes you got it    i agree with you and this is the bottom of line of the whole story   once to finish high school was not an easy accomplishment to be accepted to college was an accomplishment to survive the first year was an accomplishment and not to mention to graduate with a bachelor degree   the few who managed to accomplished that were accomplished men and women who got full benefits of their accomplishments guaranteed   today also as a former professor in college i can tell you you that anyone graduates from high school no student left behind everyone many barely know how to read write or even tackle a simple logical question and same in college i was told i ca n't fail my students except in extreme cases   so what do we have here you said it correct and clearly   having a college degree drives the value down for everybody which is exactly what is happening   further it 's just an industry to make money put people into debt give them almost worthless pieces of papers force them to also study for a master 's degree and reduce the pay for qualified people with degrees even harvard you would think that for $ tuition you get good education instead you are put in a with 500 other students for lectures   gt things need to be turned on their head    yes you got it here too   gt i propose that colleges need to receive their income as a percentage of the first 10 15 years of income from their students   disagree i propose to make the requirements for finish high school and college degrees much much higher as it was in the past   as you said too many people have worthless degrees   the few who get degree are accomplished people and will reap the benefits including their employers    this is also the best formula for people to come out of poverty and low social economic family background   right now if you are smart but from a poor background oh yes you get a degree but it 's worthless and wo n't help you much    but if the requirements are high and you are smart you are all set   as for people who fail high school and do n't get degrees they will not be spoiled as today 's kids with all their degrees someone needs to be a plumber electrician trade or a clerk and these jobs make very good many much better than bank tellers with a bachelor degree   finally there 's no way someone who graduate high school today even a relatively good student that they could survive high school of the 50s and 60s they will fail miserably also for bad attitudes discipline and capacity to handle simple requirements

it 's a persistent myth that the us has any trouble whatsoever selling its debt no country with it 's own fiat currency has trouble selling debt   of course there is a limit to it and that limit comes in the form of inflation via currency weakness the dollar is in fact still near historic highs even though it has come down some recently   i would not be the slightest bit concerned until the dxy is down in the 70s

schwab is a highly diversified operation and has a multitude of revenue streams   schwab obviously thinks it can make more off you than you will cost in atm fees and it 's probably safe to assume most schwab clients use more services than the atm card it 's not worthwhile to discuss the accounting of atm debit credit card fee norms because for a diversified operation it 's about the total relationship not whether each customer engagement is specifically profitable    people who get schwab accounts for the atm fee refunds are in the minority   in 2016 10-k filing schwab posted $ in net earnings 10 million client accounts with a total of $ 2.78 t in client assets   a couple grand in atm fees over several years is a rounding error   atm does n't even appear in the 2016

my understanding is that when you die the stocks are sold and then    the money is given to the beneficiary or the stock is repurchased in    the beneficiaries name this is wrong and the conclusion you draw from michael 's otherwise correct answer follows your false assumption   you seem to understand the estate tax federal threshold jersey would have its own and i have no idea how it works there if the decedent happened to trade in the tax year prior to passing normal tax rules apply   now if the executor chooses to sell off and liquidate the estate to cash there 's no further taxable gain a $ 5 m portfolio can have millions in long term gain but the step up basis pretty much negates all of it   if that 's the case the beneficiaries are n't likely to repurchase those shares in fact they might not even know what the list of stocks was unless they through the asset list but that sale was unnecessary assets can be up and distributed in kind each beneficiary getting their fraction of the number of shares of each stock and then your share of the $ 5 m has a stepped up basis meaning if you sell that day your gains are near zero you might owe a few dollars for whatever the share move in the time passing between the step up date and date you sell   i hope that clarifies your misunderstanding   by the way the irs is just an intermediary it 's congress that writes the laws including the tangled web of tax code the irs is the moral equivalent of a great customer service team working for a company we do n't care for

you did borrow money for the downpayment   when you apply for a mortgage loan on your new home you will be required to list all your assets and all your liabilities you must disclose the first mortgage as well as the second mortgage on your current condo as well as the monthly payment on each of these loans   if you took out the second mortgage five years ago you can truthfully say that you have not taken out any loans within the past year to get cash for the down payment when you apply for a mortgage for purchasing your new house but what the lender will be looking at is can   the applicants current income support monthly payments of    $ 1000 for the first mortgage on the condo plus $ 300 for the second    mortgage on the condo plus $ 1500 for the proposed mortgage on the    new house you might argue that you will be selling that condo soon or will be renting it out and that the rental income will cover the mortgage payments on the condo but will the lender give much to this the condo may not sell easily you might not be able to find a tenant right away or be able to rent the condo at a high enough rental to cover the costs etc if you simply save money from your current extra cash flow and use that to make the down payment the lender will be pondering the question can   the applicants current income support monthly payments of    $ 1000 for the mortgage on the condo plus $ 1500 for the proposed mortgage on the new house which deal will the lender be happier with if you are uncomfortable saving your extra cash flow in a savings account or cd or investing it in stocks and/or bonds until you need the money for the down payment on your new house put that money in a sock under your mattress and do n't smoke in bed

the one thing your friend needs to understand is for every dollar paid out there is somebody paying that dollar in   the mark of a ponzi scheme is that it feeds on itself the stock market has trade volumes where it almost meets the definition of a ponzi scheme   however it deals with shares in actual production facilities rather than only financial institutions and provides means of production in return for large amounts of the profits   so there is someone legitimately expecting to pay back more than he gets out in return for the availability of money at a time where he could not finance matters except by credit with your friend 's scheme there is nobody expected to pay more than he gets out nail him down with that every dollar paid out has to be paid in   who is the one paying at this point of time it sounds like there will be two possible outcomes   you 'll be visiting your friend in debtors prison or you 'll visit him in criminal prison   if you highly value your friendship you might get him out of the former with your own money   you wo n't be able with the latter   and if you let him exploit his standing for scamming his community make no mistake it will be the latter i do n't envy you

12 is ridiculously high and routine for loans with no credit history esp from the dealer i do n't think though paying off would hurt your credit you 've already got installment loan on your report and you have history of payments so it should n't matter how long the history is warning this is kind of guesswork compiled from personal experience and stuff read on the net since officially how credit score calculated is top secret   if you have the loan and credit card with good payments only thing you need to build credit is time and of course keeping everything nicely paid of course if you could find a loan with lower rate somewhere it 's be great to refinance but with low credit you would probably not get the best rates from anywhere unfortunately

i stumbled on the same discrepancy and was puzzled by a significant difference between the two prices on etr and fra for example today is sunday and google shows the following closing prices for dai fra dai etr dai so it looks like there are indeed two different exchanges trading at different prices   now the important value here is the last column volume according to wikipedia the trading on stock exchange is done today exclusively via xetra platform thus the volume on etr dai is much more important than on fra dai   obviously they wikipedia is not 100 accurate i.e. not all trading is done electronically via xetra according to their web page exchange has a specialist trading on frankfurt floor service which has slightly different trading hours   i suspect what google and yahoo show as exchange is this manual trading via a specialist opposed to xetra electronic trading to answer your question the stock you 're having is exactly the same meaning if you bought an etr bmw you can still sell it on fra by calling a fra trading floor specialist which will probably cost you a fee on the other hand for the portfolio valuation and performance assessments you should only use etr bmw prices because it is way more liquid and thus better reflect the current market valuation

the answer to this question will vary considerably by state and how utilities are regulated in your area in new york energy supply companies are almost always a ripoff for consumers versus the old style regulated utility in ny the utility supply markups are tightly regulated but are less regulated   you also need to really understand the marketplace rules for locking in a price if you can lock in the july price for natural gas for a year that rocks there are other factors as well but even then its a real bet since weather and supply factors can have a dramatic effect on gas prices in the winter imo the best bet is to run with the market rates and bank the efficiency improvements that you build into your home over time some utilities offer budget plans that smooth out your payments without interest i 'd recommend that route if predictable bills are your goal

age current marginal rate total saved so far current rate of savings joint or single filer these are among the variables that go into making this decision without this my answer is a general response in general you have one marginal rate today unless you happened to be a bracket limit   in retirement you have your marginal rate of course but also every bracket up to that level it can make sense to save today pretax to avoid 25 knowing this money will be withdrawn at an average 10 or so in retirement   edit to clarify to the one who offers comment below to the contrary   the 2015 for single filer   a single person has a combined $ 10,300 standard deduction and exemption this means that if he has no other income in retirement a withdrawal of $ results in a tax bill of $ this is an average on that withdrawal it also means that one can save nearly $ 1.2 m before hitting the 25 bracket in retirement with the numbers i offered the next $ 1 is taxed at 25 in general if a new worker starts by using roth and goes to traditional to avoid slipping into the 25 bracket they will have a nice mix of pre and post tax money   in the end it 's not a long term binary choice each year you can decide which flavor or mix of flavors to use you can convert from traditional to roth each year to top off the 15 bracket so you retirement withdrawals never push you into the 25 bracket   note the math above ignores the phantom tax rate zone caused by the taxation of social security benefits for a young person i do n't know that i 'd advise counting on this benefit but if you believe in fairy dust unicorns and the like you should be aware of how the government currently plans to tax you this situation leans strongly toward the roth until congress decides to use roth withdrawals as a trigger to tax or reduce your benefits in which case just using a taxable account will be all that 's left   2 years ago i wrote a blog post the 15 solution which walks the reader through the process of optimizing their savings from a tax standpoint the choice of investments is another matter this simply addresses the pre tax post tax issue

let 's imagine an economy where 100 of wealth creation comes from existing financial assets and 0 comes from new wealth creation that would essentially be a dead economy i do n't think it matters what your philosophy on economics is that 's a bad outcome if you do n't agree with that point we 'll stop here note if you do n't think it 's bad for this to keep going higher japan is at about 80 and we know how they 're doing   if you agree 100 would be bad then we 're 70 of the way there in the us trump 's tax plan if enacted would push us even further the question we should be asking is what is a reasonable way to encourage new wealth creation rather than protect and preserve existing wealth for starters it makes little sense to have a preferential tax rate for capital gains dividends estates as compared to earned income even if you just hate taxes and want them all to be gone i think it 's fairly easy to say if we 're going to have taxes they should not favor income transfer from existing financial assets as compared to earned income   a much more reasonable way to approach this is to say we have a lot of concentration of financial assets in the top of wealth spectrum let 's just level the tax rate so that income from financial assets is taxes at a similar rate to income from work that 's not even an eat the rich proposal it 's just a eat everyone equally proposal all it would do is tax the very substantial gains in stocks at the same rate as the very median gains from working   the fact that taxing income from financial assets at the same rate as work is a controversial idea is to me of a government completely captured by wealthy interests

in finance short selling also known as shorting or going short is the practice of selling assets usually securities that have been borrowed from a third party usually a broker with the intention of buying identical assets back at a later date to return to the lender remember your broker has to borrow it from somewhere other clients or if they hold those specific stocks themselves so if it is n't possible for them to lend you those stocks they would n't high p e stocks would find more sellers than buyers and if the broker has to deliver them it would be a nightmare for him to deliver all those stocks which he had lent back to whom he had borrowed from as well as to people who had gone when you went and if every body is selling there is going to be a dearth of stocks to be borrowed from as everybody around is selling instead of buying
