typically no unless you have a detailed agreement spelling out the of costs all operating expenses are deducted from gross income first with the division of the proceeds coming out of net profit in accordance with the type and of shares you own and per the terms of the shareholders agreement this is a simplified answer and does not address other methods of extraction such as wages paid loans to shareholders interest paid on loans from shareholders etc

a firm is a separate legal person from its shareholders or owners but does n't get invited to parties much owners invest capital to get shares in the firm or may get shares for investing time effort etc but those shares are on a limited liability basis that means that shareholders are only liable up to the value of their shares and that the firm itself is responsible for any expenses or liabilities the firm will have working capital from its initial investors i.e. any capital invested to get shares and can borrow money on the bond market or issue new shares to cover outgoings share ownership simply entitles the owner to a proportion of the residual equity of the company and voting rights for non equity in a firm that i previously worked for for example one of the partners owned 51 of the firm but put up 100 of the firm 's equity capital the other partner owned 49 and provided 90 of the intellectual capital of the firm they both took decisions equally the distribution of ownership should therefore have no bearing on who finances deals the owners or managers in larger firms should decide together how to use the company 's capital for spending because it is exactly that the company 's capital not any one of the investor 's limited liability of owners is one of the major benefits of forming a company

from your question it seems your problem is that you have a company that wants to make a deal but does not currently have enough money to go through with it therefore it needs to raise capital assuming that you can not get a loan from a bank and you do not want to seek funding from other sources the two owners must provide the funds themselves somehow option a the easiest and fairest way to do this is for the two shareholders to provide 75 and 25 of the funding as a loan to the company they will provide this loan knowing it may not be paid back if the company goes under note that it would not be fair for one of the shareholders to provide more as that shareholder would be taking all the risk while the other still the rewards although you could add a large interest rate to account for this option b but say one of the shareholders can not provide additional funds in that case the company should issue new shares and each shareholder can purchase however many of the new shares he she wants each shareholder is entitled to purchase at least 75 or 25 respectively but does not have to the result of this may be that company ownership percentages have changed after the capital raising this is more complex as it require valuing the company accurately to be fair and probably requires reporting to a government depending on the jurisdiction
# 535314
i think you 're looking at the picture in an odd way when each of you made your initial investments and determined what portions you owned that gave the company capital that they could use to finance its operations in return you are entitled to the future profits of the company in proportion to your ownership any future investment by either of you is at your own discretion your company now faces a situation where it would like to pursue a potentially lucrative opportunity but needs more capital than it has to do so so you need to raise more capital that capital can come from one or both of you or from an outsider since that investment would be discretionary what the investor gets is a negotiation the company negotiates with the investor how much equity in the form of new shares to award in exchange for the new investment or whatever other compensation you decide on if not equity
# 135411
i think your question might be coming from a misunderstanding of how corporate structures work specifically that a corporation is a legal entity sort of like a person that can have its own assets and debts to make it clear let 's look at your example we have two founders albert and brian and they start a corporation called corptech when they start the company it has no assets just like you would if you owned nothing and had no bank account in order to do anything corptech is going to need some money so albert and brian give it some they can give it as much as they want they can give it property if they want too usually people do n't just put money into a corporation without some sort of agreement in place though in most cases the agreement says something like each member will own a fraction of the company that is in proportion to this initial investment the way that is done varies depending on the type of corporation but in general if albert ends up owning 75 and brian ends up owning 25 then they probably valued their contributions at 75 and 25 of the total value these contributions do n't have to be money or property though they could just be general know how or connections or an expectation that they will do some work the important thing is that they agree on the value of these contributions and assign ownership of the company according to that agreement if they do n't have an agreement then the laws of the state that the company is registered in will say how the ownership is assigned now what ownership means can be different depending on the context when it comes to decision making you could own one percentage of the company in terms of votes but when it comes to shares of future profits you could own a different amount this is why you can have voting and non voting versions of a company 's stock for example so this is a critical point the ownership of a company is independent of the individual contributions to the company the next part of your question is related to this what happens when corptech sees an opportunity to make an investment if it has enough cash on hand because of the initial investment or through financing or reinvested profits then the decision to make the investment is made according to albert and brian 's ownership agreement and they spend it the money does n't belong to them individually anymore it belongs to corptech and so corptech is spending it they are just making the decision for corptech to spend it this is why people say the owners are not financially liable beyond their initial investment if the deal is bad and they lose the money the most they can lose is what they initially put in on the other hand if corptech does n't have the money then they have to figure out a way to get it they might decide to each put in an amount in proportion to their ownership so that their stake does n't change or albert might agree to finance the deal 100 in exchange for a larger share of ownership or he could agree to fund all of it without a larger stake because brian is the one who set the deal up or they might take out a loan and not need to invest any new money or they might find an investor who agrees to put in the needed money in exchange for a a 51 share in which case albert and brian will have to figure out how to split the remaining 49 if they agree to the deal the details of how all of this would work depend on the structure llc llp c corp s corp etc but in general the idea is that the company has assets and debts and the owners can have voting rights equity rights and rights to future profits in any type of split that they want regardless of what the companies assets and debts are or what their initial investment was

another way to decide would be to do a fair valuation of the company agreeable to both the partners lets assume when you started the company it was worth $ 10,000 and to acquire 75 you must have put $ 7,500 worth of money and effort similarly the other partner must have put $ 2,500 worth of time and money now say after 2 years you both agree that company is worth $ 50,000 and say now the company needs $ 10,000 worth of investment whoever invests that money should get 20 of the company or each $ 1,000 will buy 2 in the company post this investment the equity division would be   first investor you 75 of 80 = 60 second investor your partner 25 of 80 = 20 third new investor = 20 now if you alone decide to put all the money you stake will be 60 + 20 = 80 and your partner will be reduced to 20 if you guys want to maintain equity as it was 75 25 you need to put money in the same ratio $ 7500 and $ 2500 if you do that- first investor 60 + 15 for $ 7,500 = 75 second investor 20 + 5 for $ 2,500 = 25 please know for ip centric company valuation is very subjective but do make an effort to do the valuation at every stage of the company so that you can put a number in terms of equity for each investment
# 483385
it depends on the business entity if the entity is a sole proprietorship or a general partnership the individual are considered to be the business there are no shares and so yes the owner would have to take on 75 of the expenses for example in the event of a lawsuit if the claimant were awarded $ 1,000,000 the 75 partner would be personally liable for $ 750,000 in the event of a corporation there are shares so the responsibility is on the management of the company not the owners to come up with money for the expenses of the business that money can come from the business capital which is the money owners have put in basically for a corporate entity the owner is not responsible for 75 of expenses for a partnership yes they are
# 77503
you can look at the company separately from the ownership the company needs money that it does n't have therefore it needs to borrow money from somewhere or go bankrupt   and if they ca n't get money from their bank then they can of course ask people related to the company like the two shareholders for a loan it 's a loan like every other loan that needs to be repaid how big the loan is does n't depend on the ownership but on how much money each one is willing and capable of giving the loan does n't give them any rights in the company except the right to get their money back with interest in the future   alternatively such a company might have 200 shares and might have given 75 to one owner and 25 to the other owner keeping 100 shares back in that case the shareholders can decide to sell some of these 100 shares i might buy 10 shares for $ 1,000 each so the company has now $ 10,000 cash and i have some ownership of the company about and the 75 and 25 shares have gone down because now they own 75 out of 110 or 25 out of 110 shares i wo n't get the $ 10,000 back ever it 's not a loan but the purchase of part of the company

although they may have some similar functions cpas and enrolled agents operate in two rather different areas of the accounting space cpas deal with financial statements usually of corporations they 're the people you want to go to if you are making an investment or if you own your own business and need statements of pretax profit and loss prepared although a few of them are competent in taxation the one thing many of them are weak at is tax rules and this is where enrolled agents come in enrolled agents are more concerned with personal tax liability they can 1 calculate your income taxes and 2 represent you in hearings with the irs because they 've taken courses with irs agents and are considered by them to be almost one of us many enrolled agents are former irs agents actually but they are less involved with corporate accounting including things that might be of interest to stock holders that 's the cpa 's province

for a non technical investor meaning someone who does n't try to do all the various technical analysis things that theoretically point to specific investments or trends having a diverse portfolio and rebalancing it periodically will typically be the best solution for example i might have a long term growth portfolio that is 40 broad stock market fund 40 large industry specific market funds and 20 bond funds   if the market as a whole tanks then i might end up in a situation where my funds are invested 30 market 35 industry 35 bonds   okay sell those bonds which are presumably high and put that into the market which is presumably low   now back to    then when the market goes up we may end up at say in which case we sell some of the broad market fund and buy some bond funds back to   ultimately ending up always selling high whatever is currently the other two and buying low whatever is underperforming    having the industry specific fund(s means i can balance a bit between different sectors maybe the healthcare industry takes a beating for a while so that goes low and i can sell some of my tech industry fund and buy that    none of this depends on timing anything you can rebalance maybe twice a year not worrying about where the market is at that exact time and definitely not targeting a correction specifically   you just analyze your situation and adjust to make everything back in line with what you want this is n't guaranteed to succeed any more than any other strategy is of course and has some risk particularly if you rebalance in the middle of a major correction so you end up buying something that goes down more   but for long term investments it should be fairly sound

this effect has much empirical evidence as googling dividend price effect evidence will show as the financial economic schools of thought run the so do the theories   one school goes as far to call it a market inefficiency since the earning power thus the value of an equity that 's affected is no different or at least not riskier by the percentage of market capitalization paid most papers offer that by the efficient market hypothesis and arbitrage theory the value of an equity is known by the market at any point in time given by its price so if an equity pays a dividend the adjusted price would be efficient since the holder receives no excess of the price instantly before payment as after including the dividend since that dividend information was already discounted so would otherwise produce an arbitrage

so my question is is my credit score going to be hit   yes it will affect your credit   not as much as missing payments on the debt which remains even if the credit line is closed and not as much as missing payments on other bills    if so what can i do about it   not very much   nothing worth the time it would take   like you mentioned the account or opening another would likely require a credit check and the inquiry will add another negative factor    in this situation consider the impact on your credit as fact and the best way to correct it is to move forward and pay all your bills on time   this is the number one key to improving credit score    so right now the key task is finding a new job this will enable you to make all payments on time   if you pay on time and do not overspend your credit score will be fine can i contact the creditors to appeal the decision and get them to not affect my score at the very least i know they wo n't restore the account without another credit check is there anything that can be done directly with the credit score companies depending on how they characterize the closing of the account it may be mostly a neutral event that has a negative impact than a negative event   by negative events i 'm referring to bankruptcy charge offs and collections   so the best way to recover is to keep credit utilization below 30 and pay all your bills and debt payments on time you seem to be asking how to replace this line of credit to help you through your unemployment as for the missing credit line and your current finances you have to find a way forward   opening new credit account while you 're not employed is going to be very difficult if not impossible   you might find yourself in a situation where you need to take whatever part time gig you can find in order to make ends meet until your job search is complete   grocery store fast food wait staff delivery driver etc and once you get past this period of unemployment you 'll need to catch up on all bills then you 'll want to build your emergency fund   you do n't mention one but eating paying rent mortgage keeping current on bills and paying debt payments are the reasons behind the emergency fund and the reason you need it in a liquid account    source   i 'm a veteran of decades of bad choices when it comes to money of being unemployed for periods of time of credit cards and generally being irresponsible with my income and savings   i 've done all those things and am now paying the price   in order to rebuild my credit and provide for my retirement i 'm having to work very hard to save   my focus being financial health not credit score i 've brought my bottom line from approximately 25k in the red up to about 5k in the red   the first step was getting my payments under control    i have also been watching my credit score   two years of on time mortgage payments gradual growth of score   paid off student loans uptick in score   opened new credit card with 0 intro rate to consolidate a couple of store line of credit accounts   transferred those balances   big uptick   next month when utilization on that card hits 90 that took back a year 's worth of gains   however financially i 'm not losing 50 100 a month to interest tldr at certain times you have to ignore the credit score and focus on the important things   this is one of those times for you   find a job   get back on your feet   then look into living debt free or working to achieve financial independence

that is an opinion   i do n't think so   here are some differences if you use credit responsibly and take the time to make sure the reporting agencies are being accurate a good report can benefit you   so that is n't like a criminal record what is also important to know is that in the united states a credit report is about you not for you   you are the product being sold   this is in my opinion and unfortunate situation but it is what it is   you will more than likely benefit for keeping a good report even if you never use credit there are many credit scores that can be calculated from your report the score is just a number used to compare and evaluate you on a common set of criteria if you think about it that does n't make sense   the score is a reflection of how you use credit   having and using credit is a commitment   your are committing to the lender that you will repay them as agreed your choice is who you decide to make agreements with   i personally find the business practices of my local credit union to be more palatable than the business practices of the national bank i was with   i chose to use credit provided by the credit union rather than by the bank   i am careful about where i take auto loans from and to what extent i can control it where i take home loans from since it is absolutely a commitment you are personally responsible for making sure that you like who you are making commitments with

you can take a shortcut and make a few cumulative transactions maybe just estimate how much of your spending landed in each of your budget categories but you will lose a lot of the value that you were building for yourself by tracking your spending during the earlier months i reconcile my budget and categorize my spending on a monthly basis it 's always a chore to pull out the big stack of receipts and plow through them but i 've learned the value of having an accurate picture of where all my money went there is no clean way to fake it you can either take the time and reconcile your spending or you can take a short cut it probably renders your efforts to track everything from the beginning of the year invalid though if you want to start over this month as you did at the beginning of the year that would probably be a cleaner way to reconcile things

there are a lot of good answers but i will share my experience   first a savings account needs to be for savings if your in the us you have regulation d to deal with and that will bite you on the rear if you go over those limits specially easy to do if your purchasing from a savings account   next having an income account and a spending account can be a very good tool to build a nest egg so for example you get $ 1500 into your income account and then move $ 1000 to your spending account then budget based on that $ 1000 this is an amazing thing to do so long as you have the discipline to never transfer that extra $ 500 and pretend your broke when you run out of the $ 1000   that being said there is no reason that you ca n't do that in one account it 's all preference my wife and i use ynab an envelope budgeting system to do just that we do n't need the separate accounts we are no more likely to not spend in one account then we are to not spend in two accounts it 's all just self discipline and what you need to do   this does lead to the situation we call ynab broke it 's when we have to start choosing between   going hungry or getting that new dvd even though our bank account has $ 5,000 in it   it 's even harder when you choose go hungry and have to follow through with it even though you have enough to buy a used car in your bank account   but rather it 's ynab broke or your spending account is empty and your income account it full the result is the same it 's up to you to have the self discipline not to spend rather that 's in one account or two makes little difference

the simplest argument for overpayment is this let 's suppose your fixed rate mortgage has an interest rate of 4.00 every £ 1 you can afford to overpay gives you a guaranteed effective return of 4.00 gross yes your monthly mortgage payment will stay the same however the proportion of it that 's paying off interest every month will be less and the amount that 's actually going into acquiring the bricks and mortar of your home will be greater so in a sense your returns are inverted i.e. because every £ 1 you overpay is £ 1 you do n't need to keep paying 4 a year to continue borrowing in your case this return will be locked away for a few more years until you can remortgage the property however compared to some other things you could do with your excess £ this is a very generous and safe return that is well above the average rate of uk inflation for the past ten years let 's compare that to some other options for your extra £ cash savings the most competitive rate i can currently find for instant access is from icici if you are prepared to lock your money away until march 2020 building society has a fixed rate bond that will pay you gross on these accounts you pay income tax at your marginal rate on any interest received for a basic rate taxpayer that 's 20 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer that means 40 of this interest is deducted as tax in other words assuming you pay income tax at one of these rates to get an effective return of 4.00 on cash savings you 'd have to find an account paying cash isas these accounts are tax sheltered so the income tax equation is n't an issue however the best rate i can find on a 4 year fixed rate cash isa is from building society as you can see it 's a long way below the returns you can get from overpaying to find returns such as that you would have to take a lot more risk with your money for example stock market investments for example an index fund tracking the ftse 100 uk listed blue chip companies could have given you a total return of over the last 3 years past performance does not equal future returns over a longer time period this return should be better historical performance suggests somewhere between 5 to 6 is the norm but take a closer look and you 'll see that over the last six months of 2015 this fund had a negative return of i.e. for a time you 'd have been losing money how would you feel about that kind of volatility in conclusion i understand your frustration at having locked in to a long term fixed rate effectively insuring against rates going up then seeing rates stay low for longer than most commentators thought however overpaying your mortgage is one way you can turn this situation into a pretty good deal for yourself a 4 guaranteed return is one that most cash savers would envy in response to comments i 've uploaded a spreadsheet that i hope will make the numbers clearer i 've used an example of owing £ 100k over 25 years at an 4 interest and shown the scenarios with and without making a £ 100/month voluntary overpayment assuming your lender allows this here 's the sheet after one year you have made £ 1,200 in overpayments you now owe £ less than if you had n't overpaid   after five years you owe £ less on your mortgage having overpaid in £ 6,000 so far should you remortgage at this point that £ is your return so far and you also have £ 6k more equity in the property   if you keep going after 65 months you are paying more capital than interest out of your monthly payment this takes until 93 months without overpayments in total if you keep up £ 100/month overpayment you pay £ less interest overall and end your mortgage six years early you can play with the spreadsheet inputs to see the effect of different overpayment amounts hope this helps

yes of course   my point is there are lots of different ways this could be funded   for instance one of the doctors complained that insurance only paid him $ 100 for a one hour exam but it costs him $ to operate his office so he quit taking insurance   he said single payer is the way to go   but what if single payer also only pays him $ 100 for the exam   then it 's probably not so great    if single payer pays him $ 300 but it requires a 20 payroll tax to fund the system would that be great     i am not questioning a single payer system   i am only questioning the lack of information in endorsing a single payer

say the rate is 6 and the payment is $ 500/mo if the bank credits on the day received the .5 per month is $ 2.50 for the whole month in other words pulling in the payment by the full 30 days will save you about $ 2.50 the whole loan may be costing $ but you can only impact the amount one payment at a time   to be clear you need to find out exactly how they credit you some loans do not accept partial payments separate from the normal payment if a $ 500 payment is due that 's the time to prepay principal but they might not accept say $ 200 each week   as a side note mortgages typically do n't credit the way you 'd hope i have a standard 30 year mortgage and whether i send the payment a full 15 days early or 14 days late the next month shows a balance that i can pull from an amortization table assuming all payments are on the 1st of the month if i were you i 'd make a full payment 2 weeks early then check your balance and see what the impact was just to be sure

regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision

if you have no credit score it is generally far easier and more affordable to establish credit the cheapest way possible which is usually in the form of a small credit card student card if you are a student low credit line unsecured or even secured if you need your local bank credit union will usually be keen to offer you something to start out but you can also apply online to some of the major credit card vendors as always look out for annual fees etc in general trying to get a larger loan to establish credit will cost you a lot as you will not qualify for any legitimate 0 or ultra low apr car loans those are reserved for people with established and generally pretty good credit i expect you 'll find a car loan that will have a lower apr than you could get investing your money otherwise especially if you do not have established excellent credit to simply be a phantom you wo n't find it and even if you could it is more risky than it is worth furthermore if establishing credit is important to you such as for buying a house down the road you can build an excellent credit score without ever having a car loan so you do n't have to buy a car on borrowed money just to hope to get approved for a house some day it 's just not a requirement finally i urge you to make a decision on the best car for you in your situation ignoring the credit score especially if you are more than 3 5 + years away from buying a house everything else about buying a car is more important the actual cost of the car year mileage suitability for your needs gas mileage maintenance and insurance costs etc   then at the very end of your decision making process ensure that buying the car would not put you dangerously low on savings by squeezing your emergency fund decide if you really need a loan or as expensive of a car considering the costs over the expected life of you owning the car or at least the next 2 5 years never get trapped into just thinking about monthly payments which hide the true cost of loans and buying beyond what you can afford to purchase today

beyond the numbers how do you objectively establish causation between amazon and a lost job   that to me is what is practically impossible   ma and pa might blame amazon but that 's hardly dependable information   what if ma and pa 's business model was unsustainable or simply mismanaged   now with walmart you can establish a stronger connection because you 'll see those effects tightly correlated with a local store opening   doing that with an online business is considerably harder   you 'd need to know who the customers were and how they substituted ma and pa 's goods and then correlate that with a drop in sales for example

realize this is almost a year old but i just wanted to comment on something in answer above   whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me its a zero sum game from a market maker 's perspective their primary goal is not necessarily to make money by you being wrong it is to make money on the bid offer spread and hedging their book and potentially that being said the market maker would likely be quoting one side of the market away from top of the book if they do n't want to take exposure in that direction i.e. their bid will be lower than the highest bid available or their offer higher than the lowest offer available this is n't really going to change anything if you 're trading on an exchange but important to consider if you can only see the prices your broker dealer provides to you and they are your counterparty in the trade

yes in my humble opinion it can be safe to assume that but not in the sense that your assumption is necessarily or likely correct rather it can be safe in the respect that assuming the worst even if wrong could save you from a likely painful and unsuccessful speculation in the highly volatile stock of a tiny company with no revenue no profits next to no assets and continued challenges to its existence there is material uncertainty about whether the company will be able to obtain the required financing this material uncertainty    significant doubt about the company ’s ability to continue as a going    concern as a penny stock they are in good company still there are a variety of other reasons why such a stock might have gone up or down and no one here can say for sure even if there was a news item any price reaction to news could just amount to speculation on the part of others having enough money to move the stock there are better investments out there and cheaper than most penny stocks

does the insurance value differ from state to state for example i 've a car in hawaii and there is another car in illinois with same model make and same features does the insurance vary for both yes quotes will vary based on where you live for various reasons propensity for accidents value of cars etc and state laws regarding required car insurance can vary how is the insurance quote calculated it 's likely a proprietary formula that the insurance company will not disclose if they did they could be giving away a competitive advantage however like all insurance the goal is to determine the probability of the insured having an accident and the projected cost of such an accident   that will be based on actuarial tables for each of the risk factors you mention

if you have income it should appear on your tax return if you are a non resident that would be 1040nr with the ebay income appearing on line 21 since this is unrelated to your studies this income will not be covered by the tax treaties for most countries and you 'll pay full taxes on it keep in mind that the irs may decide that you 're actually having a business in which case you 'll be required to attach schedule c to your tax return and maybe pay additional taxes mainly self employment also the uscis may decide that you 're actually having a business regardless of how the irs sees it in which case you may have issues with your green card for low income from occasional sales you should n't have any issues but if it is something systematic that you spend significant time on and earn significant amounts of money you may get into trouble what 's systematic and how much is significant is up to a lawyer to tell you

i 'm guessing you 're conflating bonus share issuance with stock split   that seems very common to me from a quick search there 's even some issues of terminology between the us and europe i think it seems some europeans may use bonus shares to mean stock split as opposed to the more common meaning in the us of stock dividend sometimes a bonus share issuance is incorrectly called a stock split like in this public announcement from in 2004   it is a 1:1 bonus share issuance meaning they issue one bonus share to everyone who has one share now but it is in essence the same thing as a stock split a 2:1 stock split namely   they combined the 1:1 from bonus share with the wording split causing the confusion bonus share issuance also known as a stock dividend is covered well in this question answer on this site or from a search online   it has no obvious effect initially both involve doubling shares out there and halving the price but it has a substantially different treatment in terms of accounting both to the company and to your tax accountant

it 's not a bad strategy i 'd rather owe money at 4 interest than at 6 7 however there is something to consider   consolidating debt into a new loan can backfire when you have money borrowed at 7 you want to get that paid off as quickly as possible once you have that converted to 4 if you think now i can take my time paying off this debt then you are n't really better off in fact if you take too long paying off the new loan you might end up paying more interest than if you had kept the high interest loan and paid it as soon as possible do n't lose your drive to get out of debt after you refinance   as far as how the student loans affect your debt to income ratio i 'm not sure however if they do count i think they do your ratio will not really be going up by taking out the new loan since you are using the money to pay other debt make sure the new lender knows this so they take that into consideration when making their decision   overall i like your strategy pay off what you can right away the car loan and the highest interest student loans and reduce the interest on the rest just make sure that you continue to pay down that debt as quick as you can

the end result is basically the same it 's just a choice of whether you want to base the final amount you receive on your salary or on the stock market you pay in a set proportion of your salary and receive a set proportion of your salary in return the pension both contributions and benefit are based on your career earnings you get x% of your salary every year from retirement until death these are just a private investment basically you pay a set amount in and whatever is there is what you get at the end normally you would buy an annuity with the final sum which pays you a set amount per year from retirement until death as with the above the amount you receive depends on how much you pay in and the performance of the investment if the stock market does well you 'll get more if it does badly you could actually end up with less in general in as much as anything relating to the stock market and investment can be a defined benefit plan is usually considered better for security or at least public sector ones and a majority of people in my experience would prefer one but it entirely depends on your personal attitude to risk i 'm on a defined benefit plan and like the fact that i basically get a benefit based on a proportion of my salary and that the amount is guaranteed no matter what happens to the stock market in the meantime i pay in 9 of my salary get 2 of my salary as pension for each year i pay into the pension no questions no if 's or no performance indicators others prefer a defined contribution scheme because they know that it is based on the amount they pay in not the amount they earn although to an extent it is still based on earnings as that 's what defines how much you pay in and because it has the potential to grow significantly based on the stock market unfortunately nobody can give you a which is best answer if i knew how pension funds were going to perform over the next 10 50 years i would n't be on stackexchange i 'd be out there making a rather large fortune on the stock market

certainly reading the recommended answers about initial investing is a great place to start and i highly recommend reading though that page for sure but i also believe your situation is a little different than the one described as that person has already started their long term career while you are still a couple years away   now tax advantaged accounts like iras are amazingly good places to start building up retirement funds but they also lock up the money and have a number of rules about withdrawals you have fifteen thousand which is a great starting pot of money but college is likely to be done soon and there will likely be a number of expenses with the transition to full time employment   moving expenses first month 's rent nursing exams job search costs maybe a car   all of this can be quite a lot especially if you are in a larger city   it sounds like your parents are very helpful though which is great make sure you have enough money for that transition and emergency expenses first and if there is a significant pool beyond that then start looking at investments   if you determine now is the best time to start than then above question is has great advice but even if not it is still well worth taking some time to understand investing through that question my favorite introduction book on the subject and maybe even a college course   so when you land that first solid nursing job and get situated you can start taking full advantage of the 401 k and iras

see solid reading literature for investment retirement income taxes not exactly the same question but a great reading list for you you are putting the cart before the horse here first you learn then you invest there 's a large danger in confusing intelligent investing with fooling around the idea that you think you 'd like to use derivatives without knowing how or why is a tough one   i suggest you go to yahoo finance and set yourself up with a portfolio click on the my portfolios tab in effect creating your own simulated account assume you are starting with some reasonable amount of money say $ 10,000 but not $ 1 m as part of real investing is to learn how to asset allocate the funds you have learning that way for a time is the smarter way to start that said individual stocks are not for everyone most investors can lead a successful investing life by using etfs or mutual funds of one type or another learning to pick individual stocks can be a life 's work and if you put too little time into it are likely to be disappointed but learning by paper trading can be a good learning experience nonetheless

interesting question    how is social security funded the social security system works by using current payroll taxes as funding to pay benefits to retirees   historically there was always more money coming in then what was being paid out in benefits   this changed at the beginning of march 2010 when social security started paying out more than it was taking in this article estimates the exact date to be around march 3 or march 4 the chart below has the approximate date highlighted with the red circle   due to the baby boomer generation it is estimated that social security will now be perpetually in the red unless changes are made   the recent reduction in payroll taxes will not help social security solvency   what was done with all the extra money social security collected over the last three decades the social security trust fund sstf was required to purchase special issue us government bonds with the excess funds   the sstf was essentially purchasing us government debt with the excess funds   this allowed congress to spend the excess funds   the special issue funds are different then normal us treasuries in that the sstf can redeem special issue bonds at face value at any time even before maturity   the sstf is currently holding $ 2.5 trillion of these special issue bonds as assets   what next hell if i know   the sstf was a major purchaser of us debt over the last few decades to the tune of $ 2.5 trillion   that changed in 2010   the sstf is no longer purchasing us debt at the same time the us government is issuing record amounts of debt   the sstf could begin redeeming its bonds to meet payment obligations   when it the bonds the us treasury must cough up the funds   where is it the us government going to get the money especially when it is currently borrowing money at record levels i read many articles that say that we do n't have to count sstf bond holdings as debt since we owe it to ourselves   that always makes me chuckle   the us government owes the sstf $ 2.5 trillion   i 'm not the us government so do n't count me in the we part of we owe it to ourselves   i 'm also fairly certain i will never see a dime of social security so do n't count me in the ourselves portion either charts were obtained from here

i take it you have nearly zero expenses since you do n't mention any savings and with your income you would n't have much left over for investing at your level of income any actual investing is either going to unwisely reduce your cash available should you need it such as investment in mutual funds which often have minimum investment periods of 2 6 months or more to avoid fees or cost you a high percentage of your income in commissions stock trading so i would n't recommend investing at all yet i find dave ramsey 's baby steps to be very good general money management advice   here is how i would adapt the first three steps to your income and stage in life beyond this dave recommends saving for retirement college for kids and paying off your house early   these things are a little beyond your stage in life but it would be good to start thinking about them for you i recommend following 's advice to invest in yourself   specifically plan to get through college debt free   put away money so that you have a head start once you do have living expenses save for a car save money for rent etc so that you do n't have to live month to month as most people do starting out so what this boils down to put away every cent you have in a savings account

some 401k plans allow you to make supplemental post tax contributions basically once you hit the pre tax contribution limit in 2014 you are then allowed to contribute funds on a post tax basis because of this timing they are sometimes called spillover contributions usually this option is advertised as a way of continuing to get company match even if you accidentally hit the pre tax limit   but if you actually pay attention to your finances it is instead a handy way to put away additional tax advantaged money   that said you would only want to use this option if you already maxed out your pre tax and roth options since you do n't get the traditional tax break on contributions or the roth tax break on the earnings however when you leave the company you can transfer the post tax money directly into a roth ira when you transfer the pre tax money match and earnings into a traditional ira

modern portfolio theory has a strong theoretical background and its conclusions on the risk return trade off have a lot of good supporting evidence   however the conclusions it draws need to be used very carefully when thinking about retirement investing   if you were really just trying to just pick the one investment that you would guess would make you the most money in the future then yes given no other information the riskiest asset would be the best one    however for most people the goal retirement investing is to be as sure as possible to retire comfortably   if you were to just invest in a single very risky asset you may have the highest expected return but the risk involved would mean there might be a good chance you money may not be there when you need it instead a broad diversified basket of riskier and safer assets leaning more toward the riskier investments when younger and the safer assets when you get closer to retirement tends to be a better fit with most people 's retirement goals   this tends to give on average more return when you are young and can better deal with the risk but back the risk later in life when your investment portfolio is a majority of your wealth and you can least afford any major swings   this combines the lessons of mpt diversity risk return trade off in a clearer way with common goals of retirement caveat   your retirement goals and risk tolerance may be very different from other peoples   it is often good to talk to fee only financial planner

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

not charging taxes on a money losing investment or business is much more than humanitarian it is common sense in general money that is used to invest has already been taxed as income or inheritance to the person making the investment so taxing that money again not just the profit would provide a disincentive for people to invest which would be bad for economic growth over the medium and long term as far as taxing a money losing businesses goes most businesses do n't make money in their couple of years and adding further tax burdens would be counter productive because it would provide a major hurdle for people wanting to start a business other have already mentioned that the money losing operation likely paid indirect taxes as well small businesses provide a majority of the economic growth and innovation so in short additional taxes on money losing investments and businesses would be both foolish and shortsighted

i have money withdrawn near when the bill is due not early at all and my credit score is top notch   it 's far far more important that you do n't pay late   i do n't think paying early earns you brownie points with fico now if you have an interest bearing checking account and if you pay your balance in full each month and are very very organized then paying at the last minute but on time lets you take full advantage of the free float that the credit card issuer gives you if you have trouble two brain cells together when it comes to bills like i do sometimes then either set up auto deduct from your checking account or pay the bill as soon as it comes in

there is a site that treats you like a fund manager in the real market each user is given 1 million in cash you can have multiple mutual funds and the site allows use to choose between two types of strategies buy sell short cover currently options are not supported the real value of the site is that users are ranked against each other of course you can op out of the rankings this is really cool because you can determine the real worth of your returns compared to the rest of investors across the site a couple years back the top 100 investors were invited to come on as real mutual fund managers so the competition is legitimate take a look at the site it 's definitely worth a try were there other great sites you looked at

this is potentially a real risk to google the odds of such a huge success it decreases google 's profits are tiny i think but there is a real risk that the increase in google 's profits going forward are materially affected by a well done competitor to adsense   if amazon took away 10 of what google 's adsense business 4 years from now would have been that is likely material to google 's earning not huge but real   even losing the ads on amazon 's web site is likely noticeable though not a huge deal i would guess to google though to most companies it would be a huge lose   there is even the potential google has to reduce their profitability on adsense to compete giving web sites a better cut of revenue   that said i think amazon has plenty of challenges to making it an effective competitor to google but they have a chance and there is even a small chance very small i think that amazon could create a competitor that actually results in noticeably say over 15 declining revenue to google via adsense likely even in this case google continues to grow profit as a company overall   google revenue from ads from their own websites are the most important earnings and likely to continue to be so also new business non web ad income is growing and i think will continue to do so this is likely an area some might find more questionable

the fact that your shares are of a canadian listed corporation as indicated in your comment reply and that you are located in the united states as indicated in your bio is highly relevant to answering the question the restriction for needing to be a qualified institutional buyer arises from the parent company not having registered the spin off company rights options or shares yet for sale in the united states shares sold in the u.s. must either be registered with the sec or qualify for some exemption see sec fast answers securities act rule 144 quoting selling restricted or control securities in the marketplace can be a    complicated process this is because the sales are so close to the    interests of the issuing company that the law might require them to be    registered under section 5 of the securities act of 1933 all offers    and sales of securities must be registered with the sec or qualify for    some exemption from the registration requirements there are regulations to follow and costs involved in such registration perhaps the rights options themselves wo n't ever be registered as they have a very limited lifetime while the listed shares might be you could contact investor relations at the parent company for more detail if i guessed the company correctly there 's detail in this press release search the text for united states

there are kind of two answers here the practical reason an acquirer has to pay more for shares than their current trading price and the economic justification for the increase in price why must the acquirer must pay a premium as a practical matter   everyone has a different valuation of a company   the current trading price is the lowest price that any holder of the stock is willing to sell a little bit of stock for and the highest that anyone is willing to buy a little bit for however microsoft needs to buy a controlling share   to do this on the open market they would need to buy all the shares from people who 's personal valuation is low and then a bunch from people whose valuation is higher and so on   the act of buying that much stock would push the price up by buying all the shares from people who are really willing to sell   moreover as they buy more and more the remaining people increase their personal valuation so the price would really shoot up   avoid this situation by offering to buy a ton of stock at a substantially higher single price why is linkedin suddenly worth more than it was yesterday microsoft is expecting to be able to use its own infrastructure and tools to make more money with linkedin than linkedin would have before   in other words they believe that the linkedin division of microsoft after the merger will be worth more than linkedin alone was before the merger   this idea is the theoretical foundation for mergers in general and the main reason people use to argue for a higher price you could also argue that by expressing an interest in linkedin microsoft may be telling us something it knows about linkedin 's value that maybe we did n't realize before because we are n't as smart and informed as the people on microsoft 's board   but since it 's microsoft that 's doing the buying in this case i 'm going to go out on a limb and say this is not the main effect   given microsoft 's history the idea that they buy expensive things because they have money to burn is more compelling than the idea that they have an insight into a company 's value that we do n't

the long and short of it is the mortgage company has a significant interest in the resale value of the home in the event of a default   imagine a scenario where you say to yourselves that you 're not going to repair the deck just yet meh we 'll do that next summer and something happens that causes a default on the mortgage the resale value of the home may be harmed by the deck even though you 're willing to live with it   that being the case the mortgage company has every right to insist that you carry out the repairs in order to maintain the property in salable condition so the essence of it is you do n't have much choice but to do the repairs keep in mind too that the insurance company paid for the roof and the deck to be repaired   if they were to learn that you now have no intention of using the money to repair the property you could end up in legal hot water with them   after all you did accept the check for repairs that you 're now not carrying out

the us withholding tax applies to stocks etfs purchased on the nyse and other us based exchanges if you buy on the tse then you will not be charged this tax   your last sentence seems like you might be misunderstanding this tax though if the tax applied it would not cost you 15 on all your profits it only applies to dividend yields so if it pays you a 5 dividend the tax costs you 0.75 however if you buy at $ and sell at $ 26 then your capital gain is not subject to withholding taxes it is however subject to canadian income tax at 50 of the gain amount when it 's not sheltered in a tfsa or other registered account the tax on the gains could easily amount to 16 of your profits which is a much more significant cost therefore having to pay a 0.75 withholding cost certainly does not defeat the purpose of the tfsa which is to shelter from canadian income tax

to many question and they are all treated differently i was wondering how the logistics of interest and dividend payments are handled on assets such as mortgages bonds stocks    what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second when the company decides to pay dividends does it literally track    down every single owner of that stock and deposit x cents per share in    that person 's bank account this sounds absolutely absurd and seems    like it would be a logistical nightmare in stocks the dividends are issued periodically the dividend date is declared well in advance as on end of the day on dividend date the list of individuals or entities who own the stock is available with the stock exchange registrar of the companies to this list the dividends are credited in next few days weeks via banking channel most of this is automated what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second on bonds things work slightly differently an bond is initially issued for say 95 discount of 5 and payment of 100 after say 5 years so when the person sells it after an year he would logically look to get a price of 96 of course there are other factors that could fetch him a price of or so every change in ownership factors in the logical rate of interest the person who submits in on maturity gets 100   for the homeowner i 'm assuming he she still makes mortgage payments to the initial bank they got the mortgage from even if the bank no longer owns the mortgage in this case does the trader on the secondary market who owns the mortgage also come back to that bank to collect his interest payment this depends on how the original financial institution sells the mortgage to new institutions generally the homeowner would keep paying initial financial institution and they would then take a margin and pay the secondary investor if this was collateral as mortgage backed security it is a very different story

reading and analyzing financial statements is one of the most important tasks of equity analysts which look at a company from a fundamental perspective   however analyzing a company and its financial statements is much more than just reading the absolute dollar figures provided in financial statements you need to calculate financial ratios which can be compared over multiple periods and companies to be able to gauge the development of a company over time and compare it to its competitors for instance for an equity analyst the absolute dollar figures of a company 's operating profit is less important than the ratio of the operating profit to revenue which is called the operating margin   another very important figure is free cash flow which can be set in relation to sales (= free cash flow sales   the following working capital related metrics can be used as a health check for a company and give you early warning signs when they deviate too much you can either calculate those metrics yourself using a spreadsheet e.g. excel or use a professional solution e.g. bloomberg professional reuters or worldcap

it is absolutely normal for your investments to go down at times if you pull money out whenever your investments decrease in value you lock in the losses   it is better to do a bit of research and come up with some sort of strategy about how you will manage your investments   one such strategy is to choose a target asset allocation or let the target date fund choose it for you and never sell until you need the money for retirement   some would advocate various other strategies that involve timing the market   the important thing is that you find a strategy that you can live with and that provides you with enough confidence that you wo n't buy and sell at random   acting on gut feelings and selling whenever you feel will likely lead to worse outcomes in the long run

with stocks you can buy or sell if you sell first that 's called shorting as in i think linkedin is too high i 'm going to short it with options the terminology is different the normal process is to buy to open sell to close but if you were shorting the option itself you would first sell to open i.e you are selling a position to start it effectively selling it short eventually you may close it out by buying to close   options trading is not for the amateur if you plan to trade study first and be very cautious

like most forms of insurance health insurance is regulated at the state level so what is available to you will depend greatly upon which state you live in you can probably find a list of insurance companies from your state 's official website many states now provide insurance of last resort for individuals who ca n't get insurance through private insurance companies you can try looking into professional and trade associations some offer group insurance plans comparable with cobra coverage meaning you 'd get a group discount and benefits but without the benefit of an employer paying 30 80 of your premiums as a software developer you may qualify for membership in the or which both offer several forms of insurance to members the also offers insurance though they do n't provide much information about it on the public portions of their website these organization offer other benefits besides insurance so you may want to take that in to consideration the national federation of independent business also offers insurance to members you may find other associations in your specific area credit unions and the local chamber of commerce are all possible avenues of finding lower cost insurance options if you are religious there are even some faith based non insurance organizations that provide medical cost sharing services they depend upon the generosity and sense of fairness and obligation of their members to share the burden of medical expenses so their definitely not for everyone

this answer is provided mostly to answer your question what is it a variable annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company the insurance company takes a bunch of money up front as a lump sum and will pay you some money yearly like earning interest in this case they will probably be paying you the money into the account itself how much they return is as the name suggests variable it can be anything depending on what the contract says mostly there will be some formula based on the stock market frequently the performance of the standard poors 500 index there will typically be some minimum returns and maximum returns if the stock market tanks your annuity will not lose a ton of value but if the stock market goes up a lot in one year as it frequently does you will not gain a lot of value either if you are going to be in the market for a long amount of time decades e.g. a few years out of college and then a little it makes a lot more sense to invest in the stock market directly this is essentially what the insurance company is going to do except you can cut out the middleman you can get a lot more money that way you are essentially paying the insurance company to take on some stock market risk for you you are buying some safety buying safety like this is expensive   variable annuities are the right investment for a few people in a few circumstances mostly if you 're near retirement it 's one way to have an option for a safe investment for a portion but not all of your portfolio maybe depending on the specifics a lot if you are under like 50 or so almost certainly a terrible investment which will gradually waste your money by not growing it as fast as it deserves to be grown since you want to transfer it to vanguard you can probably call vanguard ask to open a roth ira and request assistance rolling it over from the place it is held now there should be no legal restrictions or tax consequences from transferring the money from one roth ira account to another

i 'm assuming that when you say convert to s corp tax treatment you 're not talking about actually changing your llc to a corporation there are two distinct pieces of the puzzle here first there 's your organizational form your state which is where the business is legally formed and recognized creates the llc or corporation s corp does n't come into play here your company is either an llc or a corporation there are a handful of other organizational types your state might have e.g. limited partnership etc none of these are immediately relevant to this discussion second there 's the tax treatment you receive by the irs if your company was created by the state as an llc note that the irs does n't recognize llcs as a distinct organizational type you elect to be taxed as an individual for single member llcs a partnership for multiple member llcs or as a corporation the former two elections are pass through there 's no additional level of taxation on corporate profits everything just passes through to the owners the latter election introduces a tax on corporate profits when you elect pass through treatment a single member llc files on schedule c a multiple member llc will prepare a form k-1 which you will include on your 1040 if your company was created by the state as a corporation not an llc you could still elect pass through taxation if your company qualifies under the rules in subchapter s i.e. an s corp states do not recognize s corp as part of the organizational process that 's just a tax distinction used by the irs and possibly your state 's tax authorities in your case if you are a single member llc and assuming there are no other reasons to organize as a corporation talking about s corp tax treatment does n't make any sense you 'll just file your schedule c in my experience it 's fairly simple note that this is based on my experience of and multiple member llcs in just two states your state may have different rules that affect state level taxation and the rules may change from year to year i 've found that hiring a good cpa to prepare the forms saves a good bit of stress and time that can be better applied to the business

typically developing economics are marked by moderate to high inflation as they are growing at a faster pace higher in savings rate and higher lending rates if you reduce the lending rate more business start up will borrow at cheaper rate this in turn means lowers savings rate and leads to higher inflation to combat this central banks make borrowing expensive which lowers inflation and increases the saving rate essentially all these 3 are tied up as to why these countries offer higher interest on usd is because most of the developing countries have trade current account deficit they need to bring in more usd in the country one of the ways is to encourage non resident citizens to park their foreign earning back home ensuring more funds usd inflow   the rate differential also acts as a guide as to how the currency would be valued against usd for example if you get 8 on usd less than 12 had you converted same to rouble at the end of say 3 years the exchange rate between usd and rouble would factor that 4 ie rouble will go down developed countries on the other hand are marked by low inflation they have already achieved everything as there is no in growth it more they are also characterized by low savings and lending rates

the primary difference between japan and most other developed nations is who owns their debt   japan 's debt is almost entirely internal   that is it 's actually borrowed from within japan   it 's not owned by china or anyone else   additionally japan owns a fairly substantial proportion of the usa 's debt which provides additional security   it 's a favorite complaint of romney and his friends that american is borrowing from china to finance public spending   a lot of people do n't realize that in fact japan was until very recently america 's biggest source of borrowing   and is still number 2 by a substantial margin   combine this with pretty careful regulation by the bank of japan low bond yields and a much larger economy still with a decent manufacturing base and japan 's situation is n't remotely like greece despite it appearing worse   in a nutshell the japan is the educated university graduate with a reasonable income who like many of us who buy a house that costs many multiples of our annual salary and can afford to service the debt even if it needs to be carefully managed   greece is the homeless one armed drug addict with no prospects that struggles to find a few bucks to spend a night in a   the size of the debt is more or less irrelevant   it 's the ability to pay it that really matters   of course this does n't mean that if circumstances change things could n't go south badly but right now japan is n't in trouble and the 230 vs 130 the reality of the situation

your explanation is nearly perfect and not hand at all stock prices reflect the collective wisdom of all participating investors investors value stocks based on how much value they expect the stock to produce now and in the future so the stability of the stock prices is a reflection of the accuracy of the investors predictions investor can be seen as a sequence of increasingly sophisticated stock pricing strategies if investors were able to predict the future perfectly then all stock prices would rise at the same constant rate in theory if a particular investor is able to beat the market it is because they are better at predicting the future profits of companies or they are lucky or they are better at predicting the irrational behavior of other investors

i believe temp agencies get a payout if the employer decides to hire on the temp full time usually so it would be to prevent a temp from quitting and going to work for the employer as a way around that payment the idea is to set a term long enough not to make it worthwhile for the employer to wait rather than paying the fee

tl;dr roth earnings are not necessarily tax deferred but they might be this is a great question because imho the use of the wording tax deferred is slightly misleading when talking about a roth ira and roth 401k too the phrase tax deferred actually means you save tax now and you pay tax later i.e. you defer the tax as you pointed out this is the normal terminology used for describing a traditional ira/401k earnings on a roth ira are tax free not deferred but only if your distributions are qualified for the most part distributions are considered qualified if you wait until you are 59.5 years old before taking the money out but there are some exceptions if you choose to distribute more than your contributions meaning you are now taking out earnings the earnings are tax free only if your distribution is qualified for example if you take out the earnings before you are 59.5 and no other exceptions apply then you would pay tax on the earnings and also a 10 penalty so perhaps a better way to say it is that earnings in a roth ira are tax deferred

you are really showing some wisdom here and congratulations on finishing college    its a lot about   if you buy a new car there is something like a chance you will get a car that will not need repairs   if you buy a car for $ 1200 there is probably a 20 chance that the car will only need minimal repairs   so the answer is there is no real guarantee that spending any amount of money you will end up with a car with no repairs you also ca n't assume that with buying a car it will immediately need repairs   its possible that you could spend 1200 on a car and it will need an oil change   in three months it might need brakes and in 6 months tires   if that is the case you could save up the money for repairs have you looked for a car   it will take some work but you might be able to find something in good condition for your budget    if you shop for a loan go with a good credit union or local bank   mostly you are looking for a low rate   however i would advise against it   you worked so hard on getting out of school without debt why start now    be weird and buy a car for cash   heck someone may be able to loan you a car for a short time while you save some money

i know what you are talking about and this is what students at uc i know usually do in such cases talk with the 's office and see if you have been reported to collections if you had plans to pay via financial aid this can be a non issue but be sure it 's critical to remove your record from collections if any take a loan and find out how the loan will be paid most lenders pay the school directly based on what the school bills for the quarter if you signed up for x units in fall 10 and plan to take y units in winter 12 add x+y units in your list of courses those x units could be anything in your course catalog once the school sends out the bill and the lender pays it drop the x units this will give you a check and use that to pay out the outstanding amounts most schools will include all outstanding amounts in the bill for your current quarter but i am not sure if your lenders has agreements otherwise also some lenders have agreements in place to send refunds directly to them but remember the cashier is king and she can make refunds happen the way she likes and she is likely to help a student unless you have a bad payment history collections bounced checks

in layman 's terms oil on the commodities market has a spot price and a future price the spot price is what the last guy paid to buy a barrel of oil right now and thus a pretty good indicator of what you 'll have to pay the futures price is what the last guy paid for a futures contract where they agreed to buy a barrel of oil for $ x at some point in the future futures contracts are a form of hedging a futures contract is usually sold at a price somewhere between the current spot price and the true expected future spot price the buyer saves money versus paying the spot price while the seller still makes a profit but the buyer of a futures contract is basically betting that the spot price as of delivery will be higher while the seller is betting it will be lower futures contracts are available for a wide variety of acceptable future dates and form a curve when plotted on a graph that will trend in one direction or the other now as chad said oil companies basically get their cut no matter what oil stocks are generally a good long term bet as far as the best short term time to buy in to an oil stock look for very short windows when the spot and near future price of gasoline is trending downward but oil is still on the uptick during those times the oil companies are paying their existing high contracts for oil but when the spot price is low it affects futures prices which will affect the oil companies margins day traders will see that the sky is falling and sell off driving the price down temporarily that 's when you buy in pretty much the only other time an oil stock is a guaranteed win is when the entire market takes a swan dive and then bottoms out oil has such a built in demand for the foreseeable future that regardless of how bad it gets you will make money on an oil stock so when the entire market 's in a panic and everyone 's heading for gold t debt etc buy the major oil stocks across the spectrum even if one stock tanks chances are really good that another company will see that and offer a buyout jacking the bought company 's stock which you then sell and reinvest the cash into the buying company which will have taken a hit on the news due to the huge drop in working capital of course the one thing to watch for in the headlines is any news that renewables have become much more attractive than oil you wait in the next few decades some enterprising individual will invent a super efficient solar cell that provides all the power a real practical car will ever need and that is simultaneously integrated into wind farms making oil gas plants when that happens oil will be a thing of the past

he 's comfortably middle class but not wealthy the tesla was purchased in a multi owner shared arrangement and the solar panels were installed by a company that supplies the capital for the panels with a long term agreement to supply power to the homeowner and takes care of the more complex business agreements to feed back power to the grid the situation on paper looks like   a long term break even but we 'll have to see   overall even if he 's paying a bit more in electric cost the arrangement gives a lot of stability in exchange   to me it 's clear that going electric car + renewable electric is a long term good on the principle of becoming nationally independent from geopolitical but also more towards becoming individually independent in terms of being isolated from instability in gas prices utility prices and even in times of natural disaster

insurance you purchase is paid to you however even if the home is destroyed you still owe all the money to the bank and you no longer have the house as part of the land 's value to guarantee the loan so depending on how much the land is still worth versus how much you owe and exactly what the terms of the loan are you may need to use some or all of that money to repay enough of the loan to bring it back within the bank 's policies read the terms of the loan consider asking a lawyer to clarify it for you if necessary having a lawyer review that kind of major contract is always wise anyway

as i understand it the usual rule is that the country you are resident in taxes you on your worldwide income but gives you credit for foreign tax paid the country you are not normally resident in taxes you only on income from that one country note that residence for tax purposes can have different rules from residence for immigration purposes at least in the uk being resident in the country for more than half the tax year normally makes you tax resident and there are some other cases too i expect other countries are similar but the details of the rules and the start end of the tax years may vary i do n't know the exact rules for finland and belgium but i expect your belgian taxes will be based on your belgian income only and your finnish taxes will be based on your worldwide income but with a credit for your belgian taxes engaging accountants from both countries to confirm the exact rules and what exactly you should put on the forms is almost certainly a good idea

# 490529
to expand on @joetaxpayer 's answer the devil is actually in the fine print all   the credit card checks that i have ever received in the mail explicitly says that the checks can not be used to pay off   or pay down the balance on any other credit card issued by the same bank whether the card is branded with the bank logo or is branded with a department store or airline logo etc the checks can be used to pay utilities or even taxes without paying the service fee that is charged for using a credit card for such payments the payee is paid the face amount of the check in contrast to charges on a credit card from a merchant who gets to collect only about of the amount on the   charge slip generally speaking balance transfer offers are a bad deal regardless    of whether you pay only the minimum amount due each month or whether    you pay each month 's statement balance in full by the due date or    anything in between the rest of this answer is an explanation in support of the above assertion feel free to tl;dr it if you like if you make only the minimum payment due each month and some parts of the balance that you are carrying has different interest rates applicable than other parts then your payment can be applied to any part of the balance at the bank 's discretion it need hardly be said that the bank invariably chooses to apply it to pay off the lowest rate portion by law card act of 2009 anything above the minimum payment due must be applied to pay off the highest rate part and then the next highest rate part etc but minimum payment or less is at the bank 's discretion as an illustration suppose that you are not using your credit cards any more and are paying down the balances due by making the minimum payment due each month suppose also that you have a balance of $ 1000 carrying 12 apr on card a and pay off the entire balance of $ 500 on card b transferring the amount at 0 apr to card a for which you are billed a 2 fee your next minimum payment   will be likely be $ 35 computed as $ 10 interest on $ 1000 + $ 10 transfer fee + $ 15 1 of balance of $ 1500 if you make only the minimum payment due that payment will go towards paying off the $ 500 and so for next month your balance will be $ 1500 of which $ will be charged 1 interest and $ will be charged 0 interest   in the months   that follow the balance on which you owe 1 interest per month will grow and the 0 balance will shrink   you have to pay more than the minimum amount due to reduce the amount that you owe in this example in the absence of the balance transfer the minimum payment would have been $ 20 = $ 10 interest on $ 1000 at 1 per month + $ 10 1 of balance and would have left you with $ 990 due for next month   to be at the same point with the balance transfer offer you would need to pay $ 30 more than the minimum payment of $ 35 due this extra $ 30 will pay off the interest and transfer fee $ 20 and the rest will be applied to the $ 1000 balance to reduce it to $ 990 there would be no balance transfer fee in future months and so the extra that you need to pay will be a little bit smaller etc if you avoid paying interest charges on credit cards by never taking any cash advances and by paying off the monthly balance   consisting only of purchases made within the past month in full by the due date then the only way to avoid paying interest on the purchases made during the month of the balance transfer offer is to pay off that month 's statement in full including the balance just transferred over and the balance transfer fee by the due date   so depending on when in the billing cycle the transfer occurs you are getting a loan of the balance transfer amount for 25 to 55 days and being charged 2 or 3 for the privilege if you are getting offers of 2 balance transfer fees instead of 3 you are probably among those who pay their balances in full each month and the bank is trying to tempt you into doing a balance transfer by offering a lower fee it is unlikely that they will make a no transfer fee offer they would prefer laughing all the way to themselves by collecting a 2 transfer fee from you and possibly interest too if you fail to read the fine print than having you decline such offers at 3 as being too expensive can you make a balance transfer offer work in your favor sure   do n't make any purchases on the card in the month of the balance transfer or during the entire time that the 0 apr is being offered in the month of the transfer pay the minimum balance due plus the balance transfer fee in succeeding months pay the minimum balance due typically 1 of the balance owed each month all of it will go to reducing the 0 apr balance because that is the only amount owing just before the 0 apr expires anywhere from 6 to 24 months pay off the remaining balance in full   but remember that you are losing the use of this card for this whole period of time put it away in a locked trunk in the attic because using the card to make a purchase will mean paying interest on charges from the day they post something that might be totally alien to you

we all have a concept of costs   we have all said f that i am not paying $ 2.00 for a candy bar but i 'll pay that for that ice cream bar only because we are used to paying $ 2.00 for an ice cream but not $ 1.50 for a candy bar    business owners are the same    i 'll throw in my very limited knowledge of roofing      looked into doing it myself   could have had my roofing supplies delivered to my roof for about $ 1800 but did n't have the insurance so i got four bids to do my roof   $ $ $ and $ 17,000    four guys showed up to my house and it was done in a   day      now i am a business owner    i get that there is insurance advertising trucks accounting bookkeeping etc   but if you are talking about roofers    4 guys x 8 32 man hours    if you increase wages by $ 5.00 an hour that is $   got ta think that being able to get a $ 6000 job even if it costs $ 160 more is an acceptable cost even an additional $ 10 an hour is acceptable

if they own the old house outright they can mortgage it to you in many jurisdictions this you of the obligation to chase for payment and of any worry that you wo n't get paid because a transfer of ownership to the new owner can not be registered until any charge against a property ie a mortgage has been discharged the cost of to your friends of setting up the mortgage will be less than the interest they are offering you and you will both have peace of mind even if the sale of the old house falls through you will still be its mortgagee and still assured of repayment on any future sale or even inheritance complications arise if the first property is mortgaged although second mortgages are possible and rank behind first mortgages in priority of repayment the first mortgagee generally has a veto on the creation of second mortgages

1 usually the choice between traditional vs. roth is whether you believe that your tax rate will be higher or lower in the future than it is now your income is probably in the 25 bracket now it 's hard to say whether that should be considered high or low some people advocate roth only for 15 bracket but your income would probably go into higher brackets in the future so roth may be preferable from this point of view roth ira also has another advantage that the principal of contributions can be taken out at any time without tax or penalty so it can serve as an emergency fund just as well as money in taxable accounts given that you may not have a lot of money saved up right now this is useful 2 in a sense it 's nice to have a mix of traditional and roth when you withdraw to hedge against uncertainty in future tax rates and have the option of choosing whichever one is advantageous to withdraw when you need to withdraw that said you will likely have many years of access to a 401k and high income in your future working years in which you can contribute to a traditional 401k or if no access to 401k then traditional ira so a mix will almost certainly happen even if you go all roth ira now 3 i think that depends on you whether you are a hands on or hands off kind of investor

it is possible to achieve a substitute for refinancing but because of the short life of cars at least relative to housing there are no true first the entire loan will not be able to be refinanced   the balance less approximately 80 of the value of the car will have to be repaid   cars depreciate by something like 20 per year so $ 2,000 will have to be repaid now you should be able to get a loan if your boyfriend has good credit but the interest rate will not drop too much further from the current loan 's rate because of your presumably bad credit rating assumed because of your current interest rate while this is doable this is not a good strategy if you intend to have a long term relationship   one of the worst of a relationship is money   it will put a strain on your relationship and lower the odds of success the optimal strategy if the monthly payments are too high is to try to sell the car so to buy a cheaper car   the difficulty here is that the bank will not allow this if balance of the loan exceeds the proceeds from the sale so putting as much money towards paying the balance to allow a sale is best as a side note please insure your car against occurrences such as theft and damage with a deductible low enough to justify the monthly payment   it is a terrible position to have a loan no car and no collateral against the car

the home owner does not start foreclosure the bank decides when to foreclose   therefore you can not really decide a time to foreclose if you are trying to time the decision the process you miss payments and the banks will send you a late notice for the missing payments   expect many notices the bank will call you at home on your cell phone and at work   they will mail you letters regarding the missing payments if you continue to miss payments the bank will probably demand the loan be paid in full   you will owe the bank the full balance of the principle all past due interest all past due late charges and junk fees   the bank wo n't even take a normal monthly payment from you should you try to pay your regular payment again some law enforcement will notify you on the bank 's intent to foreclose   the bank has begun legal proceedings legal notices are published in the local newspaper soon the notices and the legal waiting period will expire   court proceedings happen   the court will then allow the bank to foreclose notices to into the paper again about the updated status of the foreclosure the house is sold at auction money from the auction is used to pay taxes owned then mortgages then other liens or creditors who file further debt for the home owner taxes when sold if the mortgage debt exceeds the home 's fair market value us federal tax rules say the selling price as the fair market value the fair market value can still be higher than the tax basis which i think is the value of the house at the time of original purchase plus improvements    if the fair market value is higher you will own taxes on sale   however tax rules in the us say if you have owned the home more than two years and make less than $ 250,000 in the transaction $ 500,000 if married you will not owe any tax   state taxes can be different additionally if the mortgage lender the debt and does n't create a deficiency that income is taxable as well   this is more an more common these days   there are exceptions if the home is your primary residence this whole process an take several months to occur but depends on where you live   if you continue to live in the home after the auction the new owner must evict you from the property which is another set of legal proceedings your credit and ability to buy are home will be damaged for the next several years i am not so sure on how pmi works for the banks but i know they are getting some money back

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

what you 're describing is called timing the market   that is if you correctly predict when the market will drop you can sell before the drop wait for the drop then buy after the drop has occurred   sell high buy low the fundamental problem with that though is what ends up happening on average is you end up slightly behind   there 's quite a lot of literature on this see betterment 's explanation for example   forbes click through ad first also has a detailed piece on the matter now we 're not really talking hft issues here and there are some structural things that some argue you can take advantage of restrictions on some organizational investors for example similar to a blackjack dealer who has to hit on 16   however everyone else knows about these too so it 's hard to gain much of an edge plenty of people say they can time the market right and even yourself perhaps you timed a particular drop accurately   this tends to lead to false confidence though how many drops that you timed badly do you remember ultimately most investors end up slightly down when they attempt to time the market because of the transaction costs if you guess two drops one right and one wrong and they have exactly opposite gains losses before commissions you will lose a bit on each due to commission and because of the overall upward trend in the market ie if you picked at random one month a year to be out of the market you 'd lose around 10 annualized gains from doing that same applies here all of that aside there is one major caveat risk tolerance   if you are highly risk tolerant say a 30 year old investing your 401(k then you should stay in no matter what   if you 're not say you 're 58 and retiring in a few years then knowledge that there 's a higher risk time period coming up might suggest moving to a less risky portfolio even at the known cost of some gains

gt any time you split a portfolio up whether it be a credit portfolio or a trading book portfolio you lose the benefits of diversification that allow you to reduce the capital you hold against it said mr austen gt    just to amplify this a little banks like diversification but you can only diversify within a reporting entity at the moment most banks have a single eu wide reporting entity so thay are free to combine trade and credit exposures with a mandated split they will be forced to split the pot between the uk and the eu entities as each must look healthy

pretty simple actually this is a state run defined benefit plan where the benefit is calculated based on the length of the employment and the contributed amounts this is what in the us is known as the social security   this is a defined contribution plan where the employee can chose the level of risk based on certain pre defined investment guidelines more conservative or more aggressive in poland it appears that there 's a certain amount of the state mandated ss tax is transferred to these plans nothing in the us is like that but you can see it as a mandatory ira with a preset limited choice of mutual funds to invest into as an analogy the recent change was to reduce the portion of the contribution that is diverted to this plan from to 2.3 on account of expanding the contribution to 1 probably the recent crashes of the stock markets that affected these accounts lead to this decision this is voluntary defined contribution plan similar to the us 401ks this division is actually pretty common not unique to poland i 'd say its the standard pension scheme as opposed to what we 're used to in the us

you should also look outside the box there are non profit credit relief organizations that will give you free credit counseling do n't pay for it though there are some organizations that are shady in offering counseling but they wreck your credit by asking you to stop making your payments some of the legitimate organizations out there have ties to credit unions and banks that can offer you some loans to consolidate your debt at rates lower than those you mentioned in your questions you should probably also approach a credit union directly and discuss debt consolidation loan options even if you can only knock out the debts with the highest interest rate that 's a good first step

it 's a scam the cashier 's check will be forged craigslist has a warning about it here item 3 what kind of payment do you think is not or at least not    likely to be used in scams when on craigslist deal only locally and in person you can ask to see the person 's id if you 're being paid by check when being paid by check how can seeing his her id help in case the    check is n't i can find that person by keeping record of    his her id   if you 're paid by check the payers details should be printed on the check by checking the id you can verify that the details match name address so you can find the payer later of course the id can be faked too but there 's so much you can do to protect yourself you 'll get better protection including verified escrow service by selling on ebay is being paid by cash the safest way currently    although cash can be faked too but it is the least common thing that    is faked currently do you recommend to first deposit the cash into a    bank so that let the bank verify if the cash is faked before    delivering the good   for craigslist use cash and meet locally that rules out most scams as a seller what payment methods do you think are relatively safe currently    then getting checks must be the least favorite way of being paid do    you think cash is better than money order or cashier order   you should only accept cash if it is a large transaction you can meet them at your bank have them get cash and you receive the cash from the bank back to the quoted scam how will they later manipulate me are they interested in    my stuffs on moving sale or in my money they will probably accidentally overpay you and ask for a refund of some portion of the overpayment in that case you will be out the entire amount that you send back to them and possibly some fees from your bank for cashing a bad check

to be completely honest i think that a target of 10 15 is very high and if there were an easy way to attain it everyone would do it if you want to have such a high return you 'll always have the risk of losing the same amount of money option 1 i personally think that you can make the highest return if you invest in real estate and actively manage your if you do this well with short term rental and/or airbnb i think you can make healthy returns but it will cost a lot of time and effort which may diminish its appeal think about talking to your estate agent to find renters or always ensuring your airbnb place is in good nick so you get a high rating and keep getting good customers if you 're looking for passive income i do n't think this is a good choice also make sure you take note of 's point of costs no matter what you plan for your costs will always be higher than you think think about water damage a tenant that breaks things doesn't take care of stuff etc option 2 i think taking a loan is unnecessarily risky if you 're in good financial shape as it seems unless you 're gon na buy a house with a mortgage and live in it option 3 i think your best option is to buy bonds and shares you can follow 's 100 minus your age rule which seems very reasonable personally i invest all my money in shares because that 's how my father brought me up but it 's really a matter of taste both can be risky though bonds are usually safer i think i should note that you can not expect a return of 10 or more because as everyone always says if there were a way to guarantee it everyone would do it you say you do n't have any idea how this works so i 'd go to my bank and ask them you probably have access to private banking so that should mean someone will be able to sit you down and talk you through also look at other banks that have better rates and/or pretend you 're leaving your bank to negotiate a better deal if i were you i 'd invest in blue chips big international companies listed on the main dax ftse 100 dow jones or passively managed mutual funds etfs that track these just remember to diversify by country and industry a bit note i would not buy the vehicles plans that my bank no matter what they promise and they promise a lot suggest because if you do that then the bank always takes a cut off your money tldr do nt expect to make 10 15 on a passive investment and do what a lot of others do shares and bonds also make sure you get a lot of peoples opinions

any time there is a share adjustment from spin off merger stock split or reverse there is zero chance for the stockholders to hang on to fractional shares they are turned into cash    for the employees in the 401 k program or investors via a mutual fund or etf this is n't a problem because the fraction of a share left over is compared to the thousands or millions of shares owned by the fund as a collective for the individual investor in the company this can be a problem that they are n't happy about   in some cases the fractional share is a byproduct that will result from any of these events in the case of a corporate merger or spin off most investors will not have an integer number of shares so that fraction leftover that gets converted to cash is n't a big deal when they want to boost the price to a specific range to meet a regulatory requirement they are getting desperate and do n't care that some will be forced out in other cases it is by design to force many shareholders out they want to go private they to split if you had less than 1000 shares pre split then you will end up with zero shares plus cash they know exactly what number to use the result after the split is that the number of investors is small enough they they can now fall under a different set of regulations they have gone dark they do n't have to file as many reports and they can keep control of the company   once the board of directors or the majority stockholders votes on this the small investors have no choice

sometimes i think a question like this is one of moral versus legal   the reality is that you know you owe the money because you received the services   you 're right that the bill should have been sent to you and the natural urge for many people is to just count it in the win column when things like this happen and there 's the chance to avoid paying i suppose my question for you is are you comfortable with the notion that you are not paying something that your heart of hearts tells you should be paid   if roles were reversed and you as a business owner had forgotten to bill something for which you were rightfully due payment would n't you hope they 'd have the integrity to pay you anyway the legal side of this can be a bit trickier and much depends on the state you 're in assuming you 're in the u.s. because some have consumer collection and protection laws than others   the rehab center could when doing an audit of its accounts discover that you did n't pay for these   they could take the polite course of action and call you with a gentle reminder or send a bill or they could be not so nice about it   either way they ca n't send anything to collections for which you have n't been presented a bill and demonstrated an unwillingness to pay   there 's a process in place regardless of the state so they ca n't just automatically put it into collections i will close with this question for you did the rehab center help you with what you needed and are you healthier and better because of their care   if so pay the bill   that 's my advice   keep in mind that unpaid medical costs just raise the prices for everyone else because these providers will make up for the loss somewhere i hope this helps good luck

this is a good thing   this person is a parasite i do n't mean that i mean he fits the dictionary definition of a parasite the same way a tapeworm does his host organism is the healthy and vibrant society of the united states and its people who do work that creates enormous economic value like a tapeworm he has himself into the body of the organism and removes whatever resources he feels like taking   there is absolutely no reason why david siegel or any other parasite deserves to make his outlandish gains at the expense of their host organism of course the parasite 's philosophy is that it worked hard to establish its privileged place within the host body and it is morally wrong for the host to try to starve it of resources but that philosophy does not translate to the host if you have a tapeworm you get it removed it 's not your problem if the tapeworm dies because you never agreed to let it your gut in the first place   of course a tapeworm if it can will find ways to make sure that extraction kills the host in the hope that the host will simply allow the present state of affairs to continue but again there is no reason why the host should agree to this   and so when your tapeworm writes you a letter demanding that you cease a particular course of action the only thing that could possibly mean is that you should pursue that course of action stronger and harder because clearly it is

remember that risk should correlate with returns in an investment this means that the more risk you take on the more return you should be receiving in an efficient marketplace that 's why putting your money in a savings account might earn you < 1 interest right now but putting money in the stock market averages returns over time you should be very careful not to use the word interest when you mean returns in your post you are calling capital gains the increase in value of owned property interest this may be in your head the level of risk associated with property ownership in the case of the bank they are not in the business of home construction rather than take that risk themselves they would rather finance many projects being done by construction companies that know the business the bank has a high degree of certainty of getting its money back because its mortgages are protected by the value of the property   part of the benefit of an efficient marketplace is that risk gets bought by individuals who want it this means that people with a low risk tolerance such as banks people on fixed incomes seniors etc can avoid risk and people with a high risk tolerance stock investors young people with high income etc can take on that risk for higher average returns the bank 's reasoning should remind you of the risk associated with property ownership increases in value are not a sure thing if you do not understand the risk of your investment you can not be certain that you are being well compensated for that risk note also that most countries place regulations on their banks that limit the amount of their funds that can be placed in higher risk asset classes typically this something along the lines of if someone places a deposit with your bank you can only invest that deposit in a low risk debt based asset ie you can take money deposited by customer a and use it to finance a mortgage for customer b this is done in an attempt to prevent collapse of the financial sector if risky investments start failing

any large stockbroker will offer trading in us securities as a foreign national you will be required to register with the us tax authorities irs by completing and filing a w-8ben form and pay us withholding taxes on any dividend income you receive   us dividends are paid net of withholding taxes so you do not need to file a us tax return   capital gains are not subject to us taxes   also each year you are holding us securities you will receive a form from the irs which you are required to complete and return you will also be required to complete and file forms for each of the exchanges you wish to received market price data from trading will be restricted to us trading hours which i believe is 6 hours ahead of denmark for the new york markets   you will simply submit an order to the desired market using your broker 's online trading software or your broker 's telephone dealing service you can expect to pay significantly higher commissions for trading us securities when compared to domestic securities you will also face potentially large foreign exchange fees when your funds from eur to usd all in all you will probably be better off using your local market to trade us index or sector etfs

hey nuts i 've been working with blockchain implementation since before you became an armchair investor   blockchain technology is an implementation of security by consensus it can be between 2 people and 100 million bitcoin 's incentive is the mother of all value into this so it has value so you can get value out of it it was never suppose to be industrialized in the way it has been and it 's become an amoral waste of resources further evidence can be found in the fact that bitcoin had no value except as a currency before people started hacking contracts and the like into it is admirable in that it actually has some kind of intent of value built into it but it 's simply not good enough for high demand applications   in a private chain mining does n't operate with an increasing cost it could be done by a single system which is good enough for an internal chain the security comes from the of the chain that is generated which is what everyone subscribed to the chain gains once something is added no amount of hacking a centralized system could change the confirmed blocks an attacker might be able to add a bunch of new blocks but you could with consensus roll back the entire chain    as a simple example a company has several partners who it coordinates exchange rates with they set the value and they want to share that with their partners while keeping an entirely proof history of the set values they start the chain and allow their partners to subscribe to it they can then set their system to add a block every hour which contains the set values now every partner is keeping a consensus based record of what the trading values were when if for whatever reason an audit was required ie say they suspect someone was trading higher lower than they should have they can audit the chain and see exactly what everyone agreed would be the price at the time the exchanges were made if a partner messed with his chain to cover whatever he would be involved in the other 's would refute it it would be exceptionally hard for any single bad actor to alter all the chains   the incentive in a private chain is rolled into business incentives for record keeping they gain value by keeping certain types of records secure in this manor therefore it is worth it to do they do n't need a literal payout to keep their own records secure   this is why companies want to use the blockchain records secured by even loose consensus are more secure than a centralized database but with little to no increase in operation overhead it then further gains value in that it could lead to distributed amp recorder keeping and management   tldr lol you armchair finance guys

the statement can be true but is n't a general rule crashes and recessions are two different things a crash is when the market rapidly something when prices are out of equilibrium whether it be stocks a commodity or even a service   when the internet was new nobody knew how to design webpages so web page designers were in huge demand and insane price premiums i literally had college classmates billing real companies $ for marginal web skills eventually the market up and that industry collapsed overnight another example of a crash from the supply point of view was the discovery of silver in the western us during the 19th century these discoveries increased the supply of the commodity to the point that silver coin eroded in value and devastated small family farms who mostly dealt in silver currency recessions are often linked to crashes but you do n't need a crash to have a recession basically during a recession trade and industrial activity drop the economy operates in cycles and the euphoria and over optimistic projections of a growing or booming economy lead to periods of reduced growth where the economy essentially itself capital is a if not the key element of the economic cycle it 's a catalyst that makes things happen debt is one form of capital it 's not good not bad generally cheap capital ie low interest rates bring economic growth why if i can borrow at 4 i can then perform some sort of economic activity bake bread make computers assemble cars etc that will earn myself 6 8 or 10 on the dollar when interest rates go up economic activity slows because the higher cost of credit increases the risk of losing money on an investment the downside of cheap capital is that risk taking gets too easy and you can run into situations like the $ 2 m ranch houses in california the downside of expensive tight capital is that it gets harder for businesses to operate and economic activity slows down the effects of either extreme cascade and snowball

the big issue i can see is foreign exchange risk if you 've got the money in the us and you need it in australia you 're vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the two currencies i would think that if you 're expecting to go back to the us you might want to leave some money in the us to guard against the falling against the us$ if you 're not planning to go back you 're probably better off moving the money with you unless you expect the usd to appreciate considerably against the aud anytime soon the picture changes slightly if you still have expenses in the us like paying for a mortgage or repairs to a property there or something similar as you 're probably better off leaving part of the money in the us to get rid of both the exchange rate losses and currency risk

the government does n't borrow money it in fact simply prints it the bond market is used for an advanced way of controlling the demand for this printed money think about it logically take 2011 for example the govt spent $ 1.7 trillion more than it took in this is real money that get 's credited in to people 's bank accounts to purchase real goods and services now who purchases the majority of treasuries the primary dealers what are the primary dealers they are banks where do banks get their money from us   so now put two and two together when the govt spends $ 1.7 trillion and credits our bank accounts the banking system has $ 1.7 trillion more then that money flows in to pension funds gets spent in to corporation who then send that money to china for cheap products and eventually the money spent purchases up govt securities for investments we had to physically give china 1 trillion dollars for them to be able to purchase 1 trillion dollars in securities so it makes sense if you think about how the math works in the real world

in general i think you 're conflating a lot of ideas    the stock market is not like a supermarket   with the exception of a direct issue you 're not buying your shares from the company or from the new york stock exchange you 're buying from an owner of stock joe sally a pension fund a hedge fund etc it 's not sitting on a shelf at the stock market when you buy an apple stock you do n't own $ 10 of apple you own of apple because apple has shares outstanding   when a the board gets together to vote on and approve a dividend the approved dividend is then divided by billion to determine how much each owner receives   the company does n't pay dividends out to owners from a pot of money it received from new owners it sold iphones at a profit and is sending a portion of that profit to the owners of the company    when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the    company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your    stock for the company 's assets the statement does have backing   it 's backed by the us judicial system   but there 's a difference between owning a company and owning the assets of the company   you own of the company and the company owns the company 's assets   nevermind how disruptive it would be if any shareholder could unilaterally decide to sell a company 's buildings or other assets this is not a ponzi scheme because when you buy or sell your apple stock it has no impact on apple you 're simply transacting with another random shareholder barring a share repurchase or direct issue   apple does n't receive the proceeds of your private transaction you do as far as value goes yes the stock market provides tons of value and is a staple of capitalism   the stock market provides an avenue of financing for companies   rather than taking a loan a company 's board can choose to some control and take on additional owners who will share in the of the enterprise    additionally the exchanges deliver value via an unbelievable level of liquidity   you do n't have to go seek out joe or sally when you want to sell your apple stock   you do n't need to put your shares on craigslist in the hope of finding a buyer   you do n't have to negotiate a price with someone who knows you want to sell   you just place an order at an exchange and you 're aligned with a buyer    also understand that anything can move up or down in value without any money actually changing hands   say you get your hands on a pair of shoes or whatever they 're hot on the market very rare and sought after   you think you can sell them for $ 1,000 on tonight 's news it turns out that the leather is actually from humans and the ceo of the company is being indicted the company is falling apart etc   your shoes just went from $ 1,000 to $ 0 with no money changing hands or from $ 1,000 to $ 100,000 depending on how cynical you are

there are definitely ways to retroactively consolidate medical bills there 's an entire industry of companies offering debt consolidation many of which are scummy predatory be careful see and some decent articles at and in general what you are looking to do is take out a loan possibly at a better interest rate than whatever you are being charged currently and pay off the medical bills if you are not paying interest on the medical bills and are just being allowed to spread out the payments you are already golden and should just put up with the ups and downs if you have any equity in a home take out a home equity loan or line of credit pay off your medical bills rates are still great right now even if you have no home equity to tap if you have a steady job you might be able to get a nice small loan from a local bank or peer to peer lending site do your homework and only work with reputable companies especially if doing things online

given that such activities are criminal and the people committing them have to hide them from the law it 's very unlikely that an investor could detect them let alone one from a different country the only things that can realistically help is to keep in mind the adage if something sounds too good to be true it probably is and to stick to relatively large companies since they have more auditing requirements and fraud is much harder to hide at scale but not impossible see enron edit and of course diversify this kind of thing is rare and not systematic so diversification is a very good protection

then my 100 honest answer would be the same but an insignificant and number of people not that anyone going without healthcare is n't concerning just that it will happen no matter what path we choose and a free market diminishes it the most some people wo n't act in their own interests did you read the original article i posted it appears you did not i encourage you to do so    everyone would like to receive free stuff no surprise    i 'm coming from an honest admission that the market would and should provide a variety of differing qualities of healthcare to best serve everyone and their differing valuation of their health government can not do that but a free market can like shoes or anything else we ca n't all afford italian leather but most people can get shoes of all sorts of sizes and styles and colors that 's because the market works let the market work in healthcare and you get the absolute people without it and they can spend what they want on it people who exercise every day will probably spend more on it those who drink and smoke everyday probably wo n't and that 's not my business or yours quite frankly

a lot of your questions are probably best directed towards your payroll department who have no doubt done this sort of thing before   but i can answer about the cross border banking question   of the big five canadian banks the one with the largest presence in the u.s. is almost certainly td   td stands for toronto after all   td canada trust the canadian version of the bank seems to offer a range of services for cross border banking   i would recommend calling the canadian bank and asking what they can do for you   trying to get things set up from the u.s. side is likely to lead to frustration   canadians needing to do financial stuff in the u.s. is much much more common than americans needing to do financial stuff in canada and the bank staff on each side of the border will probably be proportionately helpful

there are some circumstances in which it is a good idea chris w rea has already mentioned the case where you expect your marginal tax rate to decrease but there is also the case where lack of contributions might cause your marginal rate to increase assume your income is $ 20,000 over the 46 threshold and you normally contribute $ 20,000 to rrsp however this year you have only been able to contribute $ 10,000 if you wait until next year and contribute an extra $ 10,000 making $ 30,000 the extra $ 10,000 will only bring 35 tax back if you can borrow the money and make the contribution this year it will get 46 tax back that makes the loan worth taking making the contribution now can also get you a larger rebate this year you will have that money for twelve extra months and you can invest it that probably is n't enough to make it worthwhile alone but it certainly makes the damage less however i would always recommend taking out an rrsp loan for as short a time as possible my recommendation would always be to make the contribution as late in the period as possible apply for your tax refund as soon as you can and then pay off the loan with the refund you be able to get away with having the loan only for a couple of months

that is a pretty sweet setup the few months i was on contract with an oil company they had a similar arrangement although not quite as good as that this is a different situation though i 'm sorry but i do n't think that as many people can do what needs to be done on an oil rig as can be trained to be a cop i personally do n't think they should be compensated at that level

from the other point of view company use it makes sense to segregate expenses incurred on the company 's behalf away from an employee 's personal expenses   this way if there were any requirement to prove that certain expenses were for the company 's benefit it is not intermingled with an employee 's personal expenses    from an ethical point of view   to avoid these types of confusing and conflicting issues most employer 's prefer to have a segregated expense process especially if an employee is regularly incurring expenses on the company 's behalf   as mentions you should check with your employer about their expense policy
