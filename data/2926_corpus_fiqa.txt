if i were in your shoes i would concentrate now on investing in yourself   your greatest wealth building tool is your income   going to school is great make sure you can finish   also is there additional coursework you can obtain that might help boost your salary   i would look for course in the following areas that might be outside your core competency after that i would concentrate on some books that will help you in your journey   however i would not start investing until you have a well paying full time job that will get you started

does it make sense to calculate the irr based on the outstanding value of the project or just use the cash flows paid out let 's assume i invest x amount every year for 49 years and the investment grows at a constant rate but i do not get dividends before which will be constant 50 years later i assume that the value of the investment will decline as it pays dividend and will be worth 0 when the dividends stop    do i calculate the irr as the negative streams of outflows for the first 49 years and then positive cash inflows from 50 year in the future if i apply this method the irr will be very low almost equal to the annual expected return   or based on the current value of the project for each year combined with cash outflows for the first 49 years and dividends from year 50 if i apply this method the irr will be a lot higher than the first method

with reference to the uk structured deposits should not be confused with structured products   structured deposits are often quite simple deposit accounts you place your money into what is essentially a deposit account and are therefore guaranteed not to lose your capital as with any other deposit account the attraction is that you could earn more than you would in a normal deposit account often around double due to indirect exposure to the markets another benefit is that structured deposits can form part of your annual cash isa allowance so the returns can be tax free these products are popular with those who have savings which they are happy to deposit away for between 3 and 6 years and are looking for better rates of return than standard cash isas or savings accounts the main drawback is that you may not receive anything other than your original deposit that poses a minimal risk if your savings are earning less than 1 currently   see my article at for a more rounded overview of the structured deposits

a drop in credit score of 300 is pretty significant right   you describe the cause of this as unfortunate circumstances   lets say you observe a mother giving a small child a ball to play with in the median of a busy interstate   once the inevitable happens would you also describe that as unfortunate circumstances   because really it is the same thing you overextended yourself and did not consider risk in the decision to borrow money   this may sound harsh but you have proven that you can not handle credit   so your solution is to borrow more   that makes no sense the best thing you can do for your credit score is to reduce then eliminate all debt

no as a rule the dividends you see in the distribution table are what you 'll receive before paying any taxes tax rates differ between qualified and unqualified ordinary dividends so the distribution ca n't include taxes because tax rates may differ between investors in my case i hold it in an israeli account but the tax treaty between our countries still specifies 25 withheld tax this is another example of why tax rates differ between investors if i hold spy too my tax rate will be very different because i do n't hold it in an account like yours so the listed dividend could n't include taxes

you ca n't ask insurers to use a particular score they have a state approved underwriting model that they must follow consistently insurance companies make money by not paying claims and poor credit score including limit access to credit increases the probability that you will file a small claim why if you get into a minor accident say $ 750 of damage and have a $ 500 deductible you are much less likely to file a claim to get $ 250 if you have access to a cash or credit lines to make the repairs yourself   if you feel that you are going to be penalized for closing credit card accounts the solution is simple do n't close them other than an event where you need to sever a relationship with a co owner of an account ie you break up with your significant other dissolve a business etc or avoid paying an annual fee there is no advantage to you closing a revolving credit account ever if you can not control your spending throw the card in the eventually the credit card company will close your account for inactivity which affects your credit to a lesser degree the big exception is if you carry sufficient balances on other cards your credit utilization ratio goes up materially

the reason your 401k match is always counted as pre tax whether you are contributing to a traditional 401k or a roth is that the money is contributed by the employer and is not counted as income and that contribution is not taxed as income should you wish to pay taxes on it and convert it to a roth you can do that though perhaps not until you change jobs

several actually maintenance costs as landlord you are liable for maintaining the basic systems of the dwelling structure electrical plumbing hvac on top of that you typically also have to maintain anything that comes with the space so if you 're including appliances like a w d or fridge if they crap out you could spend a months rent or more replacing them you are also required to keep the property up to city codes as far as unless you specifically assign those responsibilities to your tenant and in some states you are not allowed to do so and in many cases renters expect to come out of their rent one way or the other failure to do these things can put you in danger of giving your tenant a free out on the lease contract and even expose you to civil and criminal penalties if you 're running a real slum escrow payments the combination of property tax and homeowner 's insurance usually doubles the monthly housing payment over principal and interest and that 's if you got a mortgage for 20 down also because this is not your primary residence it 's ineligible for homestead act exemptions where available states like texas are considering extending homestead exemptions to landlords with the expectation it will trickle down to renters however mortgage interest and state taxes do count as rental expenses and can be deducted on schedule c as ordinary business expenses offsetting revenues income tax the money you make in rent on this property is taxable as self employment income tax you 're effectively running a sole proprietorship real estate management company so not only does any profit you are allowed to deduct maintenance and administrative costs from the rent revenues get added to whatever you make in salary at your day job you 're also liable for the full employee and employer portions of medicare medicaid ss taxes you are however also allowed to depreciate the property over its expected life and deduct depreciation the life of a house is pretty long and if you depreciate more than the house 's actual loss of value you take a huge hit if when you sell because any amount of the sale price above the depreciated price of the house is a capital gain though it can work to your advantage by depreciating the maximum allowable to reduce ordinary income then paying lower capital gains rates on the sale   legal costs the rental agreement typically has to be drafted by a lawyer in order to avoid things that can cause the entire contract to be thrown out though there are boilerplate contracts available from state landlords associations this will cost you a few hundred dollars up front and to update it every few years it is deductible as an ordinary expense advertising putting up a for rent sign out front is typically just the tip of the iceberg online and print ads an ad agency these things cost money it 's deductible as an ordinary expense add this all up and you may end up losing money in the first year you rent the property when legal advertising initial maintenance purchases to get the place tenant ready etc are first spent deduct it properly and it 'll save you some taxes but you better have the nest egg to cover these things on top of everything your lender will expect you to bring to closing assuming you do n't have $ 100k+ lying around to buy the house in cash

yes the really good weed requires a bit of know how to grow properly but i have known and hung out with people that grow plants and i have been to their houses and they have shown me how they trim and clip things and they show me how they put a light to trick the plant into thinking that it is still daylight out etc   but in the end weed ai nt worth what is being charged for it   no way   i am in texas now and the price here is similar to what i paid at the weed club in california in cali i paid a of ten dollars per gram and it was possible to spend approx forty dollars per gram and i think that they even had some that was more than that   but i want to promise you that your average joe can figure out how to get his plants growing just fine especially when all he has to do is to trim and water it as opposed to having to give some criminal ten dollars for enough to make a couple of cigarettes joints of it   paying for weed   and just for the record i do nt really give a why people pay for cigarettes   cigarettes are just plain retarded

the company gets the proceeds from the sales of shares on the open market if a company is selling 1,000,000 shares at $ then they will receive $ from the underwriter minus some fees that the underwriter will collect the part that ties into valuation is to consider what percentage is the company selling of itself that is coming from its own holdings if the company is putting out 10 of its shares in the ipo from treasury holdings on a $ 10b valuation then it will get $ 1b minus the fees i 'd suspect where i worked in late 1990s early 2000s had an ipo where the underwriter did a bridge loan and the ipo so that the company did n't get all the money raised but did get enough to run operations for a while before ending operations public offering notes that after an ipo other offerings would be called seasoned equity offering that may or may not be as they could come from new or existing shares

congratulations you 're making enough money to invest there are two easy places to start i recommend against savings accounts because they will quite safely lose your money the inflation rate is usually higher than the interest rate on a savings account you may have twice as much money after 50 years but if everything costs four times as much then you 've lost buying power if in the course of learning about investing you 'd like to try buying individual stocks do it only with money you would n't mind losing index funds will go down slightly if one of the companies in that index fails entirely but the stock of a failed company is worthless

that is absolute rubbish   warren buffet follows simple value and tenants that literally anyone could follow if they had the discipline to do so   i have never once heard of an investment made by warren buffet that was n't rooted in fundamentals and easy to understand   the concept is fairly simple as is the math buying great companies trading at discounts to what they are worth due to market fluctuations or to key sectors etc   if i buy abc corp at $ 10 knowing it is worth $ 20 it could go down or trade sideways for five years doing seemingly nothing and then one day catch up with its worth due to any number of factors   in that case my 100 return which took five years to accounts for an average 20 return per year   also and this should be obvious but diversification is a double edged sword   every year hundreds of stocks individually beat the market return   owning any one of these stocks as your only holding would mean that you beat the market   as you buy more stocks and diversify your return will get closer and closer to that of an index or mutual fund   my advice is to stick to fundamentals like value and investing learn to separate when the market is being silly from when it is responding to a genuine concern do your own homework and analysis on the stocks you buy be patient after buying stock that your analysis gives you confidence in and do n't over diversify   if you do these things congrats   you are warren buffet

make a list of all your expenses i use an excel spreadsheet but you can do it on the back of a napkin if you prefer list fixed expenses like rent loan payments insurance etc i include giving to church and charity as fixed expenses but of course that 's up to you list regular but not fixed expenses like food heat and electricity gas etc come up with reasonable average or typical values for these keep records for at least a few months so you 're not just guessing though remember that some will vary with the season presumably you spend a lot more on heat in the winter than in the summer etc you should budget to put something into savings and retirement if you 're young and just starting out it 's easy to decide to postpone retirement savings but the sooner you start the more the money will add up even if you ca n't put away a lot try to put away something and if you budget for it you should just get used to not having this money to play with then total all this up and compare to your income if the total is more than your income you have a problem you need to find a way to cut some expenses i wo n't go any further with that thought that 's another subject hopefully you have some money left over after paying all the regular expenses that 's what you have to play with for entertainment and other non essentials make a schedule for paying your bills i get paid twice a month and so i pay most of my bills when i get a paycheck i have some bills that i allocate to the first check of the month and some to the second for others whatever bills came in since my last check i pay with the current check i have it arranged so each check is big enough to pay all the bills that come from that check if you ca n't do that if you 'll have a surplus from one check and a shortage from the next then be sure to put money aside from the surplus check to cover the bills you 'll pay at the next pay period   always pay your bills before you spend money on entertainment always have a plan to pay your bills do n't say oh i 'll come up with the money somehow if you have debt student loans car loans etc have a plan to pay it off one of the most common traps people fall into is saying i really need to get out of debt and i 'm going to start paying off my debt next month because this month i really want to buy this way cool toy they put off getting out of debt until they have away huge amounts of money on interest or worse they keep accumulating new debt until they ca n't even pay the interest

although the market   discussion by other answers is correct the   tax structure of many developed nations i am familiar with canada in particular offers a preferred tax rate for dividend income compared to taxable gains consequently if your portfolio is large enough to make transaction fees a very small percentage rate this is a viable investment strategy   however as the preferred tax rate for dividends typically will catch up to that for capital gains at some cut off point there is a natural limit on how much income can be obtained in this way   if you believe your portfolio might be large enough to benefit from this investment strategy talk to a qualified investment advisor broker or tax consultant for the specifics for your tax jurisdiction

any accounting software should be able to handle this   when you invoice them set the invoice date to the date of the event   then receive a partial payment against that invoice   this will cause your accounting software to display the service income in the correct period as well   so if you sent them invoice for august 7 2014 event on may 5th 2014 and they gave you $ 500 due you would see this income in august $ 500 on cash basis $ 1000 on accrual basis   when you received the other $ 500 in august you would see $ 1000 for both methods   you would not see any income in may when you created the invoice   this is better for revenue matching with the correct period when you send them same invoice say 30 days before the event set the software to show payments already received   it seems that most online accounting software will do this by default   here is an example in     here is an example in xero   seems they both display information on when you can expect payment on the their respective    in the desktop version of quickbooks which i use a lot it will not show the balance of the customer by default on an invoice   you will have to modify the invoice template   there are more details on that here   in desktop version of quickbooks you can look at cash flow forecast report to see the expected amount coming in    i hope that helps and good luck

like i said i absolutely believe and admit that there are people using icos as a vehicle for schemes    that said there are also individuals like brendan wiki who are accomplished and trusted individuals participating in the market as well brendan is the creator of javascript and a cofounder of he also created the brave web and through that launched an ico for his cryptocurrency basic attention whose ico gathered $ in under 30 token sale internet browser brave i want you to read that again $ in 30 seconds given to a proven and renowned who has been an important figure in shaping the web as we know it for him to cut out the middle men banks vcs and everyone else and have the capital needed to focus on building and launching a new project     is everyone brendan absolutely not but it is important that a market like this exists so that the brendan 's of the world can venture down these paths to accomplish great things even if that means suffering through scams   finally on the subject of icos themselves are icos a bubble maybe but if and when it pops it will simply clear the way for the value added projects it is important to note that the majority of icos that take place are outside of the us and bar us citizens from participating additionally the majority of project teams within the us that seek to issue an ico through the proper legal channels are seeking legal counsel to help structure the deals usually costing anywhere between $ 100    to answer your question regarding subs i would suggest following   /r cryptocurrency    /r ethereum    /r btc    /r bitcoin    these are good basic starting points that can help you learn branch out from there another great resource for news is   hope this helps and i am happy to discuss further if needed

if you have been putting savings away for the longer term and have some extra funds which you would like to take some extra risk on then i say work yourself out a strategy plan get yourself educated and go for it if it is individual shares you are interested then work out if you prefer to use fundamental analysis technical analysis or some of both you can use fundamental analysis to help determine which shares to buy and then use technical analysis to help determine when to get into and out of a position you say you are prepared to lose $ 10,000 in order to try to get higher returns i do n't know what percentage this $ 10,000 is of the capital you intend to use in this kind of investments trading but lets assume it is 10 so your total starting capital would be $ 100,000 the idea now would be to learn about money management position sizing and risk management there are plenty of good books on these subjects if you set a maximum loss for each position you open of 1 of your capital i.e $ 1,000 then you would have to get 10 straight losses in a row to get to your 10 total loss you do this by setting stop losses on your positions i 'll use an example to explain say you are looking at a stock priced at $ 20 and you get a signal to buy it at that price you now need to determine a stop price which if the stock goes down to you can say well i may have been wrong on this occasion the stock price has gone against me so i need to get out now i put automatic stop loss conditional orders with my broker you may determine the stop price based on previous support levels using a percentage of your buy price or another indicator or method i tend to use the percentage of buy price lets say you use 10 so your stop price would be at $ 18 10 below your buy price of $ 20 so now you can work out your position size the number of shares to buy your maximum loss on the position is $ 2 per share or 10 of your position in this stock but it should also be only 1 of your total capital being 1 of $ 100,000 = $ 1,000 you simply divide $ 1,000 by $ 2 to get 500 shares to buy   you then do this with the rest of your positions with a $ 100,000 starting capital using a 1 maximum loss per position and a stop loss of 10 you will end up with a maximum of 10 positions if you use a larger maximum loss per position your position sizes would increase and you would have less positions to open i would not go higher than 2 maximum loss per position if you use a larger stop loss percentage then your position sizes would decrease and you would have more positions to open the larger the stop loss the longer you will potentially be in a position and the smaller the stop loss generally the less time you will be in a position also as your total capital increases so will your 1 of total capital just as it would decrease if your total capital decreases using this method you can aim for higher higher return investments and reduce and manage your risk to a desired level one other thing to consider do n't let tax determine when you sell an investment if you are keeping a stock just so you will pay less tax if kept for over 12 months then you are in real danger of increasing your risk considerably i would rather pay 50 tax on a 30 return than 25 tax on a 15 return

if possible i would disable online payment on the card immediately reduce the limit of online payment to zero i think you should also demand the photocopy back immediately it is tad and maybe he did get it without any ill will but even in this case he should be made aware of the fact that this is wrong note that if he genuinely did it with ill will he will have likely made multiple copies who knows how many so it will not really protect you from fraud in this case then you should call or e mail the card company and/or your bank and tell them what happened i think they would consider the card stolen and maybe advise you on what you should do next note that if he uses the card you might and should try to chargeback the money through the card company but it might be argued that you did not sufficiently protect the details of your card and even if you succeed the process can be long and you will not have access to your money in the meantime this is one of the downsides of a debit card vs credit card you may also consider moving away the money from the associated bank account so that there 's not much to steal of course the situation on that front gets more complicated if account overdrawing is enabled in your account

you should invest your money to figure out what rate of return you need use this equation how much money you want per year total amount of cash you have = annualized interest rate if we plug in the amount of annualized interest you can expect to safely get while not managing your money personally 2 by my estimate we get x 1.2 m = 0.02 year a measly $ 24,000 year   many people say that you can get 10 12 even 30 return on your investment i wo n't speculate   on if this is true but i will guarantee that you can not get those returns simply by handing your money over to a money manager so your options are 1 earn a guaranteed $ 24,000 and earn the rest you need to live by working 2 learn to invest your money and then do so intelligently and earn enough to live off the interest to learn how to invest your money read beating the street by peter lynch good luck

i think everything in your case is just simply missing one important rule of how credit works essentially your mil can not get a loan you can you are making her a large loan that she can not get for herself that is all that is the essence of what this deal is it is not without interest she makes a financial contribution toward your son you get the deal in 2 years assuming she does n't default she will etc imagine it this way you are sitting in the dealership with the dealer and your mil she wants a loan to pay for the car the dealership says you are way not credit worthy so your mil says why does n't my son in law take out the loan instead now the dealership says sure that 's fine from the dealer 's standpoint every other part of your arrangement is irrelevant boring even the only magic trick is in who takes the loan out no other difference you 're letting your mil pull a car out of her sleeve like a and in taking the deal you 're believing her   this sentence i am pretty sure that the ex mil will not let me down i 've loaned her large sums of money before and she always promptly repaid   is everything you 're making a rather large bet that the things that can go wrong in two years including any situation involving your wife 's welfare are rather miniscule and furthermore that the few times she 's paid you back that did not convince banks and dealer she is more creditworthy justifies her good creditworthiness is the interest worth it do you really believe that your mil needs to wring a car out of you before she would consider contributing to her grandson 's well being which is essentially the interest but wait it 's not everything her daughter my ex wife would drive it for 2 years and then turn the car over to our son even if your mil is creditworthy the woman you described as follows her daughter though is a loose will be holding and returning the collateral in this deal things she can do include so i 'm arguing two points obviously my opinion on this is clear i hope i did a decent job of explaining where the components of this deal credit interest collateral play out in the eyes of a dealer or bank and get lost in the mechanics of the rules you worked out with your family

there are rules that prevent two of the reactive measures you suggest from occurring first on the date of and shortly following an ipo there is no stock available to borrow for shorting second there are no put options available for purchase at least none that are listed of the sort you probably have in mind in fact within a day or two of the linkedin ipo most all of the active equity traders i know were the fact that they could n't yet do exactly what you described i.e. buying puts or finding shares to sell short there was a great deal of conviction that linkedin shares were overpriced but means available to translate that market assessment into an influence of market value this does not mean that the efficient markets hypothesis is deficient equilibrium is reached quickly enough once the market is able to clear as usual

judging from your comments you seem to be confused about the way banking works   banks can only lend out money that they actually have whether from deposits or investors or loans taken from other banks government entities   the rules on how this works varies from country to country but the principle is always the same   there is no magic money let 's imagine a closed system   there 's only one town and that town only has one bank   there are 100 people total in town and each has $ 10,000   everyone deposits all of their money in the bank the bank now has $ 1,000,000 in total deposits   you take a loan for $ 100,000 and buy a house   the bank now has $ 900,000   you make your payments of $ per month $ 833 of interest and $ 132 toward principal   in this ideal world the bank has no costs associated with doing business   after one month the bank has $ 1,000,000 in deposits $ in cash on hand $ in loans and $ 833 in profit from interest now here 's the confusing part   you bought a house from someone   that person also lives in town   he takes the $ 100,000 you gave him and deposits it in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit assume 10 more people buy houses at $ 100,000 each taking loans for that whole amount for the same terms you did   assume those sellers then deposit the money back in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit   the bank is taking in $ per month $ x 11 in loan payments making profit of $ $ 833 x 11 per month from interest this process of loans and deposits and payments can go on forever without any outside influence   this is the primary way money is created   it 's like printing money without the paper of course we 're not in a closed system   banks are limited in endlessly creating money primarily by two things reserve requirements are set by government agencies   they might say banks can lend until their cash on hand or liquid equivalent is at minimum 35 of total deposits   so a bank with $ 1,000,000 in deposits would have to keep $ 350,000 in cash at any given time capital requirements work largely the same way   it 's more the bank saying what happens if a bunch of people want their deposits back   they plan a reasonable amount of cash to have on hand for that scenario

if you are going to be a long term investor you are only going to buy and hold you will not sell thus future price is not relevant only dividend payout is relevant divide the dividend by the price you paid to get the yeald   edit   once again the will not allow me to add a comment so i have to edit a previous post   what you call active investor is not really investing it is speculating when you try to buy low sell high you have at best a 50 50 chance of picking the low you then pay a commission on that buy after you buy then you have a 50 50 chance at best of picking the high you also have to pay the commission on the sell 50 times 50 is you have at best a 25 chance of buying low and selling high you are churning your account which makes money for the broker whether you make money or not if instead you buy and hold a dividend paying security then the going price is irrelevant you paid for the security once and do not have to pay for it again meanwhile the dividends roll in forever buy low sell high is a fools game warren buffet does not do it he buys and holds

if you business is incorporated it 's up to the two of you how to do it typically you will have the company write cheques or make transfers whatever to each of the humans if you want to say that each of you gets a salary of 80 of the revenue you bring in and then tweak things with bonuses you can if one of you is contributing more to marketing and awareness and less to revenue then you may prefer to pay you each the same even though the revenue you bring are different it 's up to you it 's quite literally your business when you 're not incorporated then for tax purposes you split the income and the expenses according to your ownership share if that does n't seem fair to you then a partnership is probably not as useful to you as being incorporated in general it 's better to be incorporated once you 're past any initial phase in which the business is losing money for tax purposes acquiring depreciable assets and the partners have taxable income from elsewhere day jobs or at least income from the earlier part of the year before starting the business i would recommend that the partnership phase of the business be very short get incorporated and get a shareholder agreement

what you should compare is spx spy nav and es fair value    like others have said is spx is the index that others attempt to track spy tracks it but it can get a tiny bit out of line as explained here by   that 's why they publish nav or net asset value   it 's what the price should be   for spy this will be very close because of all the participants   the mer is a factor but more important is something called tracking error which takes into account mer plus things like trading expenses plus revenue from securities lending   spy the few times i 've checked has a smaller tracking error than the mer   it 's not much of a factor in pricing differences es is the price you 'll pay today to get spx delivered in the future but settled in cash   you have to take into account dividends and interest this is called fair value   you can find this usually every morning so you can compare what the futures are saying about the underlying index the most likely difference is you 're looking at different times of the day or different open close calculations

your best bet is to talk with a banker about your specific plans    one of the causes of the housing crash was an 80/20 loan   there you would get a first for 80 of the value of a home and 20 on a heloc for the rest   this would help the buyer avoid pmi   the reason this was popular was because the buyer could not afford the home with the pmi and did not have a down payment   they were simply cutting things too close could you find a banker willing to do something like this i bet you could in your case it seems like you are attempting to increase the value of your home by using money to do an improvement so the situation is better   however sizable improvements rarely return 100 or more on investments   typically i would think the bank would want you to have some money invested too   so if you wanted to put in a pool a smart banker would have you put in about 60 of the costs as pools typically have a 40 roi    however i bet you can find a banker that would loan you 100 you do n't seem to be looking for advice on making a smart money decision and it is difficult to render a verdict as very little detail is supplied about your specific situation however while certain decisions might look very profitable on paper they rarely take into consideration risk

i think you will find it hard to do there are money laundering regulations which require you to provide proof of address when opening an account i do n't know for certain if they require an uk address but even if they do n't it 's very likely that individual banks etc will require that i doubt that they will view you as a profitable customer for them since you would not be using the account as your main account although having a job is n't a legal requirement in practice i think it 's the only way you can get an account without having been resident in the country for a while my company employs a significant number of people from abroad and they typically need support from the company to open an account when they first move one thing you could investigate is opening an account with some international bank with branches both in hungary and the uk and asking them to arrange the uk account for you one example of such a bank is hsbc however such banks will typically charge you a significant amount for the privilege for example with hsbc you need a premier account to get this kind of service

gt;and how did this cause the mbs to get wiped out was it a written clause or did they just collapse from the value dropping so hard    it was written into the debt instruments   mbs and cdos are broken down into tranches with descending priority of claims to the collateral pool   when it comes time for payment the top tranche gets paid out 100 before the one below it is entitled to a single cent and so on and so forth   here 's an example of how one might be organized     foo | bar | text tranche | size | credit rating class a | | aaa class b | | aa class c | | a class d | | bbb class e | | not rated   in this example lets say that 5 of the loans defaulted meaning that of the $ 1b only $ was available to get paid out assuming no over which most had but that 's besides the point here   the class a would get the full 750 they 're due the class b would get the full 100 and the class c would get the full 60   at this point there is only left so the class d would get 40 of the 50 due a 20 write down and class e would get nothing getting completely wiped out   gt;i do nt know what subordination level means subordination level basically just means how much debt it below it on the capital structure how much needs to get completely wiped out before any particular tranche starts sharing in the losses   gt did defaults reaching 8 meaning that 8 of loan takers defaulted    yeah more or less   technically i think it 's that 8 of the value of the mortgages defaulted but i believe they were set up to be relatively the same size within each instrument so there 's not really much distinction between 8 of the loan takers and 8 of the aggregate value

the standard answer i have heard is that if you were to purchase term life insurance and invest the difference between the cost of the policies your investments would grow larger than the cash value of the insurance also when you take cash out of the insurance value drops by a like amount so you ca n't have your cake and leave it to your heirs too either you get the cash value or they get the insurance value hopefully there could be some of both although i believe the philosophy of that answer i have two issues with it first you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month i can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance second for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value my life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period hmm maybe there is n't a one size fits all solution if you need a large amount of insurance term life will certainly be more affordable however considering this as an investment i would not expect that to be a deciding factor good luck with your decision it is great that at such a young age you are concerned about investments

at what point does my investment benefit from compounded interest monthly quarter yearly does it even benefit i think you are mixing things there is no concept of interest or compounding in mutual funds when you buy a mutual fund it either appreciates in value or depreciates in value both can happen depending on the time period you compare now let 's assume at the end of the year i have a 5 return my $ 10,000 is now $ 10,500 the way you need to look at this is given you started with $ 10,000 and its now $ 10,500 the return is 5 now if you want to calculate simple return or compounded return you would have to calculate accordingly you may potentially want to find a compounded return for ease of comparison with say a bank fd interest rate or some other reason   so if $ 10,000 become $ 10,500 after one year and $ 11,000 after 2 year the absolute return is 10 the simple yearly return is 5 or the simple rate of return for first year is 5 and for second year is 4.9 or the average year on year return is

others have commented on the various studies if as joetaxpayer says this one particular study he mentions does not really exist there are plenty of others and in that case did someone blatantly lie to prove a bogus point or did someone just get the name of the organization that did the study wrong like it was really somebody called they read it as because they 'd heard of dun bradstreet but not of whoever is of course if they got the organization wrong maybe they got important details of the study wrong whatever   but let me add one logical point that i think is if you always buy with cash there is no way that you can spend more than you have when you run out of cash you have no choice but to stop spending but when you buy with a credit card you can easily spend more than you have money in the bank to pay even if it is true that most credit card users are responsible there will always be some who are not and credit cards make it easy to get in trouble   i speak from experience i once learned that my wife had run up $ 20,000 in credit card debt without my knowledge when she divorced me i got stuck with the credit card debt to this day i have no idea what she spent the money on and i 've known several people over the years who have gone bankrupt with credit card debt even if you 're responsible it 's easy to lose track with credit cards if you use cash when you take out your wallet to buy something you can quickly see whether there 's a lot of money left or not so much with credit you can forget that you made the big purchase more likely you can fail to add up the modest purchases it 's easy to say oh that 's just $ 100 i can cover that but then there 's $ 100 here and $ 100 there and it can add up or depending on your income level maybe it 's $ 10 here and $ 10 there and it 's out of hand or maybe it 's $ 10,000 it 's easier today when you can go on line and check the balance on your credit card but even at that well just this past month when i got one bill i was surprised at how big it was i went through the items and they were all legitimate they just added up do n't cry for me i could afford it but i had failed to pay attention to what i was spending and i let things get a little out of hand i 'm a pretty responsible person and i do n't do that often i can easily imagine someone paying less attention and getting into serious trouble

the livret a is a very specific product it 's tax exempt and would historically not be available through regular banks commercial banks can now offer it but they only collect the money on behalf of the des cdc the cdc then pays interest to the savers and a commission for the bank the commission is baked into the system not charged to the customer directly but since the interest rate is set centrally banks can not compete on that so this is risk free money for them but on the flip side it does not help them meet capital adequacy requirements other savings account or products have different rules another angle to consider is that a livret a was historically very attractive for consumers and was certainly perceived as such so that many people would have a checking account at a regular bank and another account at the or the just to open a livret a. for commercial banks the alternative therefore is n't having your money on your checking account vs. your livret a or another savings account it was having your money on a livret a they administer vs. seeing you run away to another institution there is also a cap on the livret a and you 're not allowed to save more money by opening several of them at different banks at the same time banks have been complaining that the decrease of the interest rate and consequently of their commission makes the whole scheme a lot less interesting for them for what it 's worth i recently a bank account in france after living abroad for a long time and the customer advisor did not seem particularly interested in pushing a livret a.

free huh from their commission and fee schedule   so if you literally bought two shares then the sec added one penny in fees and finra added one penny as a trading activity fee note that there are several other fees on their schedule that may not apply to you if you had bought 100 shares instead your total fees would have still been only 2 cents but you would have lost $ 4 on the trade   so the fees are minuscule when you start doing larger orders    however that should not discourage you from experimenting and learning   i 'd rather pay 2 cents in fees on a 4 cent loss than 2 cents in fees on a $ 400 loss   just chalk it up to the cost of experience

of course but then paper also has utility so do seashells and    there is no obvious reason why even in a perfect world we would go looking for a malleable highly conductive corrosion resistant metal as something to peg the value of our banknotes to    the argument in favor of a gold standard is not whether gold is intrinsically more valuable than paper or seal skins or anything else it 's that gold is fairly inelastic in terms of supply so it limits the ability of central bankers to mess up the value of the currency through funny business    if you picked up a rock and started going around telling people that we should use it as money because it 's highly malleable and conductive and can be used in computer parts they would look at you like you 're a crazy person that 's not why gold is was should be a currency    gold was the perfect currency for thousands of years because it was easy to identify easy to handle hard to and rare those were important characteristics when strangers had to carry physical money to different places without any atms credit cards or paypal accounts they are somewhat less critical today but still   the one characteristic that might still argue in favor of a gold standard is rarity since the amount of gold in the world is somewhat fixed forcing the currency supply to be restricted to the gold supply semi prevents governments and central bankers from getting into too much or at least that 's the theory    i will leave it to others to argue over whether a return to the gold standard would be a good idea but the argument has nothing to with the intrinsic utility of gold i 'm sure we can all agree that gold is a fine metal with many good qualities

i would advise against both at least in the way you are discussing it you seem to be talking about day trading speculating in either stock or currency markets this seems ill advised in each trade one of three things will happen you will end up ahead and the person you buy from sell to will end up behind you will lose and the counterparty will win or you both will lose due to trading fees that said if you must do one stick with stocks they have a reason to have positive returns overall while currency trade is net zero additionally as you said if it sounds like you can gain more with less money that means that there are many more losers than winners how do you know you will be a winner a lot of the reason for this idea that you can gain a lot with less is leverage make sure you understand it well on the other hand it may make sense to learn this lesson now while you have little to lose

the fact that you pay the bill reliably is going to count more for your credit rating than anything else even if you are paying it off in full every month lenders seem to like to see at least one instance where you charged a large balance held it a couple months then paid it off in full but i would n't go out of my way to do that remember that the credit card company is making money on transaction fees as well as interest if you 're pushing money through their system they 're happy they 'd be happier if you were paying them interest too reportedly they actually refer to those of us who pay in full every month as deadbeats but they are n't going to kick you out or ding your credit rating for it the quote you give says that a small balance may be slightly better i submit that may be slightly is too small a difference to be worth worrying about unless you have reason to believe that your credit rating actively needs to be repaired and as noted in the comments it 's actually stated even less strongly than that personal recommendation you can get a free credit report each year from each of the big three credit rating agencies those reports usually include a brief explanation of what they think the most negative item on your record is the phrasing of those explanations is often somewhat misleading but i 'd still suggest that you get these reports and see what they think would improve your rating i 'm willing to bet it wo n't be does n't carry a high enough debt balance

my son who is now 21 has never needed me to cosign on a loan for him and i did not need to establish any sort of credit rating for him to establish his own credit   one thing i would suggest is ditch the bank and use a credit union i have used one for many years and opened an account there for my son as soon as he got his first job he was able to get a debit card to start which does n't build credit score but establishes his account work the credit union he was able to get his first credit card through the same credit union without falling work the bureaucratic bs that comes with dealing with a large bank his interest rate may be a bit higher due to his lack of credit score initially but because we taught him about finance it is n't really relevant because he does n't carry a balance he has also been able to get a student loan without needing a cosigner so he can attend college   the idea that one needs to have a credit score established before being an adult is a fallacy like my son i started my credit on my own and have never needed a cosigner whether it was my first credit card at 17 the credit union probably should n't have done that since i was n't old enough to be legally bound my first car at 18 or my first home at 22 for both my son and i knowing how to use credit responsibly was far more valuable than having a credit score early before your children are 18 opening credit accounts with them as the primary account holder can be problematic because they are n't old enough to be legally liable for the debt using them as a cosigner is even more problematic for the same reason each financial institution will have their own rules and i certainly do n't know them all   for what you are proposing i would suggest a small line of credit with a credit union being small and locally controlled you will probably find that you have the best luck there

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

got ta love advice from a guy that bankrupted himself by spending like a moron also like how he did n't specify what taxes would be so crippling that he 'd have to shut down the business other than the marginal tax rate which really has no impact on the business itself   i also liked how he asked his employees if they would continue to work for 50 pay which is a failure at multiple levels first it fails to point out at a 50 rate is n't currently on the table second if it was it would mean that worker was making a crap ton of money third most of his employees probably ca n't stop working because they do n't have a crap ton of money like he does

company x located outside a military base offer discounts to military as a form of marketing they want to encourage a group of potential customers to use their store service in some cases they are competing with subsidized store on the base in other cases their only competition is other stores outside the base the smart ones also understand the pay structure of military pay to make it easier for enlisted to stretch their money for the entire month the government does n't offer compensation to the business near bases the businesses see their offer and discount as advertising expenses and are figured into the prices they have to charge all customers you will also see these types of discounts offered by some businesses in college towns they are competing with the services on the campus and with other off campus businesses some also allow the use of campus dollars to make it easier for the student to spend money

i work in the fsa hsa industry and just wanted to point out that if your wife has a medical fsa you can not contribute to an hsa whether or not you are covered by her medical insurance plan the only exception to this per the rules is if your wife 's employers plan limits the medical fsa benefit to the employee your wife which i can say from experience is extremely rare it 's possible but i 've never personally seen an employer with this in their plan document so better check first to be sure the fsa is restricted to your wife only you have to understand the fsa to know why this is true unless restricted your wife can use her medical fsa for herself her spouse and any tax dependents meaning whether or not she uses the fsa for your eligible expenses you still have 1st dollar coverage from the fsa making you in eligible to open and contribute to an hsa until the end of the plan year and possibly grace period if her employer has one in place and she does not spend her funds by the end of the plan year hope this helps if your still not sure talk to a tax professional which i am not but do advise employers and participants on both hsas and fsas

probably the easiest to do is to do an international transfer via online banking you will need to give your iban and bic swift code of your bank to your friend he should then be able to transfer the money from his bank at least i think they use iban in israel as well the money will be converted to the currency of your account there are some fees but they are not too big i think and depending on the choice of transfer they can be paid by sender shared or by receiver contact your bank for precise details edit if you really need to be paid in usd this may not be the best option though

the particularly hilarious part was the conclusion   gt;what is to be done about it the answer is that if the world is facing such an enormous glut of savings then they have to be taxed as fast as possible to prevent they imbalances they create so we need higher corporation taxes we need withholding taxes on dividends and interest going to tax havens we need capital gains taxes at rates as high as income taxes we need an investment income surcharge to increase tax rates on unearned income to match those including national insurance on earnings and we need effective wealth taxes plus a continued crack down on tax havens of course   gt;and i mean we may need all of these the world can not afford for its wealthy people to become us$ 57 trillion richer in the next five years that would be a disaster for us all including the wealthiest so action is needed urgently and now we ca n’t wait for things to get ugly

the change is generally known as the options initiative or and there is a highly comprehensive guide to what occurred here the basic gist of what occurred was a shift from a coded system in which a shorter 3    to 5 letter symbol could be used but    the symbols required a data source to    determine what they meant ad    used to be a msft jan 20 option but    you had to look up in a table to    know that to a system in which much longer symbols    are needed but they contain all the    information required to identify a    unique option dell c    is n't easy to type but once you know    how to read it it 's easy to see that    it 's an option on dell expiring on may 16th 2010 is a call rather    than a put and has a strike price    of 4 as to why they did it there are a number of benefits but most important reason is this one   they were running out of symbols   the number of permutations of 3 5 letter symbols had been exceeded by the number of options that had been listed resulting in the need to recycle symbols    this meant that a current option symbol would be the same as an old one in some cases on a different stock which was havoc on historical data

in your specific case i would leave them open unless you have a specific reason for wanting to close them particularly unless you feel closing them is necessary for you to not misuse them the impact on the credit score is not why i say this though   much more important are the two competing real factors my suggestion would be to take the cards and put them in your file cabinet or whatever would cause you to not use them   in fact you could even cut them up but not close the accounts i had an account open that i did n't possess a physical card for several years for and did n't use at all and it stayed open though it 's not guaranteed they 'll keep it open for you if you never use it    in an emergency you could then ask them to send you a new copy of the card very easily   but keep them just in case you need them once you have paid off your balances on your balance carrying cards then you should consider closing some of them   keep enough to be able to live for ~4 6 months a similar amount to the ideal rainy day fund in savings basically and then close others particularly if you can do so in a way that keeps your average account age reasonably stable

i would like to add to the answer provided by dheer i think under some you need not pay premium after 3 years and you can take the money back after 5 years something like that read your policy statement of course since the money is invested in stock markets and since generally people say the longer money stays in stocks the better you can keep the money with them without taking it back and without paying any further premium that way whatever you paid will be invested and you can get it back later when you feel you will make a profit

this is fine and can definitely be done the bank will be perfectly fine with it since you 're paying interest on the money as long as they 're confident that you can repay the whole growing balance of course there 's the issue of the credit limit which you 'll eventually reach and then you wo n't be able to pull this off any longer problems start when the bank either loses that confidence or the credit line is term limited like heloc for example and comes to term in either case you 'll be required to cover the balance and especially in the first case as a balloon payment if they call on you when you do that you will most likely go bankrupt and the longer you keep doing it the higher are the chances of that happening

no it is not if that were the case you would have no such thing as a growth stock dividends and dividend policies can change at any time   the primary reason for investment in a company is access to a firm 's earnings hence the idea of p e. dividends are factored in with capital appreciation but studies have shown that dividends are actually detrimental to future growth    they tend to allow easier access to shareholders because of the payouts reducing the cost of equity but if you reduce the growth rate as well sensitivity tables can demonstrate deterioration or stagnation over time    some good examples are ge and microsoft

gold is not debt money is debt whatever it is made of   in the example above everything could have been exactly the same except using certificates written on sharks instead of on paper    now sharks have value paper has value and gold has value when you print money the stuff you make it out of has some utility separate from its use as currency but when you are using it as currency regardless of what it is made from it is a marker for debt    you go to work for an hour your boss gives you a marker that you can trade for a cheeseburger or some gasoline or a or or whatever you want that marker is an iou for the work you did you give it to the store and it becomes an iou for the value of one they give it to the store employees or the grower or whatever and so on    it does n't matter what that marker is made out of its function is the same if it were gold you could melt it down and make a ring out of it if it 's paper you could use it as a bookmark or a shopping list or to blow your nose if it 's a shark you scare people with it in the pool   this is totally separate from the question of whether we should be using gold as a currency which has to do with the fact that the gold supply is a lot more stable than the paper supply and whether being able to easily print more money on demand is a good thing or a bad thing

answering a more general question   are financial services firms worth the money   it really depends on the person   some can contribute regularly to index funds and do the asset allocation on their own   they are comfortable buying and selling various funds and there is really not that much management to do a bogle like 3 fund portfolio   all that is needed is an occasional re balance   this person probably does not need a firm like ubs or many of the others out there some do some active picking of funds and stocks and also some indexing   again they are comfortable in doing the right thing and probably do n't need a manager there are others however that need a manager   a friend of mine pulled all of his money out of the market when trump was elected   he missed out on some nice growth   the extra percentage point that he paid to have an adviser would have been well worth it for people who get spooked easily by the market and need things explained over and over an advisory service is great   my mom falls in that category   i thank god every day for her service as she would otherwise call me with the same investment questions every other quarter

i think this varies considerably depending on your situation   i 've heard people say 6 month 's living expenses and i know suze orman recommended bumping that to 8 months in our current economy my husband and i have no children lots of student loan debts but we pay off our credit cards in full each month and are working to save up for a house   we 've talked through a few different what if scenarios   if one of us were to lose our job we have savings to cover the difference between our reduced income and paying the bills for 6 or 8 months while the other person regained employment   if both of us were to lose our jobs simultaneously our savings would n't hold us over for more than 3 or 4 months but if that were to happen we would likely take advantage of the opportunity to relocate closer to our families and possibly even move in to my parent 's house for a short time   with no children and no mortgage our commitments are few so i do n't feel the need to have a very large emergency cash fund especially with student loans to pay off think through a few scenarios for your life and see what you would need   take into consideration expenses to break a rental lease cell phone contract or other commitments   then start saving toward your goal also see answers to a similar question here

i upvoted you as i think your story is important to tell however commodities and futures accounts have never been protected under sipc the use of your money to pay debts sounds illegal or perhaps it was legal under a document you signed when you opened your account bankruptcy was not a way to screw you over   the bigger point is that bankruptcy is a way to restructure debts and is beneficial in the long run to the benefits of society while we often look at people or corporations who have to file bankruptcy as being irresponsible and what i am about to say may reflect negatively on you for that i apologize the people or corporations who lent to a bankrupt entity should be just as much   right now the eu is going through a period where we are hoping bankruptcy is off the table increasingly though the only way to do that is to try and paper over debts that will never be repaid for a long enough time period for growth to resume but the question remains what if growth never comes back this is why restructuring and bankruptcy is the only option for greece and likely italy portugal spain and ireland

over simplification of the problem   to get a well paying job requires a degree these days   not everyone has the money to pay for college without a loan   does that mean they should n't be able to get a well paying job   that is n't including production increasing and school prices increasing while wages stagnate exacerbating the issue   real responsibility would include our responsibility to nurture and build a great nation education and value for everyone not just ourselves and those we decide deserve it

there are a few factors at play here depending on the bank that has offered you the card there are different types of overdraft protection that may have been set up typically if they attempt to run the card with no money if one of these is in play you will be spared any overdraft fees by the transaction charging to a designated overdraft account usually savings or by the transaction failing due to insufficient funds   if you know the transaction went through and you know there were not enough funds in the account to cover the transactions then you have a few options if you have overdraft protection that auto charges insufficient funds charges to a separate account then you have nothing to worry about if you do not most banks offer a grace period where you have until the end of the day to zero out your account that is to say pay the overdraft amount and bring your balance to at least $ 0   if this is a charge that occurred in the past and you have already been charged an overdraft fee there may still be hope i can not speak for all banks but i know that chase bank offers a once per year overdraft forgiveness where they will get rid of the charges if you agree to bring the account out of the negative there is a chance other banks will do the same if you call their customer service

you 're not being over taxed the withholding is just aggressive   employer 's do n't know your whole tax situation all they can go on is the amount they pay you minus deductions then extrapolate that to an annual number and withhold according to your w4 you could ratchet up your w4 exemptions and this will help your current withholding   when you do your taxes next april this will all shake out and you will likely receive a large refund    it 's also worth noting that your federal withholding given the numbers above is just about 19 not 27 which does match the federal tax table if your annual income was $ 72,000 as your semi monthly paycheck indicates   that should be closer to 14 at an annual income of $ 36,000   the medicare related taxes are flat amounts   so really you 're talking about an approximately 5 discrepancy on the $ 18,000 you 'll earn during this internship or about $ 900 if you feel like you 're being welcome to paying taxes

great effort on the question all i can advise is if paypal does not provide the mapping table type status credit debit you will have to build it up yourself as you go along i would tackle it this way your sql mapping table has credit debit entries for all knows combinations and the credit debit entry would be -1 for all then as you get a list of transactions you will have to display all possible results to the user who will then tick the correct one comparing it to the balance you would store the credit debit entry if it is unique this way you will learn what the possible combinations are over time its a to the problem so maybe start with a small number of transactions first i expect you can build up pretty quickly it will be an interesting experiment

what big picture   if you can not tell the massive drain on an organization simply by looking you are blind   how do companies make money   income producers   who are the income producers   there are three classes people who assemble a product people who charge billable hours and people who make sales of more product and/or hours   that 's it   those are the only people who make money     if you make a product you may absolutely require a packaging and shipping department to bring your product to market but those people will not ever make you more product to sell or bring in more sales so you run that department as lean as you can   how lean that is depends entirely on how you feel about business personally i think it 's just as important to be able to enjoy the job as it is to make money but that 's neither here nor there likewise maintenance likewise it likewise accounting marketing although they 'll never admit it qc legal etc etc etc   the only function of management is to organize operations and deal with problems   the old c plan organize direct staff and falls entirely into organizing or dealing with problems   management is there to empower people to do their jobs allow them to not deal with crap that is not their through proper organization and problem resolution     just like shipping and maintenance and it you run your management staff as lean as possible while still accomplishing the goals of 1 organization to empower employees to do their jobs and 2 problem resolution   that 's it once you get that done you do n't need any more managers ever until you 're not able to keep up with   so what 's the purpose of middle management   they deal with fundamental problems but they have no authority to resolve them   you are paying an entire class of employee to pass the buck up to higher and wait hoping that a decision will eventually come back down   sometimes they are necessary to accomplish the goals of the organization ie during growth periods   but they are always a drain and would always be better off replaced by experienced and motivated senior line employees with the authority to make reasonable decisions on the spot

while i certainly agree with the principle of paying down debt there is some value in having a healthy cash cushion   if an emergency expense were to come up and your credit has been cut off or reduced to the point where you have no excess credit then having real cash on hand is critical i would perform the following thought experiment   what if my available credit had been cut off   how much would i need in cash to survive for 1 month 3 months 5 months etc   consider what time period you 'd be comfortable with and set that amount as your minimum desired cash on hand while it may seem extreme to not have access to credit at all during the credit crisis many banks and lenders tightened their lending reducing credit limits closing lines of credit calling loans raising rates etc suze orman recommends cash savings equivalent to 8 months living expenses that does n't mean 8 months salary but 8 months of what it would take to live on   at one point in the midst of the economic crisis i thought that made sense the simple dollar blog considers suze 's recommendation and the idea of emergency fund vs. debt repayment   worth reading is suze right do emergency funds now trump debt repayment

there are 2 that help make sense of insurance following those 2 rules normal insurance makes sense ca n't afford to replace your car insure it can afford to lose your tv do n't insure it people with a net worth in the low millions have very similar insurance needs to the middle class for example they might be able to afford a new car when they total it but they probably ca n't afford to pay for the long term care of the person they accidentally ran over similarly they probably need to insure their million dollar house just like average people insure more affordable housing   very wealthy people still have the same basic choices but for different assets   if you are a billionaire then you might not bother to insure your $ 30k childhood home or your fleet vehicles but you probably would insure your $ 250 m mansion your $ 100 m yacht and your more pricey collectible cars   it 's also worth noting that very wealthy people are at much higher risk of being sued for negligence or personal injury as such they are more likely to purchase personal liability or umbrella insurance coverage to protect against such risks multi million dollar personal injury suits would never be filed against a poorer person simply because they could n't afford to pay even the plaintiff 's lawyer fees when they lost the court case insurance also makes sense when the insurance company is likely to grossly underestimate the risk they are taking   for example if i am a really bad driver but i have a clean record thanks to my army of lawyers then insurance might actually be a good deal for me even on average to take the very wealthy stereotypes to the extreme perhaps my eccentric billionaire neighbor and i are in an escalating which i think will result in my accidentally running his car into my neighbor 's precious ferrari

depends on how urgent your need for the emergency savings might be if the money market account allows you to get your money in the same amount of time as the savings account then there is no real downside but if the account takes a few days for you to access and you need your money sooner then you probably should n't also money market accounts do give more interest than most savings accounts but the interest rates are generally still pretty low so it might be an improvement but probably not a huge one

ebitda is in my opinion not a useful measure for an investor looking to buy shares on the stock market it is more useful for private businesses open to changing their structuring or looking to sell significant parts of their business one of the main benefits of reporting earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization is that it presents the company as it would look to a potential buyer consider that net income as a metric includes interest costs taxes and depreciation   interest costs are to put it simply a result of multiplying a business 's debt by its interest rate if you own a business and personally guarantee the loan that the company has with the bank your interest rates might be artificially low if you have a policy of reaching high debt levels relative to your equity in order to achieve high financial leveraging your interest cost might be artificially high either way if i bought your business my debt structure could be completely different and therefore your interest costs are not particularly relevant to me a potential buyer instead i should attempt to anticipate what my own interest costs would be under my plans for your business taxes are a result of many factors including the corporate structure of the business if you run your business as a sole proprietorship ie no corporation but i want to buy it under my corporation then my tax rates could look nothing like yours or if we operated in multiple jurisdictions etc etc instead of using your taxes as an estimate for mine i should anticipate my taxes based on my plans for your business depreciation amortization is a measure that estimates how much of a business 's fixed assets were used up during the year ie how much wear and tear occurred on your fleet of trucks it is generally calculated as a of your overall asset value it is a very loose proxy for the cash costs which will ultimately be incurred to make repairs replacements is also something which could significantly change if a business changes hands if the value of your building is much higher now than when you bought it i will have higher costs than you because i will be recording a of total costs higher than yours and therefore i should forecast my own removing these costs from net income is not particularly relevant for a casual stock investor because these costs will not change when you buy shares whatever ibm 's interest cost is reflects the debt structuring policy that the company currently has therefore when you buy a share in ibm you should consider the impact that interest has on net income similarly for taxes and they reflect costs to the business that impact the company 's ability to pay you a dividend and therefore you should look at net income which includes those costs why would a business with good net income and good ebitda report ebitda because ebitda will always be higher than net income why say $ 10 m net income when you could say $ 50 m ebitda the fact is it 's easy to report and is generally well understood so why not report it when it also makes you look better from a purely big number = good perspective i 'm not sure that reporting ebitda implies any sort of manipulative reporting but it would seem that warren buffet feels this is a risk

yes   i 've spoken to mortgage officers from various banks who will do conventional loans with anything as low as 3.5 down however there are many more restrictions e.g. normally you can borrow funds from a parent or relative for a down payment in this case that was prohibited if you are already pre approved then your approval letter should state the specifics you need to adhere to   if you would like to modify that e.g. put a smaller amount down then you could still get the loan but your pre approval wo n't be valid i would recommend speaking with your lender and perhaps with a few others as well about the new home you are looking at

no   this is too much for most individuals even some small to medium businesses   when you sell that investment and take the cheque into the foreign bank and wire it back to the usa in us dollars you will definitely obtain the final value of the investment converted to us$ that s what you wanted right   you 'll get that   if you also hedge unless you have a situation where it is a perfect hedge then you are gambling on what the currencies will do a perfect hedge is unusual for what most individuals are involved in it looks something like this   you know is going to pay you 10 million on dec 31   so you go to a bank probably a foreign bank i 've found they have lower limits for this kind of transaction and more customizable than what you might create trading futures contracts and tell them i have this contract for a 10 million receivable on dec 31 i 'd like to arrange a fx forward contract and lock in a rate for this in us$   they may have a credit check or a deposit for such an arrangement because as the rates change either the bank will owe you money or you will owe the bank money if they quote you 0.05 us$ then you know that when you hand the cheque over to the bank your contract payment will be worth us$ 500,000   the forward rate may differ from the current rate that s how the bank accounts for risk and includes a profit even with a perfect hedge you should be able to see the potential for trouble   if the bank does nt quite trust you and hey banks are nt known for trust then as the strengthens relative to the us$ they may suspect that you will walk away from the deal   this risk can be reduced by including terms in the contract requiring you to pay the bank some as that happens   if the falls you would get this money credited back to your account   this is also how futures contracts work there it is called mark to market accounting   trouble here   some people seeing how they are down money on the hedge cancel it   it is a classic mistake because it the protection that one was trying to achieve   often the rate will move back and the is left with less money than they would have had doing nothing even though they bought a perfect hedge

the employer most likely has already sent that money that was withheld to the irs therefore they can not refund you any money instead you need to get the money back from the irs you do this by filing a tax return   your will show that taxes were withheld i.e. that you paid taxes the rest of the return will show that no taxes were due and therefore you are entitled to have your money refunded if you have already filed for that tax you you just need to file an amended return with the new data that amendment will show that you are to be refunded the extra money then just wait several weeks for the payment from the irs   as pointed out if it is medicare and social security taxes that have been withheld in error then you need to file a different set of forms with irs it would be nice if refunding fica also occurred via the tax return

transactions cost is what kills you here the price of determining who gets what and then enforcing it    for example let 's say you invested in my electrical engineering class then when i get out of school i go to work at starbucks where i 'm applying literally none of that knowledge or experience and thus i signed a bad deal   or what if i change majors you still have a stake on my lifetime income but it wo n't be in the field you helped me into so college aged indecision would mean twice as much out of my take home income for life   or what if i 'd like to buy your percentage back from you what would be a fair price would there be a market to establish it   you should read the unincorporated man which has a system very similar to what you 're proposing    in this story education and subsistence investment have become expensive so in order to send a kid through college you 're actually purchasing shares of an individual 's future earnings like they 're a corporation parents get 10 when you 're born government gets 5 in lieu of taxes these shares have a market value based on income expenditures health etc pricing individuals just like you 'd price a company   in the story most individuals have sold over 50 of their shares meaning that they effectively do n't have controlling interest over their lives their jobs their homes all their major decisions are made by the shareholders so you might take a high risk job just because one of your biggest shareholders wants a payday   of course since it 's on the open market you can buy your shares back once you 're back over 50 you 're back in control of your life and the majority of your income the way the author it it 's a pretty comprehensive system and the book stays ambiguous as to whether it 's debt slavery or a new evolution of liberty   but again transactions costs think of six billion little corporations with all their vital stats and market data now imagine voting on the jobs and homes of the potentially hundreds of people in whom you have an interest it would simply be impossible to keep track of   honestly it 'd probably be more modest to just pay your student loans

can she claim deductions for her driving to and from work considering most people use their cars mostly to commute to from work there must be limits to what you can consider and what you ca n't otherwise everyone would claim back 80 of their mileage no she ca n't but if she 's driving from one work site to another that 's deductible whether or not either of the work sites is her home office can she claim deductions for her home office there 's a specific set of irs tests you have to meet if she meets them she can if you 're self employed reasonably need an office and have a place in your house dedicated to that purpose you will likely meet all the tests can i claim deductions for my home office even though i have an official work place that is not in my home it 's very hard to do so the use of your home office has to benefit your employer not just you can we claim deductions for our home internet service if the business or home office uses them they should be a deductible home office expense in some percentage usually for generic utilities that benefit the whole house you deduct at the same percentage as the home office is of the entire house but you can use other fractions if more appropriate for example if you have lots of computers in the home office you can deduct more of the electricity if you can justify the ratio you use run through the rules at the irs web page

leasing is not exactly a scam but it does n't seem to be the right product for you   the point of leasing over buying is that it turns the capital purchase of a car which needs to be depreciated for tax purposes into what is effectively a rental expense   rent is an expense that can be deducted directly without depreciation    if you are not operating a business where you can take advantage of leasing 's tax advantages leasing is probably not for you   because of the tax advantages a lease can be more profitable for the car dealer   they can get a commission or finder 's fee on the lease as well as the commission on the car sale   that extra profit comes from somewhere presumably from you   if a business you can then pass part of that to the government   as an individual you lose that advantage    at this point the best financial decision that you could make would be to buy out the lease on your current car   lease prices are set based on the assumption that the car will have been abused during the course of the lease   if you are driving the car less than expected its value is probably higher than the cost of buying out the lease   if you buy that car you can drive it for years   save up some money and buy your next car for cash rather than using financing    of course if you really want a new car and can afford it you may not want to buy out the lease   that is of course your decision   you do n't have to maximize your current financial position if buying a new car would return more satisfaction for the money in the long run   i would try to avoid financing for what is essentially a pleasure purchase though

you 're saying that you 're thinking of keeping 35 in cash if you expect the market to plummet in the next few months and then head up again this would be a smart strategy hold on to a bunch of cash then when the market hits bottom buy then as it goes back up collect your profits in practice the long term trend of the market has been up for as long as there has been a stock market bear markets tend to be relatively short usually just a few months or at most a year or two before the market gets back to where it was if you are smart enough to predict when there will be a decline and how long it will last you 're smarter than 99 of the professionals never mind the amateurs personally i keep only trivial amounts of cash let 's see right now about 2 of my assets if you 're more active in managing your retirement accounts if you really watch the market on a monthly basis or more frequently and adjust your assets according it would make sense to keep a larger cash reserve and use it when the market goes down but for the average person i think it would be a big mistake to keep anywhere near 35 of your assets in cash in the long run you 'll probably lose out on a lot of potential growth

old question i know but i have some thoughts to share your title and question say two different things   better off should mean maximizing your ex ante utility   most of your question seems to describe maximizing your expected return as do the simulation exercises here   those are two different things because risk is implicitly ignored by what you call the pure mathematical answer   the expected return on your investments needs to exceed the cost of your debt because interest you pay is risk free while your investments are risky to solve this problem consider the portfolio problem where paying down debt is the risk free asset and consider the set of optimal solutions   you will get a capital allocation line between the solution where you put everything into paying down debt and the optimal tangent portfolio from the set of risky assets    in order to determine where on that line someone is you must know their utility function and risk parameters   you also must know the parameters of the investable universe which we do n't

very rarely would an investor be happy with a 4 yield independent of anything else that might happen in the future for example if in 3 years for some reason or other inflation explodes and 30 year bond yields go up to 15 across the board they would be kicking themselves for having locked it up for 30 years at 4 however if instead of doing that the investor put their money in a 3 year bond at 3 say they would have the opportunity to reinvest in the new rate environment which might offer higher or lower yields this eventually leads fixed income investors to have a bond portfolio in which they manage the average maturity of their bond portfolio to be somewhere between the two extremes of investing it all in super short low yield money market rates vs. super long term bonds as they constantly monitor and manage their maturing investments it inevitably leads them to managing interest rate risk as they decide where to reinvest their incremental coupons by looking at the shape of the yield curve at the time and determining what kind of risk reward tradeoffs they would have to make

great question it can be a confusing for sure but here 's a great example i 've adapted to your scenario as a day trader you buy 100 shares of at $ 100 then after a large drop the same day you sell all 10 shares at $ 90 for a loss of $ 1,000 later in the afternoon you bought another 100 shares at $ 92 and resold them an hour later at $ 97 a $ 500 profit closing out your position for the day the second trade had a profit of $ 500 so you had a net loss of $ 500 the $ 1,000 loss plus the $ 500 profit   here ’s how this works out tax wise the irs first disallows the $ 1,000 loss and lets you show only a profit of $ 500 for the first trade since it was a wash but it lets you add the $ 1,000 loss to the basis of your replacement shares so instead of spending $ 100 shares times $ 92 for tax purposes you spent $ $ plus $ 1,000 which means that the second trade is what caused you to lose the $ 500 that you added back 100 x $ 97 = $ minus the 100 x $ 102 = $ netting $ 500 loss on a net basis you get to record your loss it just gets recorded on the second trade the basis addition lets you work off your wash sale losses eventually and in your case on day 3 you would recognize a $ 500 final net loss for tax purposes since you exited your position caveat unless you re enter within 30 days later at which point it would be another wash and the basis would shift again source

you will almost certainly be able to sell 10,000 shares at once the question is a matter of price if you sell at market then you may get a lower price for each batch of the stock sold one person buys 50 another buys 200 another buys 1000 etc at varying prices will you be able to execute a single order to sell them all at the same price at the same time nobody can say and it 's not really a function of the company size the exchange has what 's called open interest which roughly correlates to how many people have active orders in at a given price this number is constantly changing alongside the bid and ask particularly for active stocks so let 's say you have 10,000 shares and you want to sell them for $ 100 each what you need is at least 10,000 in open interest at $ 100 bid to execute by contrast let 's say you issue a limit order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares your ask will stay outstanding at that price and you 'll be filled at that price if there are enough buyers i you have a limit sell order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares the strike price of the stock can not go to $ 100.01 until all of your sell orders are filled

since the bondholders have voted to reject the emergency manager 's plan which would have paid them pennies on the dollar the city is now attempting to discharge its short term and long term debt if they get what they want in court it is likely these bonds will become worthless even if they are only able to restructure the debt its likely that bondholders will need to accept large concessions however this may not be immediately reflected in bond prices as it 's very possible that the market for these bonds will be very limited in terms of who they could sell them to if you were to buy them now that would be a bet on some outcome other than bankruptcy and the discharge of the city 's long term obligations president obama has already stated that he monitoring the situation and it seems unlikely to me that after all of the support given to the auto industry in the last several years that the federal government will do nothing if only to avert job losses however i think it 's likely that state aid will be limited at best as michigan 's economy has been struggling for a number of years there are n't many large precedents to look at for guidance one of the largest public entities to declare bankruptcy orange county was a very different situation because this was due to malfeasance on the part of its investment manager whereas detroit 's situation is a much larger structural problem with its declining economy and tax base i think the key question will be whether the federal government will consider a detroit bankruptcy to be a large enough failure to take significant action

first some general advice that i think you should consider a good rule of thumb on home buying is to wait to buy until you expect to live in the same place for at least 5 years this period of time is meant to reduce the impact of closing costs which can be 1 5 of your total buying selling price if you bought and sold in the same year for example then you might need to pay over 5 of the value of your home to realtors lawyers this means that for many people it is unwise to buy a home expecting it to be your starter home if you already are thinking about what your next presumably bigger home will look like if you buy a townhouse expecting to sell it in 3 years to buy a house you are partially gambling on the chance that increases in your 's value will offset the closing costs mortgage interest paid increases in home value are not a sure thing in many areas the total costs of home ownership are about equivalent to the total costs of renting when you factor in maintenance i notice you do n't even mention renting as an option make sure you at least consider it before deciding to buy also do n't buy a house expecting your life situation to make up the difference in your budget if you 're expecting your girlfriend to move in with you in a year that implies that you are n't living together now and maybe have n't talked about it even if she says now that she would move in within a year there 's no guarantee that things work out that way taking on a mortgage is a commitment that you need to take on yourself no one else will be liable for the payments as for whether a townhouse or a detached house helps you meet your needs better do n't get caught up in terminology there are few differences between houses that are universal are cheaper smaller and have condo associations with monthly fees to pay for maintenance on joint property but that is something that differs on a case by case basis do n't get tricked into buying a 1,100 sq ft house with a restrictive hoa instead of a 1,400 sq ft free hold townhouse just because townhouses have a certain reputation the only true difference between a house and a townhouse is that 1 or both of your walls are shared with a neighbor everything else is flexible

by the time you 've earned the income it is basically too late to decide who it belongs to   if the assets belong to one person income from those assets must be declared by that person   if you earn interest on a shared account you must declare 50 of it each   and so on   if you 're tempted to fudge it bear in mind that banks report to the ato about interest paid and account ownership i do n't think family tax benefits are taxable income but i do n't get them myself so i do n't know what you can do is think about how you want things arranged going forward   that means making a prediction about who will have the higher income it sounds like that 's going to be you and she will be working at most part time therefore she should hold anything that generates taxable income bank accounts etc and you should hold anything that generates losses negatively geared investments charitable deductions etc   you could look into making a voluntary super contribution into her account which will be deductible for you and get it into a lower tax area if you 're earning on the order of $ 30k per annum in interest you 're looking at paying $ tax on it if it 's in your name vs $ 5k if it 's in hers so it 's not a moot point $ in cash is arguably quite a lot and perhaps you want to look at putting some of it into a low cost balanced managed fund such as those from vanguard   that will be somewhat more tax effective though less stable   if you 're looking to buy a new house within a few years perhaps cash is the best place for it one kind of exception is that if you have a family trust the trust can decide at the end of the year to whom it will distribute its income   however you still have to decide to establish a trust in advance

gt amazon 's bid to buy whole foods should be a wake up call our anti monopoly policies have fallen into and today 's big tech monopolies have used that opening to seize too much power as senator john sherman co author of the sherman antitrust act declared as his bill came up for a vote in 1890 if we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production transportation and sale of any of the of life   i 'm going to push back a little and say that by ending the article by connecting the bid for whole foods to the sherman antitrust act the implication is pretty clear if not bordering on explicitly stating that amazon qualifies as a big tech monopoly    i could definitely be wrong i just feel like the wording she chose throughout the article deliberately tries to lead the reader to the conclusion that amazon should be broken up by the government because it 's a monopoly     what are your thoughts on the concluding statement and your point that she is focusing on the potential and not the current state

stock issuing and dilution is legal because there must be some mechanism for small companies to grow into big companies a company sees a great investment opportunity   it would be a perfect extension of their activities but they can not afford it to get the necessary money they can either take out a loan or issue shares taking a loan basically means that this is temporary but the company will go back to being small when the loan is paid back issuing new shares basically means that the board means that this growth is permanent and the company will be big for the foreseeable future it is utterly necessary that companies have this option for raising cash and therefore it is legal as detailed in the other answers you end up with a smaller percentage of a larger company usually ending up with more or less the same value

the s&p 500 is an index this refers to a specific collection of securities which is held in perfect proportion the dollar value of an index is scaled arbitrarily and is based off of an arbitrary starting price side note this is why an index never has a split lets look at what assumptions are included in the pricing of an index all securities are held in perfect proportion this means that if you invest $ 100 in the index you will receive shares of ibm shares of general motors etc also if a security is added dropped from the list you are immediately rebalancing the remaining money zero commissions are charged when the index is calculated they are using the current price last trade of the underlying securities they are not actually purchasing them therefore it assumes that securities may be purchased without commission or other liquidity costs also closely related is the following the current price has full liquidity if the last quoted price is $ 20 for a security the index assumes that you can purchase an arbitrary amount of the security at that price with a counterparty that is willing to trade dividends are distributed immediately if you own 500 equities and most distributed dividends quarterly this means you will receive on average 4 dividends per day management is free all equities can be purchased with zero research and administrative costs there is no gains tax trading required by the assumptions above would change your holdings constantly and you are exempt from short term or long term capital gains taxes each one of these assumptions is of course invalid and the fund which endeavors to track the index must make several decisions in how to closely track the index while avoiding the problems costs caused by the assumptions these are shortcuts or each shortcut leads to performance which does not exactly match the index management fees fees are charged to the investor as load annual fees and/or redemptions securities are purchased at real prices if facebook were removed from the s&p 500 overnight tonight the fund would sell its shares at the price buyers are bidding the next market day at this could be significantly different than the price today which the index records securities are purchased in blocks rather than buying shares of general motors each time someone invests a dollar they wait for a few people and then buy a full share or a round lot securities are substituted with lots of analysis it may be determined that two stocks move in tandem the fund may purchase two shares of general motors rather than one of general motors and ford this halves transaction costs debt is used as part of substitution equities may be replaced by options option pricing shows that ownership of options is equivalent to holding an amount of debt other forms of leverage may also be employed to achieve desired market exposure see also beta   dividends are bundled vfinx the largest s&p 500 tracking fund pays dividends quarterly rather than immediately as earned the dividend money which is not paid to you is either deployed to buy other securities or put into a sinking fund for payment there are many reasons why you ca n't get the actual performance quoted in an index and for other more exotic indices like vix the volatility index even more so the best you can do is work with someone that has a good reputation and measure their performance

although this has been touched upon in comments i think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue there is a clear difference between investing and gambling the reality is that the difference is n't that clear at all tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions the underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing especially in the stock market is a form of gambling people who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling as gambling is considered a negative thing the simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous and the way investors will use the words investments and gambles will differ from the way it is used by gamblers and once again different from the way it 's commonly used what i definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling the result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment   that still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms with a strong overlap which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment over on there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling and they came up with the following two definitions investing any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance sufficient research has been conducted the odds are favorable the behavior is risk averse a systematic approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play no role the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long term plan the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is involved a net positive economic effect results gambling any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance little or no research has been conducted the odds are unfavorable the behavior is risk seeking an approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play a role the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long term plan the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is not involved no net economic effect results the very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people and they even acknowledge that a lot of investors are gambling and that a few gamblers are investing read the essay for more on that and this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public so in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment but if we take for example 's operation example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000 so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one this can suddenly change the perception and turn gambling into high risk investing

gt if a penny worth of copper is worth 1.8 cents and i choose to make it into a a coin with a value of 1 cent then my opportunity cost is .8 cents   no not at all a coin represents value it is not value in terms of its denomination a coin does however have value as facilitator of exchange of value but that is in principle unrelated to that coin 's denomination so the value of a 1 cent coin as a facility of exchange is unknown it is however easy to make the case that this unknown is very low or even negative   gt a gold coin back before fiat currencies was worth its weight in gold   gold is just very slightly different in this regard and substantially the same it is used to represent value and has very low intrinsic value it 's just a naturally limited resource instead of an artificially limited one such as fiat currency this would be immediately evident if by some freak act of nature there was an abundance of gold raining down on everyone tomorrow nobody would become rich just some unfortunate people overloaded with gold assets would become poor gold teeth and jewelry would become cheaper though i imagine the latter would go out of fashion quite quickly   gt when i make the spending power less than the value the purpose of a fiat currency breaks down   not at all there 's in principle no relationship between value and denomination you just need means of exchange that are cost effective and practical single cents are becoming impractical and basically useless and this would be just as true even if they cost cents each to produce

generally for tax questions you should talk to a tax adviser do n't consider anything i write here as a tax advice and the answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer does irs like one payment method over other or they simply do n't care    as long as she can show the receipts they do n't care as long as she withholds the taxes 30 unless specific arrangements are made for otherwise she should withhold 30 of the payment and send it to the irs the recipient should claim refund if the actual tax liability is lower it 's only consulting work at the moment so most of the communication    is done over phone should they start engaging in written    communication to keep records of the work done yes if she wants it to be a business expense is it okay to pay in one go to save money transferring fees can she    pay in advance again she can do whatever she wants but if she wants to account for it on her tax returns she should do it the same way she would pay any other vendor in her business she can not use different accounting methods for different vendors basically she has not outsourced work in previous years and she    wants to avoid any red flags then she should start by calling on her tax adviser and not an anonymous internet forum

the vix is a mathematical aggregate of the implied volatilities of the s&p 500 index components it itself can not be traded as there currently is no way to only hold a position on an implied volatility alone   implied volatility can only currently be derived from an option relative to its underlying   further the s&p 500 index itself can not be traded only the attempts to replicate it   for assets that are not tradable derivatives can be cash settled where the value of the underlying is delivered in cash   cash settlement can be used for underlyings that in fact due trade but are frequently only elected if the underlying is costly to deliver or there is an incentive to circumvent regulation currently only futures that settle on the value of the vix at the time of delivery trade in other words vix futures holders must deliver on the value of the vix in cash upon settlement   options in turn trade on those futures and in turn are also cash settled on the value of the underlying future at expiration the vxx etf holds one to two month vix futures that it trades out of before delivery so while it is impossible to know exactly what is held in the vxx accounts unless if one had information from an insider or the vxx published such details one can assume that it holds vix futures contracts no later than two settlements from the preset   it should be noted that the vxx does not track the vix over the long run because of the cost to roll the futures and that the futures are more stable than the vix so it is a poor substitute for the vix over time periods longer than one day underlying now implies any abstract from which a financial product derives its value

i expect that the loan documents show both you and your ex partner as jointly and liable for the debt and thus you 're both responsible for it   it does n't really matter what other paperwork you have that says otherwise or what other promises might have been made   certainly the other agreements give you legal ground to go after your ex partner for the money but they give you no leverage with the bank if you end up paying this debt off to save your credit you need to make sure that the account is closed   make sure you have paperwork showing it as closed and showing that it was paid in full and then keep that paperwork forever re 1 i think it will eventually show up on your credit report   you could ask the bank for proof that you owe the money if you like but that will probably just delay the inevitable re 2 his bankruptcy filing really has no bearing on you and your obligation to repay the loan   if he did n't list this debt then he is still liable for it as well and you can still go after him under your other agreements   but either way you 're still on the debt

the only way to roll debt into a home purchase is to have sufficient down payment   under the new lending rules that took effect in canada earlier this year you must have at least 5 of the purchase price as a down payment   if you have $ 60,000 in additional debt the total amount of mortgage still can not be greater than 95 of the purchase price   below is an example purchase price of home $ 200,000 maximum mortgage $ 190,000 95 of purchase price total outside debt $ 60,000 that means the mortgage other than the current debt of $ 60k can only be $ 130,000 this means you would need a down payment of $ 70,000 also keep in mind that i have not included any other legal fees real estate commissions etc in this example since it is safe to assume that you do not have $ 70k available for a down payment renting and paying down the debt is likely the better route   pay off the credit card(s first as they have the higher interest amount best of luck

then why do countries with single payer health plans see the cost for medical services increase beyond the rate of inflation every year    seriously just look at these assets watson global medical trends   it does n't matter that they spend less of of gdp on health care than us because the net effect of thier models cause cost inflation that increases that percentage just like ours you could transplant thier model to the us and still see the same upward momentum it is mathematically unsustainable

the cra 's website has pretty good information on this type of thing the search function is not great however so i recommend going to google and typing if you search   it brings you here   if you want to transfer funds from one tfsa to another or from one issuer to another there will be no tax consequences if your issuer completes a direct transfer on your behalf for more information contact your issuer it seems that this is not something you are able to perform yourself unfortunately it seems you may need to go back to your issuer with this information and ask again that they perform the transfer on your behalf note that failure to comply with this request on their end likely has stiff penalties behind it so it may help you to get the individual 's name and wave that stick around to make something happen you may also have better luck by first opening an account with your new desired institution and asking that they assist in requesting the transfer from your old institution they have incentive to help you here as it 's the only way they get to serve you so you 'll have valuable help on your side

if they really want cash you notify your bank in advance of the amount and have it put in your account then you both sign the paperwork at the bank and after everything is signed you have the bank hand them the money it after that is entirely their problem personally i would consider this a stupid request and tell them to have their lawyer discuss it with my lawyer in the hope they can be talked out of it   as far as where to get the money same as for any purchase find a bank willing to write a mortgage for you on this new house what you choose to do about the other two houses is an independent question you can sell one or both but that may take money so you probably wo n't finish doing so before needing to pay for the new house of course when they do sell you can use the money toward paying down paying off the new mortgage

gt;i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   gt;the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages    the law should not force any party to sit at any table that violates a party 's contract liberty   gt;the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits   that 's nice that you think you know what 's better for other people than they do for themselves but that does n't give you a right to force them to any table a right to contract freedom means the right to dismiss any offer or refuse to even negotiate with a party   gt;if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that   then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   gt;i'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   sorry i do n't have time to dig up citations now if i have time later i 'd be happy to do so all i could find now is an inverse correlation between the state of a country 's credit market and the rate of child labor     is an abundance of indirect empirical evidence discussed below concerning   the role of credit constraints and educational   however and   2002 test the hypothesis directly   they estimate a basic model of child labor determination for a panel of countries for the years 1950 60 1970 1980 and 1995     gt;&gt;the credit constraint variable is by the share in gdp of private credit issued by 10 deposit money banks   they find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of credit in gdp is associated with a 10 percent standard deviation decrease in child labor they conclude that families with access to credit are considerably less likely to put   children to work during a period of economic volatility than parents without access to credit   educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers    if there are efficient financial markets that allow parents to borrow money against the expected future increase in earnings from their children being educated then yes   in less developed economies these markets have not developed and the choice is often between death and child labor    gt;they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries    studies have shown that by and large parents act towards their children and only put them to work if it is in the children 's best interest e.g. page 32     together the evidence so far presented it   appears that the data are consistent with a model where the returns from child   labor do not accrue to the parents parents redistribute entirely these returns to their children in the form of lower labor supply and higher schooling plus possibly increased consumption 47   laws against child labor therefore will generally do more harm than good   gt;what 's the solution here   the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   gt;this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none   a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   gt;i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford   why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so   the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   gt;i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes   a general effect happens gradually over a course of decades and happens in the aggregate not in every case it will not be apparent in the short run and will not be manifested in every case in other words that unionization did not result in immediate bankruptcy of your industry does not prove that unionization does not have a negative effect over the average long term performance of industries and average long term increase in wages

i will expand on bacon 's comment when you are married and you acquire any kind of property you automatically get a legal agreement   in most states that property is owned jointly and while there are exceptions that is the case most of the time    when you are unmarried there is no such assumption of joint acquisition   while words might be said differently between the two parties if there is nothing written down and signed then courts will almost always assume that only one party owns the property   now unmarried people go into business all the time but they do so by creating legally binding agreements that cover contingencies   if you two do proceed with this plan it is necessary to create those documents with the help of a lawyer   although expensive paying for this protection is a small price in relation to what will probably be one of the largest purchases in your lives however i do not recommend this   if clayton can and wants to buy a home he should   emma can rent from clayton   that rent could any amount the two agree on including zero   if the two do get married well then emma will end up owning any equity after that date   if they stay together until death it is likely that she or her heirs will own half of it anyway   also if this house is sold the equity pass into larger house they buy after marriage then that will be owned jointly if they do break up the break up is clean and neat   presumably she would have paid rent anyway so nothing is lost   many people run into trouble having to sell at a bad time in a relationship that coincides with a weak housing market   in that case both parties lose    so much like bacon 's advice i would not buy jointly   there is no upside and you avoid a lot of downside do n't play house by buying a home jointly when you are unmarried

it 's more complicated than that governments raise money in a number of ways   first they tax economic activity within their borders and for connected companies and individuals   then some governments have actual revenues from state owned enterprises licences patents courts business revenues and so on whatever shortage arises between state expenditure and this income is the deficit which is usually financed through debt government usually issues a bond wikipedia for a list of government bonds of various types some with extremely lengthy maturation dates   these bonds can be purchased both locally and by foreign investment funds   the nature of who buys is important from the wikipedia link you 'll see that most government debt is very highly rated based on the ability of the state to simply raise taxes in order to fund redemption   pension funds are legally bound to only invest in highly rated investment classes and the bulk of bonds may be purchased to support local pensioners a state that defaults on debt will first hit its own most vulnerable citizens   in addition the fall out will result in a cut in ratings   countries like argentina and zimbabwe which have both refused to repay their debts even to the imf are currently unable to raise investment at all   this has a tremendous impact on local economic development so default is out of the question without severe penalties the second part of your question is about paying down the debt   as debts increase more and more of the revenue that a country does earn is spent on servicing debt repayments   sometimes bonds are issued merely to refinance old debt   a country that spends too much on refinancing debt is no different from an individual   less and less money is available to do other things in conclusion governments can neither default nor binge borrow unless they wish to severely limit economic opportunities for their citizens

to add to joetaxpayer 's answer the cost of providing term life insurance for one year increases with the age of the insured thus if you buy a 30-year term policy with level premiums the premium is the same for 30 years then during the earlier years you pay more than the cost to the insurance company for providing the benefit in later years you pay somewhat less than the cost of providing the insurance the excess premiums that the insurance company charged in earlier years and the earnings from investing that money covers the difference between the premium paid in later years and the true cost of providing the coverage   if after 20 years you decide that you no longer need the protection children have grown up and now have jobs etc and you cancel the policy you will have overpaid for the protection that you got the insurance company will not give you on the overpayment as an alternative you might want to consider a term life insurance policy in which the premiums increase each year or increase every 5 years and thus better approximate the actual cost to the insurance company one advantage is that you pay less in early life and pay more in later years when hopefully your income will have increased and you can afford to pay more thus you can get a policy with a larger face value 150 k for your wife and 400 k for yourself is really quite small with annual premium of $ 550 now and more in later years also if you decide to cancel the policy after 20 years you will not have overpaid for the level of coverage provided finally in addition to a policy with larger face value i recommend that you include the mortgage if any on your house in the amount that you decide is enough for your family to live on and to send the kids to college etc or get a separate term life insurance policy to cover the mortgage on your home many mortgage contracts have clauses to the effect that the entire principal owed becomes immediately due if either of the borrowers dies yes the widow or can get a replacement mortgage or prove to the lender that the monthly payments will continue as before or pay off the mortgage from that $ 150 k or $ 400 k which will leave a heck of a lot less for the family to survive on etc but in the middle of dealing with all the hassles created by a death in the family this is one headache that can be taken care of now   the advantage of including the mortgage amount in a single policy that will support the family when you are gone is that you get a bit of a break the sum of the annual premiums on ten policies for $ 100 k is more than the premiums for a single $ 1 m policy there is also the consideration that the principal owed on the mortgage declines over the years very slowly at first though and so there will be more money available for living expenses in later years alternatively consider a special term life insurance policy geared towards mortgage coverage the face value of this policy reduces each year to match the amount still due on the mortgage note that you may already have such a policy in place because the lender has insisted on you getting such a policy as a condition for issuing the loan in this case keep in mind that not only is the lender the   beneficiary of such a policy but if you bought the policy through the lender you are providing extra profit to the lender you can get a similar policy at lower premiums on the open market than the policy that your lender has so provided you   i bought mine from a source that caters to employees of nonprofit organizations and public sector employees your mileage may vary

a yes it does accomplish the goal of adding more money but the money is in lieu of any return you can earn while the loan is outstanding if you somehow knew exactly which periods where going to run negative and you took a 401k loan during that time you 'd be in pretty good shape but if you had that information you 'd probably be ruling the world in short order and would n't care much about a measly 401k b it 's a nice idea but unfortunately you are not allowed to set your own interest rate if you could your idea would work perfectly the interest rate is bank specific and is typically 1 2 points over prime but if your plan was to leave your money sitting in cash or low interest bearing accounts anyway the loan does actually achieve the goal of getting more money in there though it 's your money you are n't earning it

you mention only two debts mortgage and student loan but you mention $ 19 k in savings which suggests that you are a saver and likely do not have other debts you did not mention your net income and expenses income statement but since you have substantial savings you likely live within your means income > expenses   since you mention $ 38 k in retirement we might conclude you are regularly saving for retirement are you saving 10 toward retirement you did not mention any medical condition or other debts that might require a large savings so i would suggest having 6 months savings $ 2.5 k x 6 = $ 15 k but should your net expenses be less you might reduce this $ 2 k x 6 = $ 12 k you do not mention any investment you might want to make but since you did not mention any candidate investments we can assume you have no specific investments you find particularly attractive   you did not mention anything you were saving to purchase that you might want to purchase you have combined $ 19 k + $ 50 k = $ 69 k savings and $ 15 k would be a comfortable emergency savings leaving $ 54 k you could use to reduce mortgage or student loan debt the mortgage debt interest is higher so paying that debt off would be like earning 4.5 guaranteed return on your money tax free   at your income your marginal tax rate is low enough that the mortgage interest deduction if you do itemize would not reduce this return much 15 if you itemize the student loan debt interest would be like earning 2.8 guaranteed return on your money tax free clearly the higher return on your investment in paying off debt would be reducing your mortgage balance over 50 higher return on investment compared to the student loan debt you did not mention any circumstance that might cause the student loan rate to increase the mortgage rate to increase nor did you mention any difficulty making both the mortgage and student loan payments the amounts of either payment nor the number of years remaining to pay on either should you need or desire to reduce your payments you could choose to payoff the student loan to eliminate one payment and thus decrease your expenses   or you could choose to pay down the mortgage and refinance or the mortgage to obtain a smaller payment   another strategy assuming you have had your house for 5 7 years might be to pay the mortgage down enough to refinance into a 15 year loan and assuming you have a good credit score obtain a lower 3 rate but i am going to suggest you consider a blended approach   combine the dave ramsey debt snowball approach with the reduce the interest rate approach   take the $ 54 k $ 57 k available after reserving 6 months emergency fund and split between both   you pay your mortgage down by $ 27 k and your student loan debt down by $   your blended return on investment is 2.8 + = and you have the following balance sheet assets debts the next steps would be to there are two great reasons for paying off the student loan debt one is the dave ramsey debt snowball approach which is that this is the smaller debt and thus represents a psychological win and the other is that student loan debt has special treatment even in bankruptcy

insurance is a financial product to control risk the fact that a loss would not be catastrophic simply makes the decision to carry insurance less critical it is perfectly reasonable to be self insured in this case this is assuming we are discussing replacement of your property vs liability which you have made clear like many other products one buys a fine reason to purchase insurance is simply because one wants to just because you can absorb the loss does not mean that you want to take on the full risk i would be careful of your analysis here insurance companies on average make money by selling insurance which means you lose money on average by dealing with them insurance companies make money based on the cumulative probability that they will have to pay on multiple policies to make money they analyze the risk that in a given period they will only pay on a portion of their hundreds of thousands or millions of policies this is a different analysis than the probability that you will have a loss on your specific asset   your risk of a loss is not equivalent to their risk of loss here the argument that they only win if you individually lose is not a good one

real estate investment is a proven creator of wealth   check into the history of the rich and you will find real estate investment starting your investment in multi family is a great idea   it is a good way to gain experience in real estate while exponentially increasing cash flow if you turn the properties over to a reputable property management company your cash flow will be a little less but so will your headaches expect to pay 8 10 of gross income you could start investing now by looking into discounted real estate such as foreclosures tax sales short sales etc while the market is still depressed   this way your return on investment should be higher from there you could expand into land development i.e. or commercial investments commercial properties with triple net leases can be a great low stress investment opportunity but they take more cash upfront attending some local real estate investment classes would be a great idea for starters

there is no generic formula as such but you can work it out using all known incomes and expenses and by making some educated you should know your buying costs which include the purchase price legal fees taxes in australia we have stamp duty which is a large state based tax when you purchase a property other things to consider include estimates for any repairs and/or renovations also you should look at the long term growth in your area and use this as an estimate of your potential growth over the period you wish to hold the property and estimate the agent fees if you were to sell and the depreciation on the building these things including the agent fees when selling and building depreciation will all be added or deducted to your cost base to determine the amount of capital gain when and if you sell the property you then need to multiply this gain by the capital gains tax rate to determine the capital gains tax you may have to pay from all the items above you will be able to estimate the net capital gain after all taxes you could expect to make on the property over the period you are looking to hold it for in regards to holding and renting the property things you will need to consider include the rent the long term growth of rent in your area and all the expenses including loan fees and interest insurance rates land tax and an estimate of the annual maintenance cost per year also you would need to consider any depreciation deductions you can claim other things you will need to consider is the change in these values as time goes by and provide an estimate for these in your calculations any increase in the value of land will increase the amount of rates and the land tax you pay and generally your insurance and maintenance costs will increase with time however your interest and mortgage repayments will reduce over time will your rent increases cover your increases in the expenses from all the items above you should be able to work out an estimate of your net rental gain or loss for each year again do this for the number of years you are looking to hold the property for and then sum up the total to give a net profit or loss if there is a net loss from the income then you need to consider if the net capital gain will cover these losses and still give you a reasonable return over the period you will own the property below is a sample calculation showing most of the variables i have discussed

danger the affidavit is a legal document understand the risk of getting caught if you are planning on using the condo to generate income the chances that you default on the loan are higher than an owner occupied property that is why they demand more down payment 20%+ and charge a higher rate   the document is n't about making sure you spend 183 + nights a year in the property it is making sure that it is n't a business and you are n't letting a 3rd party live in the property   if you within the first year tell the mortgage company to send the bill to a new address or you change how the property is insured they will suspect that it is now a rental property   what can they do undo the loan ask for penalty fee limit your ability to get a mortgage in the future or a percentage of the profits how likely is it the exact penalty will be in the packet of documents you receive it will depend on which government agency is involved in the loan and the lenders plan to sell it on the secondary market   it can also depend on the program involved in the sale of the property hud and sister agencies lock out investors   during the initial selling period they do n't want somebody to represent themselves as homeowner but is actually an investor note some local governments are interested not just in non investors but in properties being occupied therefore they may offer tax discounts to residents living in their homes then they will be looking at the number of nights that you occupy the house in a year if they detect that you are n't really a resident living in the house that has tax penalties suggestion if you do n't want to wait a year buy the condo and let the loan officer know what your plan is you will have to meet the down payment and interest rate requirements for an investment property your question implies that you will have enough money to pay the required 20 down payment then when you are ready buy the bigger house and move in if you try and buy the condo with a non investment loan you will have to wait a year if you try and pay cash now and then get a home equity loan later you will have to admit it is a rental and still have to meet the investor requirements

wow hard to believe not a single answer mentioned investing in one of the best asset classes for tax purposes real estate   now i 'm not advising you to rush out and buy an investment property   but rather than just dumping your money into mutual funds over which you have almost 0 control buy some books on real estate investing   there are plenty of areas to get into single family housing rentals multifamily apartments mobile home parks and even some of those can have their own   learn now and yes you do have some control over real estate you control where you buy so you pick your local market you can always force appreciation by if you rent you approve your renters   compared to a mutual fund run by someone you 'll never meet buying stocks in companies you 've likely never even heard of you have far more control no matter what area of investing you decide to go into there is a learning curve or you will pay a penalty   go slow but move forward also all the advice on using your employer 's matching if available for 401k should be the easiest first step   how do you turn down free money   besides the bottom line on your paycheck may not change as much as you think it might and when weighed against what you get in return well worth the time to get it setup and active

ugh sorry + finance is pretty to actual information sharing   taxi medallions licenses are heavily financed using debt principally in the form of commercial loans the structure of these loans is usually interest only 3 year balloon with borrowers qualified on a 40 year amortization period sound familiar i 'll give you a hint rhymes with the loans then get chopped up and to local community lenders who are told that the prices never go down because supply side monopoly and then they happily up the concentration of taxi financing in their lending portfolios   your observation is uber lyft sidecar all that shit comes into the picture and there 's no hail so they 're not really taxis meaning they skirt regulation and to make matters worse they are also heavily financed through vc pe short term bank debt and they use that financing to do what not operations instead they just lower their prices and usually below that of traditional cabs it 's an artificially deflated price designed to hook folks on the service and then when they start not being able to subsidize their prices anymore they 'll raise em back up but consumers do n't care about that in the short run   why does any of this matter because when the e collective cited above comes in and creates stiff competition demand for medallion falls because cab drivers would rather go work for uber they do n't need to license their right to drive from a cab fleet anymore and also demand for cabs themselves falls because people would rather take the cheaper alternative that causes the cost of medallions to fall which = price correction and that 's bad because it 's not the guys originating and these loans who are on the hook effectively sold off their share of the loan to other lenders community banks and cashed out instead you 're looking at mom and pop banks who are now on the hook for these loans where the value of the loan grossly exceeds the value of the collateral the medallion the thing they were supposed to partially finance   this is the same phenomenon as what happened in 08 real estate prices experience a substantial price correction because of well a bunch of shit but let 's just say that it had to do with the financing arrangements that made real estate safe in the first place + shitty loan underwriting standards all of a sudden you had people with 500 k houses that they took out a 1.2 m mortgage for rational actors true to their word just walked away from the house just packed up their shit and moved somewhere else and just said to the bank here 's the keys i ca n't afford this shit and the bank ca n't take any of their stuff because the mortgage terms were essentially for the value of the collateral so now you have all these banks that are short on liquid assets they have residential properties but nobody 's buying at least not at the prices that they need to get the return on their investment   this is all a really long way of saying this if there is a mass price correction caused by uber it 's going to be mom and pop banks on the hook for the loans borrowers will flee en masse to uber et al while banks will experience serious liquidity issues you 're right that uber is doing something great by forcing taxi cabs into a non monopolistic situation but the first step needs to be unwinding the debt on these loans otherwise you 're looking at a mini market crash that could be disastrous for grandma and grandpa in county they 're not going and banking at citi or they 're banking at shitty little mom and pop banks that have no idea what they 're being sold

seek professional advice as duffbeer703 has suggested already   very important consider incorporating   if your income will fluctuate year to year you can keep profit in the corporation taxed in its hands at the canadian small business rate since such corporate income below $ 500,000 would likely qualify for the small business deduction you could pay   retained earnings to yourself as dividends over more than one year in order to lessen the personal tax burden if you do n't incorporate all your profits in the year they are earned are taxed at personal income tax rates and with our progressive income tax system taking the tax hit all in one year can be expensive   however if this project is a one off and you 're not likely to continue working like this you might not want the overhead of a corporation   taxes aside there are also legal issues to consider vis a vis incorporating or not a professional can help you make this decision    yes you can claim deductions for reasonable business expenses whether or not you are incorporated no you ca n't do free work on the side and claim it as donations   it 's nice to volunteer but you would n't get a charitable tax credit for your time only for money or goods donated consider opening an rrsp so you can start saving for retirement and get a tax deduction for any contributions you make   this is but one strategy to reduce your tax   there are others   for instance if you are a student you perhaps have some unused tuition credits that you could claim in your first year with higher income oh and seek professional advice

the math works out so that the 401k is still a better deal in the long term over a taxable account because of the tax deferred growth let 's assume you invest in an s&p 500 index fund in either a taxable investment account or a 401k and the difference in fees is .5 i used an online calculator and a hypothetical 1k year investment over 30 years with 4.5 tax deferred growth vs 5 taxable and a 25 tax bracket after 30 years the tax deferred 401k account will have $ and the taxable account will have $ the math is n't perfect i 'm sure i 'm missing some with dividends capital gains distributions and that you 'll then pay income tax on the 401k upon retirement as you drawn down but it still seems pretty clear that the 401k will win in the long run especially if you invest more than the 1k year used in my example but yeah expenses on an index fund is robbery can you bring that to the attention of the hr department maybe they 'll want to look for a lower fee provider and it 's in their best interest too if they also participate

gift taxes kick in at around $ 13 k per giver per recipient per year that means that a straight up gift of $ 200 k as cash or a house will incur a tax it is possible however that if the father has a spouse he and the spouse could each give the mother and each child the full gift limit for a total of about $ 78 k per year and that money could be used by all 3 of them to buy the house jointly over a couple of years i think the children would have to be on the title since part of the gift money would be theirs and one is an adult as far as lending the money my in laws are our mortgage lenders and when we structured the loan it had to be at a market rate which could be the lowest advertised rate we found for a fixed rate mortgage independent of what we might actually qualify for or we could not deduct interest payments forgiving the loan could also be considered a gift so they would need to keep an audit trail showing that payments were made and her father would need to declare the interest income on his taxes if he bought the house as a second home and let her and her children live there rent free it might work but i 'm not sure it would in that case be an asset of his estate when he dies i do n't know anything about structuring it as a trust free rent could conceivably also be construed as a gift subject to the limits stated above disclaimer not a tax professional

i should think the primary reason is due why those countries have a higher standard of salary its not what you get but what it buys you in a high salary low exchange rate country like sweden you get a lot of services that your taxes buy you healthcare and quality of life in a stable country is something you want when you get old note that your viewpoint might be very different when you 're a kid moving to a country that has less impact on your finances is often because that country has significantly fewer services to offer so a swedish citizen might think about moving to a 3rd world country and find that their retirement income is n't sufficient to pay for the kind of lifestyle they actually want such countries tend to be pleasant to live in only if you are exceptionally wealthy   now this kind of thing does happen but only within reason there are a number of old people who retire to the coast in the uk at least and many people who used to work in london who retire to the south west for them the idea of moving does n't seem so bad as they are moving to areas where many other people in their situation have also moved see florida for an example for us citizens too

that very idea of saving is precisely what fed monetary policy is trying to prevent   create demand by forcing savers to spend then when they run out   you do n't have money you have the next bailout for the banks
