there is a ten year statue of limitations on debt collection bankruptcy etc the problem is if you start paying even say $ 1 you acknowledge the debt and the clock starts again debt claims fall under the he said she said in debt restructuring situations the debtor is taught to write all their creditors denying debts some percentage of those creditors wo n't have the paperwork to back up their claims others will and can press their claims then a court decides   but in any event a debt more than tens years old is a stale debt a court is likely to rule in your favor unless you acknowledge the debt

this sounds like a shady trick i would consult with a consumer debt lawyer in your area most county bar associations in the us have a referral service where they recommend a local lawyer and there is a reduced fee for the initial visit i think the statute of limitations is 10 years in most cases but it depends on where you live from these bare details i think they don;t have much of a case go see a lawyer and do n't let them you
# 525967
investigate the statute of limitations in your area   15 years sounds like in most places it is past the allowable time a debt collector can legally collect or report it on your credit report the statute of limitations means you still owe the debt but they collector can no longer use the court system to collect it from you   they can file a lawsuit they will just lose   please read up on how to handle yourself with a debt that is past the sol so that you do n't accidentally reset the clock what i do n't know for sure is how that applies to a business and i can not remember ever hearing a difference between personal vs business debt but it is best to consult a lawyer regarding it references

legally a check just needs to have a certain list of things be an instruction to one 's bank to pay a specific amount of money to bearer or to a specific entity have a date have a signature etc there are anecdotes around of a guy depositing a junk mail check and it accidentally qualifying as a real check which he turned into a live show or of writing a check on a door cow or the shirt off your back what kind of checks your bank will process is technically up to them generally if you get your blank checks printed up by any reputable firm they 'll have similar information in similar places as well as the micr line the account and routing number in magnetic ink on the bottom to allow for bank to process the checks with automated equipment as long as it 's a standard size has the micr line and has the information that a check needs your bank is likely to be fine with it so there are some standards but details like where exactly the name of the bank is or what font is used or the like are up to whoever is printing the check for details on what standards your bank requires in order to process your checks you 'd have to check with your bank directly though it would n't surprise me if they just directed you to their preferred check printer provider as they know that they accept their check format fine though as i said any reputable check printer makes sure that they meet the standards to get processed by banks without trouble unless you 're a business that 's going to be writing a lot of checks and pay a lot of fees for the privilege a bank is not likely to want to make exceptions for you for your own custom printed checks written in ancient

in my opinion the average investor should not be buying individual stocks one reason why is that the average investor is not capable of reading financial statements and evaluating whether a stock is overpriced or underpriced as such they 're often tempted to make buy sell decisions based solely on the current value of a stock as compared to the price at which they bought it the real reasons to buy or sell a stock is the expectation of future growth of the company or continued profit and expected dividends if you are n't able to analyze a company 's financial statements and business plan then you really are n't in a position to evaluate that company 's stock price so instead of asking whether to sell based on a recent drop in stock price you should be investigating why the stock price is falling and deciding whether those reasons indicate a trend that you expect to continue   if you buy and sell stocks based solely on recent trends in the stock price you probably will end up buying stocks that have recently risen and selling stocks that have recently fallen in that case you are buying high and selling low which is a recipe for poor financial outcomes

it will not hurt your score to pay off your debt   it will allow your score to start healing as you plug the holes in your report what is crucial is how you pay off the debt   make sure you get in writing that paying $ x amount will fully satisfy the debt and will close the matter as in pay to delete   if you try to do a settlement this is very important also the moral brigade will not like my answer but if you are close to seven years out on your debts you might as well not pay them since they will fall off of your report after 7 years   if you pay any part of the debt however it will often reset the clock on those 7 years so tread carefully

a trust is a financial arrangement to put aside money over a period of time typically years for a specific purpose to benefit someone two purposes of trusts are 1 providing for retirement and 2 providing for a child or minor there are three parties to a trust 1 a grantor the person who establishes and funds a trust 2 a beneficiary a person who receives the benefits 3 a trustee someone who acts in a fiduciary capacity between the grantor and beneficiary no one person can be all three parties a single person can be two of out those three parties a retirement trust is something like an ira individual retirement account here a person can be both the grantor contributor to the ira and the beneficiary a after retirement but you need a bank or a broker to act as a fiduciary and to handle the reporting to the irs internal revenue service pension plans have employers as employees as beneficiaries and usually a third party as trustee a minors trust can be established under a gift to the minors act or other trust mechanisms such as a generation skipping trust here a parent may be both grantor and trustee although usually a third party is a trustee a sum of money is put aside over a period of years for the benefit of a minor for a college education or for the minor 's attaining a certain age a minimum of 18 sometimes 21 possibly 25 or even older depending on when the grantor feels that the minor is responsible enough to handle the money

very few people 's credit is worth $ 100,000 the average homeowner 's credit family of four with good to very good credit is worth about $ 30,000 this is a pure business decision the bank knew the law when they extended the mortgage to you and part of the amount they 're charging you goes to cover the risk that you might opt to walk away the mortgage was an agreement between you and the bank and it specified the penalty for you walking away taking the agreed upon penalty for an action specifically in the agreement is also keeping the agreement

i do n't think the advice to take lots more risk when young makes so much sense the additional returns from loading up on stocks are overblown and the rocky road from owning 75 100 stocks will almost certainly mess you up and make you lose money everyone thinks they 're different but none of us are one big advantage of stocks over bonds is tax efficiency only if you buy index funds and do n't ever sell them but this does not matter in a retirement account and outside a retirement account you can use tax exempt bonds stocks have higher returns in theory but to have a reasonable guarantee of higher returns from them you need around a 30-year horizon that is a long long time psychologically a 60/40 stocks bonds portfolio or something with similar risk mixing in a few more alternative assets like swenson 's is so much better with 100 stocks you can spend 10 or 15 years saving money and your investment returns may get you nowhere think what that does to your motivation to save and how much you save is way more important than what you invest in the same does n't happen with a balanced portfolio with a balanced portfolio you get reasonably steady progress you can still have a down year but you 're a lot less likely to have a down decade or even a down few years you save steadily and your balance goes up fairly steadily the way humans really work this is so important for the same kind of reason i think it 's great to buy one fund that has both stocks and bonds in there this forces you to view the thing as a whole instead of wrongly looking at the individual asset class buckets and it also means rebalancing will happen automatically without having to remember to do it which you wo n't or if you remember you wo n't do it when you should because stocks are doing so well or some other rationalization speaking of rebalancing that 's where a lot of the steady predictable returns come from if you have a nice balanced portfolio you can make money over time even if both asset classes end up going nowhere as long as they bounce around somewhat independently so you 'll buy low and sell high when you rebalance to me the ideal is an all in one fund that aims for about 60/40 stocks bonds level of risk somewhat more diversified than stocks bonds is great international stock commodities high yield reit etc you can just buy that at age 20 and keep it until you retire in beautiful ideal world economic theory buy 90 stocks when young real world with human brain involved i love balanced funds the steady gains are such a mental win the target retirement funds are not a bad option but if you buy the matching year for your age i personally wish they had less in stocks if you want to read more on the equity premium how much more you make from owning stocks here are a couple of posts on it from a blog i like update i wrote this up more comprehensively on my blog

from a purely analytical standpoint assuming you are investing your roth ira contributions in broad market securities such as the spdr s&p 500 etf which tracks the s&p 500 the broader market has historically had more upward movement than downward and therefore a dollar invested today will have a greater expected value than a dollar invested tomorrow   so from this perspective it is better to max out your roth on the first day of the contribution year and immediately invest in broad market or at least well diversified securities that being said opportunity costs must also be taken into account every dollar you use to fund your roth ira is a dollar that is no longer available to be invested elsewhere hence a lost opportunity   with this in mind if you are currently eligible for a 401k in which your employer matches some portion of your contributions it is generally advised that you contribute to the 401k up to the employer match   for example if your employer matches 75 of contributions up to 3.5 of your gross salary then it is advisable that you first contribute this 3.5 to your 401k before even considering contributing to a roth ira   the reasoning behind this is two fold first the employer match can be considered as a guaranteed return on investment so for example for an employer that matches 75 for every dollar you contribute you already have earned a 75 return up to the employer 's limit   secondly 401k contributions have tax implications not only is the money contributed to the 401k pre tax i.e. contributions are not taxed it also reduces your taxable income so the marginal tax benefit of these contributions must also be taken into account   keep in mind that in the usual circumstances 401k disbursements are taxable finally many financial advisors will also suggest establishing an emergency fund which is money that you will not use unless you suffer an emergency that has an impact on your normal income loss of job medical emergency etc   these funds are often kept in highly liquid accounts savings accounts money market funds etc so they can be accessed immediately when you run into one of life 's little surprises   generally it is advised that an emergency fund between $ is established asap and over time the emergency fund should be increased until it has reached a value equivalent to the sum of 8 months worth of expenses   if funding an ira is preventing you from working towards such an emergency fund then you may want to consider waiting on maxing out the ira before you have that ef established of course it goes without saying that credit card balances with aprs other than 0.00 or similar should be paid off before an ira is funded since while you can only hope to match the market at best between 10 15 a year in your ira investments paying down credit card balances is an instant return of whatever the apr is which usually tends to be between a 15 30 apr in a nutshell assuming you are maxing out your 401k if applicable have an emergency fund established are not carrying any high apr credit card balances and are able to do so historical price movements in the markets suggest that funding your roth ira upfront and investing these funds immediately in a broadly diversified portfolio will yield a higher expected return than funding the account periodically throughout the year using dollar cost averaging or similar strategies   if this is not the case take some time to consider the opportunity costs you are incurring from not fully contributing to your 401k carrying high credit card balances or not having a sufficient emergency fund established this is not financial advice specific to any individual and your mileage may vary   consider consulting a certified financial planner certified public accountant etc before making any major financial decisions

the default of the country will affect the country obligations and what 's tied to it if you have treasury bonds for example they 'll get hit if you have cash currency it will get hit if you 're invested in the stock market however it may plunge but will recover and in the long run you wo n't get hit if you 're invested in foreign countries through foreign currency or foreign stocks that you hold then the default of your local government may have less affect there if at all what you should not in my humble opinion be doing is digging holes in the ground or probably not exchange all your cash for gold although it is considered   a safe anchor in case of monetary crisis so may be worth considering some diversifying your portfolio with some gold splitting between banks might not make any difference at all because the value wo n't change unless you think that one of the banks will fail then just close the account there the bottom line is that the key is diversifying and you do n't have to be a seasoned investor for that i 'm sure there are mutual funds in greece just pick several different funds from several different companies that provide diversified investment and put your money there

assuming that no one else has hit the ask and the asks are still there yes you will fill $ as long as you did n't exhaust that ask actually there is no current price at which the stock is exchanging hands in reality it is the last price traded the somebody who negotiated prices between buyers sellers is the exchange through their handling of bids asks   the real negotiation comes between bids asks and if they meet or cross a trade occurs it 's not that both bid ask should be $ it 's that they were to answer the title the reasons why the bid and ask even their midpoint move away from the last price are largely unknown but at least for the market makers if their sell inventory is going away people are buying heavily and they 're running out of inventory they will start to hike up their asks a lot and their bids a little because market makers try to stay market neutral having no opinion on whether an asset will rise or fall so with stocks that means having a balanced inventory of longs shorts   they want to sometimes have to depending on the exchange accommodate the buying pressure but they do n't want to lose money so they simply raise the ask and then raise the bid as people hit their asks since their average cost basis has risen in fact yahoo finance is great about showing this there 's rarely 1 bid and 1 ask   take a look at bac 's limit book you can see that there are many bids and many asks   if one ask is exhausted the next in line is now the highest   the market maker who just sold at x will certainly step over the highest bid to bid at to get an 11 return on investment

your best course of action is to gather your paperwork ask around your personal network for a recommendation for a good cpa and pay that person to do your taxes business and personal   read through the completed package and have them walk you through every item you do not understand   i would continue doing this until you feel confident that you can file for yourself   even then the first couple of times i did my own i 'd pay them to review my work   assuming you find a cpa with reasonable fees they will likely point out tax inefficiencies in the way you do your business which will more than pay for their fees    it can be like a point of honor for cpas to ensure that their customers get their money 's worth in this way   not saying all cpas work this way but to me this would be a criteria for one that i would recommend

former financial analyst here happy to help you first off you are right to not be entirely trusting of advisors and attorneys they are usually trustworthy but not always and when you are new to this the untrustworthy ones have a habit of reaching you first you 're their target market i 'll give you a little breakdown of how to plan and a starting investment first figure out your future expenses a lot of that money may go to medical bills or associated care do n't forget the costs of modifications and customizations to items so you can have a better quality of life cars can be retrofit to assist you with a you can build a chair lift into a things like that which will be important for mobility all depending on the lingering medical conditions mobility and independence will be critically important for you your past expenses are the best predictor of future expenses so filter out the one time legal and medical costs and use those to predict second for investing there is a simple route to get into the stock market and hopefully you will hear it a lot exchange traded funds etfs you 'll hear the s&p 500 increased by 80 points today on the news the s&p is a combination of 500 different stocks and is used to gauge the market overall you can buy an exchange traded fund as a stock and it 's an investment in all those components there 's an etf for almost anything but the most popular ones are for those big indexes i would suggest putting a few hundred thousand into an s&p 500 indexed etf do it at maybe $ 10,000 per month so you spread the money out and ensure you do n't buy at a market peak and then let it sit there for many years you can buy stocks through online brokerages like scottrade or etrade and they make it fairly easy they even have local offices that you can visit for help stocks are the easiest way to invest once you 've done this you can also open a ira a type of retirement account with special tax benefits and contribute several thousand dollars to it per year i 'll be happy to give more advice if when you need it but there are a number of good books for beginning investors that can explain it better than i. i would suggest that you avoid real estate especially if you expect to move overseas as it is significantly more complicated and has maintenance costs and taxes

normally yes kind of i do n't personally think in terms of generating profit when making business it purchasing decisions i merely think in terms of adding value    but in the context of the article    you buy a technology consider well whether it is going to increase your revenues or decrease your costs if it would not then there is no point buying it       a dr bc facility will never generate profit it will hopefully allow you to continue generating the profit you were generating any way should shit go bad but even then your costs are likely to go up    so when i say kind of i mean you 're right in that profit can mean more than numbers on a balance sheet but the writer of the article seems to present profit in those black and white terms the article appears to advocate something that is not particularly good practice but deems to call it so

total capital this is a very old fashioned term that really is mostly only used in the finance industry today like when everyone was obsessed with bank capital total capital = preferred equity + common equity + liabilities true blue preferred shares are almost only used by financial companies banks specifically   the more modern ones that convert to common are used by all other companies notes payable this is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in generally accepted account principles gaap the oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date    this has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal interest    a bank note like a one dollar bill is a note that pays something in this case one dollar never technically the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract   while it pays one dollar it never pays it back so it has a constant value of one dollar   the constant nature inflation notwithstanding is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange gaap has taken its own definition to mean any debt payable within 12 months as it is a current < 12 months liability

you talk about an individual not being advised to sell or purchase in response to trends in the market in such a buy and hold strategy but think of this for a moment you buy stock abc for $ 10 when both the market as a whole and stock abc are near the bottom of a bear market as say part of a value buying strategy you 've now held stock abc for a number of years and it is performing well hitting $ 50 there is all good news about stock abc profit increases year after year in double digits would you consider selling this stock just because it has increased 400 it could start falling in a general market crash or it could keep going up to $ 100 or more maybe a better strategy to sell abc would be to place a trailing stop of say 20 on the highest price reached by the stock so if abc falls say in a general market correction by less than 20 off its high and then rebounds and goes higher you keep it if abc however falls by more than 20 off its high you automatically sell it with your stop loss order you may give 20 back to the market if the market or the stock crashes but if the stock continues going up you benefit from more upside in the price take aapl as an example if you bought aapl in march 2009 after the gfc for about $ 100 would you have sold it in december 2011 when it hit $ 400 if you did you would have left money on the table if instead you placed a trailing stop loss on aapl of 20 you would have been still in it when it hit its high of $ in september 2012 you would have finally been stopped out in november 2012 for around the $ 560 mark and made an extra $ 160 per share and if your thinking how about if i decided to sell aapl at $ 700 well i do n't think many would have picked $ 700 as the high in hindsight the main benefit of using stop losses is that it takes your emotions out of your trading especially your exits

if businesses can not turn a profit while paying for a healthy minimum wage they are bad for the economy and deserve to die wages are a business expense and must be allowed to react to the factors that naturally shift that expense subsidizing businesses by keeping wages low hurts the economy in the long run by reducing the ability people have to buy goods and services labor is not the only cost a business incurs and increasing wages does not correlate to a 1:1 price increase

this is a classic correlation does not imply causation situation   there are at least three issues at play in this question if you are or day trading then the first and second issues can definitely affect your trading   a higher price higher volume stock will have smaller percentage volatility fluctuations within a very small period of time however in general and especially when holding any position for any period of time during which unknowns can become known such as netflix 's customer loss announcement it is a mistake to feel safe based on price alone when considering longer term investments even weeks or months and if you were to compare penny stocks with blue chip stocks you still might find more stability in the higher value stocks   this is a correlation alone in other words a stable reliable stock probably has a relatively high price but a high price does not mean it 's reliable as joe said the stock of any company that is exposed to significant risks can drop or rise by large amounts suddenly and it is common for blue chip stocks to move significantly in a period of months as changes in the market or the company itself manifest themselves the last thing to remember when you are looking at raw dollar amounts is to remember to look at shares outstanding   netflix has a price of $ 79 to ford 's $ 12 yet ford has a larger market cap because there are nearly 4 billion shares compared to netflix 's 52 m

nothing is guaranteed candlesticks are not crystal balls nor is any part of technical analysis candlestick patterns used correctly and in combination with other western technical indicators can increase the probability of a trade going into the derived direction but they are not a guarantee which is why you should always use stop losses with your candlestick or any trading in saying that another candlestick pattern that can provide high probability trades is the doji or a combination of in a row at a market extreme note that both patterns and work best at price extremes highs and lows and in combination with other technical indicators such as an overbought momentum indicator at a market high or an oversold momentum indicator at a market low edit an example here is a sample trade i placed on the 17th october and am currently in profit on see the chart below as it shows taking the trade on the open of the following day after a bullish pattern appeared at the bottom of a downtrend on the 16th in combination with the slow stochastic crossing over in the oversold region below 20 i would consider this a high probability trade and have placed an initial stop loss at 10 below my open price in case the trade went against me as the price moved up i moved the 10 stop loss up as a trailing stop loss my profit target is set at 25 or $ 4.00

none of what i say is advice directed to you it is how i would continue to analyse the situation you have were it mine first off i prefer to work in more than possibilities   saying that paying down the mortgage makes sense as i can calculate the amount i will save i also believe that rate rises are coming in the future based on the talk from the so any money i pay off now means guaranteed less interest to pay in the future also the lower my loan to value ratio the better lower interest rates i can receive in the mortgage market if i do not want to work until retirement age it 'd be nice to have as few bills as possible in the decade or so prior to retirement age i could then do early retirement or part time work in the run up to retirement i could use my savings to fund life until retirement pays out i 'd be aiming to put 15 of my gross income into future investing using isas to build up a savings pot taking advantage of retirement products that way all the money is not tied to a normal retirement age before it can accessed and it 's not by future greedy government taxation any income leftover above the 15 i 'd be throwing at the mortgage taking advantage of the 10 overpay window remortgaging as ltv comes down in theory overpaid mortgage equity is money that could still be accessed provided house prices do n't decline and remortgaging is a possibility so in short i 'd follow a plan along these lines of logic 1 make sure i have 4 6 months of living expenses as a rainy day fund insulate myself from fluctuations in my financial situation 2 put away 15 of annual gross income towards future saving isas first pension second 3 overpay the mortgage and look to remortgage as ltv drops when ltv 60 look to lock in to a longer term fix eg 2 year fixes at 90 ltv 5 year fixes at 60 4 reassess steps 2 3 as life happens circumstances change work fluctuates etc 5 once the mortgage is paid off build as much wealth as possible isas first then non tax efficient savings products aim for keeping expenses down and raising my savings rate as much as possible your analysis was thorough and shows you are thinking through consequences never forget to factor in the risk of carrying debt having no low debt as you get older means there 's more income left to build wealth ignore the american view of carrying debt for life and trusting investments to outperform the debt you have to pay monthly to keep that debt around and it ai n't a pet

there are two reasons leases are generally a worse deal than buying first inherent in the lease is the concept of trading in the car at the end of the lease term as we all know cars depreciate the most in the first year or two by repeatedly leasing cars on short time frames you own the vehicles during those most expensive years of course there 's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing when buying be it via cash or loan but leasing builds in a schedule and encourages you to stick to it second it is easier for the dealer salesperson to hide things from the consumer in a lease contract most salespeople will try to get a car purchaser to focus on the monthly payment or they 'll four box the purchaser but even then there 's only 4 numbers and most consumers have a rough idea what they are and what they mean but in a lease the numbers in question are renamed and price becomes capitalized cost interest rate becomes money factor and is divided by 2400 making it look really small and not easily without a calculator or pencil and paper down payment becomes a capitalized cost reduction there 's a new concept residual value neither of those reasons change when interest rate is lower

what i 've found works best when working on my personal budget is to track my income and spending two different ways bank accounts and budget categories here is what i mean when i deposit my paycheck i do two things with it it goes into my checking account so the balance of my checking account goes up by the amount of my paycheck i also deposit the money from my checking account into my various budget category balances   this is separate from my bank account balances   some of my paycheck money goes into my groceries category some goes into clothing some into car fuel entertainment mortgage phone etc   some goes into longer range bills that only happen once or twice a year such as car insurance life insurance property tax etc   some goes into savings goals of ours such as car replacement vacation furniture etc every dollar that we have in a bank account or in cash in our wallets is also accounted for in a budget category   if you add up the balances of our bank accounts and cash and you add up the balances of our budget categories they add up to the same number when we make a purchase this also gets accounted for twice the appropriate bank account or cash wallet balance gets reduced by the purchase amount the appropriate budget category gets reduced by the purchase amount in this way we do n't really need to worry about having separate bank accounts for different purposes   we do n't need to put our savings goal money in a separate bank account from our grocery money if we do n't want to   the budget category accounting keeps track of how much money is allocated to each purpose    now the budget category amounts are not spent yet the money in them is still in our bank account and we can move money around in the categories if we change our mind on how to allocate them   for example if we do n't spend all of our gas money for the month we can either keep that money in the gas category or we can move it to a different category such as the car replacement category or the vacation category   if the phone bill is more than we expect we can move money around from a different category to cover it now back to your question we allocate some money from each paycheck into our furniture category   but the money is not really spent until we actually buy some furniture   when we do the furniture category balance and bank account balance both go down by the amount of the purchase all of this can be kept track of on the computer in a spreadsheet   however it 's not easy to keep track of so many categories and bank balances   an easier solution is custom budgeting software designed for this purpose   i use and recommend ynab

first one would not want to be the guarantor as it would likely appear as a debt on their credit in some cases this can be good but not always   i 'd suggest a homeowners meeting a reverse auction where you say would anyone like to get the condo fee waived for 12 months in return for guaranteeing the loan if no hands go up you have an issue but if even one hand goes up you have the guarantor then you ask if there are any objections anyone who objects is welcome to bid fewer say 10 months ideally you see a dozen hands go up and you just count down until one one remains when i lived in a condo the fee was $ 250 if i were one of the older residents who planned to stay i 'd do it for one or two month 's fees

there 's a big difference between the 2 scenarios apple does n't have any liability of one of their devices is used for criminal purposes and that was n't even the situation apple was asked to unlock a phone so the fbi could look for potential information   db however has a legal and ethical obligation to prevent it 's services being used for money laundering and other criminal behavior this included internal controls and audits on customer activity the house democrats asked if these controls were performed on trump 's accounts and what the outcome of their audit was a request that is well within the house 's scope if republicans signed on to the inquiry the house could subpoena the information and it would carry the force of law   the only way this would be remotely analogous to the apple scenario is if apple was legally required to routinely read your emails to make sure you were n't a terrorist and the fbi requested an accounting of whether that particular terrorist 's emails had been read if apple had denied a request like that it 's unlikely that pr would have been so favorable to them   edit and it was the san 's phone

if you invest in a 401(k the shares in that plan are yours for as long as you live or until you pull them out so if the employer is offering any sort of matching and those matched funds remain yours after you leave then definitely contribute that 's an immediate return on your money if the employer is not matching funds then usually it is better to contribute to an ira instead you get the same income tax benefits from the deduction without the headaches of going through your company or the company from 3 jobs ago or whoever bought them to get to your money if i were in your position the most i personally would do after i quit the company which i 'm assuming you 'd be doing if you were going back to your country of origin would be to have the 401k shares rolled over into a traditional ira that way i 'd have more control over it from outside the country just keep the bank holding your ira of your movements around the world and how they can get ahold of you it may be wise to grant a limited power of attorney to someone who will be staying in the u.s. if you do n't want the bank mailing your statements all around the world and the money can stay in an american account while you do whatever you have to outside it as long as you do n't take the money out in cash before you 're 59 1/2 years old you do n't need to pay taxes or penalties on it if you were to need it to cover unexpected expenses perhaps relating to the aforementioned family emergency then that decision can be made at that time if you think that 's even remotely likely you may consider a roth ira with a roth you pay the income taxes on your contributions but the money is then yours you can withdraw anything up to the total amount of your contributions without any additional taxes or penalties and once you hit 59 and a half the interest also becomes available also and free so if you had to leave the country and take a lot of cash with you you could get out everything you actually put into a roth with only minor if any transaction fees and the interest will still be there compounding

gt let 's just say the insurance industry knows a lot more about underwriting than you do   i 'm sorry but that is a meaningless statement i work in insurance first as a consultant before retiring to work in insurance distribution a few years ago and i know that our industry frequently uses flawed or outdated methodologies due to the simple fact that insurance companies are very conservative and very resistant to change when it comes to changes to their core business unless you can show a direct negative impact on the bottom line caused by the currently used method you are unlikely to make any changes at all in this case if the entire us car insurance industry is using the same flawed system it wo n't affect a single company if they also stick to it    until 1996 before the current system was introduced insurance companies in germany used to rate liability insurance for cars almost exclusively by engine power output the industry had known that this method was fundamentally flawed since at least the late 1980s comprehensive and partial coverage had been rated by the new system for a few years at this point which had also taken years to work out but it took additional years of planning negotiations and cooperation by the entire industry to change to the new system for liability    so please do not ever assume that the insurance companies are the experts they know what they are doing it might very well be the case that they are stuck with flawed outdated systems simply because there is no sufficiently strong impulse to change what they do    the current tesla rate adjustment situation is a wonderful example of this it took aaa 5 years since the model s first came out to realise that their initial estimate was wrong it seems unlikely that the accident rate or repair costs have suddenly changed over the last year and take appropriate actions by late 2013 there were easily enough teslas on the road about 20,000 to get data yet nothing happened for nearly another 4 years

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

i think you have a really good idea kudos to it it will be difficult to break eve and while you stressed the fact that you are ready to part with this money it would be interesting for you not to part with this money just for the sake of trading you will be frustrated because you are winning and breaking even or even losing money in the process think about that for somebody with limited experience the derivatives market carries a very high risk also as everything in this matters carries high or very high yield trading futures on margin can actually work but i think you will need a bit more money check the mini contracts of infinity futures and calculate the commissions you will be paying more for a contract yes you will need more money for your maintenance margin yes but if you day trade and you have a broker this will be substantially lower gold contracts pay about 10 to 1 so a mini contract of 33 ounces will pay you 33 dollars per 1 dollar move your commissions will be about usd in a discount broker and you will need to pay some exchange house fees maybe about 15 of your trade will be fees check the contract specs and costs as somebody said before they would n't recommend trading on margin but with an account of that side i would n't know anything else trading physical gold on margin could also be an option just my 2 cents

right but there were tangible reasons that made sense that was fueled by a cycle of predatory loans and consumers being dumb enough to think that just because they got approved for a $ 500 k house with a 500 credit score meant they should definitely take out massive loans and buy it this was piled on by the derivative market specifically credit default swaps which certain people recognized as creating a liquidity issue they did n't know when the crash was going to occur they just knew that the asset bubble fueled by massive debt with this debt being falsely rated as aaa when most of it was junk left banks in a position of complete insolvency when the mortgage defaults reached a certain point when people realized the extent of the debt e.g. knowing with common sense that people with a 550 credit score should n't have 7 properties and be allowed to be that over leveraged let alone be rated aaa and the amount of derivatives that would have to be paid out on top of having no cash flow due to mortgage defaults they recognized that a bubble bursting would wreak havoc on the economy        that had a lot of moving parts simply saying overvalued record highs crash coming soon when how is fucking stupid nobody knows what evidence did op offer not that he would n't still get laughed out because this topic is fucking annoying with thousands of people crying overvalued but he did n't even mention p e ratio or anything he literally came in and basically said when is it all gon na fall apart nobody knows the answer

it definitely depends on the exchange you are trading on i 'm not familiar with scottrade but a standard practice is to fulfill limit orders in the order they are placed    most of the time you would n't see stocks trade significantly under your bid price but since penny stocks are very volatile it 's more likely their price could drop quickly past your bid and then return above it while only fulfilling a portion of the orders placed example 1 penny stock priced at $ 0.12 2 others place limit orders to buy at $ 0.10 3 you place limit order to buy at $ 0.10 4 stock price drops to $ 0.07 and some orders are filled anything $ 0.07 or higher based on a first come first served basis 5 due to the increase in purchases of the penny stock the price rises above $ 0.10 before your order is filled edit adding additional clarification from comment section a second example if the price drops from $ 0.12 to $ 0.07 then orders for all prices from $ 0.07 and above will start to be filled from the oldest order first that might mean that the oldest order was a limit buy order for 100 shares at $ 0.09 and since that is above the current ask price it will be filled first the next order might be for 800 shares at $ 0.07 it 's possible for a subset of these to be filled let 's say 400 before the share 's price increases from the increased demand then if the price goes above $ 0.10 your bid will not be filled during that time

i say this with all due understanding if they 're only there for the money if that 's what motivates them i do n't want them in the government we are better off without them really   maybe i confused things by saying bubble because it is n't just that but i do n't want the attitude that because one is educated or powerful one is deserving of better   i understand that you might not be saying that and you might be saying let 's use them well but alas this is too subtle a line and too easy to slip   if big dollars hinge on a particular situation being optimized let a manager make a case by case exception but the norm is not that   and by the mindset leads to a creeping overall theory that government needs to insulate itself from its own effects   it 's presumably why congress gets its own health care because these people are too important to be sick but then in having done that we reduce the pressure to make it work for everyone i 'm sorry i just do n't agree it 's a legitimate position you stake out clearly presented i am just not buying it

go to your local bank or credit union before talking to a dealership ask them if putting both names on the loan makes a difference regarding rates and maximum loan you qualify for ask them to run the loan application both ways having both names on the loan helps build the credit of the spouse that has a lower score     you may find that both incomes are needed for a car loan if the couple has a mortgage or other joint obligations the lender will treat the entire mortgage payment or rent payment as a liability against the person applying for the loan they wo n't split the housing payment in half if only one name will be on the car loan therefore sometimes the 2nd persons income is needed even if their credit is not as good that additional income without a significant increase in liabilities can make a huge difference regarding the loan they can qualify for once the car is in your possession it does n't matter who drives it in general the insurance company will put both spouses as authorized drivers note it is almost always better to ask your bank or credit union about a car loan before going to the dealership that gives you a solid data point regarding a loan and removes a major complexity to the negotiations at the dealership

stop loss orders are the exact opposite of what you should be doing if you are implementing a long term buy and hold strategy the motivation of a buy and hold strategy is that in the long term the market rises even despite the occasional crash or recession setting a stop loss simply increases the probability that you will sell for a low price in a temporary market downturn unless you are likely to need near term liquidity in which case you 're not a long term investor that makes no sense

i am glad they are going away malls are an environmental tragedy    are the product or maybe even part of the cause of suburban sprawl they encourage car usage and by virtue of their need for large open areas to be constructed are often far from where most people work and live as a result patrons have to drive large distances from their houses jobs to the shopping centers    2 the parking lots are tremendous waste of space and hugely damage the studies environment transportation parking environmental impacts development policies research roundup     3 online shopping is much better for the environment as the product can be shipped directly to the consumer    4 once they are built and then closed the space where the centers sat is basically abandoned and turns into blight depending on the businesses that were housed in the mall and the businesses that were supported by the mail especially gas stations these sites could be toxic    i am sure there are more reasons why malls are environmentally harmful but those are a few off the top of my head

generally investing in index tracking funds in the long term poses relatively low risk compared to short term investment aka speculation no one says differently however it is a higher risk than money market savings bonds the reason for that is that the return is not guaranteed and loss is not limited here volatility plays part as well as general market conditions although the volatility risk also affects bonds at some level as well while long term trend may be upwards short term trend may be significantly different take as an example year 2008 for s&p500 if by any chance you needed to liquidate your investment in november 2008 after investing in november 1998 you might have ended up with 0 gain or even loss had you waited just another year or liquidated a year earlier the result would be significantly different that 's the volatility risk you do n't invest indefinitely even when you invest long term at some point you 'll have to liquidate your investment higher volatility means that there 's a higher chance of downward spike just at that point of time killing your gains even if the general trend over the period around that point of time was upward as it was for s&p500 for example for the period 1998 2014 with the significant downward spikes in 2003 and 2008 if you invest in major indexes these kinds of risks are hard to avoid as they 're all tied together so you need to diversify between different kinds of investments bonds vs stocks as the books parrot and/or different markets not only us but also foreign

although this is n't related to homes directly as an it professional i know that wind power tends to be cost effective to the point that many data centers the massive buildings holding the servers that are the backbone of the internet actually invest in their own wind turbines to slash costs since servers tend to be power as far as going off the grid that ultimately depends on how much wind sun you 're getting at your residence but if you look at places like dallas pa ca and other areas where   the major hosts place centers they 're typically in areas where there 's plenty of sunlight or wind going back to small scale thinking however one of my contacts actually leases a building in pa where he has a few server racks and while he currently has electric there he also owns a couple of turbines which have been < 60 of the demand and he 's actually planning to add solar and also feed that back to the grid at a profit so overall wind solar definitely has the potential for a decent roi at both large and small levels but performance will vary greatly from area to area   i know that lowes actually started advertising about carrying solar panels so going in and asking about the performance and if you can arrange an audit of your home might be a good place to start if you google green audits i 'm sure you can find a trillion companies specializing in green power but as with any sales rep including at lowe 's i 'd do some due diligence so you do n't get taken for a ride and also to check references because i do n't think green audit companies have any official certifications standards

i 'm going to assume that you will spend the money to fix the mold problem correctly   using your numbers after that is done the home is worth perhaps $ 280k to evaluate whether or not to sell the amount you have spent on the house is irrelevant the only thing you need to ask yourself is this would i spend $ 280k to buy this house today you might if you were happy with the rental income that you were getting if the house is fully rented it earns you $ 24k year which is an 8.6 return if you had purchased the house today at $ 280k of course you will have vacancies taxes and other expenses bringing that return number down figure out what that is and see if you are happy with the return based on those numbers   if you decide it would be a bad investment for you at $ 280k then sell the house   by the way this question works for any investment not just real estate when deciding whether or not to sell stock the same thing applies it is irrelevant what your cost basis is you only need to ask yourself if the stock would be a good buy for you at the current price

what 's the primary factor keeping a consumer from handing out fees as as corporations or small businesses do power can an individual or more appropriately what keeps an individual from being able to charge fine or penalize a business if it could be accomplished but at a high cost let 's assume it 's based on principal and not monetary gain and have a legal entitlement to money back   no   you are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like $ 50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around but there 's no legal obligation for him to pay up unless he signed a contract stating that he would do so corporations also can not simply send you a fine or fee and expect you to pay it you must have either agreed to pay it in the past or now agree to pay it in exchange for something in these cases the corporations have the power you have to agree to their rules to play ball    however consumers do have a significant power as well in well competed markets the power to do business with someone else   you do n't like the fee   buy from amazon which offers free shipping on returns   you do n't like paying a no show fee from the doctor   find a doctor without one or with a more forgiving fee or with a low enough that you do n't have to make appointments early   your ability to fine them exists as your ability to not continue to patronize them in some markets though consumers do n't have a lot of power for example cable television or other utilities the fcc has a list of customer service standards which cable companies are required to meet and many states have additional rules requiring penalties for missed or late appointments tougher than that    and in the case of the doctor if your doctor is late find one that is   or try sending him a bill   it does apparently work from time to time particularly if the doctor wants to keep your business

allen welcome to money se you 've stumbled into the issue of debt snowball which is the low balance method of paying off debt the other being high interest i absolutely agree that when one has a pile of cards say a dozen there is a psychological benefit to paying off the low balances and knocking off card after card i am not dismissive of that motivation personal finance has that first word personal and one size rarely fits all for those who are numbers oriented it 's worth doing the math a simple spreadsheet showing the cost of the ds vs paying by rate   if that cost is even a couple hundred dollars i 'll still concede that one less payment envelope stamp etc favors the ds method on the other hand there 's the debt so large that the best payoff is 2 or 3 years away during that time $ 10000 paid toward the 24 card is saving you $ vs the $ 500 if paid toward 5 debt hard core do n't even want to discuss the numbers strangely enough   in your case you do n't have a pile of anything the mortgage is n't even up for discussion you have just 2 car loans send the $ 11,000 to the $ 19 k loan carrying the 2.5 this will save you $ 500 over the next 2 years vs paying the zero loan down once you 've done that the remaining $ 8000 will become your lowest balance and you should flip to the debt snowball method which will keep you paying that debt off   ds is a tool that should be pulled out for the masses the radio audience that the david dave ramsey radio show host appeals to they may comprise the majority of those with high credit card debt and have greatest success using this method but you exhibit none of their symptoms and are best served by the math by bringing up the topic here you 've found yourself in the same situation as the guy who happens to order a white wine at a wedding and finds his cousin offering to take him to an aa meeting the next day   in past articles on this decision i 've referenced a spreadsheet one can download it offers an easy way to see your choice without writing your own excel doc for the situation described here the low balance total interest is $ vs $ for the higher interest not quite the $ 500 difference i estimated the $ 350 difference is low due to the small rate difference and relatively short payoffs in my opinion knowledge is power and you can decide either way what 's important is that if you pay off the zero interest first you can say i knew it was a $ 350 difference but i 'd rather have just one outstanding loan for the remain time my issue with ds is when it 's like a religion and followers are told to not even run the numbers i wrote an article thinking about dave ramsey a number of years back but the topic never gets old

i bought health insurance for myself after a period without it and my premiums were not terrible i was a 27 year old man living in california no preexisting conditions and i paid approximately 90 $ a month this was for a standard health insurance plan   however when i moved back to ny a little while later insurance companies wanted almost $ 500/month for catastrophic coverage   so from personal experience my answer is that price varies widely by state different states have different regulations as to what health insurance companies need to cover and at what price in ny health insurance companies ca n't charge different rates according to age also in ny there is a price spiral where the price is so high few people buy it so they have to raise the price because not enough well people are in the pool so fewer people buy it to test it out go to an online insurance broker like and put in your proposed information including that you have n't been covered for a period this way you will know

first of all one thing that is very important match is always better than no match   so you should definitely use that match on your hsa if you 've already maxed out the company match on your 401(k   in fact for most people there wo n't be much reason to invest in your 401(k above the company match at all if for example your company matches only up to 5 and you want to invest 15 of income into retirement you ought to open an ira instead roth or standard depending on your situation and put the extra 10 in there beyond that you 're right hsa 's the accounts themselves have all the benefits of a 401(k   i would n't invest there for retirement instead an ira though   there is just no reason the only built in downside of an hsa is the hdhp attachment which may be undesirable to some employees or in certain situations if you want to get down to raw dollar figures and your company is offering both a standard health plan and a the calculation will be dependent on the premiums and benefits of each and your projected costs of your health care which is always a crystal ball estimation anyway   those costs and benefits can vary wildly from a completely obvious choice on either the hdhp or standard plan or pretty much a wash where you decide based on your comfort level with a high deductible to illustrate standard plan your company might offer a standard plan that costs you $ 100 out of pocket for an individual   that means you pay a minimum of $ 1200 a year for health care   most plans will have copays a flat amount like $ 15 you pay for standard doctor consultations a deductible you pay 100 of fees up to this co pays do n't count a percentage you pay beyond the deductible 20 is typical and a maximum like $ 1000 per individual per year beyond this up to a lifetime maximum benefit of like $ 2 million you wo n't be charged anything in a standard plan where you have no expenses you might pay $ 1200 a year plus a couple co pays for a total of $   in a bad year with surgery you might max out so $ 1200 + $ 30 + $ 1000 = $ hdhp hsa these plans are very different   you might still pay a premium i.e. $ 30 a month   they will still have a deductible and maximum but they might be the same amount   you will probably not have copays i did n't when i had one but i could be wrong which means a standard doctor visit will cost more like $ 80 100 in a good year this will mean that you pocket $ 500 from your company but pay back $ 360 in premiums   a couple doctor visits would mean there 's only $ 300 left in your account at the end of the year   but that 's still a net cost of only $ 60 compared to $   big win in a bad year you would end up out of pocket the max say $ 2000 plus premiums minus the $ 500 for a total of $ 1860   in this case still better than the standard plan the important difference will come in an in between year   you will reach the max quicker on an hdhp than you will on a standard plan   with a family where all of these numbers are higher and you have more people to be getting sick injured this might make the standard plan a better benefit however since whatever you build up in an hsa account stays with you forever while you 're single and have only your own health to be concerned about that is probably a good choice   when you have a family things might change and you switch to a standard plan but you still have that war chest to offset copays and hospital visits in future years i was forced onto an hsa for 2 years with a smaller company   they had a really good contribution $ 2500 if i remember right and we saved up big time later when my wife was pregnant we were on a low deductible standard plan and paid all our fees out of the hsa   it worked out great i say as long as the averaged yearly expected costs make sense after doing calculations illustrated above go for it

in reality shareholders have very few rights other than the right to profits and the right to vote on a board   in general a proxy fight to replace the board is complicated and expensive so unless the interested parties buy close to 50 of the shares it 's unlikely to be successful   furthermore a lot of the shares are held by insiders and institutions     i suppose if a large group of shareholders got together and demanded this the existing directors may listen and give in to avoid unhappy shareholders being a general annoyance   that seems pretty unlikely unless the stake gets large   there 's a great episode of npr planet money board sections games which talks about one man 's struggle to get the company to take some action

in most cases of fraud your liability is limited to $ 50 if you report it within certain number of days i think 2 after that the liability grows to something like $ 500 you are covered even if your negligence has caused the breach in addition visa guarantees credit cards in most cases you have 0 liability finally checking savings accounts are fdic insured up to $ 250,000 in case the bank goes bankrupt the $ 250,000 is a total for all accounts at the given bank it 's up to   you to report and ask for refund though and sometimes you have to jump through hoops to get it but usually it 's fairly straightforward and it usually takes only 2 or 3 days

i am admittedly not giving a scientific or mathematical analysis here just giving my anecdotal take on what i 've lived through i do n't know if my assessment of tripled is even accurate just that there 's a palpable sense of things being a lot more expensive amp it just seems to me that the cost of living has gone up quite a bit for average people from what it once was especially considering most of us now have cable bills internet costs and in my case several different cell phone bills for different members of the family i realize these are not necessities but they are important things that most people are now expected to have i did n't mean to imply that we 've had insane inflation amp i understand that these things are mathematically measured as both core inflation and cpi and by these measures things have held pretty steady it just seems to me that these sorts of indexes have not yet taken a lot of things into account regarding the realities of modern day living and their resultant expenses

think about the credit card business model they have two revenue generators interest and fees from borrowers and commissions and fees to merchants the key to a successful credit card is to both sign up lots of borrowers and lots of merchants credit card fortunes have improved dramatically since the 1990 's when formerly off limits merchants like grocery stores began to accept cards so when a credit card lets you just pull cash out of any atm there are a few costs they need to account for when pricing the cost for such a service credit card banks have managed to make cash advances both a profit center and a self serving perk knowing that you can always draw upon your credit line for an emergency when cash is necessary makes you less likely to actually carry cash and more likely to just rely on your credit card

i would not classify utilities including electric as additional fees   in many cases you interact directly with the utility not the landlord and pay for what you use   there are exceptions like when renting a room the renter 's insurance also is not part of the landlord 's profit it is simply there to protect you   in the case of loss the landlord can not insure your property you have to provide your own insurance   its pretty low costs typically less than 20 per month the application fee is typical    the move in fee is something that could be negotiated away and sounds pretty sketchy    you can always let your fingers do the walking and find out the fees before you look at the place

probably not though there are a few things to be said for understanding what you are doing here   primerica acts as an independent financial services firm and thus has various partners that specialize in various financial instruments and thus there may exist other firms that primerica does n't use that could offer better products   now how much do you want to value your time as it could take more than a few months to go through every possible insurance firm and broker to see what rate you could get for the specific insurance you want   there is also the question of what constitutes best here   is it paying the minimal premiums before getting a payout   that would be my interpretation though this requires some amazing guesswork to know when to start paying a policy to pay out so quickly that the insurance company takes a major loss on the policy similarly there are thousands of mutual funds out there and it is incredibly difficult to determine which ones would be best for your situation   how much risk do you want to take   how often do you plan to add to it   what kind of accounts are you using for these investments e.g. iras or just regular taxable accounts   do tax implications of the investments matter thus i 'd likely want to suggest you consider this question how much trust do you have that this company will work well for you in handling the duty of managing your investments and insurance needs   if you trust them then buy what they suggest   if you do n't then buy somewhere else but be careful about what kind of price are you prepared to pay to find the mythical best as those usually only become clear in hindsight when it comes to trusting a company in case there are more than a few factors i 'd likely use questions how well do they answer your questions or concerns from your perspective   do you feel that these are being treated with respect or do you get the feeling they want to say what the heck are you thinking for asking that in a kind of perspective structure of meeting do you like to have an agenda and things all planned out or are you more of the we 'll figure it out kind of person   this is about how well do they know you and set things up to suit you well tone of talk do you feel valued in having these conversations and working through various exercises with the representative   this is kind of like 1 though it would include requests they have for you employee turnover how long has this person been with primerica   do they generally lose people frequently   are you ok with your file being passed around like a hot potato   not that it necessarily will but just consider the possibility here reputation can be a factor though i 'd not really use it much as some people can find those bad apples that are n't there anymore and so it is n't an issue now   in some ways you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you   there are more than a few companies that want to get a piece of what you 'll invest buy and use when it comes to financial products so it may be a good idea to shop around a little

the short answer probably not much   unless you have a controlling interest in the company   if at least of the shareholder votes are in favor of the dilution then it can be done   there are some sec rules that should protect against corporate looting and theft like what the side is trying to make it appear as happened however it would appear that did something stupid   he signed away all of his voting right to someone who would use them to make his rights basically worthless   had he kept his head in the game he could probably have saved himself   but he did n't if your average startup started issuing lots of stock and devaluing existing shares significantly then i would expect it would be harder to find investors willing to watch as their investment dwindled   but if you are issuing a limited amount stock to get leverage to grow bigger then it is worth it   in the .com bubble there were quite a few companies that just issued stock to buy other companies   eventually most of these companies got delisted because they diluted them selves to much when they were overvalued any company not just a startup can dilute its shares   many if not most major companies issue stock to raise capital   this capital is then generally used to build the business further and increase the value of all shares   most of the time this dilution is very minor < .1 and has little if any impact on the stock   there are rules that have to be followed as listed companies are regulated by the sec   there are less regulations with private corporations   it looks like the dilution was combined with the buyout of the florida company which probably contributed to the legality of the dilution      with options they are generally issued at a set price   this may be higher or lower than the reported sell price of the stock when the option is issued   the idea is over time the stock will increase in value so that those people who hold on to their options can buy the stock for the price listed on the option   i worked at an isp start up in the 90 's that made it pretty well   i left before the options were issued but i had friends still there that were issued an option at $ 16 a share the value of the stock at the time of the issue of the option was about 12   well the company diluted the shares and used them to acquire more isp 's unfortunately this was about the time that dsl and cable internet took off so the dial up market tanked   the value eventually fell to .10 they did a reverse split and when they did the called in all options   the options did not have a positive cash value at any time   had ever made it big then the options could have been worth millions   there are some people from ms and yahoo that were in early that made millions off of their options   this became a popular way for startups to attract great talent paying peanuts   they invested their time in the business hoping to strike gold   a lot of it people got burned so this is less popular among top talent as the primary compensation anymore

first you do n't state where you are and this is a rather global site   there are people from canada us and many other countries here so mutual funds that mean one thing to you may be a bit different for someone in a foreign country for one point   thanks for stating that point in a tag second mutual funds are merely a type of investment vehicle there is something to be said for what is in the fund which could be an investment company trust or a few other possibilities   within north america there are money market mutual funds bond mutual funds stock mutual funds mutual funds of other mutual funds and funds that are a combination of any and all of the former choices   thus something like a money market mutual fund would be low risk but quite likely low return as well   short term bond funds would bring up the risk a tick though this depends on how you handle the volatility of the fund 's nav changing   there is also something to be said for open end etf and closed end funds that are a few types to consider as well third taxes are something not even mentioned here which could impact which kinds of funds make sense as some funds may invest in instruments with favorable tax treatment aside from funds i 'd look at cds and treasuries would be my suggestion   with a rather short time frame stocks could be quite dangerous to my mind i 'd only suggest stocks if you are investing for at least 5 years   in 2 years there is a lot that can happen with stocks where if you look at history there was a record of stocks going down about 1 in every 4 years on average   something to consider is what kind of downside would you accept here   are you ok if what you save gets cut in half   this is what can happen with some growth funds in the short term which is what a 2 year time horizon looks like   if you do with a stock mutual fund it would be a gamble to my mind   do n't forget that if the fund goes down 10 and then comes up 10 you 're still down 1 since the down will take more

short answer the cd can be considered as part of the down payment calculations they will want a plan to cash them in the last days or weeks before settlement when approving you for a mortgage they will be looking at they now know what you can afford to dedicate to this new property every month they take into account principal interest taxes insurance and the hoa fee they will then look at how much money you will use as a down payment they want this money to exist before applying and they will check on its existence in the last days before settlement   the best is cash sitting in a bank but it can also be money in savings bonds or a cd but they will want a plan for cashing that in just before settlement   they wo n't be comfortable with it being in a volatile account such as stocks especially if the current balance is exactly what you need for a mortgage that wo n't be closed for 3 more months because people use money they borrow from their 401 k for a home purchase it is possible to use money from volatile account they will want to see a plan for getting money from these accounts just before settlement

i understand $ 14k yr $ 5.4 m max this is n't the right way to say it   your dad has a $ 5.4 million estate tax exclusion that can be used for gift tax   in addition to that not instead or as part of he and his wife each have a $ 14k year gift tax exclusion   so if you are n't paying for two years from today you actually have three years of gift tax exclusion   2017 2018 2019   so that 's 3 2 $ 14k = $ that he and his wife can give you without using any of the estate tax exclusion   but   i give my cousin dad $ from the mortgage according to this you do n't want your dad to give you any money   you want to pay the entire $   in that case do n't file gift tax forms   he 's not giving you money   he 's loaning you money    i agree with the others   the cleanest solution is for your cousin to loan you money to buy the house from your dad   pay a lawyer or have your cousin dad do it so that it 's legally written as a mortgage and you can get your interest deduction   you start paying off the loan in two years   until then interest accrues   so instead of a $ debt you 'd owe something like $   maybe more if your cousin pays the property taxes as well    your cousin is out $ plus possibly property taxes but apparently he can afford that   you have a house and a mortgage   your dad has money to buy his florida house    note that if your dad wanted to give you money he could   he could collect $ from you borrowed from your cousin and give you $ equity immediately and then two more payments in 2018 and 2019   but that assumes that $ is enough for him to buy his florida house   if not just do the mortgage   he can give you money by check which you can send to your cousin if he wants to do that

for reporting purposes most ira firms prefer that you roll the 401(k funds into a rollover or traditional ira and then convert to the roth from there the mid air conversions 401(k directly into a roth can get tricky when you go to do your taxes the following year if the 1099 form from the releasing custodian and the 5498 form from the accepting custodian have different numbers due to the conversion amount and taxes withheld if any

you most definitely can invest such an amount profitably but it makes it even more important to avoid fees um at all costs because fees tend to have a fixed component that will be much worse for you than for someone investing € 200k so   edit the above assumes that you actually want to invest in the long run for modest but relatively certain gains maybe 5 above inflation while accepting temporary downswings of up to 30 if those € 2000 are funny money that you do n't mind losing but would be really excited about maybe getting 100 return in less than 5 years well feel free to put them into an individual stock of an obscure small company but be aware that you 'd be gambling not investing and you can probably get better quotes playing roulette

budgeting is a tool for planning not for execution it sounds like you do n't have a problem budgeting planning what to spend on what things but rather with the execution of your plan that is living frugally this is primarily an issue of self control and personal psychology not an issue with the mechanics of budgeting and finance which explains why the most popular personal finance gurus dave ramsey suze deal as much with your relationship to money and spending as they do with financial knowledge there is no easy answer here but you can learn to spend less one helpful thought is to realize that whatever your current income is someone in your community is currently making less than that and surviving what would you do differently if your real actual income was $ 100 or $ 200 less than it is currently if your food budget is a concern learn to cook cheaply often this is more healthy you mentioned schooling so i assume you are on or near a college campus many colleges have all sorts of free food opportunities i used to eat free vegetarian meals weekly at a temple price of admission listening to the monk read from the fast food is of course a complete no no on low budget living it probably goes without saying but just in case you have n't cancel cable get a cheap phone plan is excellent if available in your area and otherwise see how you can squeeze a few dollars out of your bills on the subject of frugality i have found no book more enlightening than money secrets of the amish finding true abundance in simplicity sharing and saving

the reason to do a stock split is to get the price of the stock down to an affordable range if your stock costs $ 100,000 per share you are seriously cutting in to the number of people who can afford to buy it i can think of two reasons not to do a stock split the biggest is why bother if your stock is trading at a reasonable price why change anything it takes time and effort which equals money to do a stock split if this serves no purpose you 're just wasting that effort the other reason is that you do n't want to drive your stock price down too low low prices are normally associated with highly speculative start up companies and so can give a wrong impression of your company also low prices make it difficult for the price to reflect small changes if your stock is trading at $ 10.00 a 1/2 of 1 change is 5 cents but if it 's trading at $ 1.50 a 1/2 of 1 change is a fraction of a penny does it go up by that penny or not you 've turned a smooth scale into a series of hurdles

question 1 yes question 2 there is no simple formula car insurance is mostly statistics because you have so many millions of cases that the variance is really low this also means that because the cost can be estimated so precisely it is difficult to make an offer better than the competitors for that reason every insurance company makes there own arbitrary segmentation of the data which leads them identify low risk groups they can offer a bonus to common ones are type of car or and driving experience but it could be anything that is not forbidden by anti discrimination laws also additional perks like towing insurance etc may give them an opportunity do differentiate themselves or to make easy profit   in fact it is a common tactic to offer prices that make close to no profit to fill up your book then raise tariffs in then following years an make you profit with those who are to lazy to switch

firstly a stock split is easy for example each unit of stock is converted into 10 units   so if you owned 1 of the company before the stock split you will still own 1 after the stock split but have 10 times the number of shares    the company does not pay out any money when doing this and there is no effect on tax for the company or the share holder now onto stock dividend when a company make a profit the company gives some of the profit to the share holders as a dividend this is normally paid in cash   an investor may then wish to buy more shares in the company using the money from the dividend       however buying shares used to have a large cost in broker charges etc therefore some companies allowed share holders to choose to have the dividend paid as shares    the company buys enough of their own shares to cover the payout only having one set of broker charges and then sends the correct number of shares to each share holder that has opted for a stock dividend   along with any cash that was not enough to buy a complete share this made since when you had paper shares and admin costs where high for stock brokers    it does not make sense these days a stock dividend is taxed as if you had been paid the dividend in cash and then brought the stock yourself

well it 's directly depositing money in your account but direct deposit is something completely different direct deposits are most commonly made by businesses in the payment of salaries and wages and for the payment of suppliers accounts but the facility can be used for payments for any purpose such as payment of bills taxes and other government charges direct deposits are most commonly made by means of electronic funds transfers effected using online mobile and telephone banking systems but can also be effected by the physical deposit of money into the payee 's bank account thus since the purpose of dd is to eliminate checks i 'd say no depositing cash directly into your account does not count as the requirement for one direct deposit within 90 days

i think you 're really underestimating the degree of that occurs in hiring and just how much youth is in the job markets experience costs more and it depreciates quickly in most case employers   will prefer someone less experienced who comes across as mature and less expensive than someone who is more experienced but has been our of the industry for a year or more the attitude of you ca n't teach an old job new tricks rules your 30s represent the ideal sweet spot you are still young and you have some experience if you 're not in full preparing for retirement mode by 40 or 45 you 're going to have a bad time have lost most of their sweet spot and if the recovery does n't happen they will have lost all of it    yes millenials have it pretty bad too no one is disputing that but genx was screwed from the start we have larger generations on either side of us we are a transitional generation that started out before computers went mainstream but ended after so we have a hard time competing with millenials who have lived with technology all their life the whole structure of the world changed right under us i.e. the end of the cold war and this change significantly increased available labour even before 2008 the talk was all about how screwed the where because of the power of boomers and the dominance of the millenials we already had our backs up against the wall then 2008 struck   also i 'd much rather be 28 and looking for a job than 40 + and looking for one it 's so much easier to jump industries or cites or countries when younger and you do n't have children to look after the 28 year old is not locked a career path and has lost a ton of political capital and credibility for having lost their job the 40 + year old will always have to face questions why was n't he she one of the one the company kept during the layoffs will he she be able to learn and adapt to the new job will he she be comfortable reporting to someone younger will he she be will to sacrifice time away from kids to work longer hours to compete with younger employees

property taxes where they exist are generally levied by cities counties and other local level administrative bodies like and are the primary source of revenue at these levels of government these taxes pay the lion 's share of the expenses for basic services provided by a city or county there are federal dollars other revenue sources state lottery revenues often go toward public schools for instance and usage fees vehicle registration utility bills toll roads at play as well but a lot of that money covers larger scale infrastructure development freeways and specialized political involving this bridge or that dam in a 's home district a few national initiatives from the president 's budget like first technology upgrades for improved disaster terrorism property taxes are the main funding for the day to day government operations at the most visible level to the average resident the theory behind using a property tax instead of some other form of taxation like income is that the value of the property and the quality of services provided to the of that property are the property is valuable in part because the infrastructure is well maintained and nearby schools hospitals are good and by the same token affluent residents expect high quality services property taxes are also easier to levy because most of the work can be done by the tax assessor monitor recent sale prices do drive through neighborhoods come up with a number and send the resident the bill that 's opposed to sales taxes which businesses operating in the jurisdiction have to calculate collect and turn over or income taxes which require residents to fill out paperwork to calculate how much they owe the justification is eminent domain it 's very simple when you buy land in the u.s. and a state thereof you are still a citizen and/or resident of that state and the u.s. and subject to their laws you 're not creating your own country when you buy a house as such the government charges you for the facilities and services they provide in your area and your state which are then your privilege to use obviously roads are n't free a one mile stretch behind my house is costing the county $ 15 million to expand it from to here 's the kicker you 've already been paying these taxes you think your landlord 's just going to take the property taxes for the whole apartment complex on the chin he 's out to make money and doing that requires charging a sufficient amount to cover costs including taxes he incurs you just never see allocated property taxes as an item on your rent statement just like you do n't see allocated mortgage allocated facilities maintenance allocated gross margin etc you know you 're getting shafted paying someone else 's financing with a little extra on the side to boot that 's why you want a house unfortunately not being able to pay these taxes is a reality for some people old and young and government generally does n't go easy on delinquent homeowners after medical bills and mortgage delinquency property tax delinquency is the number three reason for bankruptcy and only a mortgage or property tax delinquency can cause your home to be seized and sold well that and using it for criminal enterprise but unless you 're running a meth lab in your half million dollar home or financing it with coke money i would n't worry about that score retirement planners figure property taxes into cost of living and they do often advise a downgrade from the house you raised your children in to something smaller for many reasons including lower taxes there really is n't a way to structure a completely pay as you go metropolitan area and you would n't want to live in it if there were imagine every strip of asphalt in the county being a toll road where your ez pass etc or license plate was scanned and you were billed at each intersection in addition to being a huge invasion of privacy the cost to maintain this network and your cost to use it would skyrocket imagine 911 asking for a credit card number before police fire or ems ambulance services already do bill on a per event basis but you 'd be surprised how few people pay and how little power a county ems has to enforce collection without a property tax and medicaid to cover the difference ems service could not be provided in most counties

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

from what i 've heard in the past debt can be differentiated between secured debt and unsecured debt    secured debt is a debt for which something stands good such as a mortgage on your house   you have a debt but that debt is covered by the value of an asset and if you needed to free yourself of the debt then you could by selling that asset    this is what is known as good debt    unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income   an example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that could n't be sold again to pay off the debt    this is know as bad debt you have to be careful about thinking that house debt is always good debt because the house stands good for it though   the problem with that is that the house could go down in value and then suddenly your good debt is bad debt or no longer secured   cars are very risky this way because they go down in value   it is really easy to get a car loan where before long you are upside down     this is the problem with the term good debt the label makes it sound like it is a good idea to have that debt and the risk associated with having the debt is and allows yourself to feel good about your financial plan   perhaps this is why so many houses are in foreclosure right now people believed the good debt myth and thought that it was ok to borrow more than the home was worth to get into a house   thus they turned a secured debt into an unsecured debt and put their residence at risk by levels of debt they could n't afford other advice i 've heard and tend to agree with is that you should only borrow for a house an education and maybe a car danger on that last one being careful to buy a modest house car etc that is well within your means to repay    so if you do have to borrow for a car go for basic transportation instead of the $ 40,000 bmw   keep you house payment less than of your take home pay pay off the school loans as quickly as possible regardless of the label good bad unsecured secured i think that less debt is better than more debt    there is definitely such a thing as too much good debt

great topic as interest rate swaps are one of the most commonly used derivatives by bank in the simplest form an interest rate swap is an exchange of payments between two parties    say party a has a $ 100 loan with a fixed 4.25 interest rate and party b also has a $ 100 loan with a variable rate lets say prime plus 1 prime is 3.25 so b is also paying 4.25    party a thinks interest rates are going to go lower and wants to lower his interest expense while party b is a small company and does n't want to be exposed to variable interest rates and needs to have a steady cash flow to project his budget   party a and b agree to enter into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of $ 100 where party a agree to pay b prime plus 1 fixed for floating and party b agrees to pay a 4.25 floating for fixed for some period of time they agree upon usually the maturity of the loan   now from the start the swap has a market value of $ 0 since a and b both receive the same as they are paying as interest rates move the value of the swap moves say interest rates fall and prime is now 2 b still pays 4.25 to a he agreed to pay a fixed 4.25 no matter what and a only pays 3 prime plus 1 to b. remember the terms of the individuals loans did not change so a owes $ 4.25 to his bank and b owes $ 3 to his bank party a uses the $ 4.25 from b to pay his bank and pays $ 3 to b. party a has lowered his interest expense by $ 1.25 and his position is considered in the money which means he is benefitting from the transaction party b gets $ 3 from a but still owes his bank $ 4.25 in reality the transaction nets out to b paying a $ 1.25 rather than both a and b paying each other different amounts b is out of the money because in aggregate he is paying a. the market value of the swap would be the present value of that $ 1.25 benefit a receives discounted using expected future interest rates the same number but negative is the value to b   please ask if you have additional questions or need

thank you for this point   i 've worked on the front end of union shops as an engineer at several different places union workers can be incredibly short sighted lazy incompetent and act like asshole union leadership can often act as a agent that itself in between workers and management unions will often act in resistance to the implementation of necessary business practices and block forward progress   this is because management lets them   managers will often complain about how they wish their plants were n't unionized yet wo n't even stand up for their own rights that have been negotiated into the management side of the contract at the first sign of resistance they will fold and refuse to fight for what is necessary for the business they do n't engage the workers and leaders on the floor by just implementing policies with no input from the floor   any stupid fucking rule or unsustainable compensation that a union has negotiated has a management signature approving it   running a union shop can be difficult but it is no excuse for allowing it to harm the bottom line any time a plant needs to relocate to a right to work state represents just as much of a failure on management as it does labor

i 'm not a huge fan of tax advantaged retirement accounts anyway so i would n't fault you for not contributing even if you were n't likely to develop a disability do you have disability insurance   i hope so   if you already have the disease then you may not be able to get it now if you do n't have it already because they may not cover existing conditions   if not try to get it however you can you may be able to withdraw the money without much problem if you can prove it 's a permanent disability   information here do you have 401(k matching from your employer   if that match is vested in a reasonable period of time then even with the penalties you 'll end up ahead beyond that this was n't part of your question but i 'm just trying to help i 'd think about what kind of work you can do after you ca n't work at your current job   you have the luxury of an early warning so plan for it also check out national industries for the blind   our lions club sells some of the products as fundraisers and they 're quality products

several options are available she may ask the us bank to issue a debit card visa most probably to her account and mail this card to russia i think this can be done without much problems though sending anything by mail may be unreliable after this she just withdraws the money from local atm some withdrawal fee may apply which may be rather big if the sum of money is big in big banks bank citibank russia etc are atms that allow you to withdraw dollars and it is better to use one of them to avoid unfavorable exchange rate she may ask the us bank to transfer the money to her russian account i assume the currency on the us bank account is us dollars she needs an us dollar account in any russian bank this is no problem at all   she should find out from that bank the transfer parameters for transfering us dollars to her account this should include among other info a bank correspondent and a swift code or may be two swift codes after this she should contact her us bank and find out how can she request the money to be transferred to her russian bank providing these transfer parameters i can think of two problems that may be here first the bank may refuse to transfer money without her herself coming to the bank to confirm her identity how do they know that a person writing or calling them is she indeed however i guess there should be some workaround for this second with current us sanctions against russia the bank may just refuse the transfer or will have do some additional investigations however i have heard that bank transfers from us to private persons to russia are not blocked probably it is good to find this out in advance in addition the us bank will most probably charge some standard fee for foreign transfer after this she should wait for a couple of days maybe up to week for the money to appear on russian account i have done this once some four years ago and had no problems though at that time i was in the us so i just came to the bank myself the bank employee to whom i talked obviously was unsure whether the transfer parameters were enough obviously this was a very unusual situation for her but she took the information from me and i guess just passed it on to someone more knowledgable the fee was something about $ 40 another option that i might think of is her us bank issuing and mailing her a check for the whole sum and she trying to cash it here in russia this is possible but very few banks do cash checks here citibank russia is among those that do the bank will also charge a fee and it will be comparable to transfer fee plus mailing anything is not quite reliable here she would also have to consider whether she need to pay russian taxes on this sum if the sum is big and passes through a bank i guess russian tax police may find this out through and question her if it is withdrawn from a visa card i think it will not be noticed but even in this case she might be required to file a tax herself

in a year with no income the best advice is to convert existing ira money to roth this lets you take advantage of the zero bracket the combination of your exemption and standard deduction this adds to $ 10,300 for a single person   other than that if you are determined to take the money out just do it there would be a 10 penalty of the growth but the original deposit comes out tax free anyway   edit there 's a rule that if you sell your entire roth account i.e. all roth accounts you ca n't pick one of a few and have a loss you can take that loss per dilip 's comment this strategy is pretty moot it 's not a loss taken against other income as a stock loss would potentially be

huge news in the grocery delivery space   groceries are one of the few large markets that require some proximity to customers due to costs and spoilage each grocery store is a type of mini distribution center for grocery products   and instacart have succeeded to date because they use existing distribution channels and set up marketplaces for the last mile of delivery this is in contrast to webvan in the early 2000 's who tried to do grocery delivery by building their own distribution and failed spectacularly   amazon has become an expert in distribution and logistics but it is clear that using their current model does n't generally work with groceries rip webvan 1998 2001 bananas need to be treated much differently than books   so what does amazon do but whole foods a moderate sized grocery store with a significant national footprint and lots of higher income customers   now they instantly have a pre built distribution channel that is already optimized for the grocery business which again is much different than non perishable consumer goods etc   things definitely just got interesting in this space i still believe that instacart and can succeed but they need to maintain a laser focus on making their shoppers and customers happy and grow as fast as possible while amazon whole foods

your comment regarding your existing finances is very relevant and helpful you need to understand that generally in personal finance circles when a strong earning 22 year old is looking for a loan it 's usually a gross spending problem    their car costs $ 1,000 and their bar tabs are adding up so the only logical thing to do is get a loan   most olds do n't have a mortgage up their income or a newborn    with all of this in mind i essentially agree with and personally and many people here would probably disagree i 'd stop the 401(k contribution and use that money to pay the debt   you 're still very young from a retirement standpoint let the current balance ride and forego the match until the debt is paid   i think this is more about being debt free at 22 quickly than it 's about how much marginal money could be saved via 401(k or personal loan or this strategy or that strategy   i think at your age you 'll benefit greatly from simply being debt free there are other very good answers on this site and other places regarding the pitfalls of a 401(k loan   the most serious of which is that you have an extremely limited time to pay the entire loan upon leaving the company   failure to repay in that situation incurs tax liability and penalties    from my quick math assuming your contribution is 8 of $ 70,000 you 're contributing something in the neighborhood of $ to your 401(k   if you stopped contributing you 'd probably take home a high $ 300 number net of taxes   it 'll take around 20 months to pay the loan off using this contribution money without considering your existing payments in total you 're probably looking at closer to 15 months   you 'll give up something in the neighborhood of $ 3,500 in match funds over the repayment time    but again you 're 22 you 'll resume your contributions at 24 still way ahead of most people from a retirement savings standpoint   i do n't think my first retirement dollar was contributed until i was about 29   sure retirement savings is important but if you 've already started at age 22 you 're probably going to end up way ahead of most either way   when you 're 60 you 're probably not going to giving up a few grand of employer match in your 20s that 's what i would do edit i actually like 's suggestion in the comments below   if there 's enough vested in your plan that is also available for withdrawal that you could just scoop $ 6,500 out of your 401(k net of the 10 penalty and federal and state taxes which would be on the full amount to pay the debt i 'd consider that instead of stopping the prospective contributions   that way you could continue your contributions and receive the match contributions on a prospective basis   i doubt this is a legitimate option because it 's very common for employers to restrict or forbid withdrawal of employee and/or employer contributions made during your employment but it would be worth looking in to

the price at which a stock was purchased is a sunk cost that is you can not go back in time and reverse the decision you made to purchase that stock   another example of a sunk cost would be purchasing a non refundable non transferable movie ticket   sunk costs have the tendency to create a cognitive bias in which we feel that the amount we paid at some point in the past should have some sort of bearing on the decision we make now the purchaser of the ticket feels he must go see the movie even if he no longer wishes too lest the ticket go to waste the investor to a stock for that tiny chance that just maybe some day it will return to its former glory   this is referred to as the sunk cost fallacy and is considered to be irrational behavior by economists keeping this in mind your hopes and dreams for the stock at the time you purchased it should have no bearing on the decision you make now   similarly whether the stock has risen or fallen in price since your purchase date should have no bearing   instead you must consider what you expect the stock to do from this very moment on into the future that is you must act at the margin you 've indicated that you are faced with two choices sell the stock now incur the loss but benefit from the tax break option a   this benefit is quite easily quantifiable it is your marginal tax rate multiplied by the additive inverse of the loss assuming you have will have other gains to offset   let 's just assume that you incurred a $ 1000 loss at a marginal tax rate of 20 which means your tax benefit for the loss is $ 200 the second choice to hold the stock in hopes of it rising in price option a bit harder to quantify   you must assume that today is day zero and that every cent in price the stock rises is a gain to you and every cent in price the stock looses is a loss to you   if you believe that the stock will rise to a price that will net your more than your tax benefit from option a then holding the stock is more favorable than selling it at a loss today   conversely if you believe this stock will fall even further in the future or not rise enough to net you $ 200 per the example then option a is preferable granted there are some additional complications that play into your decision   by selling the stock today you not only get a tax benefit from the loss but you 've also freed up the funds previously used to purchase that stock to be invested elsewhere in hopefully a better performing asset   if you choose to stick with your current stock then the gains you may have netted elsewhere must be considered as an opportunity cost associated with option b.   finally the tax benefit is essentially guaranteed so in our example a $ 200 risk free return while sticking with the stock in option b still comes with some risk

according to your post you bought seven shares of at $ each on august 23rd   you paid €   now on august 25th is worth $   so you have   but you want to know what you have in eur not usd   so if i ask google how much $ is in eur it says €   that 's even lower than what you 're seeing    it looks like usd has fallen in value relative to eur   so while the stock price has increased in dollar terms it has fallen in euro terms   as a result the value that you would get in euros if you sold the stock has fallen from the price that you paid    another way of thinking about this is that your price per share was € and is now €   that 's actually a small drop    when you buy and sell in a different currency that you do n't actually want you add the currency risk to your normal risk   maybe that 's what you want to do   or maybe you would be better off sticking to euro denominated investments    usually you 'd do dollar denominated investments if some of your spending was in dollars   then if the dollar goes up relative to the euro your investment goes up with it   so you can cash out and make your purchases in dollars without adding extra money    if you make all your purchases in euros i would normally recommend that you stick to euro denominated investments   the underlying asset might be in the us but your fund could still be in europe and list in euros    that 's not to say that you ca n't buy dollar denominated investments with euros   clearly you can   it 's just that it adds currency risk to the other risks of the investment   unless you deliberately want to bet that usd will rise relative to eur you might not want to do that    note that usd may rise over the weekend and put you back in the black   for that matter even if usd continues to fall relative to the eur the security might rise more than that   i have no opinion on the value of   i do n't actually know what that is as it does n't matter for the points i was making   i 'm not saying to sell it immediately   i 'm saying that you might prefer euro denominated investments when you buy in the future   again unless you are taking this particular risk deliberately

thanks    gt how do you believe it should be approached    businesses should be more cognizant of the fact that they have enormous amounts of technical debt or what will be considered to be debt that will suddenly need to be solved   infrastructure or applications that have n't seen a dime in 5 + years shadow it that was stood up e.g. hey we use this access database that everyone completely forgot about to meet this one specific need and has somehow managed to survive that 's one of the most frequent issues that will grind to a halt the business need to involve it as early as possible in the m&amp;a process   cross platform can usually be solved by some form of extraction load processes that 's straightforward but it does take time   if you 're a company that cares enough to have a disaster recovery team you should also have an it m&amp;a team that meets regularly to have a dry run of an m&amp;a that covers the processes from end to end for 2 3 worst case scenarios new scenarios should be identified if you do enough you 'll have compiled a fairly decent playbook of scenarios after the third or fourth you 'll have a well oiled machine that your investors can and should be proud of    for perspective the best m&amp;a team i 've seen was microsoft 's and even then shit regularly hits the fan for those guys when it comes to technical debt that 's something to keep in mind

there is no shortage what there is is a lot of unskilled who think they can skate their way through an career after 4 years at college   because hr people ca n't tell the difference they have hired too many of the and because management ca n't deal with the social differences that people who spend all day working with machines are going to have they have fired all of the true experts   the business world brought this situation upon itself because of arrogance and ignorance and it deserves all of the suffering that has resulted   wages for high tech work have actually dropped by 50 over the last 10 years if you folks want skilled computer workers to support your organizations again you need to increase average salaries by 200 and treat the experts with the respect we deserve

my point was more that i 've seen firsthand people not take financial responsibility for their dependents or for themselves and that they ca n't be trusted in investing in any future   like i keep saying though i just wish those irresponsible folks did n't benefit from the social security i wish it went to their burial costs to the family etc    personally i have modest life insurance available through my employer and i usually opt in to any additional programs offered at open enrollment given i 'm still in great health and in my 20 's i probably ought to look into getting more real life insurance as well of course i 'd rather be investing in my family 's own wellbeing than the state of well the state but for the aforementioned reasons i see benefits in the status quo model as well

yes there are checks and balances   employers can be and have been prosecuted for failing to pay super before the statutory timeline which is three months from the pay date however it is still in your interests to check for yourself   the most common point for missing super to be discovered is when the company goes broke at which point it 's too late for you   what you should do is   check on your that the right amount is allocated to super   it should be 9 of gross plus any salary sacrifice or additional component check your super fund 's half yearly statements line up the deductions given on your payslip consider getting online access to your super account so you can check more quickly if something is missing call your super fund and/or payroll office resources

i have credit card debt of about $ 5000   that 's the answer right there you told us the has no match the next highest priority would be credit card debt that 's costing you interest you did n't mention the rate on the card i 'm assuming it 's 8 or more   as far as your balance sheet the bottom line is concerned pay off a 10 debt is the same as earning 10 on your money if anyone promises you a higher return with a different investment i 'd run the other way we hope the market i.e. the us stock market as measured by a broad index say the s&p 500 will return 8 10%/yr over the long term but this is n't guaranteed paying off that credit card will save you the interest every year and free up the payments to invest elsewhere   in response to 's comment crazy no human nature and emotion is what it is i honestly do n't know how to address some of it years ago i was in a similar situation with a reader who had a $ 5000 emergency account yet had $ 5000 in credit card debt i had a tough time getting my head around why it was n't obvious this made no sense in your case i might suggest you pay the card down to below $ 1000 and have the credit line reduced paying high interest on $ 5 k makes no sense at any point in one 's life at least a can dig his way out and learn a lesson a pre retiree should n't be throwing this money away

what you are suggesting will not work banks have strict guidelines about what they can and can not do with an fha loan property remember the fha is only an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan   the bank wo n't take the risk of violating their insurance policy and the government refusing to pay them off if you default instead consider doing a creative sale on your property maybe a rent to own deal or owner financing as long as you pay the mortgage the bank wo n't even know you do n't live there and you can rent the house out to someone who eventually will buy it after the timeframe expires meanwhile you can go and get a new home or condo either thru regular financing or owner the internet to see how to do this and you can use owner financing until you complete the sale of the first house otherwise just tough it out in the house you are in until the time expires and then sell you made no mention of the property value but i am assuming if you bought it 3 years ago that you may have a little equity note that if you sell at that time though you will likely have to come out of cash because your equity wo n't cover the realtor fee and closing cost but if you do the rent to own i suggested earlier you can sell at a slightly higher price making sure you can cover those cost i realize this answer is a little out the box but i deal with people who do n't want properties all day and i have completed transactions like this many times good luck and god bless

they have forever to collect a balance from you   furthermore they can add whatever penalties and fees they wish to increase that balance   worst of all they do n't have to remind you or send you bills or any other notification   you owed it when you left the office   there very well could be local laws that require notifications but that is n't really the issue here that dentist has every right to deny you service until you settle the account   forever the statute of limitations on collecting that debt via court which covers the rules on how long they have to collect the debt   owing the money is one thing but the rules and tools that you creditor has to collect the debt are another   you are probably worried about them suing you but if you do n't pay the debt or settle in some way that dentist can refuse to provide services to you even if they write off the debt ways you can be punished by your dentist for not paying the bill are depending on your jurisdiction and/or type of debt they typically only report it on your credit if they are reporting at all for 7 years   even if you pay and settle the account it will still be reported on your credit report for 7 years   the difference is how it is reported   they can report that is a super reliable person who always pays debts on time   they can say is a who pays but takes a while to pay   or they can say is a bad person to provide services before collecting money because do n't pay bills other people considering lending you money are going to read these opinions and decide accordingly if they want to deal with you or not and they can say that for 7 years   the idea of credit reporting is that you settle up as soon as possible and get your credit report to reflect the truth one popular way to collect a debt to is to sue you for it   there each state has a different time period on how long a creditor has to sue you for a debt if you pay part of the debt that will often reset the clock on the statute of limitations so be sure any partial or negotiated settlements state very clearly in writing that payment is considered payment in full on the debt   then you keep that record forever there are other interesting points in the fair debt collection practices act   see debt collectors calling know your rights   they can only contact you in certain ways they must respond to you in certain ways and they have limits on what they can say who they can say it to and when they can say it   there are protections from mean or vicious bill collectors but that does n't sound like who you are dealing with   i do n't know that the fdcpa is a tool you need to use in this case you should negotiate your debt and try your best to settle up   from your post both parties dropped the ball and both parties should give a little   you should pay no or minor late fees and the doctor should report your credit positively when you do so   if you both made honest mistakes they both parties should acknowledge that and be fair and not defensive this is not legal advice   but you owe the debt so you should settle up   i do n't think it is fair for you to not pay because they did n't mail you a paper   however i also do not think it is fair for the doctor to run up fees and not remind you of the bill finally you did n't bring up insurance or many other details   those details can change the answer

the answer is simple your new job pays more than your old one   as such you 're in a higher tax withholding bracket even with the same number of deductions as before your withholding is computed based on how much you make each pay period and the number of pay periods in the year   so if you were being paid weekly before then it was based on the assumption you made the same amount for every pay period in the calendar year   this is why tax varies from week to week for hourly employees and people being paid overtime   in your new job you 're being paid semi monthly which makes for 24 pay periods rather than the 52 pay periods when you were paid weekly so the amount of withholding in dollar terms is going to be much greater than when you were being paid weekly   add in the fact you 're making $ 2,000 more a month i presume so that 's $ 24,000 a year more   it 's definitely going to bump you into a different earning bracket for taxes so even with the same number of deductions you 're going to pay more now this is n't to say you wo n't be able to recoup some of that at the end of the year when you file your taxes since your current withholding rate may have you over paying   as such you 'll see a nice refund one final note you always have the option of changing your withholding if you like   many people will do that claiming minimal deductions for the first few months of the year to let the maximum withholding take place then they 'll adjust their withholding deductions in the second half of the year to capture more in each paycheck   if done right it makes no difference in the total amount withheld but it does allow the checks at the latter part of the year to be bigger than if withholding deductions were kept the same throughout

i was in a similar but not quite as bad situation a couple years ago and i had a stroke of luck that helped me but your friend might be able to force a similar situation my parents refused to take out the huge parent loan understandably so but my dad made enough money that i was n't eligible for much aid   my stroke of luck came when they got divorced i could my fafsa with only one parent using my mom with very little income my aid shot through the roof and nearly covered my undergrad this happened in california i do n't know if this works in other states my advice for your friend would be to take the 6 units part time job option but do what she can to earn enough to pay her own rent food other bills   i think the requirement for filing as an independent is that you supply > 50 of your own income   it wo n't kick in right away but for next school year this would end up getting her a lot more money from the state federal governments   for me it was enough to cover my school food rent gas car payment and still have a little left over i do n't know if this is still possible and i know it does n't work for graduate school or if it applies to every state   it might be an option worth pursuing though

whether you need to hire a lawyer depends on whether you are capable enough to understand the fine print and it 's consequences in all the contracts you sign with the builder or not   even though the is a standard document the builder may add additional addendum many of the rights buyers normally have if you are not sure or have doubts about specific verbiage i recommend that you at least get your realtor to spell it out for you or hire a lawyer as an alternative

why do they have to endorse every check every time they want to    deposit it they told you why they said it was because it was made out to one person and there were    others on the account that could withdraw money from the acct so    endorsing it acknowledged that the payee still wanted to deposit the    money knowing others could take the $ out the reason they insist on it may have something to do with their responsibility in case of abuse they are worried that you may be using your parents money without their knowledge and if it ends up being true and they did n't enforce the requirement they may also be liable i have a joint account with my spouse and they do not let us deposit checks written to both of us unless we both endorse this is similar and stems from the same concern so here 's the unusual situation in case of a death of a joint account holder the whole account is frozen until the estate is executed you can not deposit a check of a deceased person to such an account

in addition to what has been said gift cards with a credit card logo which is what i am assuming you mean here do not have an address associated with them that means that if you try to use one at a merchant that users address verification common in online purchases the transaction will fail   in my experience with an american express branded gift card i was able to call the number on the back and they added an address to the card so that it would work it seemed like this was a common and well known issue   because the gift card is not associated with any person no verification is needed to add that address you can give them any address you want   also i believe that the card numbers in use for gift cards are specific that is you could tell that a card is a gift card based on the number alone that means it is likely possible for a merchant to reject those gift cards while still accepting other cards from that network   this is likely for certain transactions for example   a hotel or car rental agency requires a credit card for and it 's likely that the system itself will outright reject a gift card even if it has enough on it for the initial hold   as for debit cards i think there are far fewer issues with acceptance other than the aforementioned hold issues described in another answer

an llc does not pay taxes on profits as regards tax a llc is treated as a partnership but instead of partners they are called members the llc is a passthrough entity as in partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits the llc reports the share of the profits of the members then the members pay the tax as an individual the profit of the llc is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred this is often the case as the llc may need to retain the profits for use in the business late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the llc than is available to distribute   the first answer is wrong only a c corporation files a tax return all other corporate structures are passthrough entities the c corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders if the c corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend and taxable to the shareholder hence double taxation

as you note your question is inherently opinion based   that said if i were in your situation i would sell the stock all at once and buy whatever it is you want to buy hopefully some index etf or mutual fund according to what i see the current value of the hd stock is about $ 8500 and the jnj stock is worth less than $ 500   with a total investment of less than $ 10,000 any gain you are likely to miss by liquidating now is not going to be huge in absolute terms this is doubly true since you were given the stock so you have no specific reason to believe it will do well at all   if you had picked it yourself based on careful analysis it could be worth keeping if you believed in yourself or even if you just wanted to test your acumen but as it is the stock is essentially random   even if you want to pursue an aggressive allocation it does n't make sense to allocate everything to one stock for no reason   if you were going to put everything in one stock you 'd want it to be a stock you had analyzed and picked   i still think it would be a bad idea but at least it would be a more defensible idea so i would say the risk of your lopsided allocation just two companies with more than 90 of the value in just one outweighs any risk of missing out on a gain   if news breaks tomorrow that the ceo of home depot has been or if trump decides to go on the twitter for some reason your investment could disappear another common way to think about it is if you had $ 9000 today to buy stocks with would you buy $ 8500 worth of hd and $ 500 worth of jnj   if not it probably does n't make sense to hold them just because you happen to have them the only potential exception to my advice above would be tax considerations   you did n't mention what your basis in the stock is   looking at historical prices it looks like if all the stock was 20 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 8000 and if all of it was 10 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 6000   if your tax situation is such that selling all the stock at once would push you into a higher tax bracket it might make sense to sell only enough to fit into your current bracket and sell the rest next year   however i think this situation is unlikely because a since the stock has been held for a long time most of the gains will be at the lower long term rate b if you have solid income you can probably afford the tax and c if you do n't have solid income your long term capital gains rate will likely be zero

in 2001 argentina defaulted on it 's debt and started negotiating a haircut with it 's debtors as a result a lot of the debtors sold the bonds they had a fire sale prices thinking better get some back than nothing   one of the guys that bought those cheap bonds was paul singer aka mr. vulture hedge fund i 'll speculate here saying that mr. singer saw that the bond conditions gave him a way to force argentina to pay the full value of the bonds notwithstanding it 's default or negotiated haircut argentina did negotiate a haircut with about 97 of it 's bond holders this meant that although they would lose out on some of the money they would still get some back and argentina could work its way back to its feet eventually    mr. singer and friends were the 3 that did not accept the haircut and took the country to court to get 100 of the bond value back   now the plot i do n't understand if mr. singer knew this or not but the bonds also had a condition that said that no bond holder would be worst off than the highest bond deal argentina offered anyone which basically means if they pay mr. singer 100 they have to pay everybody else 100 now it was well established that argentina could not pay 100 and is not able to pay 100 of the debt hence the 2001 default    meanwhile argentina was paying out the hair cut bonds but holding out on mr. singer and friends as they still did n't agree to pay 100 the courts ruled that they could not do this and had to pay everybody since argentina can not pay everybody 100 it is defaulting on the debt

it is possible and it depends on your strategy as short selling interest rates are annual and levied monthly at a prorated rate interest rates are also low in general with the exception of hard to borrow stocks therefore you can maintain a short position for weeks on end and notice nothing months even if the position itself has already gained in your favor there is no additional fee for opening the short position although some brokers have a locate fee if it is hard to borrow the stock and they need to go find some shares to short so you can do it as much as you like

let me summarize your question for you i do not have the down payment that the lender requires for a mortgage how can i still acquire the mortgage short answer find another lender or find more cash do n't overly complicate the scenario the correct answer is that the lender is free to do what they want they deem it too risky to lend you $ 1.1 m against this $ 1.8 m property unless they have $ 700k up front you want their money so you must accept their terms if other lenders have the same outlook consider that you can not afford this house find a cheaper house

this seems like a risky setup   all it takes is one missed or delayed transfer for you to overdraw your savings   there is a benefit to keeping your regular expenses and savings separate and i can see some benefits in having multiple checking accounts depending on how you organize your finances but i do n't see a benefit to having a paycheck go to one account and all regular spending and savings come from another   it requires some regular maintenance to transfer money over to use for regular spending   i suppose if you have a checking account that earns interest but requires direct deposits and a savings account that earns slightly higher interest you could squeeze out a bit but it 's probably not worth the effort these days unless you have a lot of money going in and out also it should not be easy to tap into savings but your day to day spending should be very accessible   all those factors suggest to me that your paycheck should go into your regular spending account and keep your savings separate

i 've spent enough time researching this question where i feel   comfortable enough providing an answer   i 'll start with the high level fundamentals and work my way down to the specific question that i had so point 5 is really the starting point for my answer we want to find companies that are investing their money   a good company should be reinvesting most of its excess assets so that it can make more money off of them if a company has too much working capital then it is not being efficiently reinvested   that explains why excess working capital can have a negative impact on return on capital but what about the fact that current liabilities in excess of current assets has a positive impact on the return on capital calculation   that is a problem period   if current liabilities exceed current assets then the company may have a hard time meeting their short term financial obligations this could mean borrowing more money or it could mean something worse like bankruptcy   if the company borrows money then it will have to repay it in the future at higher costs   this approach could be fine if the company can invest money at a rate of return exceeding the cost of their debt but to favor debt in the return on capital calculation is wrong that scenario would skew the metric the company has to overcome this debt anyways this is my understanding as the amateur investor my credibility is not even comparable to greenblatt 's credibility so i have no business calling any part of his calculation wrong but in defense of my explanation greenblatt does n't get into these gritty details so i do n't know that he allowed current liabilities in excess of current assets to have a positive impact on his return on capital calculation

i agree for the most part i thought about them i even thought about money supply and some others but the point was mainly that businesses as a whole have been doing bad for not just this year or since 2008 but over a decade not enough to account for inflation this is grounds that the economy is in a recession and will be bond 's are n't really an investment in business as they are loaning money to the government on interest so they do n't portray whether the economy is in recession or not   the premise was that a recession is has occurred not that money can not be made in a good portfolio   perhaps you did n't fully understand my last point i do n't believe gold and silver are the bubble i believe the dollar is the bubble and it has been bursting since 2000 commodity prices are merely a sign of the bursting bubble given that we 're in recession the only way to pull out as it is apparent people have been doing for the past 10 years is to buy real assets and that this creates a positive feedback loop into devaluing the dollar not everyone will pull out but most will for a long while the assets have had little exposure to the inflation of the dollar and now it 's catching up to the assets ergo assets are undervalued they are not the bubble

i believe you are confusing sales tax with income tax the tax holidays in the us are only for sales tax consumers purchasing certain goods during the tax holiday do not have to pay sales tax like they normally would effectively the price is slightly lower during those days with the purpose of giving people an extra reason to shop at that time during the tax holiday the stores make the exact same profit that they normally do but they may experience a bump in sales simply because more people will shop during that time income tax for both consumers and the businesses is not affected by this although new york state was the first state to implement a tax holiday 20 years ago they no longer have one today though they do have certain goods which have a lower tax rate year round

it 's a real pain in the rear to get cash only from a bank teller the end result of cutting the card as suggested there is a self control issue here that like weight loss should ultimately be addressed for a psychologically healthy lifestyle you do n't mention a budget here a budget is one of the first tools necessary for setting spending limits categorizing your money into categories such as   will force you to look at any purchase in context of your other needs and goals note that savings is at the top of the list supporting the to pay yourself first make realistic allowances for each budget category then force yourself to stick to this budget by whatever means necessary cash in several envelopes labeled with each category can physically reinforce your priorities the debit card is usually left at home for now   roll remaining funds from each month over into the next month to cover irregular larger expenses such as auto repairs   what sort of investing are we talking about if you are just talking about retirement savings an automatic deduction of just $ 50 to a roth ira account at a discount brokerage every pay check is a good start an emergency fund of 6 months expenses is also common financial advice and can likewise be built from small automatic deductions in defense of wise use of plastic a debit card can be a great retroactive budgeting tool because it records all spending for you it takes a lot more effort to save and enter receipts for cash and a compulsive spender without a budget is just as likely to run out of money whether or not he uses plastic you could keep receipts in the envelope you take the cash out of when you 're getting started if you are so addicted to spending that you must cut your debit card to enforce your budget at least consider this a temporary measure to get yourself under control when the bank issues you a new card re evaluate this decision and the self control measures you 've implemented to see if you 've grown enough to keep the card

unpaid internships though are the bread and butter of unskilled labour in many fields taking in someone who has no skills and nothing really to contribute to the enterprise but would like to work in the field for experience paying them makes no sense as they do little other than take up time of staff teaching them if they prove themselves and develop their skills thus improving the productivity of the enterprise then they deserve to be paid

i tried this a few months ago when i got one from chase for 0   thought it might be fun to play with maybe make some money with the interest elsewhere over the 6 months   read the term and called chase for more information on these and did n't see any issues at first    the big thing that got me was that the rest of my account not the money from the convenience check was converted so that interests accrued on a daily basis even if you paid it all off at the end of the month   so even though i was making the required payments that would normally not incur any interest just by having the convince check balance on my account i was being charged the interest for my normal credit card charges over the month    the amount of charges came out to only be around $ so was n't much of a loss really   but something to keep in mind when using these i tried it with 0 apr and still could n't get away from the interest   if i had needed the money this would still be an excellent way to go   but if your trying to beat chase with this game it does n't work   although if you do n't use the card for anything other than the convenience check it 's free money or cheap in your case everything in my account went back to normal after it was paid off so no harm really but some things to keep in mind at least

there are mechanisms for determining how valuable a property is without resorting to artificial government valuations that can rise drop in relation to the local economy   the most interesting i 'm aware of is to force a sale of a property for x times the tax the person is paying   so for instance if i value my home business property at 100 k and the forced sale factor is 100x then i would pay at least 1k year for taxes maybe a bit more just to be safe   this also solves the imminent domain issue   that is a bit science though   in reality using an average of similar recent sales while imperfect is good enough    is important in all kinds of investments   i agree but governments can always raise rates or cut services or borrow in hard times in general the property values should track fairly closely other forms of economic activity

in short no or not retroactively there really are multiple companies involved each of which bills you separately for the services they provided this can be partly avoided by selecting either a high end health plan with lower out of pocket maximum costs more up front of course or by selecting a genuine health management organization not a ppo which gathers more of the services into a single business either of these would result in fewer cash payments needing to be sent   but i do n't know of any way to simplify things after the fact even if there was a consolidation service you would have to forward the bills to them which really would n't be any easier than just paying the bills i 'm assuming you are in the us where we have a health insurance system rather than a health system other countries may handle this differently

like everybody else i 'm picking up on the school loans you 're mother is n't exactly earning a massive amount of money given her cost of living why is she taking out student loans that benefit you and your sister i 'm not trying to be offensive but it 's fairly obvious that she ca n't afford it as a first step i think you should at least take over paying your own student loans you sound like you 're out of college already and if you have $ 8k to lend to your mother you probably have enough money to pay the student loans that benefited you after all or as someone else also recommended assume your loans as to your sister maybe it 's time for her to get another job to pay for the tuition so her mother does n't have to go further into debt again i 'm not trying to be mean here but your mother is digging herself deeper and deeper into a hole because of the tuition something 's got ta give and delivering pizza or getting a paper round is a small sacrifice here next the car unless she has a managed to work herself out of some of this mess i would consider getting a much cheaper car instead this is provided that she is n't upside down on the loan personally i would n't trade in a vehicle with an upside down loan if anything that 's another bad financial decision assuming that she is n't upside down on the loan and has some equity in the car i would seriously consider selling the car and using the equity to buy something small and cheap that should also hopefully reduce the cost of gas and maybe insurance somewhat i think these points are probably the quickest steps that can be taken towards recovering this situation you already mentioned the longer term plans like downsizing the apartment but tbh i 'm not sure that this is really necessary the big elephant in the room are the college costs and removing those from the equation would give her a serious amount of breathing room

manufacturers sometimes give incentives to car dealers to ensure that the prior year models are sold out before the year is up   however dealers are usually pretty smart on only ordering the cars they know they can sell before this happens   also manufacturers are usually pretty good about only producing enough vehicles to cover demand    honestly you are n't likely to see these incentives materialize unless the manufacturer really screwed up    if that happens then three things occur   first is that manufacturers give a hidden incentive to the dealers   dealers wo n't publicize this even internally   if the cars are still not moving after a month then the dealers will tell the salespeople that those cars have a specific bonus on them   if those cars still do n't sell then the bonus inflates quite a bit and dealers begin advertising that car at a deep discount on the radio   it 's pretty much guaranteed to sell at that point barring those circumstances the deal you get on a brand new car late in the model year is likely to be the same you could have gotten early in the model year    honestly if you want the best deal possible look at the date of the inspection sticker on the car   if it is close to the 3 month mark then the dealer will bend over backwards to sell the car as the finance costs are racking up on it   they 'll often sell that one at heavy discounts

most people carry a diversity of stock bond and commodities in their portfolio   the ratio and types of these investments should be based on your goals and risk tolerance   i personally choose to manage mine through mutual funds which combine the three but etfs are also becoming popular as for where you keep your portfolio it depends on what you 're investing for   if you 're investing for retirement you are definitely best to keep as much of your investment as possible in 401k or iras preferably roth iras   many advisers suggest contributing as much to your 401k as your company matches then the rest to ira and if you over contribute for the ira back to the 401k   you may choose to skip the 401k if you are not comfortable with the choices your company offers in it such as only investing in company stock if you are investing for a point closer than retirement and you still want the risk and reward potential of stock i would suggest investing in low tax mutual funds or eating the tax and investing in regular mutual funds   if you are going to take money out before retirement the penalties of a 401k or ira make it not worth doing technically a savings account is n't investing but rather a place to store money

it 's not only a matter of staying calm when being up or down you must keep yourself from chasing a stock that appears to be running away or from betting all your money that say a crash will happen tomorrow because that would be great for you use your head not your heart empathy you need to understand what other speculators investors institutions and algorithms are going to do when there is a new development or technical signal and why for publicly traded corporations fundamentals and technical indicators only have the value that their algorithms choose to assign to them at that particular moment and every stock has a different population trading it there is no rule of thumb patience to trade successfully you must avoid trading at all costs heh if you ca n't find any good trade to do do n't open positions in order to meet your targets buy a new smartphone or to fight boredom diligence if your strategy relies on tight stops do n't make exceptions if your strategy relies on position sizing do n't close when you are a few points down luck in the end almost every trade can turn against you very badly you must prepare for the worst and hope for the best you ca n't buy luck or get luckier but you can attempt to stack probabilities diversify buy options to insure your positions reduce holding time avoid known volatility events etc

not really   most of the major cloud providers have streamlined their data center processes to the point they can go from deciding they need additional capacity to having another 10k nodes online in a matter of a few months   that 's a process that takes a traditional data centers years   fiber runs are all about up front capital investments and attempting to target supply to demand despite needing years of surveys permits and   cloud is just getting another dozen rows of servers   it 's like saying because a bunch of states highways that a rental car company could cars

they may be confused the combination of my wife received stock when younger and her father just died leaves questions a completed gift when she was a kid means she has a basis cost same as the original owner of that stock this may need to be researched the other choice is that she gets a price based on the date of dad 's death a stepped up basis if it was his but she got it when he passed   no offense to them but brokers are not always qualified to offer tax advice   how when exactly did she get to own the stock upon second reading it appears i answered this from a tax perspective you seem to have issues of ownership what exactly does the broker tell you in whose name is the statement for the account holding these shares scott saw your update for the accounts i have for my 13 year old i am custodian but the tax id is her social security number when 21 she does n't need my permission to sell anything just valid id what exactly does the broker tell her

oops i had been meaning to come back to this q. sooner just saw my reminder so here goes shortly before this question was asked i actually read a good blog post on the subject of disability insurance at evolution of wealth 7 ways your group disability will fail   i know the op does n't have group disability and hence the question but the reason i 'm highlighting it is even somebody with a group disability policy from their employer may want to consider it with an individual policy that has better coverage in my case the reason i opted for an individual policy was due to point 6 from the post ways that group disability coverage will fail you     etc    6 you can go work somewhere else    with disability insurance there is a    feature called own occupation   this    means that you are unable to perform    the duties of your specific occupation    even if you are able to work in an    other occupation   good group    disability coverage will cover your    own occupation for a period of 2 years    after that if you can work anywhere    yes even mcdonald ’s then you    receive no more benefits   notice i    said coverage a lot of    policies do n’t even have the    own occupation benefit i made sure my own individual ltd policy included coverage of own occupation until age 65   so do pay attention to the specific features and limitations of ltd policies when shopping for one

technically the answer is no you ca n't put more money in to that isa in that tax year once you 've transferred it unless you 've transferred it to a stocks and shares isa faqs 7 and 8 from cover these cases q. i have transferred current year payments to my cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa can i make any further payments to a cash isa in this    tax year a. yes provided you have n't already used up your annual isa    investment allowance £ in the tax year 2013 14 when you transfer current year payments to your cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa it is as if that cash isa had never existed any money    you saved up to the date of transfer will be treated as if you had    invested that money directly in the stocks and shares isa for example if you had put £ 2,000 in a cash isa and then transferred    it to a stocks and shares isa you would be able to make further    payments totalling £ in that tax year you could either put all    of the £ in the stocks and shares isa or you could put up to    £ in a cash isa with the same or a different isa manager and    the remainder of the £ in the stocks and shares isa   q. how many isas can i have a. there are limits on the number of isa accounts you can subscribe to    each tax year you can only put money into one cash isa and one stocks    and shares isa but in different years you could choose to save with different    managers there are no limits on the number of different isas you can    hold over time however in practice if you transfer mid year from provider a to provider b provider b has no way of telling whether you have already put money in to the isa with provider a that year or not so you will be able to put more money in   i believe that isa providers do report their subscriptions back to hmrc so they can check for multiple subscriptions over the limit in one tax year but in the past i have done exactly what you describe and it has never been picked up in any way or caused any problem at all as long as you stick to total subscriptions within the limit i 'd guess you 're unlikely to encounter a problem of course i am not a financial advisor so you should take what i say with the same pinch of salt as you would take any other random advice from the internet

note the answer below is speculative and not based on any first hand knowledge of pump and dump schemes the explanation with spamming does n't really makes sense for me often you see a stock jump 30 or more in a single day at a particular moment in time unlikely that random people read their emails at that time and decide to buy what i think happens is the does a somewhat risky thing starts buying a lot of shares of a stock that has declined a lot and had low volumes during the previous days as the price starts to increase other people start to notice the jump and join the buying spree also do n't forget that some probably use buy stop orders which are triggered when the price reaches a particular level also there should be some automatic trading involved maybe hft firms do pump and dumps as you have to trade a big volume in a relatively short time span i think it is unlikely to be done by human operators another explanation would be that there is a group of to spread the risk so to speak update as i think more of it it is not necessary to buy a lot of shares you could buy some shares sell them to another and buy from them again at a higher price in several iterations i think this could also work if you do it fast enough these scheme makes sense only you previously bought many shares at the low price possibly during several weeks once the price is pumped high enough you can start selling the shares you previously bought in the days preceding the pump

you can invest for yourself be your own boss make your own hours my boyfriend and i both trade for our personal income and we work from home and have these as our only jobs he chooses to work longer hours and devote more time to it because he values money over free time more than i do if you consciously choose what you value most the ratio of work time to free time you can make it your goal to secure a job which follows your values if you let your job dictate your hours values for you for example accepting a position somewhere because it will make you a lot of money but it will leave you with little free time you may be unhappy if that 's not what you want i think people have a lot more control over their happiness and work hours than they give themselves credit for good luck in your path

another factor to consider is that resale value of the laptop is quite bit more if it is still under warranty   this would apply to people who replace their laptop often it is higher because the purchaser can be assured they are not getting a lemon   i determined this by comparing prices on ebay before selling my computer of course if you keep your laptop longer than the warranty this means nothing   but for me it meant i could sell my old laptop quickly and for a better price because i used my laptop for work and totally depended on it even one day of downtime would cost me a lot so it was worthwhile to keep a relatively new laptop under warranty also for those using apple care there is an undocumented perk   apple covered an out of warranty repair on a time under my apple care for my laptop even tho they were not purchased at the same time

you could do a voluntary repossession while a repossession never looks good on your credit a voluntary repossession is slightly better a good friend of mine had a situation like this about 11 years ago   she was in an accident did n't have replacement coverage insurance and was left with a large chunk of debt on a wrecked vehicle that she then rolled into a new car in the end it came down to the simple fact that she could not afford a car loan on a vehicle that never was worth as much as she owed   since the car was worth less than the loan she really could n't sell it to fix the problem she called and arranged a voluntary repossession   she stopped making payments and parked the car till they came and picked it up   took about 4 months and 20 phone calls from her for them to come get it   in the mean time i purchased her a much older used but decent car for a couple thousand and she paid me back over the next year   the total she paid me back was less than the money she would have paid in the 4 months it took them to come get the car   in fact by the time they picked up the car she had paid back over half on the car i bought her yes the repossession did stay on her credit for seven years but during that time she was approved for a mortgage cellphone plans and credit cards etc   therefore i do n't know that it did that much damage to her credit when her car was sold at auction by the repo company it sold for much less than the loan amount technically she was on the hook for the remaining amount the outstanding balance on the loan was then sold several times to several different collection agencies over the years since then she has gotten letters every now and then demanding she pay the amount off she ignores these   most of these letters even included very favorable terms full forgiveness for 20 of the amount   at this point the statute time has run out on the debt so there is no recourse for anyone to collect from her the statute time limit varies from state to state   some states it is as long as 10 years in others it is as short as 3 years what this means is that counting from the date of the repossession of debt last payment or agreement to pay whichever is later if the statute period has elapsed and the lender collector has not filed a suit against you by the end of the period then they have effectively abandoned the debt and can not collect    find out what that period of time is in your state   if you can avoid the collection agencies till that period runs out you are scott free you just have to make sure that you do not ever send them any money or agree to pay them anything as this resets the calendar if you do not want to wait for the calendar to run out if you wait long enough you will probably be offered favorable terms to pay only a fraction of the remaining amount you just have to wait it out note i normally would not endorse anyone not paying off their debts   however sometimes it is necessary and it is for this type of situation that we have things like this and bankruptcy
