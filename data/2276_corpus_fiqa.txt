if it were possible for every person in the world to run their own business at the same time maybe you 'd have a point but that 's not how things work as it stands now there inherently must be more employees than business owners and the nature of that relationship inherently favours the owner a few laws in place to somewhat balance the scales is not a bad thing at the end of the day the employer was breaking the law and now they have to suffer the consequences

gt you said all terrorists are muslims which is not true at all because most acts of terror comes from right population   let 's keep it simple instead of a lengthy argument how many muslim terrorist attacks in the last year versus right wing and i am going to ask again please tell us about a right wing terrorist attack against general civilians   you think a rightwing would attack muslims if they did not attack westerners do you think rightwing attacks are more than muslim attacks are they even 1 of all attacks and harm   gt this is the core problem i am talking about this is why millions of germans slaughtered the jewish population this is the result of hate speech and hard right propaganda    gt swap jew with muslim   wow i agree with you that true hate speech by hitler and his movement made one of the most cultural and educated group of people into against jews despite jews being exact opposite of what they were portrayed in that hate speech   now when i say muslims are terrorists and other things against muslims do you think i have no basis for my hate speech and do i call to and kill all the muslims does anyone call for actions against all muslims   gt the crime rate of the refugees is actually a bit lower then the rate of the rest of the population so not big a problem    gt the overall crime rate rise significantly though since the start of the refugees crisis as a result of massive right wing activity    gt needles to say that the actual crime rate if jews in germany was no different then the non jew crime rate just as it is now with muslims   that 's not true refugees do more crime than germans i can prove it to you and you blame germans for crimes actually done by muslims you even go to the extra step to claim that jews will be as criminal as germans and refugees which is not true never was true   here 's the problem you really really really want to believe that jews germans and muslims are same this is not true check the news and statistics   japan norway hungary poland etc accept zero refugees and look at the problems they have with crime especially with the jews among them

incorrect as a given product or service becomes more complex to manufacture or support the cost of entry into that marketplace increases    any aspect of technology automatically tends towards increased barrier to entry even without regulation   increased barrier to entry requires larger investment means more risk means increased difficulty finding investment   consider computer processors in the 80s creating a processor that can compete in the fledgling marketplace against similarly available chips would cost maybe a few million   today creating a processor thousands of times more complex requiring much more complex chip of which there are a mere handful and bringing it to market to compete against that already have the infrastructure and programming history to support them would be nearly impossible and require billions   or you know you could look at the whole microsoft and intel locking out their competition from pc manufacturers by means of economic incentives or disincentives leading to a de facto monopoly that they can then abuse to force pc manufacturers to deal on their terms all possible without regulation

the short answer is yes electrical vehicles make logistical sense the batteries are n't quite where they should be to really push the market but the are high enough and the batteries themselves can be recycled    there are two major advantages that electric has over oil the first is that electricity is abundant and can come from many sources this means that a car can be running on power from coal wind solar hydro electric or any other source of electricity this also means that the cost per mile driven is generally lower than the cost of a gas driven car    another big advantage is the national security it offers if electric were to really enter the consumer market in a big way the dependency on countries in the middle east and africa would be lessened it would also ease some of the competition between nations like china and the united states over natural resources    of course their are problems with electric cars as well and they are n't even close to replacing gas for use in heavy machinery

there are 2 basic ways to have someone buy partial ownership of your company or if they buy shares that you already own then their shares will have the same rights as yours same voting rights same dividend rights etc if they buy shares newly created from the company they could be either identical shares to what you already own or they could be a new class of shares you may need to adjust the articles of incorporation if you did not plan ahead with multiple share classes you really need to talk to a lawyer tax accountant about this there are a lot of questions you need to consider here for example do you want to use the money in the business or would you rather have it personally are you concerned about losing some control of how the business is run what are the short term and long term tax consequences of each method what does your new partner want in terms of their share class the answers to these questions will be highly valuable and likely worth much more than the fees you will need to pay at the very least you will likely need a lawyer and accountant anyway to ensure the filings taxes are done correctly so better to involve them now rather than later there are many other situations to consider here and an online forum is not the best place to get advice that might put you in a sticky legal situation later on

this is a comment not an answer but it needs saying and does n't fit in the comment boxes owning is not always cheaper than renting   houses do n't always appreciate and in the early years of a loan you 're mostly paying interest so that too is lost money the time to buy a house is when you are reasonably sure you are n't going to move in the next five years or so you need something a rental ca n't give you you have at least 20 to put down so you avoid the pmi rip off you 've run a full budget including upkeep and insurance costs and are sure you can carry the house worst case including if you 're out of work for an extended time   i 've seen people lose a job and discover that they ca n't keep the house   and ca n't unload it quickly   good route toward bankruptcy houses are not a liquid asset and being house rich cash poor is potentially dangerous if you really hate apartments   remember that sometimes you can rent houses too often at lower cost per square foot basically do n't be into buying i rented for two decades before i bought and by while doing so i was able to put aside enough investments that i could have bought a half million dollar house for cash and was able to change cities several times without the stress of having to sell and re buy i missed out on the insane housing bubble   but i also avoided being hit when that crashed

just saw the video i think there will be less incentive for businesses and governments to allow automation to reach a point where the majority of the population is out of work it 's not hard to imagine why any economic system that puts automation above everything can end up in disarray excess automation will trigger the law of diminishing returns to kick in in end the system will have to regulate itself to survive    example pro automation and businesses increase investment in automation margins increase which leads to more spending and investment more workers are laid off the standard of living increases in the short run as more workers are getting laid off aggregate demand decreases and spending decreases leading to a recession    the glut of production the market further standard of living decreases income disparities between workers and sponsors of automation increase anti automation movements commence social conflict ensures production grinds to a near halt as unrest increases    now two things are possible either pro automation gives in to the pressure and introduce labor reforms full automation to allow job creation or they are ousted in a social revolution and an anti automation takes over automation is kept in check

my suggestion would be to do the math that is the best advice you can get when considering any investment   there are other factors you have n't considered too like the fact that interest rates are at extremely low levels right now so borrowing money is relatively cheap if you 're outside the us though that may be less of a consideration as the mortgage lending institutions in europe only tend to give 5-year locks on loan rates without requiring a premium you may be somewhere else in the world   you will probably struggle to do the actual math about the probability of the market going down or up but what you can do is this   figure out what it would cost you to cash out the investments you say your balance is $ 53,000 in various items congrats that 's a nice chunk of money but with commissions and taxes and etc it may reduce the value of your investments by 10 25 when you try to cash out those investments paying $ 3,000 to get that money out of the investments is one thing but if you 're sending $ 10,000 to the tax man when you sell this all off that changes the economics of your investments a lot in that case you might be better off seeing what happens if the markets correct by 10 you 'd still have more than if you sold out and paid major taxes once you know your down payment calculate the amount of property you could afford you know your down payment could be somewhere around $ 50,000 after taxes and other items at an loan to value ratio that 's about $ 250,000 of a property that you can qualify for assuming you could obtain the loan for $ 200,000   what could you buy for that do some shopping and figure out what your options are   once you have two or three potential properties figure out the answer to what would the property give you is it going to be rented out are you going to live there both   if you 're living in it then you come out ahead if the costs for the mortgage debt and the ongoing maintenance and repairs are less than what you currently pay in rent figure out what you pay right now to put a roof over your head will the place you could buy need repairs will you pay more on a mortgage for $ 200,000 usd in your local currency than what you currently do for housing do n't even factor in the possible appreciation of a house you when you 're making this kind of investment decision it could just as easily burn down as go up in value   if you would rent it what kind of rental would that be long term rental expect to pay for other people to break your stuff short term rental you can collect more money per tenant per day but you 'll end up with higher vacancy rates and people still break your stuff but do the math and see if you could collect enough in rent from a tenant person or business or whatever the properties are you could buy to cover the amount you are paying in debt plus what you would pay in taxes rent is income plus what you would need for maintenance plus insurance   if the numbers make sense then real estate can be a lucrative investment i own some investment properties myself it is a great hedge against inflation you can raise rents when contracts lapse usually and it is an excellent way to own a tangible item but if you do n't know the numbers and exactly how it would make you better off than sitting and hoping that the markets go up because they generally do over time then do n't take the jump

you 're 100 right the irr is the rate at which the project breaks even you project cash flow profitability metrics and then you see what under your projections is the discount rate at which your project breaks even the irr    but remember it breaks even today so it 's saying that you should make a worthwhile investment today because the return that you will obtain at points in the future are worth you putting your investment in today you still make a healthy return overtime if you project a reasonable irr but your irr is showing you whether it 's at least as worth it today to put your money in today whether given what you 'll make over the future it 's at least as worth it to put your money in today

the optimal time period is zero seconds   put it all in immediately   dollar cost averaging reduces the risk that you will be buying at a bad time no one knows whether now is a bad or great time but brings with it reduction in expected return because you will be keeping a lot of money in cash for a long time   you are reducing your risk and your expected return by dollar cost averaging it 's not crazy to trade expected returns for lower risk   people do it all the time   however if you have a pot of money you intend to invest and you do so over a period of time then you are changing your risk profile over time in a way that does n't correspond to changes in your risk preferences   this is contrary to finance theory and is not optimal   the optimal percentage of your wealth invested in risky assets is proportional to your tolerance for risk and should not change over time unless that tolerance changes dollar cost averaging makes sense if you are setting aside some of your income each month to invest   in that case it is simply a way of being invested for as long as possible   having a pile of money sitting around while you invest it little by little over time is a misuse of dollar cost averaging bottom line forcing dollar cost averaging on a pile of money you intend to invest is not based in sound finance theory   if you want to invest all that money do so now   if you are too risk averse to put it all in then decide how much you will invest invest that much now and keep the rest in a savings account indefinitely   do n't change your investment allocation proportion unless your risk aversion changes there are many people on the internet and elsewhere who preach the gospel of dollar cost averaging but their belief in it is not based on sound principles   it 's just a dogma the language of your question implies that you may be interested in sound principles so i have given you the real answer

i agree with you that you need to consolidate this debt using a loan it may be hard to find a bank or credit organization that will give you an unsecured personal loan for that much money   i know of one called lending club disclaimer i 'm an investor on this platform not trying to advertise it 's just the only place i know of off the top of my head that facilitates loans like this but instead of a bank financing the loan the loan is split up accross hundreds of investors who each contribute a small amount such as $ 25 they have rates anywhere between 5 30 based on your credit and i believe they have some loan amounts that go up to the area that you 're discussing   regarding buying the house the best thing you can do when trying to buy a house is to save up a 20 downpayment if at all possible below this amount you may be asked to pay for pmi private mortgage insurance this is a charge that does n't go away for quite a while until you 've paid them 20 of the appraised value of the home where you pay a premium because you did n't have the 20 downpayment for the house   i would suggest you try to eliminate your credit card debt as soon as possible and would recommend the same for your father getting your utilization down and the large debts with a loan will help to reduce interest charges and get you a reasonable fixed payment   whether you decide to pay off your own balances using your savings account is up to you if it were me personally i 'd do so immediately rather than trying to pay it off over time but if you lose money to taxes by withdrawing the money from your tax free savings account it may not be a beneficial situation   treat debt especially credit card debt like an emergency at all times and you 'll find yourself in a better place as a result   credit card debt and balances are and should be temporary and their rates and fees are structured that way if for any reason you expect that a credit card 's balance will remain for an extended period of time you may want to consider whether it would be advantageous for you to consolidate the debt into a loan instead

you can split payments and nobody judges you because most prepaid cards are actually gift cards   they just think you have generous friends    when you use visa mc at a vendor they get dinged around 2 3 plus 35 cents flat rate   so when you ask them to charge 77 cents to the card you 're essentially asking they give half of it to visa mc   which is unfair   a charity wo n't turn it down but it 's wasted   so how do you solve this problem   if you see a small merchant using square or paypal here their merchant agreements charge a flat rate 2.75 and respectively with no flat rate per transaction   if you see they are on paypal square go for it    obviously paypal itself does n't have that problem because they have a really really good deal with visa and mastercard   so feel free to buy yourself credit on your paypal account with these residual values    amazon probably has a similar deal    you are getting these small amounts because you aim to pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 25 on it   reasonable but it causes this    flip it around pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 20 on it consume the $ 20 value and pay the $ in cash   you may need to tell the cashier exactly the amount to charge e.g. $ 20.00 especially if it is a visa mc card   it will certainly go faster if you do   the cashier may be able to pull up the balance but it 's an extra procedure and an inexperienced cashier may struggle with it have to call the manager etc not worth it in my book

she seems to be paying an inordinate amount of money for car payments $ is just too high she may be able to get by on public transit depending on where she lives but if not she needs to look at selling her car and picking up a cheap second hand vehicle public transit would probably save her $ going to a cheaper car should still save her $ 300 $ 400/month next phone and cable these are certainly nice but they are rarely necessities i do not have cable for example i do have a cell phone and i do have internet a requirement of my job but no cable she may be able to save some money there my guess is that she could save $ here though i may be biased on how much it costs to heat a canadian home in our cold cold winters and of course the college payment $ 900 $ 1000 a month i understand that she is paying this so that your sister can attend college that 's very nice but it certainly sounds like your mother can not afford that on the other hand if this is repayment of college expenses already incurred there may be no choice here rent at $ i have no idea what that gets you in nj but perhaps she could rent out a room it 's not that she could bring in $ 1000/month from doing so though obviously that 's going to very much depend on the real estate rental market where you live alternatively she could move out and move in with someone else and that should certainly get her share of the rent down to $ 800 $ 1000/month or thereabouts and most likely cut her utility bills also i 've identified a number of places where she can save money no doubt the budget is tight but i think she 's spending on far more than just bare essentials one thing that concerns me here is that she appears to have no emergency funds and very little for entertainment other than cable if at all possible she needs to cut her budget down so that she is not living paycheque to paycheque and has money to cover for example emergency car repairs and i 'd really like to see her have more than $ 50/month for expenses which i 'm guessing is entertainment it may not be possible of course but i would most definitely say she should not be paying for your sister 's college if this places her in such dire financial risk easier said than done of course most certainly i would not even consider cutting the health insurance by the way another approach would be to look at how her expenses will go down when your sister is done school and perhaps cleared up other expenses it may be worth borrowing from family and friends knowing that in a year her expenses will go down $ 500/month that makes her budget manageable additionally the debt repayment presumably will finish at some point the point i 'm trying to make is that in a year her budget will be just about manageable and she may be able to get there with smaller in the immediate future

nobody would goto seaworld if they did n't have whale shows   that just the bottom line of reality 90 of people goto sea world because their kids want to sit in zone and see whales and jump around    if peoples kids do n't want to goto seaworld anymore they can go out on a date or something instead with that money    if they dropped the orca shows a bunch of hippie that would n't be caught dead in a sea park would be really happy and keep not going to seaworld while the thousands of children that basically keep their business afloat would rapidly loose interest and they would have to just become another 2 hours away from a bigger better six flags   i do n't like the orca shows anymore than you do but if 2 or 3 whales living in sub optimal conditions helps keep marine science research and development afloat i think it 's worth it even if their conditions where 5x shittier     seriously nobody cares about 100 's of thousands of starving children or the million people kept in a shittier tank in gaza but some uncomfortable whales that almost single keep funding up for projects that are saving millions of sea creatures are a huge deal    edit downvote me all you want it does n't make it less true that 90 of their visitors could n't give a single fuck about orca conditions

i recommend pulling up a retirement calculator and having an honest conversation about how long term savings works and the power of compound interest just by playing around with the on an online calculator you can demonstrate how the early years are the most important depending on how much they make now and are considering saving delaying 5 10 years can easily leave 6 7 figures on the table if it 's specifically a child or close family member i recommend pulling up your retirement account talk with them about how you managed it and how much you were putting in perhaps show them how much is the principal and how much is interest if you did well tell them how if you did n't do as well as you liked tell them what you would have done differently finally discuss a bit of psychology even if they do n't have a professional job and are making minimum wage getting into the habit of saving makes it easier when they eventually make more a couple of dollars a month is n't much but getting into the habit makes it easier to save a couple hundred dollars a month later on

they are entirely free to do whatever they want with the shares in particular they can sell them to whomever they choose no restrictions on who can sell when and to whom are a common thing with startups publicly traded companies are regulated in a much stricter way than private companies so until the ipo the sales are limited to the otc markets but even that can be restricted by bylaws for example ownership can only be limited to a group of investors approved by the board as an employee your grant was approved by the board but when you come to sell the buyer was not and the company may not agree to vet them bottom line is that it is not illegal to impose all kinds of restrictions on what the employees can do with their shares as long as the shares are not listed on a public stock exchange even after the company goes ipo with one class other classes may remain restricted

first off you have done very well to be in your financial position at your age congratulations   i first started investing seriously about 10 years ago and when i started i had a similar attitude to you learning how to invest is a journey and it will take you a while to learn both the intellectual and emotional sides of investing first off there is nothing wrong with having a chunk of cash that you are n't investing effectively it is far better to be losing earning power wrt inflation that it is to make a bad investment where you can lose all your money quite quickly i have perhaps 15 of my capital just sitting around right now because i do n't have any place where i 'm excited to put it for your ira i would look at the options you have and choose one that is reasonably well diversified and has low costs in most cases an index fund is a reasonable choice my 401 k goes into an s&p 500 index fund and i do n't have to worry about it beyond that i suggest spending some time learning about investing and then making some small and conservative investments i 've learned a lot from the motley fool web site

firstly most option traders do n't want to actually buy or sell the underlying stock this is completely utterly false perhaps the problem is that you are only familiar with the buy side of options trading on the sell side of options trading an options desk engages in delta hedging when we sell an option to a client we will also buy an appropriate amount of underlying to match the delta position of the option during the life time of the option we will readjust our hedge position whenever the delta changes those who follow black scholes will know that normally that comes from underlying price changes however we lose money on each underlying change we have to cross the bid ask spread for each trade that is why we lose money when there is volatility that is why we are said to be short vega or short volatility so one way to think about buying options is that you are paying someone to execute a specific trading strategy in general those who sell options are also happy to buy options back at a discount of course so we make a profit but when doing so we need to our hedging position and that again incurs a cost to us the bank finally since this is money stackexchange rather than finance you are most likely referring to warrants rather than options which are listed on stock exchanges the exchange in most regions give us very specific and restrictive regulations that we must abide by one very common one is that we must always list a price which we are willing to buy the warrants back at which may not be an unreasonable spread from the sell price since an option is a synthetically created investment instrument when we buy back the option from the investor we simply unwind the underlying hedging positions that we booked to the options with source i 've worked 2 years on a warrant desk as a desk developer

the car deal makes money 3 ways if you pay in one lump payment if the payment is greater than what they paid for the car plus their expenses they make a profit they loan you the money you make payments over months or years if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car plus their expenses plus their finance expenses they make money of course the money takes years to come in or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount you trade in a car and they sell it at a profit of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car they or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance or you buy lots of expensive dealer options some dealers wave two deals in front of you get a 0 interest loan these tend to be shorter 12 months vs or even 72 months the shorter length makes it harder for many to afford if you ca n't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget pay cash and get a rebate if you take the rebate you ca n't get the 0 loan if you take the 0 loan you ca n't get the rebate the price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit the key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in do n't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized otherwise they will adjust the price rebate interest rate length of loan   and trade in value to maximize their profit the suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one if you get a loan for 2 from your bank credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer it will cost less in total than the 0 loan from the dealer the key is to get the loan approved by the bank credit union before meeting with the dealer the money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer

your credit score is really bad and it 's highly unlikely anyone will be willing to give you a mortgage especially if you still have bad debt showing up on your credit report what would help well clearing off any bad debt would be a good place to start ideally you want to get your credit rating up above though that may be optimistic here note though that bad debt falls off your credit report after a while exactly how long depends on your province note that making partial payment or even just acknowledging the debt will reset the timer however i mention this though because you mention some of your debt is from 5 or 6 years ago it may be just about to fall off it would also help if you can show that your credit is so bad because of mistakes from a number of years ago but you 've been making payments and staying on top of all debts for the past few years if that 's the case also it would help if you had a reasonable downpayment 20 minimum but you 'll be a lower credit risk if you are able to put down 50 75 you could also consider having someone with good credit co sign the mortgage note that most people will not be willing to do this as they take on substantial financial risk all that said there are some institutions which specialise in dealing with no credit or bad credit customers you pay more fees and will pay a vastly higher interest rate but this may be a good option for you check out mortgage brokers specialising in high risk clients you can also consider a rent to own but almost all the advice i 've ever seen say to avoid these if you can one late payment and you may lose all the equity you think you 've been building up note that things may be different if you are moving from the u.s. to canada and have no credit history in canada in that case you may have no credit rather than bad credit most banks still wo n't offer you a mortgage in this case but some lenders do target recent immigrants do n't rule out renting for many people regardless of their credit rating renting is a better option the monthly payments may be lower you do n't need a downpayment you do n't have to pay realtor and legal fees and pay again if you need to move a couple of sites provide more information on how your credit rating affects your possibility of getting a mortgage and how to get mortgages with bad credit and along with

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

very rarely would an investor be happy with a 4 yield independent of anything else that might happen in the future for example if in 3 years for some reason or other inflation explodes and 30 year bond yields go up to 15 across the board they would be kicking themselves for having locked it up for 30 years at 4 however if instead of doing that the investor put their money in a 3 year bond at 3 say they would have the opportunity to reinvest in the new rate environment which might offer higher or lower yields this eventually leads fixed income investors to have a bond portfolio in which they manage the average maturity of their bond portfolio to be somewhere between the two extremes of investing it all in super short low yield money market rates vs. super long term bonds as they constantly monitor and manage their maturing investments it inevitably leads them to managing interest rate risk as they decide where to reinvest their incremental coupons by looking at the shape of the yield curve at the time and determining what kind of risk reward tradeoffs they would have to make

gt;1 the us mint is a private business there 's your first flaw of any argument about currency before we talk further   policies are set by the us congress and the mint operates under the of the us treasury you do n't point out how any of this relates to anything so i guess no point in going any further    that small percentage value of the penny not being worth your time is a huge fallacy it might not be worth anything to him but i generally would be intent on getting a few cents back that are due to me similarly using his example of 3 cents adding 2 seconds to the transaction ends up at a rate of $ that 's quite a bit of money to be considered   if we assume that any penny related transaction is equally likely to have 1 4 pennies involved and we take the 2 second figure as accurate then we come up with $ 45 per hour however there is the time of the cashier and anyone behind you to consider that 2 seconds is multiplied by everyone but only you get the pennies if we figure you have to wait as often as you receive pennies on the whole then the figure gets slashed i 'm guessing under $ 10 an hour    your figure also fails to account for what would happen if the penny were removed from circulation most likely outcome would be that transactions where you 'd make 1 or 2 pennies would be rounded down and transactions where you 'd have gained 3 or 4 pennies would be rounded up you are n't actually on the whole gaining or losing any money at all    no machines take pennies fair enough not really the fault of the penny itself but more so a fault of inflation   this is n't about establishing guilt pennies are tools and symbols if they do n't serve their purpose then maybe we should consider removing them    supposing the penny does get removed the axe gets held above the neck of the nickle inevitably then the dime and so on    so   also see a massive disruption in handling of accounting principles and tax rates due to being forced into rates all adjustable yes but it does cause a whole new mess of issues in it 's own right   this can be acknowledged one might take issue with massive but a transition would not be free of labor and education costs    lincoln 's face has nothing to do with this argument 25 seconds worth of video wasted that 's about 35 pennies worth   maybe it did n't hit home with you but the obviously felt he was addressing someone 's concern the psychological impact of change or the not strictly to traditions or history would have to be taken into account in a fair evaluation of implementing a big change

the entire time you 've talked about cost changing incomes matters little if the cost scales with it me thinks you do n't understand how a market works even a semi planned one if more people make more money the price of most goods goes up this is n't due to real actual demand its due to something called inflation when the amount of money in circulation increases we have inflation lets say i make 35k a year as a store clerk is my labor being undervalued compared to the income of a store clerk in the past or is the price of goods scaling faster than my income has scaled   simply adding more money does n't fix anything the price of the good or service is what matters the most while everyone having more money is good you ca n't just magically give everyone more money without the cost of goods and services rising i imagine that if everyone suddenly were at least a millionaire the price of a laptop would sky rocket the cost of the laptop in parts would n't be that much more but since most people would have disposable income beyond their needs some goods would then get more expensive once that happens the inflation of prices starts to spread until its effects are seen across the market   i do n't think the fruit of my labor is being stolen by the upper class if anything the fruit of my labor gets taken more and more by my own government and transferred to the lower classes more and more i 'm not rich not even close but i know i 've had at least 15k of my income in the last 5 years taken and distributed through taxes on my income to people that are generally unable to earn enough on their own   if these people are the upper class then i must be

first it depends on your broker   full service firms will tear you a new one discount brokers may charge   you 'll have to check with your broker on assignment fees theoretically this is the case of the opposite of my answer in this question are underlying assets supposed to be sold bought immediately after being bought sold in call put option your trading strategy reasoning for your covered call notwithstanding in your case as an option writer covering in the money calls you want to hold and pray that your option expires worthless   as i said in the other answer there is always a theoretical premium of option price + exercise price to underlying prices no matter how slight right up until expiration so on that basis it does n't pay to close out the option however there 's a reality that i did n't mention in the other answer if it 's a deep in the money option you can actually put a bid < stock price exercise price trade fee and hope for the best since the market makers rarely bid above stock price exercise price for illiquid options but it 's unlikely that you 'll beat the market makers + hft   they 're systems are too fast i know the philly exchange allows you to put in implied volatility orders but they 're expensive and i could n't tell you if a broker exchange allows for dynamic orders with the equation i specified above but it may be worth a shot to check out however it 's unlikely that such a low order would ever be filled since you 'll at best be lined up with the market makers and it would require a big player dumping all its holdings at once to get to your order if you 're doing a traditional true blue covered call there 's absolutely nothing wrong being assigned except for the tax implications   when your counterparty calls away your underlyings it is a sell for tax purposes if you 're not covering with the underlying but with a more complex spread things could get hairy for you real quick if someone were to exercise on you but that 's always a risk   if your broker is extremely strict they may close the rest of your spread for you at the offer   in illiquid markets that would be a huge percentage loss considering the wide bid ask spreads

i know an answer has been accepted but you need an emergency fund ideally enough to cover at least 3 months of after tax basic living expenses as a free 6 months would be even better this is n't a fun way to tie up your money but it is a prudent way what if you lose your job or decide you want to change your line of work what if you 're told a close family member has only months to live and you want to take significant time off unpaid what if your car breaks down and you need a new one what if your freelance business hits a dry patch for a few months what if you want to move but ca n't sell your next house quickly i 've known people who had these types of situations come up unexpectedly some were financially prepared and had the freedom to make the choices they wanted to make others did n't and now have regrets once you have a basic emergency fund in place then go for investing with the rest of the money best of luck

i agree with the dave ramsey method as well if you do n't have $ 1k in the bank already do that   total up the smaller debts and the best buy card   if they are $ 4k all together then pay them off   do n't get caught up in keeping the smaller one around because they are at zero percent   if they exceed $ 4k then payoff the interest bomb best buy card then pay off the smaller ones starting with the smaller balance   that is the only tweak i will make here   dropping any amount into the citi balance is pointless because it only reduces the amount not the total number of hands reaching into your bank account

a lot of people in this thread have provided excellent information from a public company 's perspective with respect to wacc etc but i 'll chime in from a private company 's perspective specifically a tech start up   two reasons a private company would prefer to receive financing in the form of debt as opposed to equity   1 it ca n't sell equity at a good valuation or at all in this case the company may have no choice but to raise debt financing using assets as collateral and also diverting future cash flows away from growth initiatives for the sake of servicing the debt this is obviously a bad situation for the company also because debt is senior to equity in the case of a bankruptcy owners would only be able to recover money from the sale of the company liquidation after debt owners have been paid   2 the company 's owners do n't want to further dilute their ownership stakes and are willing to have the company pay interest to avoid it sometimes private company owners will take on debt with the purpose of buying out other owners in some other cases the company 's management thinks equity in their company will increase in value disproportionately to what investors might give it credit for in these cases the math is simple projected valuation growth versus the valuation financing is available at taking into account the interest paid on the debt

there s some major logic missing from this report it did nt mention how technology is disrupting how everything is being distributed as businesses become more efficient with technological advances and less dependent on human capital then so must humans become more efficient and less dependent upon an expected level of income what s the demand to keep a human alive and well versus the demand for needing a well paid human laborer if you are easily then your value to the company is simply cheap labor best example is walmart the wealthiest family the largest employer whose many employees require gov assistance to live due to low wages the only way this business could even exist is with from the goverment to support its workers so where do these tax subsidies come from the article responded with a great point there will never be piles and piles of valuable goods laying around with no one to enjoy them whoever said that has never been to walmart with no money i suppose there will always be someone around to enjoy them but will there also be less and less people who can afford to enjoy such things walmart has already shown what happens this article points out the old ways of doing things economically but ignores the fact technology creates abundance not scarcity were not currently using that abundance to directly improve humanity on a large scale level but rather the opposite to control supply or scarcity aka profits when the demand to maintain amp control financial power the desire to care amp provide for your neighbor then the rise of inequality and options appear this buying power is the component of influence to being able to survive very well or simply even remain alive if my daily wage does nt provide for my daily needs then how can i use technology to stay alive how efficient can we all become before we start to share in the abundance of life together

the contract should address this issue it will specify the types of remedies and damages that would result if either side tries to back out of the deal there can be monetary penalties and the courts can force the seller to complete the deal where i have experienced this it generally takes only a gentle reminder from the agent regarding the consequences there is also limited indirect protection via the contract between the seller and their real estate agent many times that contract will require the seller to pay the agent their commission if there is n't a valid reason to cancel the deal the contract was to find a fully qualified buyer the threat of having to pay 6 of list price to the agent and not selling the house can be enough to get them to complete the deal all this assumes there was fraud which could bring in criminal penalties

you can withdraw from your rrsp to pay your taxes while not necessarily advisable it is permitted yet the tax consequences are no different just because you happen to be using the money to pay a prior year 's income tax balance due when you make the withdrawal from your rrsp an amount will be withheld towards your income tax for the withdrawal year assuming you have other income then you are likely to owe cra even more than the amount withheld because the withdrawal is effectively taxed at your marginal rate in that case consider the withholding tax merely a downpayment you 'll figure the final amount due when you file your next income tax return e.g. if you were to withdraw money from your rrsp today in 2015 to pay your 2014 income tax balance due then on your 2015 income tax return you 'll need to declare the withdrawn amount as income for 2015 you 'll get credit for the withholding taxes already paid when you made the withdrawal your tax return will indicate how much more you 'll need to pay to settle your 2015 taxes if you then pay your 2015 income tax balance due with an rrsp withdrawal in 2016 then repeat better to save up funds elsewhere e.g. in a bank account or a tfsa to cover an anticipated income tax balance owing

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

this would inevitably lead to a few gatekeepers from which everyone trusts the bonds ibm ge etc and millions of small businesses which will have absolutely no access to capital once this happens you will quickly end up with a shadow banking system where companies like ge switch from making stuff to basically being banks giving loans to other small businesses with no access to capital etc    this is basically done in china in a slightly different way but the core state owned enterprises have near unlimited access to capital and they use this advantage to invest in and buy up any and all interesting companies simply because they 're the only organizations that can essentially print money whether you agree with it being printing money or not the fact is ge ibm would be able to issue bonds almost whenever they want similar to the treasury 's monthly bond auctions and other firms simply unable to    so then you have a few key companies with nearly unlimited right to print used loosely cash they use this advantage to push on other businesses buy them up or control them in many ways and then they use this position to eventually take over anything that looks interesting    what you 're imagining as being an open market where everyone 's bonds have full information will quickly devolve into information overload and people choosing the well known brands as their trusted source once that happens the whole idea falls apart and those few firms will find a way to control not only the money supply but also who gets to use their money    you will also have situations where some mom and pop takes john llc bonds as payment for dinner and when they try to give john llc bonds to their suppliers their suppliers say no thanks we only deal in ibm bonds    mom and pop will find themselves stuck with paper that nobody wants to accept and mom and pop will quickly find themselves in a cash flow crisis as they have tons of paper but none of their suppliers will accept that paper    the only way to get out of this situation would be to convince ibm or ge to give mom and pop some ge bonds in exchange for the john llc they have that nobody will accept of course ge and ibm being in the position as some of the few trusted money printers can refuse to accept john llc bonds except at a severe discount we know john gave you john llc bonds to pay for his dinner worth $ 100 but we 'll only give you $ 40 worth of ge bonds for it   mom and pop will quickly be fucked and go out of business due to having no hard currency aka trusted currency that they can use to purchase their raw materials   demand for ge bonds will skyrocket as everyone seeks a safe haven a trusted currency almost everyone will accept adn ge will find the entire market begging them to print bonds even at no interest just so that the money supply can increase to hold the full amount of trade occurring in the territory    this is then no different from the fed during the recession a few years ago and up until now where they sell tons of bonds at rock bottom interest rates because all the world is looking for a safe place to put their cash    the difference of course is that ge ibm can take all this money and issue themselves huge bonuses either on the cash directly or on the profit they 've amassed by being the only trusted money issuer whereas government officials can not

i wo n't make any assumptions about the source of the money   typically however this can be an emotional time and the most important thing to do is not act if this is an amount of money you have never seen before getting advice from a fee only financial adviser would be my second step   the first step is to breathe and promise yourself you will not make any decisions about this money in the short term   better to have $ 100 k in the bank earning nearly zero interest than to spend it in the wrong way if you have to receive the money before you can meet with an adviser then just open a new savings account at your bank or credit union and put the money in there   it will be safe and sound visit and interview at least three advisers with their guidance think about what your goals are   do you want to invest and grow the money   pay off debt   own a home or new large purchase   these are personal decisions but the adviser might help you think of goals you did n't imagine create a plan and execute it

i assume you 're talking about a sell order not a buy order when you place a limit sell order your order is guaranteed to be placed at that price or higher   if the market is currently trading much higher than the price of your sell order then your mistakenly low limit order will be essentially a market order and will be filled at   the current bid price so the only way this is a problem is if you want to place a limit sell that is much higher than the current market but mistakenly place a limit lower than the current market

tax cuts do lead to economic growth and why not   more money circulating in the private economy is good for everybody   it ’s why the stock market is up big on the prospect for tax cuts   the problem is the rosy growth projections that accompany these plans   the growth will occur but the pace of growth is a big question and very hard to model   so a prudent policy proposal would be to cut spending as well while the growth   then hopefully that spending cut becomes permanent as the economy grows so the private economy grows at the expense of the state

most of the consumer products that you buy at retail these days are commodity priced and have been for a long time margins are thin so if there are retail salespeople about their compensation is n't coming from the tv or computer with a 6 gross margin it comes from the extended warranty programs which are not insurance and do not have regulated underwriting standards which are typically sold at a 65 95 gross margin so that $ 200 warranty most likely costs the retailer $ 50 the salesman gets $ 15 25 i paid for my college education working at a selling these things along with other high margin items that paid commission in most cases you are n't getting much coverage anyway most products carry a 1 year warranty and using most gold or platinum credit cards doubles a manufacturer 's warranty by up to 1 year so with most transactions you are already walking away with a 2 year warranty   warranties or service plans make sense for durable goods that cost alot and are expected to last a long time and/or require regular maintenance i think they especially make sense if your budget is really tight a fixed maintenance cost can be an asset to some people because they can plan around it examples of this include service plans for a furnace boiler or water heater or a car if you 're buying a manufacturer endorsed service maintenance plan from a dealer

bargaining existed before the government officially granted people that right    collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   gt;however we 've been through that in this country and child labor unsafe working conditions and 80 hour weeks    i r business to this claim made by another redditor as well   gt;the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   labor is something that needs to disappear on its own in response to changing economic conditions if you introduced a law prohibiting child labor in a poor country like cambodia right now it would lead to widespread hardship and an increase in mortality   gt;in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good   nothing good comes for the country from using the threat of violence as all laws do to deny people a right to manage their own property how they see fit   gt;like all laws there is a balance to be struck between individual rights and the common good and what can be seen as a right for one can often be seen as a right to violate another 's rights for someone else   there is no game reason to assume or empirical evidence that suggests that violating people 's property ownership rights leads to a greater betterment of the common good than would have happened with property ownership rights intact   gt;&gt;the mighty is those who use the force of government or the threat of violence e.g. violent strikes to prevent another party from exercising their contract liberty and firing them   gt;this is some pretty extreme hyperbole and hard to take seriously   as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   membership in this country has dwindled to around 10 down from around 50 during the middle of the century and the erosion of the middle class has been the undeniable result   because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place    in no union dominated industries did unions fade due to greater power by employers vehicle manufacturing low value high volume consumer goods manufacturing ship building passenger rail service us steel in all of these industries the number of unionized employees declined because the industries themselves contracted in the us   the force of government you know we may have the right to strike in this country but there 's no law that says a company ca n't hire replacement workers indefinitely   the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union   of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here   this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union   now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   when you look at the wealth disparity in this country it 's pretty hard to argue that the right to collective bargaining has resulted in an unfair advantage for workers   collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees

if you 're looking for some formula i do n't think one exists people talk about this all the time and give conflicting advice if there was a proven accurate formula they would n't be debating it there are basically 3 reasons to do a home improvement project a correct a problem so that you prevent on going damage to your home for example have a leaking roof or replaced or such a job is worthwhile if the cost of fixing the problem is less than the cost of future damage in the case of my termite and leaking roof examples this is almost always worth doing lesser maintenance problems might be more debatable similarly some improvements may reduce expenses like replacing an old furnace with a newer model may cut your heating bills here the question is how long does it take to repay the investment compared to other things you might invest your money in just to make up numbers suppose you find that a new furnace will save you $ 500 per year if the new furnace costs $ 2000 then it will take 4 years to pay for itself i 'd consider that a good investment if that same $ 2000 furnace will only cut your heating bills by $ 100 per year then it will take 20 years to pay for itself you 'd probably be better off putting the $ 2000 into the stock market and using the gains to help pay your heating bill b increase the resale value of your home if you are paying someone else to do the work the harsh reality here is almost no job will increase the resale value by more than the cost of getting the job done i 've seen many articles over the years citing studies on this i think most conclude that kitchen remodeling comes closet to paying for itself and bathrooms come next new windows are also up there i do n't have studies to prove this but my guesses would be replacing something that is basically nice with a different style will rarely pay for itself like replacing oak cabinets with cherry cabinets replacing something that is in terrible shape with something decent is more likely to pay back than replacing something decent with something beautiful like if you have an old iron that 's and falling apart replacing it may pay off if you have a 5-year old that 's in good shape but is not premium top of the line replacing it with a premium will probably do very little for resale value if you can do a lot of the work yourself the story changes many home improvement jobs do n't require a lot of materials but do require a lot of work if you do the labor you can often get the job done very cheaply and it 's likely that the increase in resale value will be more than what you spend for example most of my house has hardwood floors lots of people like pretty hardwood floors i just the floors in two rooms it cost me i do n't know maybe $ 20 or $ 30 for stain and some i 'm sure if i tried to sell the house tomorrow i 'd get my twenty bucks back in higher sale value realtors often advise sellers to paint again if you do it yourself the cost of paint may be a hundred dollars and it can increase the sale price of the house by thousands of course if you do the work yourself you have to consider the value of your time c to make your home more pleasant to live in this is totally subjective you have to make the decision on the same basis that you decide whether anything that is not essential to survival is worth buying to some people a bottle of fancy imported wine is worth thousands even millions of dollars others ca n't tell the difference between a $ 10,000 wine and a $ 15 wine   the thing to ask yourself is how important is this home improvement to me compared to other things i could do with the money like suppose you 're considering spending $ 20,000 remodeling your kitchen what else could you do with $ 20,000 you could buy a car go on an elaborate vacation eat out several times a week for years retire a little earlier etc no one can tell you how much something is worth to you any given home improvement may involve a combination of these factors like say you 're considering that $ 20,000 kitchen remodeling say you somehow find out that this will increase the resale value by $ 15,000 if the only reason you were considering it was to increase resale value then it 's not worth it you 'd lose $ 5,000 but if you also want the nicer kitchen then it is fair to say okay it will cost me $ 20,000 but ultimately i 'll get $ 15,000 of that back so in the long run it will only cost me $ 5,000 is having a nicer kitchen worth $ 5,000 to me note by the way that resale value only matters if and when you sell the house if you expect to stay in this house for 20 years any improvements done are very long term investments if you live in it until you die the resale value may matter to your heirs

first there will always be people who think the market is about to crash it does n't really crash very often when it does crash they always say they predicted it well even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while you could go short short selling stocks which requires a margin account that you have to qualify for typically you can only short up to half the value of your account in the us and if you 've maxed out your margin limits and your account continues to drop in value you risk a margin call which would force you to cover your shorts which you may not be able to afford you could invest in a fund that does the shorting for you you could also consider actually buying good investments while their prices are low since you can not predict the start or end of a crash you should consider dollar cost averaging until your stocks hit a price you 've pre determined is your trigger then purchase larger quantities at the bargain prices the equity markets have never failed to recover from crashes ever

gt why are you against making sure their pensions are funded   pension actuarial analyst here   pensions can give employee 's benefits for time worked long before the plan came into existence   those liabilities are paid off over 30 40 years   it 's absolutely normal   in addition pension plans may also pay off increases in benefits such as an early retirement window over that same 30 40 years   pension funds use assumptions on future investment earnings to guess their contribution   sometimes they do n't earn as much as they expect the plan to earn   sometimes they try to keep contributions low as an alternative to the plan   so putting this all together   if pension plans are instantly and always 100 funded   you do n't get pension plans with defined and guaranteed retirement benefits   you get plans where the employee defers their own money into accounts with no particular guarantees at all   and that 's why we are fine with unfunded pensions   oh by the way the pbgc charges higher fees to covered pension plans that have more unfunded liability   so if a company does n't want to pay contributions they have to pay more elsewhere   it all out

i do n't know whether you 'd consider buying a single bond instead of a fund strips are treasuries where the coupons have been stripped to produce debt instruments with a fixed maturity date they pay zero interest their value comes from the fact that you buy them at a price less than 100 and they are worth exactly 100 at some point in the future you can buy them with any year month that you wish they are backed by the federal government and are considered to have no default risk like most bonds the price is actually a percentage and they mature at a 100 the one that expires costs and returns 100 on the expiration date the price list is here there 's more information about them here first of all they are still t bonds in all but the most    sense which means they are the safest most risk free investment    possible the u.s. federal government has stellar credit and a record    of never defaulting these bonds have no call features so the timing and distribution of    bond payments can not be altered by any foreseeable occurrence they are sold at a known and generally deep discount off a known    face value that can be redeemed at a known date so buyers know    exactly how much they will earn from an investment in strips

tl;dr because eventually the cc issuer will pass the fraud bill to the customer in the form of increased fees and/or taxes even with no liability in the case of fraud the customer should put effort into security measures with their card the expense from fraud may be the sole burden of the credit issuer bank as per ben miller 's answer but this expense will someday find its way into the customer 's pockets disclosure i work at a bank a banks best ability probably is risk management the ones that were bad at this probably went under in the last four decades with regulations such as sox and others it is impossible for a bank to neglect risk management every expense including operational losses a bank incurs will reflect in increased fees interest rates for the customers so in the case of a sharp raise of credit card fraud the banks will soon take measures to reduce these losses that may mean canceling the cards of high risk groups of customers increasing fees or interest a particular customer that is often the target of fraud way more than the average for that customer 's demographic will probably see his card not renewed or even cancelled or his limits decreased and/or rates fees going up

the united nations is already working on stripping us of our world reserve currency status so are the brics people think we need to maintain the status quo and give a specific country the world reserve currency there are serious discussions to create a neutral global currency so no country has an edge   i found a lot of posts on the topic but am linking to a really interesting post from a well known publication   gt;the us dollar is getting close to losing its status as the world ’s reserve currency should it cross the line the 2008 financial crisis could look like a summer storm yes worries about insolvency in europe dominate the headlines last week standard amp poor ’s cut spain ’s bond rating to a clear sign that europe ’s financial crisis is far from over but america ’s escalating debt problem is far more likely to a truly global crisis because the dollar has for decades played such a central role in the world economy how bad is the us problem former treasury official lawrence recently pointed out that investors are us bonds and notes the lack of other buyers forced the federal reserve to buy a stunning 61 percent of the total net issuance of us government debt last year like many others he warns that ballooning debt puts the us economy at risk for a sharp correction   reuters the greenback ’s losing to the yuan   but the even larger risk is the potential loss of the dollar ’s reserve currency status a key support of the world economy for the last four decades it started with the 1973 saudi commitment to accept only us dollars as payment for oil followed by opec ’s 1975 agreement to trade only in dollars trading of other commodities came to be priced in dollars reinforcing the dollar ’s reserve status as a result central banks worldwide have held onto large reserves of dollars to facilitate trade that in turn has enabled the us to print much larger amounts of its currency with seemingly little inflationary consequences it ’s also made it easier for americans to import more than they export to consume more than they produce and to spend more than they earn but all that is changing rapidly a number of countries are abandoning the dollar for the chinese yuan last december japan and china agreed to trade in yen and yuan in january the 10 nations of the association of southeast asian nations finalized a non dollar credit agreement equivalent to $ 240 billion strengthening their links with china japan and south korea that same month chinese premier signed a currency swap agreement with the united arab which holds 7 percent of the world ’s oil reserves iran has agreed to accept rubles and yuan in trade with russia and china and now is trading oil with india in rupees and gold in late march the china development bank agreed with its counterparts in brazil russia india and south africa to eschew dollar lending and extend credit to each other in their own respective currencies with global demand for dollars falling central banks around the world will inevitably reduce their dollar reserves that selloff further weakens the dollar against other currencies and in turn drives up inflation all this comes as us federal debt is soaring adding to concerns about the future value of that debt and of the dollar it ’s suddenly much easier to imagine a dollar collapse which would be a highly unexpected occurrence known as a black swan event this would unprecedented disruption because the dollar remains the world ’s most important currency let ’s hope we can avert a global crisis triggered by reckless us government spending what ’s needed is new leadership in washington with the courage to get our fiscal house in order and to defend the dollar against attack in a competitive global market   here is another opinion on the topic   edit let me add if we are constantly adding stimulus from the central banks we are going to be seriously the faith the rest of the world has in us as well the fed was the buyer of what like 10 of our bonds before the crisis now they are buying 60 we have using quantitative easing and stimulus for three years to fix the economy if we were suddenly having a recovery that would be fine because people would know we would be ready to start paying down our debts however we have spent trillions and our gdp growth is about two thirds the average since that 's a sign that there is something wrong with our economy right now clearly not an argument to end stimulus because without it we would be in a major depression the problem is that once people realize that they will question how stable our economy really is   your argument that we are the most stable economy in the world and deserve the reserve currency status is circular logic we have had the reserve currency status since 1944 that has helped us maintain the stability the rest of the world has n't enjoyed for a very long time without it we may never have become anything near the country we are today it gave us access to tremendous capital which we were able to use to expand our nation incredibly we have built an empire on our ability to take on massive amounts of debt i am sure we would have been a superpower without it but no one can say how much or how harder other recessions would have been if we had never been granted that privilege

so you do n't want to know about a gas leak in a building if that leak has n't caused the building to explode for the last 6 years    and when he is talking explosion he 's not talking the once every 10 year recession   he 's talking 1929 1937 1945 and specifically says bigger than say 1974 or 2008   where are you getting the 10 year crap   seriously is that what you 're saying   or are you saying that you just do n't believe there is a gas leak   i 'm addressing the former   the ignition source will probably not be within the us unless long term bond yields increase substantially   the ignition source will be from a recession in china or from japanese yields increasing from currency risk or default risk   the japanese crisis has been 20 years in the making     however with the current debt gdp of japan and the structure of chinese total debt govt + corporate + personal and the recognition that these are the top two gdp 's in the world the dangers for the world are undeniably larger than ever

the japanese stock market offers a wide selection of popular etfs tracking the various indices and sub indices of the tokyo stock exchange   see this page from the japan exchange group site for a detailed listing of the etfs being offered on the tokyo exchange as you have suggested one would expect that japanese investors would be reluctant to track the local market indices because of the relatively poor performance of the japanese markets over the last couple of decades   however this does not appear to be the case   in fact there seems to be a heavy bias towards tokyo indices as measured by the nav market cap of listed etfs   the main tokyo indices the broad and the large cap nikkei dominate investor choice the big five etfs tracking the nikkei 225 have a total net asset value of yen usd while the big four etfs tracking the have a total net asset value of yen usd   compare this to the small net asset values of those tokyo listed etfs tracking the s&p500 or the euro stoxx 50   for example the largest s&p500 tracker is the asset management s&p500 etf with net asset value of just usd and almost zero liquidity   if i remember my stereotypes correctly it is the japanese housewife that controls the household budget and investment decisions and the japanese housewife is famously conservative and patriotic with their investment choices   japanese government bonds have yielded next to nothing for as long as i can remember yet they remain the first choice amongst   the 1.3 yield on a nikkei 225 etf looks positively generous by comparison and so will carry some

in most cases the other classes of shares are preferred stock example jpm f preferred stock usually pays higher dividends and shareholders get preferential treatment in the event that the company goes under preferred shareholders are behind bondholders in line but ahead of common stock holders in other cases different classes of shares have different voting rights or pricing examples include berkshire hathaway b shares in the case of berkshire hathaway b shares the stock has of the rights and of the voting rights of an a share   you need to be cautious about investing in anything other than common stock make sure that you understand what you are getting into this is not to say that other share classes are bad just that many preferred stocks are thinly traded and are difficult to buy and sell

everyone buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price no matter who you are there are a few important things you need to understand example eve bid 16.00 eve ask so if your selling eve at market price you are entering an ask equal to the highest bid $ 16.00 if you buy eve at market price you are entering a bid equal to the lowest ask price $ its key to understand this rule an order executes only when both bid and ask meet bid = ask so a market maker puts in a bid when he wants to buy but the trade only executes when an ask price meets his bid price when you see a quote for a stock it is the price of the last trade so it is possible to have a quote higher or lower then both the bid and the ask

when you sell a house around between 7 10 of the sales price will go to various fees mostly to the agents but also to county fees city fees deed tax and possibly covering closing costs for the buyers so if you sell a $ 400k house for the same price you buy just in fees you 're out $ 40k mortgages are structured so that the frontend is very interest heavy while at the end you 're mostly paying towards principal so for the first two years you will pay down very little of the principal figure around $ 2500 for the mortgage and without running the numbers i bet you would pay an average for the first two years of around $ in interest $ mortgage interest is tax deductible so you 'll get some of that back that 's also $ 16,800 in equity you 'll have on the house so you 'll get that back out when you sell rough numbers i would be you lose around $ 50k buying the house and selling for the same price two years later that does n't take into account having to do any maintenance and it assumes you can sell quickly when you want to renting is not throwing away money you do n't lose any money you get a place to live in exchange you do n't build equity sure but you do n't need to worry about maintenance and other related issues when you 're looking to be somewhere short term renting is generally the best idea

# 457549
i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   gt collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages the law does n't force anyone to agree to anything and very often they do n't i do n't see how this is a violation of anyone 's contract liberty a term i 've actually never heard before the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that    gt the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked    i 'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   gt as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   would n't educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries what 's the solution here   i understand that in a poor country child labor is seen as a necessity however i think there is a moral issue when someone from a developed nation opens a factory in a third world country with conditions that they would not want someone in their own family subjected to maybe these conditions are standard in the third world country but just because they 're standard that does n't mean the people there are happy with them   gt in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good      this is quite a leap problem is you always assume that a company is always paying workers as much as it can instead of having a net income that can absorb an uptick in overhead    gt as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   and you owe this to violence or the threat of violence citation needed   gt because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place   this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none this is just a way for a business to deflect criticism when they want to outsource killing us jobs just to increase their net income unions make concessions when they have to   gt the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   this is just showing a tremendous amount of ignorance regarding the way   things actually happen   gt collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees   i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it   stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford    i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes

depending on where you live in the uk buying a house sooner might be a better option i would echo the advice about putting some money away into a rainy day fund etc above but i know that in my area house prices are going up by around 7 per year i bought a house two years ago and i 'm paying 4 interest on my mortgage so i 'm effectively making money by owning my house   given that you want to buy a house if your money sits in an account somewhere making no interest you 're effectively losing 7 of your cash each year by not keeping up with house prices meaning you 'll be able to afford a smaller house with the same money do bear in mind though that buying a house costs around £ 4k in lawyers fees surveys mortgage setup fees etc and selling a house can be more since estate agents will take a of the sale cost if you live somewhere where house prices are not increasing as quickly then this will not be as good an option than if you live in e.g. london where house prices are currently skyrocketing if you do n't want to live in the house you may be able to do a buy to let as an investment generally the rent will cover the mortgage payments and probably a letting agent property management company 's fees so while you wo n't see any actual net income the people renting will be paying the mortgage off and you 'll be building equity on the home it 's not entirely without risk though as tenants can trash homes etc

i 'm not going to speculate on the nature of your relationship with your wife but the fact that you are worried about what would happen in the event of a divorce is a bit concerning   presumably you married her with the intent of staying together forever so what 's the big deal if you spend 50k upgrading the house you live in assuming you wo n't get divorced now if you really are worried about something happening in the future you might want to seek legal advice about the content of the   i am guessing if the 400k were your assets before marriage you have full claim to that amount in the event of a   if you document the loan or make some agreement i would think you would have claim to at least some of the house 's appreciation due to the renovations if they were made with your money*. ianal

confused on amortization of intangibles    let 's say i 'm running a dcf on a firm that has lots of valuable customer contracts those contracts are amortized over 10 years the annual intangible amortization amount is pretty high   however nowhere in their 10 k do i see a correspondingly high capex number based on the footnotes it seems that the contracts are cheap to acquire just sales people salary and do n't have high capex   fundamentally i do n't understand how they can amortize something at a rate higher than its cost basis in terms of upfront cash out the door

some lenders will work with you if you contact them early and openly discuss your situation   they are not required to do so   the larger and more corporate the lender the less likely you 'll find one that will work with you my experience is that your success in working out repayment plan for missed payments depends on the duration of your reduced income   if this is a period of unemployment and you will be able to pay again in a number of months you may be able to work out a plan on some debts if you 're permanently unable to pay in full or the duration is too long you may have to file bankruptcy to save your domicile and transportation   the ethics of this go beyond this forum as do the specifics of when it is advisable to file bankruptcy research your area find debt counselling   they can really help with specifics   speak with your lenders they may be able to refer you to local non profit services   be sure that you find one of those not one of the predatory lenders posing as credit counselling services   there 's even some that take the money you can afford to pay divide it up over your creditors allowing you to keep accruing late partial payment fees and charge you a fee on top of it   to me this is fraudulent and should be cause for criminal charges the key is open communication with your lenders with disclosure to the level that they need to know   if you 're disabled long term they need to know that   they do not need to know the specific symptoms or causes or   they need to know whether the social security administration has declared you disabled and are paying you a disability check   if this is the case you probably have a case worker who can find you resources to help negotiate with your creditors

if you want an account statement from the irs listing the taxes due and paid and confirming a zero balance remaining you want what they call a tax account transcript it sounds like you tried to submit this online but yes it would require the actual taxpayer to submit it the other option would be to fill out form requesting the form 1040 tax account transcript have the taxpayer sign it and mail it in presumably whatever method you used to have her sign the form 1040 you prepared for her you could also use to have her sign the another option could be to try to request the transcript over the phone i do n't know what authentication they require or if you would need to have been listed on the 1040 as an authorized third party according to the irs transcript faq page what if i ’m unable to use get transcript by mail if you are unable to use get transcript by mail you may try our automated phone transcript service at 800 and also receive your transcript by mail please allow 5 to 10 calendar days for delivery but unless there 's a reason to think that the tax account was n't credited properly or the irs is sending another bill or the like i do n't think there 's a lot of point in doing so in general the fact that the check cleared the bank should be sufficient documentation that the amount was paid

since you are using the percentage method to determine the home business use split i would think that under most circumstances the distance driven to get your car from the dealership to home and from home to mechanic and back would be less than 1 of the total miles driven this is an acceptable rounding error when i typically do that on my way to another destination and therefore it 's not something i count separately   if your miles driven to attend to repair tasks are more than 1 of the total miles driven split them as you feel comfortable in your above examples i 'd calculate the b p percentages as total miles less maintenance miles then apply that split to maintenance miles as well

the answer comes down to what you expect the future tax rate to be if that tax rate is the same 25 marginal here then it is a wash yes you will pay more taxes when you pull the money out with a traditional but it is the same fraction of the original contribution as when you pay the tax now to convert to roth all you did was invest uncle sam 's money well so if you expect to pay higher tax rate on retirement then a roth could be beneficial also a roth does not have a required minimum distribution but congress can change that and it has been proposed the argument for leaving the money in the traditional is that you expect a lower tax rate on retirement or you do n't trust that a future congress wo n't decide to add a nominal tax to roth distributions   now if there is a year where your tax rate is very low then a partial conversion may well be worth it also if you your balance is insufficient for a good portfolio and future contributions will be to a roth due to income limits then that would also be a very good reason to convert

after seeing your most recent comment on the original question it looks like others have answered the question you intended and described the extreme difficulty of getting the timing right the way you 're trying to since i 've already typed it up what follows answers what i originally thought your question was which was asking if there were drawbacks to investing entirely in money market funds to avoid stock volatility altogether money market funds have the significant drawback that they offer low returns one of the fundamental principles in finance is that there is a trade off between low risk and high returns while money market funds are extremely stable their returns are paltry under current market conditions you can consider them roughly equivalent to cash on the other hand though investing in stocks puts your money on a roller coaster returns will be on average substantially higher since people often invest in order to achieve personal financial stability many feel naturally attracted to very stable investments like money market funds however this tendency can be a big mistake the higher returns of the stock market do n't merely serve to an investor 's greed they are necessary for achieving most people 's financial goals for example consider two hypothetical investors saving for retirement over the course of a career the first investor apprehensive adam invests $ 10k per year in a money market fund the second investor brave barbara invests $ 10k per year in an s&p 500 index fund reinvesting dividends let 's be generous and say that adam 's money market fund keeps pace with inflation in reality they typically do n't even do that at the end of 40 years in today 's money adam will have $ 10,000 40 = $ 400,000 not nearly enough to retire comfortably on on the other hand let 's assume that barbara gets returns of 7 per year after inflation which is typical though not guaranteed barbara will then have using the formula for the future value of an annuity $ 10,000 1 0.07 or about $ 2,000,000 which is much more comfortable while adam 's strategy produces nearly guaranteed results those results are actually guaranteed failure barbara 's strategy is not a guarantee but it has a good chance of producing a comfortable retirement even if her timing is n't great over these time scales the chances that she will have more money than adam in the end are very high i wo n't produce a technical analysis of this claim as it 's a bit complicated do more research if you 're interested

it surely does n't hurt to keep a receipt i tend to pile up receipts in my desk drawer never look at them and then every few months throw them all out if a vendor writes a receipt by hand or if the cash register is not tied in to the credit card system keeping a receipt could give you evidence against mistakes or fraud like if the vendor gives you a receipt for $ 10 and then sends a transaction to the credit card company for $ 20 you could use the receipt as evidence of the problem but if the vendor is trying to really cheat you the most likely thing for him to do is run the legitimate transaction through and then some time later run a fake transaction so say today you go to vendor x buy something for $ 20 and he bills your credit card $ 20 then a few days later he bills you another $ 100 even though you never came back to the store sure you have a receipt for $ 20 but you do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 because you never authorized that transaction your receipt proves nothing presumably you 're not disputing the $ 20 if you complain to the bank or go to the police or whatever saying hey look i do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 does n't prove anything how do they know you did n't just throw it away it 's difficult to prove that you never had such a receipt

never trust a single source to give you a fair price especially if they are not in competition moreso if they know that 's the case   i would want to get a quote from at least one other broker in terms of what they feel they can sell the bonds for   and let them know they are not the only one you are getting a quote from   to start with you need information such as when is the last time a bond like the ones you have traded and what did it sell for also sources for where you can sell the bonds and more info on the entire subject the securities industry and financial markets association has a pretty helpful website called   i find it has a wealth of information and is relatively free of bias on the municipal markets at a glance page you can get history for various bonds if you have the pronounced que sip numbers for the bonds if these bonds are as good as the advisor is telling you they are then they should be selling for a premium and the recent sales history would reflect that   i 'd find one or two other potential sellers and get prices from each of them compare that against recent history and go with whichever one seems to be offering you the best deal in terms of choosing someone and how to go about selling bonds the same website has some excellent information and guidance on buying and selling bonds and how to choose an investment professional which includes how to check up on them to see if they have ever faced action etc   i would also consider any gains you might have to declare if you sell these for more than face value and if that would be taxable etc i would also question your too safe judgement   just because something is safe i would not necessarily throw it out   you need to look at the return relative to the risk and if you are not investing in a tax sheltered account the affect of taxes on your net return   if these are earning a really good return for fairly low risk they might be worth keeping especially if in today 's market you need to take substantially more risk to get a comparable return   taking more risk to get nearly the same return is n't very wise since an aspect of the risk is perhaps not getting any return or losing money    in a volatile market there can be a substantial benefit to having a lower risk foundation that you build upon with more risky investments in order to provide some risk diversity in your portfolio you might want to consider for example how these bonds have done over the last 13 years compared to a similar investment in the type of less safe vehicles you are considering   perhaps you 'd be better off just holding these to maturity instead of gambling on something with a lot more risk that could go south on you

what you are saying is a very valid concern   after the flash crash many institutions in the us replaced true market orders where tag and has no price with deep in the money limit orders under the hood after the cftc sec joint advisory commission raised concerns about the use of market orders in the case of large hft traders and concerns on the lack of liquidity that caused market orders that found no limit orders to execute on the other side of the trade driving the prices of blue chip stocks into the pennies   we also applaud the cftc requesting comment regarding whether it is    appropriate to restrict large order execution design that results in    disruptive trading in particular we believe there are questions    whether it is ever appropriate to permit large order algorithms that    employ unlimited use of market orders or that permit at    prices which are a dramatic percentage below the present market price    without a pause for human review so although you still see a market order on the front end it is transformed to a very aggressive limit in the back end however doing this change manually by selling at price 0 or buying at may backfire since it may trigger fat finger checks and prevent your order from reaching the market   for example bats exchange   rejects orders that are priced too aggressively and do n't comply with the range of valid prices   if you want your trade to execute right now and you are willing to take slippage in order to get fast execution sending a market order is still the best alternative

not all futures contracts are deliverable   some futures are specified as cash settlement only in the case of deliverable contracts part of the specification of a futures contract will be the delivery locations   as per my answer to your previous question please see the cme for details of delivery points for the deliverable futures contracts traded on cme and comex assuming your agreement with your broker allows you to exercise your right to take delivery your broker will facilitate your delivery   you will be required to pay the contracted amount your buy price x contract size x number of lots as well as a delivery fee insurance and warehousing fees   in addition your broker may charge you a fee for facilitating the delivery you will be required to continue to pay insurance and warehousing fees so long as your holding of the underlying commodity is held in the exchange 's designated warehouse if you wish to take delivery yourself by having the commodity removed from the warehouse and delivered to you personally then you will need to arrange this delivery yourself warehouse delivery points obviously vary according the contract being exercised see the cme for available delivery points   some exchanges are more accommodating than others the practicality of taking delivery very much depends on your personal circumstances   an investment bank taking delivery of treasury bonds would be more practical than an individual investor taking delivery of treasury bonds   this is because the individual investor would be required to deliver the bonds to a brokerage in order to sell them   in the case of non financial futures deliveries it is hard to imagine any circumstance where an individual taking delivery would be practical

i upvoted you as i think your story is important to tell however commodities and futures accounts have never been protected under sipc the use of your money to pay debts sounds illegal or perhaps it was legal under a document you signed when you opened your account bankruptcy was not a way to screw you over   the bigger point is that bankruptcy is a way to restructure debts and is beneficial in the long run to the benefits of society while we often look at people or corporations who have to file bankruptcy as being irresponsible and what i am about to say may reflect negatively on you for that i apologize the people or corporations who lent to a bankrupt entity should be just as much   right now the eu is going through a period where we are hoping bankruptcy is off the table increasingly though the only way to do that is to try and paper over debts that will never be repaid for a long enough time period for growth to resume but the question remains what if growth never comes back this is why restructuring and bankruptcy is the only option for greece and likely italy portugal spain and ireland

i used to be a trader at a desk that sold delta one derivatives on listed indices think swaps etfs there is a lot to do    sell stocks according to redemptions or new orders manage the currency exposure indices rebalance their composition everyday based on stock corporate actions dividends and index reviews you need to be aware of each and everyone and rebalance your portfolio to account for it manage your inventory to get the best repo rates possible trade single stock swaps with foreign counterparties to get access to better tax rates on dividends when you have a big order where certain stock orders may not get filled you have to create a strategy for managing that risk sometimes you hedge your positions using futures that expire every three months in which case you need to figure out the best times to roll your expiring futures i could go on and on   basically since the profit margins are so low the market so competitive for such vanilla products and the volumes so high you have to really make your processes super efficient and error proof trust me there is a lot to be done

i 've got £ but the maximum house price is £ 450,000 what    happens to the £ 26,000 does it stay there with ~6 interest and no bonus of course and would be available when i retire at around 75 there would be about £ by then yes anything you do n't withdraw for your house purchase stays in the lifetime isa and keeps growing there also you do keep the bonus on it which was paid at the time you subscribed unless you make a withdrawal before age 60 after age 60 you can withdraw and keep the bonus note that you need to be buying with a mortgage to be allowed to use the lifetime isa money without penalty this is mentioned on the gov.uk website as well as in the actual regulations that establish lifetime isas search for first time residential purchase and look at clause 6 that would mean you 'd need to withdraw even less than the £ 450 k and artificially borrow the rest all that said i suspect the £ 450 k limit would be raised by given inflation can i buy a house and quickly sell it again to simply access the money the regulations say that on completion of the purchase you must occupy the land as their only or main residence there are a few exceptions such as if it 's still being built or if you are at the time posted abroad by the government but essentially you have to move in as soon as possible there 's no time limit stated in the regulations so in theory you could move in and then sell quite fast but personally i 'd be nervous about this being seen as not genuinely intending it to be my main residence in theory you could be prosecuted for fraud if you claimed a valid withdrawal when it was n't though given the wording of the regulations it looks like you 'd be complying with the letter of the law

it depends on the rules in the specific places you stay   specific places being countries or states    some states may consider pension payments to be taxable income others may not   some may consider presence for x days to constitute residency x days may be 60 days in a calendar year whether or not those days are continuous    it does n't matter so much where your mailbox or mail handling service is located it matters you may owe taxes in more than one place   some states will allow you to offset other states taxes against theirs   some states in the us are really harsh on income taxes   it 's my understanding that if you own real estate in new york all of your income no matter the source is taxable income in new york whether or not you were ever in the state that year ultimately you ca n't just put up your hand and say that 's my tax domicile so i 'm exempt from all your taxes   there is no umbrella us regulation on this topic the states determine who they consider to be residents and how those residents are to be taxed while it 's possible you may be considered a resident of multiple states and owe income taxes in multiple states it 's equally possible that you wo n't meet the residency criteria for any state regardless of whether or not that state has an income tax   the issue you face as addressed in 's answer oklahoma will consider you a resident of ok until you have established residency somewhere else

on most exchanges if you place a limit order to sell at you will be executed before the market can trade at a higher price however most stocks in the us trade across several exchanges and your broker wo n't place your limit order on all exchanges otherwise you could be executed several times the reason for happened to you is that your order was not on the market where those transactions were executed reviewing the ticks there were only 8 transactions above your limit all at for a total shares and all on the nyse arca exchange if your order was on a different exchange nyse for example you would not have been executed if your broker uses a smart routing system they would not have had time to route your order to arca in time for execution because the market traded lower straight after volume at each price on that day

expenses imo the best way to deal with this situation is by treating you staying at her house as renting a room as stated he does with his partner in the comments of another answer   this means you pay x amount of dollars a week to her as rent which she can most likely choose to put it towards house insurance interest repayments repairs and improvements etc etc from there you split your living expenses 50/50 living expenses include stuff like telephone internet utility bills food contents insurance etc renting income then the earnings losses you make from renting your apartment out are yours alone after all if your place gets trashed by a tenant with a meth lab she wo n't and should n't have to pay the ridiculous amounts of money required to get it fixed up   determining the rent to pay not ideal but an easy method use your place 's renting value as a indicator market research example to determine how much rent you would pay to her however since you are only a half resident at her place you would only pay half   ideal your place would have a different renting value to hers so do some research together and find a median renting value of her house based on similar houses or ask her how much she wants you to pay in rent since after all the owner of the house has final say on the renting value you might want to consider that you staying with her is a more secure tenancy as she knows you wo n't wreak her place but the same can not be said for the tenant you have in your place post in the comments if you think this last sentence should be removed i 'm on the fence about it but it seems relevant disclaimer remember you are considering a long term relationship with her do n't get too picky and do n't let it get personal emotional when deciding the renting amounts

yeah no worries it 's tough right because uber provides an incredibly valuable service but i 'm amazed at how they 're able to get away with not vetting their drivers but at the same time that sort of lack of regulation is what allowed them to expand so rapidly and provide a usually good service austin tx banned uber and drunk driving rates went up   clearly this needs to be worked out and it 's been pretty clear that the management at uber has been incapable of making mature decisions in a lot of areas but it 's also a positive because it allows a lot of people who are between jobs or out of work to be able to continue to bring in an income without being beholden to the cab companies that hold the medallions and charge the drivers for use of the cars and licensing   i do n't know the answer i think that by providing the service there is a level of accountability that is required for uber 's vetting of drivers that has n't yet been reached but at the same time i think that the primary burden of liability should fall on the drivers themselves unless there 's a reorganization and the drivers become employees instead of contractors

since your comment on @joetaxpayer 's answer says that you are still under the 2012 contribution limits if the extra money is left in your 401k account i do not think   that there is any problem for you if the money is left in the 401k account as i understand it your salary is $ x for 2012 of which you contribute some percentage per paycheck to your 401k account your contributions   would have totaled $ y for 2012 if the glitch of extra money being out into your 401k account had not occurred in the absence of the glitch your w-2 form would have reported $ x as gross wages $ x y as taxable wages and $ y as 401k contributions since an additional $ z has been put into your 401k account but not deducted from your paycheck your employer could do one of two things the extra money could be withdrawn from your 401k account by your employer if this is done then your w-2 form will be as described above the extra money is not withdrawn by your employer your w-2 form will still report $ x y as taxable wages but $ as the 401k contribution and $ as gross wages since $ is less than the maximum 2012 contribution everything is fine in your position i would very much prefer the latter alternative over the former not just because there is a larger contribution to the 401k account with no change in tax liability but also because there is always the possibility that hr payroll will screw up the withdrawal of the excess contribution so that it appears as a premature withdrawal by the participant in this case   the participant not only has to pay income tax on $ z but also a 10 excise tax for premature withdrawal without actually   getting even a penny from that $ z taken out which will go right back into the employer 's coffers

in the us a private company with less than 500 owners can dictate who can or ca n't become a shareholder this is true in general but i 'm sure there are loopholes    prior to google 's ipo i could not buy shares in google at any price    the reason google was forced to go public is the 500 shareholder rule    at a high level with 500 shareholders the company is forced to do some extra financial accounting and they no longer can control who owns a share of the company allowing me to purchase shares of google at that point   at that point it typically becomes in the companies best interest to go public see this article about google approaching the 500 shareholder limit in 2003 further is not quite correct that securities laws mandate that the company go public if by go public we mean list on a stock exchange available for general purchase    securities laws mandate what has to be reported in financial reporting and when you have to report it securities laws also can dictate restrictions on ownership of stock and if a company can impose their own restrictions a group of investors can not force a company onto a stock exchange    if shares of facebook are already for sale to anyone then having > 500 shareholders will force facebook to file more paperwork with the sec it wo n't force facebook onto the nyse or nasdaq    when that point is reached it may be in facebook 's best interest to have an ipo but they will not be required by law to do so update   cnn article discusses likely facebook ipo in 2012 when companies have more than 500    shareholders they 're required to make    significant financial disclosures    though they can choose to remain    private and keep their stock from    trading publicly however most    companies facing mandatory disclosures    opt to go public the securities and exchange commission    gives businesses lots of time to    prepare for that milestone companies    have until 120 days after the end of    the fiscal year in which they cross    the line to begin    making their disclosures if facebook    tips the scale this year that gives    it until april 2012 to start filing    financial reports

during the day market and limit orders are submitted at any time by market participants and there is a bid and an ask that move around over time   trades occur whenever a market order is submitted or a limit order is submitted that at a price that matches or exceeds an existing limit order   if you submit a market order it may consume all best price limit orders and you can get multiple prices changing the bid or ask at the same time   all that stuff happens during the trading day only what happens at the end of the day is different   a bunch of orders that were submitted during the day but marked as on close are aggregated with any outstanding limit orders to create a single closing price according to the algorithm established by the exchange   each exchange may handle the details of this closing event differently   for example the nasdaq 's closing cross or the nyse 's closing auction the close is the most liquid time of the day so investors who are trading large amounts and not interested in intraday swings will often submit a market on close or limit on close order   this minimizes their chance of affecting the price or crossing a big spread   it 's actually most relevant for smaller stocks which may have too little volume during the day to make big trades but have plenty at the close   in short the volume you see is due to these on close orders the spike in volume most likely has no special information about what will happen overnight or the next day   it 's probably just a normal part of the market for illiquid stocks

let 's talk on qe by m.    20   september   2012   thursday ph    i want to share this to all the brilliant economists in this world    let 's talk on qe     by   m.   qe is not a cure it is a qe is synthetic no more no less qe is artificial it can not and will never hold water qe is only a temporary relief not an outright total solutions qe is absolutely not a guaranty not an assurance for recovery or growth qe is a very good tool this acts as an oxygen to a dying patients to breathe qe is now and forever taking away the oxygen the patient will going to die qe is a big balloon continues

bring tears pouring in your eyes that could not stop qe is worthless injecting precious blood highly precious dollar to a zombie economy a economy an absolute waste qe is brainless simply do not know what will going to be the consequences to the economy do not have the idea of what will going to be the final result qe is only a dream being over optimistic that one day everything will go back to normal that at the end of the day the economy will recover and finally would realize growth qe is just a fantasy meaning punching the moon the stars thinking it will resolve the year 2008 economic meltdown qe is an investment yes a massive investments to a dying economy absolutely wrong investments qe will keep you running it is like a ticking time bomb qe is not good for the economy the government acts or play as an investor instead of the businessman qe is being very kind and generous to businessman while keeping the country the state 's economy at stake or in jeopardy qe is putting more money to a business supporting the company to stay to exist for the time being and later on will literally closed shop qe is killing the mighty precious dollar slowly but surely qe is hide and seek like suze orman of cnbc say 's show me the money qe is treasure hunting ultra rich millionaires billionaires is keeping it they hide it where are those precious dollars making the economy sick crippled dead qe is a money making machine printing press once the economy becomes weak all they have to do is just print qe is putting plenty of money to a basket full of holes truly very few will benefit and so many will going to suffer   this is inequality   disparity is very disturbing counter to a good economy qe is experimental trial and error testing probability never done before qe is good at the start year 2008 after spending investing releasing trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars big companies millions of jobs were blessed saved rescued   and like magic america the wealthiest and most powerful country in the   universe is now going to act again today to spend invest release again and again and again and again trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars for the economy to keep moving my god what an abnormal cycle of the economy qe is a wild guess absolutely speculative before only big businesses huge companies are at stake   today it is now the whole country is at risk   not yet talking of the whole wide world with special mention to my my beloved country the philippines   this is certainly   absolutely domino effect   no one not one will ever be spared qe is very before only america needs to be saved to be today all countries is in distress suffering badly needs a rescue qe is keeping inflation very low yes absolutely for today but not for tomorrow   the medicine that they used during the 2008 economic slump is luckily still moving   meaning still working    but once this medicine starts to slowdown and begins to die down   you may call all the saints above   and the true inflation you are looking for searching for will surely and definitely come into your midst    inflation will going to kill us all qe is a wrong medicine temporary patch or qe is it is just an easy money and definitely not a hard earned labor generated money qe is a gamble trillion dollars is at stake if we are lucky the dying person or the economy will live if we are not lucky the dying person will die the economy will going to collapsed and still we have to pay all the debts as long as we live qe is the economy today is at the mercy of qe   the economy is captive hostage by qe interest rates is a lose lose situations keeping it zero   the u.s.a government will lose trillions   and trillions of dollars that is badly needed   now raising this rates will surely and definitely starts   the u.s.a markets and precisely the world economy to react pulling down the unstable economies   of the whole world to jeopardy   now which one would you like to choose again which one would you prefer qe is trial and error a complex complicated solutions   healing one part of the body and the other part will swell and burst qe is evaporation using taxpayers money pension funds retirement benefits and all entitlements is going to fade will vanished in thin air qe are waiters simply waiting day and night for growth for recovery qe is it dries up the u.s.a treasury qe is debt a never ending debt keep in mind there is no such thing as unlimited debt or debt unlimited do n't be fooled qe will going to keep you in good sleep but will wake you up bankrupt qe is not an answer it is the culprit qe is universal it was copied all over the world worldwide qe is an absolute solutions yes for all dumb economists a hopeless desperate solutions qe to be specific is going back again to the 1930 's depression or the great depression part 2 yes precisely but with a big bang qe before is only a staggering risk today it is now debt simple as it keeps on giving birth by the hour the minutes the seconds and after eight long years the final   the end result is massive pure debt very sorry to say not growth and or definitely not recovery qe is a dying move no one not one ever dared to affirm to attest to certify that this is a correct solutions qe is mad it will make you crazy because of debt qe is the only options yes absolutely when your big

with that credit rating you should have no trouble getting a rate in that range i have a similar credit score and my credit union gave me a car loan at no haggling required in regards to your question i think you have it backwards they are more likely to give you a good rate on a high balance than a low one think about it from the bank 's perspective if i give you a small sale will you give me a discount this is the question you are asking their profit is a factor of how much you borrow and the interest rate low rate = less profit low financing amount = less profit   the deal you proposed is a lose lose for them

i also spend countless hours of my own time studying it 's the only way to continue to move forward in the tech world i have to disagree with you on this point   given the fact that tech is ever evolving no one should ever be surprised to find out that there are long hours involved   that 's is the complete opposite of what should happen evolving technology should make our lives easier i see that in my current position which allows me to whenever i feel like it hell i could probably move across the country and maintain my current position we 're pretty much post startup mode at this point though    my last position was for a fortune 100 shipping company was required to work 12 hour swing shifts required to be on 8 am meetings when i worked why because fuck you that 's why this is the reasoning coming from my manager   also i find it crazy that so many people have an issue with the use of the word fuck what are we children the fucking point of the post is to slap you in the fucking face i also find it much more entertaining to read then your standard business journal   sadly her reputation with prospective employers might be influenced by her choice of words in the interest of fucking glory   when you clear of half a million i do n't think you are exactly on the job hunt even if she was someone would be stupid to not hire her the second she walked in the door on the track record of creating successful products    also i personally have had ups and downs trying to escape working for others i made my employer over 75k last quarter alone they do n't pay me that much a year from dec feb of last year i made double my yearly salary online i 've also lost more than i care to mention investing in new ideas i 'm young and stupid i did n't need to recklessly spend the money the way i did but somethings you learn the the point is that if you own the product business you reap the rewards that also means possible taking a hit for losses but if you succeed it is going to be well worth it   this idea is n't for everyone business product creators need people who want to work hourly while they earn the big bucks i 'm starting to see that i need to build my own dreams not some investors

although this has been touched upon in comments i think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue there is a clear difference between investing and gambling the reality is that the difference is n't that clear at all tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions the underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing especially in the stock market is a form of gambling people who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling as gambling is considered a negative thing the simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous and the way investors will use the words investments and gambles will differ from the way it is used by gamblers and once again different from the way it 's commonly used what i definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling the result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment   that still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms with a strong overlap which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment over on there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling and they came up with the following two definitions investing any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance sufficient research has been conducted the odds are favorable the behavior is risk averse a systematic approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play no role the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long term plan the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is involved a net positive economic effect results gambling any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance little or no research has been conducted the odds are unfavorable the behavior is risk seeking an approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play a role the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long term plan the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is not involved no net economic effect results the very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people and they even acknowledge that a lot of investors are gambling and that a few gamblers are investing read the essay for more on that and this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public so in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment but if we take for example 's operation example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000 so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one this can suddenly change the perception and turn gambling into high risk investing

the partition is more or less ok the specific products are questionable partition it 's usually advised to keep 2 3 monthly income liquid in your case 40 45 is ca 24 27 i.e. 2000 a month thus the range is 4 7 as you are strongly risk averse then 7k is still ok then they propose you to invest 60 in low risk but illiquid and   15 in middle or high risk which is also ok however it does n't have to be real estate but could be specifics be aware that a lot most of the banks including local banks they are however less aggressive often sell the products that promise high commissions to them often with a part flowing directly to your client advisor especially now when the interest rates are low they stand under extra pressure you should rather switch to passively managed funds with low fees if you stick up to the actively managed funds with their fees you should choose them yourself

the short version of jb king 's excellent answer is that the company will typically buy back shares from the open market at market price sometimes it will specifically target larger stakeholders even controlling interests who are making noise that they want to divest if such an investor were to just dump their stock on the open market neither the investor nor the company would be very happy with the resulting price collapse in those cases the company may offer an incentive price above market rates in recent times the investor looking to divest has often been the u.s. government who received stock in return for bailouts and with notable exceptions turned a modest profit on many of them not enough to break even on the entire bailout but the government did n't just throw $ 700 billion in taxpayer money down a hole as conservative pundits would have you believe in the 80s a specific type of buy back was made famous called the leveraged buyout basically the company took out a huge loan against itself and used that money to buy up all the company 's publicly traded shares essentially becoming a private company this became a popular tool among private equity groups for better and worse

i 'm not personally familiar with this but i had a look at the companies house guidance unfortunately it seems you 've done things in the wrong order you should have first got the funds out distributed them to yourself as a dividend or salary and then closed the account and then wound up the company legally speaking the remaining funds now belong to the government bona it 's possible you could apply to have the company restored but i think that might be difficult i do n't think the administrative restoration procedure applies in your situation given the amount involved i 'd suggest just forgetting about it

credit card fraud protection by law credit card cash back programs provided by most cc issuers and debit card fees commonly imposed by the merchant the crux is that with cc transactions a small percentage is remitted to the issuing bank   since the banks are already making money hand over fist on cc 's they incentivize people to use them cc security is also lax because the merchant is responsible for fraudulent charges instead of the bank   if the merchant fails to check a signature they are held liable for all charges if the card holder reports a fraudulent transaction

if you have a huge disparity in incomes maybe    if you make roughly in the same ballpark    the ability to file separately and have one partner the higher earner itemize and claim all the home related deductions while the other takes the standard deduction is one of the greatest middle class loopholes in modern tax law   when married even if filing separately you have to both itemize or both take the standard deduction    you just need to take care that the person itemizing has provably contributed at least the amount they claim toward the house   so have one of you write the checks for the mortgage and property tax and the other pay for everything else and it 'll probably come out roughly even over time   going back to my first line the us tax code seems to be designed around the reed 1950s household with a single earner   the closer you are to equal the bigger the marriage tax penalty gets

gt go on try walking away without signing your credit card receipt at stores where they present it for signature and see what happens   that 's true if the amount is over $ 25 did you notice it actually at costco is over $ 50   and you know what else is true that yes they require you to something but you can write an obvious incorrect signature and nobody will care you have no idea how many times the screen with the electronic pen did not work right so i just put couple of lines   gt;&gt   know what i am talking about because i deal with credit cards a lot professionally in it   gt you and everyone else big deal different credit card processors have different requirements for their customers merchants   just because different processors have different requirements makes the whole process impossible to manage or comply with go figure out the requirement based on the card presented   gt;&gt the credit card companies do n't really care   gt i think the real lesson here is nobody cares    the merchant cares because they are ultimately responsible for paying for fraud which is the main reason why credit card companies do n't care and many merchants too because they have insurance   the bottom line is that everyone would not mind to enter a pin to get the transaction through but a stupid ego trip of the credit card companies who do n't want to be like atms that 's it   so they came up with chip in the card which made the process slower and more expensive and does not solve anything except fake credit cards copied credit cards

most brokers have a margin maintenance requirement of 30   in your example it would depend on how much money you 're borrowing from your broker on margin consider this you have $ 250 and short aapl at $ 500 on margin this would be a common scenario federal law requires investors to have at least 50 of their margin equity when opening a transaction if your broker had a requirement of 30 they would require that for your $ 500 position you have at least $ 500 .3 = $ 150 equity since you are currently above that number at $ 250 you will not be hit with a margin call say the price of aapl doubles and now your position is worth $ 1000 $ 1000 .3 = $ 300 which is $ 50 above your initial equity your broker will now consider you eligible for a margin call most will not execute the call right away you will often have some time to either sell cover stock or add funds to your account but not all brokers will warn you if you are breaking margin requirements and sometimes margin calls can take you by surprise if you are not paying attention also many will charge interest on extra margin borrowed

you will owe tax on all but the deposit that was not taxed   e.g. you deposited $ for 3 years and deducted $ 5 k for each of 2 years the third $ 5 k   deposit was a nondeductible ira contribution which you reported to the irs by filing form 8606 with your tax return for that year now you convert the total balance of $ 18 k $ 15 k of contributions plus $ 3 k of interest gains in this case $ 5 k is not taxable income while the $ 13 k is taxable income this calculation is done on form 8606 for the year of the rollover edit in response to op 's comment the roth conversion is text based on the value of a day it was   converted one thing to be aware of is that you can re characterize up until the time you file your taxes for 2017 in april 2018 or with extension up until october   this offers you the opportunity to undo the conversion if for whatever reason the value is lower at the time you do your taxes or if the converted amount will put you into a higher tax bracket you do n't need to give the irs a reason it 's up to your discretion as dave note in a comment the conversion is n't all or none the recharacterization along with this fact help you to fine tune exactly how much in converted in hindsight

i would n't go quite that far     it 's formatted and not written i 'll give you that   i 'd guess it 's written by someone who believes they they have a flair for and the dramatic and writes as they would talk   assume amy hoy is a slightly awkward gal at you and this all seems a little more tolerable     but i find her points somewhat solid     i think she 's presenting from a ideological standpoint where safety and security are paramount and the risk associated with startups is too much risk   but i think the point that s he 's making about the poisonous rhetoric associated with glorious death and working for a startup being very similar is well thought out and quite an interesting perspective   i go to a school whose idea of business is entrepreneurship   i left their business program because my career goals simply can not be sustained by entrepreneurship until a very long while into my career and i found the here 's how to have a startup focus of the bulk of the courses essentially valueless to me where i am now     having seen what the author refers to as the of successful startups great word by the by i can not help but those courses and the ways we were sold on this ideology     much was made about how much money was made by successful startups   much was made of the independence the power the glory of winning the startup lotto and making it big   the guys that did it young were and lauded as the greatest of our generation     no mention was made of the failures   no mention was made of the failure rate   no mention was made of the costs associated with failure   no mention was made of the people who got fucked as these entrepreneurial saints made their fortunes     further the ones that got the most attention were the ones who went back and did it a few more times   anyone clever who won big and cashed out and quit while ahead was mentioned as a success but their retirement or cashing out went   some sort of shameful detail maybe     the guys that won big and went back and tried again were praised for their determination and   if they set themselves back to square one betting on an unsuccessful attempt that was     vcs were praised as the greatest thing that happened to entrepreneurship   we were given no real warnings about hey those contracts can be kinda shady sometimes or they want a big cut yo instead they were the grease to our machine   it was a money making machine   a machine of winners   of the great men and women of our generation   of everything that is good about western society     and we are letting our generation down if we do n't play     seriously     i had a prof tear a strip off a kid for asking something along the lines of but what 's wrong with working for a company that already exists and can pay a steady wage   the prof got started in on how our generation is and just fall into things and accomplish little on our own   he moved into how it 's merely riding someone else 's and it 's not really achieving anything for yourself   the tl;dr of what was a fifteen minute in class of a student who asked what i thought was a reasonable question was if you 're not signing your own you are a huge failure and are contributing nothing of note to society or it 's progress     this particular rant pretty much sealed my withdrawal from the business aspect of my school   if my very goals render me a huge failure in my profs eyes i 'm not interested in what they have to say or in contributing to their employment at the university     but off that somewhat personal tangent the culture of glory of the startup that amy hoy somewhat complains about in her article certainly exists   in the form she 's complaining about     your rebuttal makes sense too it 's not that vc are or are n't a risk it 's not that people do n't have the right and the opportunity to take that risk if they see it as a valid opportunity to make money it 's not like it 's fair to expect a vc to fund you without seeing a profit in the long run     but you 're her thesis with something that does n't actually address it     the culture that she 's complaining about exists in my experience the culture glosses over so much of what you her article with that risks exist and that failures exist and that there are a lot of harsh realities associated with the startup world   the culture does indeed all the best parts of startup dom and creates a toughness challenge that renders no this may not be a good idea because failure are personal while successes are cultural    successful startups and people who have done very well by them are held up as everything startups are supposed to be and look at how their hard work paid off and if yours does n't work it is entirely that you did n't work hard enough   someone who has bought in wholesale holds that there are no bad startups any startup can be successful you just need to bust balls working harder if you fail     startups are akin to gambling   they 're not the roulette of it 's all luck but closer to five card skill plays a lot of a role but there 's still luck involved     startup culture represents all this as far closer to texas hold em where luck in minimized where skill and diligence play the greatest role   it assumes that everyone going in already knows all the things you brought up in your rebuttal without ever actually giving them that information   it keeps just work harder without really saying hey guys check the odds you 're playing with and know when to hold and when to

i 'd forget raises as they 're hard to predict figure in cost of living adjustment to keep pace with inflation and recalculate if you get a raise i do n't think about it too hard after i deposit my expected monthly expenditures in my checking account the balance goes to savings so any raises will go to savings unless i specifically alter my direct deposit settings i have to make a conscious decision to inflate my lifestyle if i want to spend that money also realize that matching your income is a bit overkill right now part of that income is going to savings if you spend 60 of your income now why would you suddenly need the extra 40 when you retire

in the past 10 years there have been mutual funds that would act as a single bucket of stocks and bonds a good example is fidelity 's four in one the trade off was a management fee for the fund in exchange for having to manage the portfolio itself and pay separate commissions and fees these days though it is very simple and pretty cheap to put together a basket of 5 6 etfs that would represent a balanced portfolio what s even more interesting is that large online brokerage houses are starting to offer commission free trading of a number of etfs as long as they are not day traded and are held for a period similar to ntf mutual funds   i think you could easily put together a basket of 5 6 etfs to trade on fidelity or td ameritrade commission free and one that would represent a nice diversified portfolio the main advantage is that you are not giving money to the fund manager but rather paying the minimal cost of investing in an index etf overall this can save you an extra .5 1 annually on your portfolio just in fees here are links to commission free etf trading on fidelity and td ameritrade

you could theoretically use any time period unit but 1 minute and 30 minute   seem to be the most common and useful   especially for active traders   this also has the added advantage of giving you useful insight into the trade volumes throughout the day assuming that is also included on the chart   i think most include that as a bar chart across the bottom here is a great example for crude oil on   notice that the chart has time options at the top left which include 1 minute 30 minutes 1 hour and 1 day

according to glassdoor and my own recruiting salaries and benefits are quite different for example pwc has about 1200 consulting partners and the average compensation is $ 600k year accenture director vps are nowhere near that senior manager positions at accenture top out at 175 while the same position at kpmg pays 225 250   people do n't choose accenture over deloitte ey pwc etc   most the average bill rates at accenture are quite lower than big4 public firms can not compete with private firms in compensation   a final example accenture bonuses above $ 20k are rare for manager senior managers at big4 25 40k bonuses were commonplace these past few years and these were bad years   oh yeah vacation at big4 is 6 weeks accenture is only 5 etc etc

your question reminds me of a will rogers quote buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up then sell it if it do n’t go up do n’t buy it there 's no way to prevent yourself from buying a stock that goes down   in fact all stocks go down at some times   the way to protect your long term investment is to diversify which increases the chances that you have more stocks that go up than go down   so many advisors will encourage index funds which have a low cost which eats away at returns and low rick because of diversification   if you want to experiment with your criteria that 's great and i wish you luck but   note that historically very few managed funds meaning funds that actively buy and sell stocks based on some set of criteria outperform the market over long periods   so do n't be afraid of some of your stocks losing if you diversify enough then statistically you should have more winners than losers it 's like playing blackjack   the goal is not to win every hand the goal is to have more winning hands than losing hands

while i 'm not an accountant this is how i do this for my personal    accounting note if you do n't want the expense to take effect right away meaning    it 'll affect your profits then the transaction date here needs to be    something in the future then when you hit that date and the bill is    still not paid you just the bill and repost again with a new    date so you end up with something like the following    4 now you post the invoice to liabilities accounts payable the cable company the invoice due date should reflect what you had in the invoice this is important as gnucash will warn you that your bill is due if you want to pay it every time it starts   when you 're ready to pay the bill just find the bill and click pay invoice if it 's already paid and you imported transactions from your bank find the transaction then right click and click assign as payment then choose your invoice note i 've being using this to also record cheques that are given to    people but not cashed yet i hope that helps

this sounds to me like a very nice little job for a computer this assumes that you have some experience of programming a computer which i believe you do a program like this does not require a lot of programming experience a beginner in any simple scripting language could implement it which is why i think it is a fairly general answer you can set up a small simulation with either your real loans or the examples you have given then have the computer work through the situation at a monthly time step until the debt is paid and have it output all the interesting information per month then you set it up with your different payment scenarios each paying proportionally each paying their own debt separately paying them in different orders etc when you have these graphs it should be possible to answer your main questions the more information you add to this simulation the more effective it gets for example i 'm sure there are various tax deductions that you can make depending on how much each of you pay that depends on all sorts of things location income age

with my current limited knowledge see end i understand it the following way are share prices really described as memoryless   yes   is there a    technical meaning of the term what does it really mean the meaning comes from markov models think of the behavior of the stock market over time as a markov chain i.e. a probabilistic model with states and probabilistic transitions a state is the current price of all stocks of the market a transition is a step in time memoryless means that transitions that the stock market might make can be modelled by a relation from one state to another i.e. it only depends on the current state the model is a markov chain as opposed to a more general stochastic process where the next state depends on more than the current state so in a markov chain all the history of one stock is encoded already in its current price more precisely in all stock 's prices   the of stocks is the main statement of the efficient market theory emt if a company 's circumstances do n't change then a drop in its share price is going to be followed by a rise later   so if the emt holds your statement above is not necessarily true i personally belief the emt is a good approximation only large corporations e.g. renaissance technologies have enough hundreds of mathematicians billions of $ to be able to leverage tiny non random movements that stem from a not completely random mostly chaotic market   the prices can of course change when the company 's circumstances change but they are n't memoryless either a company 's future state is influenced by its past in the emt a stock 's future state is only influenced by its past as much as is encoded in its current price more precisely the complete market 's current state whether that price was reached by a drop or a rise makes no difference   the above is my believe but i 'm by far no finance expert i am working professionally with probabilistic models but have only read one book on finance kommer 's mit und etfs it 's supposed to contain many statements of malkiel 's a random walk down wall street

it depends on the definition of earnings   a company could have revenue that nets in excess of expenses so from that perspective a good cash flow or ebitda but have debt servicing costs taxes depreciation amortization that alters that perspective so if a company is carrying a large debt load then the bondholders are in the position to capture any excess revenues through debt service payments and the company is in a negative equity positions no equity or dividends payable to shareholders and has not produced earnings if a company has valuable preferred shares issued and outstanding then depending on the earnings definition there may be no earnings for the common stock until the preferences are satisfied by the returns so while the venture itself revenues minus costs could be cash flow positive this may not be sufficient to produce earnings for shareholders whose claim on the company still entitles them to zero current liquidation value i.e. they get nothing if the company immediately all value goes to bondholders or preferred   it could also be that taxes are eating into revenue or the depreciation of key assets is greater than the excess of revenues over costs e.g. a bike rental company by the beach makes money on a weekly basis but is out half its stock every 3 months and replacement costs will overwhelm the operating revenues

at this point a great deal of the world 's wealth exists only in electronic form and just as you can write a check or pay by debit card and trust the banks will handle it banks can conduct wire transfers through higher level banking networks in the us when there is a need to convert physical money to electronic or vice versa it is typically handled by armored car and armed guard transfer between a bank and the local federal reserve bank office physical money is moved around only when necessary and for as short a distance as possible to the most secure facilities possible to minimize risk i ca n't vouch for how it 's managed elsewhere in the world where the networks and repository banks may not be as available i would presume i would hope that the same general concepts and approaches are followed

sure there is expense however anyone who raises their kids even with the hint of frugality will never come close to their base numbers     my wife and i both worked before three having kids and at least for us the outgoing costs pretty much the same as the money spent without kids   how you say   because you budget on what you make   what changes when you have kids is your lifestyle and how you spend your money   bar tab = diapers weekend getaways = 1 big disney   convertible = minivan etc     there is an opportunity cost but according to these folks they seem to be assuming you are spending money you are normally saving on kids when in truth you would have more than likely spent it on yourself

the main reason is that you move from the linear payoff structure to a non linear one this is called convexity in finance with options you can design a payoff structure in almost any way to want it to be for example you can say that you only want the upside but not the downside so you buy a call option it is obvious that this comes at a price the option premium or equivalently you buy the underlying and for risk management reasons buy a put option on top of it as an insurance the price of the put could be seen as the insurance premium you can of course combine options in more complicated ways so that you e.g. profit as long as the underlying moves strongly enough in either direction this is called a straddle

the definition i use for financial independence is 99 confidence that at a specific estimated spending rate per year allowing for estimated inflation and budgeting for likely medical emergencies and taxes on taxable investments the money will me this translates to needing an average annual return on investment which covers the average yearly spending for my purposes that works out to my relying on being able to draw only a 4 income from the money each year which should give me good odds of the money not just being sufficient but being able to deliver that rate forever historically average us stock market rate if return is around 8 that is overkill if course i could plan on the money just barely lasting past my birthday or something of that sort but the goal us to be pretty sure not only that i wo n't run out but that i will have some cash unexpected needs which in turn means that i estimate i need investments times the yearly spending estimate to declare the forever independence retirement or 25x the yearly from that i can calculate how much longer at a given savings rate and rate of return it 'll take for me to reach that target   obviously you need to adjust all these numbers to reflect your opinions understanding if the market your own needs your priorities and expected maximum age and the phase of 's but that 's the basic rationale or you can pay a financial planner to give you this number and a strategy for getting there based on the numbers you give him or her plus some statistical analysis of the market 's overall history

if you want the new car pay cash for it here 's why by paying cash for the car you immediately save $ 2,500 off the price of the car that is not insignificant it 's off   by paying cash you 'll never be upside down on the car and you can sell the car anytime you want   you said that all you need to do is beat the 0.9 interest rate with your investment to come out ahead that does n't take into account the discount you would have gotten by paying cash $ 30,000 invested for 5 years at 1.6 rough estimate would get you $ 2,500 the discount so the rate you need to beat to come out ahead is actually 2.5 still doable but it is much less of a sure thing on a 5 year investment and much less worth the trouble   new cars are an expensive luxury if you are wealthy enough a new car certainly can be appropriate for you however if you do n't like the idea of paying $ 30k in cash all at once that is a strong indication that perhaps the new car is a luxury you are n't in a position to buy at this time borrowing the money and paying for it over time makes it psychologically easier to over spend on transportation

so let 's talk about the nation scale which is what the equation savings = investments is referring to   in that context does an investment merely mean the purchase of a financial asset or an investment in some physical asset or productive capital i like to think of investment as building a factory developing land or spending money on r&amp;d. but in the economic sense merely transforming cash into a financial asset like treasuries is also considered investment correct as a matter of fact just merely leaving cash in a deposit account can technically be counted towards investment   am i understanding this correctly or am i fundamentally missing something
