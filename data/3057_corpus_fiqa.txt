in a simple case as the sole uk resident director shareholder of a company with that company as your only income you are usually best paying yourself a salary of the maximum tax free amount allowed under your tax code for most people at present   on this you will have to pay some employer and employee national insurance ni contributions totalling around £ 1000 your salary employer ni counts as an expense so that is taken off the company profits   you then pay corporation tax on the remainder 20   the first £ 5k you take as dividends is tax free the remainder at a lower tax rate than the equivalent combined income tax ni starting at 7.5 instead of 20 tax plus employee plus employer ni giving a significant saving compared to salaried income even after corporation tax to declare and pay the tax you would need to complete a self assessment tax return   your company will also need to file a return the contractor uk website although aimed at it contractors has some very useful information on operating ltd companies that said finances are rarely that simple so i would concur with the recommendation you engage an accountant which is a tax deductible expense

adding to 's answer before you calculate your profits you can pay money tax free into a pension fund for the company director that is you then if you pay yourself dividends if you made lots of profit you do n't have to pay it all as dividends you can take some where the taxes are low and then pay more money in later years    what you must not do is just take the money the company may be yours but the money is n't it has to be paid as salary or dividend you can give the company director a loan but that loan has to be repaid especially if a limited company goes bankrupt the creditors would insist that loans from the company are repaid   after a bit more checking here 's the optimal approach perfectly legal expected and ethical   you pay yourself a salary of £ per month that 's the point where you get all the advantages of national insurance without having to pay above that you would have to pay employers ni contributions and 12 employee 's ni contributions so for £ 100 salary the company has to pay £ and you receive £ below £ you pay nothing   you deduct the salary from your revenue then you deduct all the deductible business costs be wise in what you try to deduct then you pay whatever you want into a pension fund well up to i think £ 25,000 per year   the rest is profit the company pays 19 corporation tax on profits then you pay yourself dividends any dividends until your income is £ 11,500 per year are tax free then the next £ 5,000 per year are tax free then any dividends until income + dividends = £ 45,000 per year is taxed at 7.5 it 's illegal to pay so much in dividends that the company ca n't pay its bills   above £ 45,000 you decide if you want your money now and pay more tax or wait and get it tax free every pound of dividend above £ 45,000 a year you pay tax but there is nobody forcing you to take the money you can wait until business is bad or you want a holiday or you retire so at that time you will stay below £ 45,000 per year and pay only 7.5 tax

manage the company properly if you are n't much aware about company rules and regulation or tax matters get an accountant so that you do n't mess up later better off paying my self a dividend of 100 profit or as an employee that depends on how much salary you intend to pay yourself your dividend or how much business expenses you will incur while running the business   generally speaking you are better off paying your self a minimum salary and pay the rest as dividends but check out the dividend tax and the income tax you might need to pay and compare which situation you are better off if you have a partner using the dividend way will reduce your ni ethical and legal ethically the dividend way might burn your conscience but it is perfectly legal way of doing things

if you can afford to max out an hsa and cover out of pocket expenses without withdrawing from it it makes sense to do so   it might sound initially risky to tie too much money to healthcare expenses perhaps you 'll enjoy exceptional health and not need those funds however the annual contribution limit $ for an individual is low enough that it 's unlikely you 'd your hsa but even if you did n't need it all for healthcare after 65 you can withdraw hsa funds without the 20 withdrawal penalty that you 're hit with if under 65 so best case it 's tax free worst case it 's like an ira   from a tax perspective your contributions are a tax deduction like a traditional ira there 's no tax on the gains and you withdraw it tax free as well so long as you have healthcare expenses the tricky bit is you can get reimbursed for your expenses at any time if you pay out of pocket now in 20 years you can get a reimbursement from your hsa from hsa bank 's faq can i use my tax free hsa savings to pay for or reimburse myself for    irs qualified medical expenses from a previous year     yes as long as    the irs qualified medical expenses were incurred after your hsa was    established you can pay them or reimburse yourself with hsa funds at    any time just be sure to keep sufficient records to show that these    expenses were not previously paid for by another source or taken as an    itemized deduction in any prior tax year

there are a couple of things that are missing from your estimate in addition to your standard deduction you also have a personal exemption of $ 4050   so d in your calculation should be $ 6300 + $ 4050 = $ 10,350 as a self employed individual you need to pay both the employee and employer side of the social security and medicare taxes   instead of 6.2 + 1.45 you need to pay 6.2 + 1.45 2 = 15.3 self employment tax in addition there are some problems with your calculation quarter 1 estimated income should be your adjusted annual income divided by 4 not 3 likewise you should estimate your quarterly tax by estimating your income for the whole year then dividing by 4   so annual estimated federal tax should be quarterly estimated federal tax would be = 4 annual estimated self employment tax is = 15.3 a with the quarterly self employment tax being one fourth of that = 4 self employment tax gets added on to your federal income tax   so when you send in your quarterly payment using form 1040-es you should send in + the form 1040-es instructions pdf comes with the 2016 estimated tax worksheet that walks you through these calculations

the way i 've implemented essentially value averaging is to keep a constant ratio between different investment types in my portfolio lets say in a simple example 25 cash 25 reit real estate 25 us stock 25 foreign stock lets say i deposit a set $ 1000 per month into this account if the stock portion goes up it will look like i need more cash reit so all of that $ 1000 goes into cash the reit portion to get them towards their 25 i may spend months investing only in cash the reit while the stock goes up of course if the stock goes down that $ 1000 per month goes into the stock accounts now you can also balance your account if you 'd like regularly selling stock or the reit and making the account balanced so if the stock goes down you 'd use the cash reit to purchase more stock if the stock went up you 'd sell the stock and buy reit leave more in cash

place your savings into safe interest bearing accounts take out the loans   keep constant track of your net worth having 100,000 $ and 80,000 $ in interest free debt is better than having   you can always convert money + debt into less money and less debt but you can not always convert less money and less debt into more money and more debt now there are risks that is why you want an interest bearing account to place your savings in to offset the debt   this minimizes the risk   it also reduces the return it is arguable that you should be at your most financially risky at a young age   i 'd argue that your future earnings are your by far largest asset at this point and as a high school student going into college those future earnings have extremely high variability your financial situation is extremely unpredictable being conservative about your high leverage student loan + education investments is probably justified   the fact you can manage arbitrage here means you should and if you are careful you can eliminate risk and get almost risk free profit from the maneuver if your money is in less than perfectly safe accounts you are now doing leveraged investing and magnifying the risk and return of said investments if your money must be spent on college or you 'll be financially punished then you may want to consider pulling it out before the last possible legal point just in case something goes wrong apparently 529 plans may not treat paying off student loans as a valid way to spend the money   you may need to talk to a lawyer or accountant about the legality of using these plans to pay off student loans and the tax penalties involved

edit tldr i can promise you they will lose sight again because it was never regained in the first place they are n't the first company to do it and it wo nt be the last    the company i work for office depot is doing this practice we have insane goals that no one can reach and often more daily responsibilities than an individual can finish when anyone tries to speak up against it at any level the reply is we do nt want excuses or do nt be negative completely ignoring any issues presented to them instead rather than problem solving those who bring issues to light are treated as having created the problem   we the company got in trouble a while back for our pc tune because the tool did n't accurately portray the condition of a customers system if you ran the tool it would ask do you have x or y symptoms pop ups slow etc and if you selected yes it would tell you that it found possible infection symptoms it did n't make it clear that the scan did n't detect this they then paired this with techs that were n't trained in any way other than selling using the tools diagnosis and unrealistic sales goals when you could n't reach numbers you were eventually replaced if the store did n't reach numbers it came down on management who would fake numbers by returning items and reselling them as service sku 's every tech i knew complained about the awful diagnostic tool and the unrealistic goals and what they were causing many of us refused to use the tool on the grounds of it being misleading and immoral depot responded by requiring a minimum amount of logged uses of the tool per week depot did nothing but treat it as negativity until it was brought up in the news after a disgruntled tech let the word out then suddenly it 's were sorry acting like they had no idea what was going on and   the roll out of a new tool that simply had a remote technician give the same diagnostic which has since changed again we still have the same push for sales goals and attach rate push for office service and square trade sales and zero accountability they train no one create goals and act surprised when they figure out how people are meeting these goals   nothing has actually changed in a relevant way the same core problem still exists they 've only changed the face   these issues are prevalent in the company as we have minimal payroll for staffing at all times and high expectations with poor tools across the board i 've watched many people get fired for not meeting goal expectations and many more quit i 've watched the people who could meet the goals praised only to be fired a short time later when it 's found they only met the goal through cheating of some sort    every single strategy corporate tries has still followed this same format of over promise and under deliver they pile more on while cutting resources constantly and they still have n't learned the lesson that the result is the same every time regardless of game plan the best part is the higher ups all switch out every 3 6 months it seems i 've had at least 4 district managers in the short time i 've been here multiple 's and lp 's everyone comes in for 6 months then jumps ship to somewhere more stable meanwhile we cut costs to appear more profitable    the whole retail side of the company is a sham

graphs are nothing but a representation of data every time a trade is made a point is plotted on the graph after points are plotted they are joined in order to represent the data in a graphical format   think about it this way   1 walmart shuts at 12 am is selling almonds at $ 10 a pound   3 walmart says that the price is going to reduce to $ 9 effective tomorrow 4 you are inside the store buying almonds at pm   5 till you make your way up to the counter it is already am so the store is technically shut 6 however they allow you to purchase the almonds since you were already in there   7 you purchase the almonds at $ 9 since the day has changed 8 so you have made a trade and it will reflect as a point on the graph 9 when those points are joined the curves on the graph will be created 10 the data source is walmart 's system as it reflects the sale to you in your case the nyse exchange records this trade made buying a stock is just like buying almonds there has to be a buyer there has to be a seller there has to be a price to which both agree as soon as all these conditions are met and the trade is made it is reflected on the graph the only difference between the graphs from 9 pm and 4 am is the time the trade has happened regardless and any other stock exchange has recorded it the graph is just made from that data cheers

you ca n't change the w2 the employer issues it and sends it to the irs you can not affect it in any way the employer reported correctly you did contribute $ in 2015 you then withdrew the excess in 2016 and did it timely so it is not taxable in 2016 however the excess contribution should be added back to your wages on your tax return the way to do it is to add it to the taxable wages amount reported on w2 box 1 and attach a statement explaining that the amount added is the excess contribution you then put the corrected amount in the right place on your tax return line 7 on the form 1040 adding the difference to misc income line 21 is ok too it 's the same effect you will then need to check with your payroll that they 're aware that the excess was deposited back on the account of the next year and adjust their reports accordingly otherwise you 'll end up with excess contribution again

first lets understand what convexity means convexity   convexity refers to non in a financial model in other    words if the price of an underlying variable changes the price of an    output does not change linearly but depends on the second derivative    or loosely speaking higher order terms of the modeling function    geometrically the model is no longer flat but curved and the degree    of is called the convexity okay so for us idiots this means if the price of abc we will call p is determined by x and y. then if x decreases by 5 then the value of p might not necessarily decrease by 5 but instead is also dependent on y is y who cares its not important for us to know we can understand what convexity is without knowing the math behind it so if we chart this the line would look like a curve clearly this is an over simplification of the math involved but it gives us an idea so now in terms of options convexity is also known as gamma it will probably be easier to talk about gamma instead of using a confusing word like is the convexity of options so lets define gamma gamma the rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset 's price so the gamma of an option indicates how the delta of an option will change relative to a 1 point move in the underlying asset in other words the gamma shows the option delta 's sensitivity to market price changes or gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset so the answer is if we are long gamma convexity of an option it simply means we are betting on higher volatility in the underlying your case the vix really that simple well kinda to fully understand how this works you really need to understand the math behind it but yes being long gamma means being long volatility an example of being long gamma is a long straddle side note i personally do trade the vix and it can be very volatile you can make or lose lots of money very quickly trading vix options some resources what does it mean to be long gamma in options trading long gamma how to make a long gamma position work for you delta investopedia straddles strangles further reading if your interested even more reading

if what you are paying in interest on the debt is a higher percentage than what your investments are returning the best investment you can make is to pay off the debt if you 're lucky enough to be paying historically low rates as i am on my mortgage and getting good returns on the investments so the latter is the higher percentage   the balance goes the other way and you 'd want to continue paying off the debt relatively slowly essentially treating it as a leveraged investment   if you are n't sure paying off the debt should probably be the default

on thing the questioner should do is review the summary plan description for the 401(k plan   this may have details on any plan imposed limits on salary deferrals   if the does not have sufficient detail the questioner should request a complete copy of current plan document and then review this with someone who knows how to read plan documents the document for a 401(k plan can specify a maximum percentage of compensation that a participant in the 401(k plan can defer regardless of the maximum dollar deferral limit in internal revenue code section   for example the document for a 401(k plan can provide that participants can elect to defer any amount of their compensation salary but not to exceed ten percent 10   thus someone whose salary is $ 50,000 per year will effectively be limited to deferring at most $ 5,000   someone making $ 150,000 will effectively be limited to deferring at most $ 15,000   this is true regardless of the fact that the 2013 dollar limit on salary deferrals is $ 17,500   this is also true regardless of whether or not a participant may want to defer more than ten percent 10 of compensation this plan imposed limit on salary deferral contributions is permissible assuming it is applied in a manner   this plan imposed limit is entirely separate from any other rules or restrictions on salary deferral amounts that might be as a result of things like the average deferral percentage test

first let 's look at the tax brackets for single taxpayers in 2016 the cutoff between the 25 and 28 tax bracket is $   you said that your gross is $   this will be reduced by deductions and exemptions at least $ 10,350   your rental income will increase your income but it is offset in part by your rental business expenses for this year you will almost certainly be in the 25 bracket whether or not you receive your this year   next year if you receive your then and your salary is $ 11k higher i 'm guessing you 'll be close to the edge it is important to remember that the tax brackets are marginal   this means that when you move up to the next tax bracket it is only the amount of income that puts you over the top that is taxed at the higher rate   you can see this in the chart above   so if for example your taxable income ends up being $ you 'll be in the 28 tax bracket but only $ 10 of your income will be taxed at 28   the rest will be taxed at 25 or lower   as a result this probably is n't worth worrying about too much a bit more explanation requested by the op here is how to understand the numbers in the tax bracket chart   let 's take a look at the second line $   the tax rate is explained as $ plus 15 of the amount over $ 9,275   the first $ 9,275 of your taxable income is taxed at a 10 rate   so if your total taxable income falls between $ and $ 37,650 the first $ 9,275 is taxed at 10 a tax of $ and the amount over $ 9,275 is taxed at 15   on each line of the chart the amount of tax from all the previous brackets is carried down so you do n't have to calculate it when i said that you have at least $ 10,350 in deductions and exemptions i got that number from the standard deduction and the personal exemption amount   for 2016 the standard deduction for single taxpayers is $ 6,300   if you itemize your deductions you might be able to deduct more   personal exemptions for 2016 are at $ 4,050 per person   that means you get to reduce your taxable income by $ 4,050 for each person in your household   since you are single with no dependents your standard deduction plus the personal exemption for yourself will result in a reduction of at least $ 10,350 on your taxable income

gt using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment   do you believe this kind of belief the problem if you look at the data roughly 20 of college graduates will do really well for themselves which is difficult to ignore but when you look at the remaining 80 of graduates the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education   you being a financial advisor i 'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving the prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career but that is based on the aforementioned top 20 who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator   with that the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt but loses a ton of early earning potential and often can not convert that education into a higher income than anyone else it comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems

without all the details it 's hard to tell what options you may have but none of them are good   when you cosign you are saying that you believe the primary signer will make good on the loan but that if he does n't you will you are 100 responsible for this debt as such there are some actions you can take first really try to stress to your friend that they need to get you outta this loan urge them to re finance with out you if they can next look for better ways of defaulting on the loan and take them depending on what the loan is for you could deed in or short sale you may just have to admit default if you work with the bank and try not to drag out the process you will likely end up in a better place down the line   also of importance is ownership if you pay the loan do you get ownership of the thing the loan was secured against usually not but working with an attorney and the bank maybe for example if it 's a car can the friend sign over the car to you then you sell it and reduce your debt   basically as a cosigner you have some rights but you have all the responsibilities you need to talk to an attorney and possibly the bank and see what your options are at this point if you think the friend is not that much of a friend anymore it 's time to make sure that any conversation you have with them is recorded in email or on paper

yes a minor can have a checking account or a savings account they can even get a debit card the money in that bank account belongs to the minor the account can be established as soon as the are assigned their social security number if they are a newborn the account is generally set up as a joint account with a parent to facilitate transferring money into the account for us the money was birthday gifts from relatives   the irs allows minors to receive small amounts of interest or other unearned income tax free in 2015 that is up to $ if they have no earned income when bank rates were higher some parent 's wanted to put all their saving under their child 's name of course in the eyes of the law the money belonged to the child and was only to be spent for items that benefited the child credit cards are another matter because the card act in 2009 required lenders to only give credit to those under 21 who had proof of sufficient income unless there was a co signer you do have to be careful when talking about owning a house as minor they generally ca n't sign a contract you could gift the house to the minor but if it was time to sell it the courts would insist on appointing a legal guardian to represent the interest of the child that could add significant time to the transaction

yes i really do n't disagree with anything that you 're arguing regarding social mobility in general the lack of social safety net in the us and uk do n't enable social mobility   i would also point out that rich kids tend to inherit and so tend to stay in the class with which they were born to for instance i know a lawyer whose son is a fuck up sure he 'll have six figure income all his life due to inheriting dad 's money but he 'll never earn anything on his own is that success i do n't think so   i would also assert that the point is more salient in the middle class just because my parents are middle class does n't mean that i would be middle class there 's quite a few ways that i could have off and ended up quite poor i know a consultant who was solidly middle class who 's son flips burgers for a living said son is a bloody smart person from what i heard but never got his shit together   so yes i agree that decreasing social mobility is a problem i 'd also argue that success is only on luck

i would move some or all of the money with £ 30 k savings you have a 20 deposit whereas you can get a much better mortgage rate with a 40 or 50 deposit that 's true no matter how good bad your credit rating and it 's possible that with a bad credit rating you may not even be able to get a mortgage with a small deposit also you will almost certainly save significantly more by paying less mortgage interest compared to the interest rates on your savings in the netherlands shop around for a cheap option to transfer money i had a quick look at transferwise no affiliation they just happen to have a convenient calculator on their website and the all in cost for a large one way transfer seems to be about 0.5 i think you 'll more than make that back in terms of savings on your mortgage if you intend to move back to the netherlands at some point then you are taking some exchange rate risk by moving your savings to the uk you do n't know if it 'll be better or worse when you want to transfer money back but i guess it wo n't be that soon if you want to buy a house so i think the risk is probably worthwhile i calculated the cost of the transfer by converting € 100k into gbp and then converting the resulting amount back again that left € so a two way transfer cost 1 and from that i that a one way transfer costs roughly 0.5

tl;dr be patient money is probably sitting somewhere and it will eventually be credited back to your account i had a similar problem about 10 years ago   i sent an international wire transfer from my own bank account in germany to my bank account in central america i had done this before and there had been no issues but in this case even though all the information was correct the bank rejected the wire because it was above $ 10 k and in that case the bank needs written proof from the owner of the receiving account me and so did n't know where the funds were coming from i had to call the local sparkasse bank in germany as well as an intermediary bank in london to sort it all out and in total had to wait about 3 4 weeks to get the money back in my sparkasse bank account   at one point i thought i may never see that money back especially since there was an intermediary bank to deal with but it all worked out in the end

in some jurisdictions you can donate the development rights you and the family still own it but nothing can ever be built on it in some cases you will still be able to build a cabin or similar structure on a few acres but the bulk has to be left natural   the advantage is that by giving away the logging or other development rights the land loses much of its value thus reducing the tax value of the land there are some hoops that you need to jump through but this is not an unusual transaction another choice it to see if the land touches any similar conservation areas it can be possible to donate the land to the government or other conservation group but it would revert to the family if they ever tried to sell or develop the land because you do n't own it you would not have to pay taxes but and could still use it by donating the land to the same organization a your neighbors it can streamline the paperwork for people who want to through hike

this answer refers to the us investment landscape i 'm not sure your classification of funds as direct and regular accurately reflects the nature of the mutual fund industry   it 's not the funds themselves that are direct or regular   rather it 's the way an investor chooses to invest in them   if you make the investment yourself through your brokerage account you may say it 's a direct investment   if you pay a financial advisor to do this for you it 's regular for a given fund you could make the investment yourself or you could use an advisor note that many funds have various share classes   share classes may be accessed in different ways   the institutional class may be accessible through your 401(k or perhaps not even there for example   the premium class may require a certain minimum investment   some classes will have a front end load or back end load   each of these will have a different expense ratio and fees even though the money ends up in the same portfolio   these expenses are by law publicly available in the prospectus and in numerous other places   share classes with higher fees will earn less each year after fees just as you suggest   your intuition is correct on this point now there is one fee to be aware of that funds either have or do not have   that 's a 12b-1 fee   this fee is a kickback to financial advisors who funnel your money into their fund   if you use a financial advisor he or she will likely put your money into these funds because they have a financial incentive to do so   that way they get paid twice once by you and once by the mutual fund   it has been shown in the finance academic literature that funds without this fee dominate are better in some ways and in no ways worse than funds with this fee i suppose you could say that funds and share classes with a 12b-1 fee were designed for regular investment and those without were designed for direct but that does n't mean you ca n't invest in a 12b-1 fee fund directly nor that you ca n't twist your advisor 's arm into getting you into a good fund without a 12b-1   unfortunately if you have this level of knowledge then you probably do n't need a financial advisor

the credit and debit terms here is talking from bank 's point of view should n't be a surprise banks are never known to look at things from the customers pov   in accounting a liability loans owners capital etc is a credit balance and asset cash buildings and such is a debit balance   your account is a liability to the bank in accounting parlance that is because they owe you every single penny that is there in your account btw in literal parlance too if you really make their life harder   so when the bank accepts money from you they need to increase their asset cash which they will debit higher debit balance for asset means more assets and at the same time they also have to account for the added liability by crediting the deposited money into your account so when bank says they have credited your account it means you have more money in your account now if you transfer money from your account to another or make a payment through your account your account will be debited and the beneficiary account will be 's liability towards you reduces more or less what everyone else said here but hey i could also take a swipe at banks

you ca n't do this automatically you want to understand whether the drop is from a short term high is likely to be a short term low or reflects an actual change in how folks expect the company to do in the future having said that some people do favor a strategy which resembles this betting on what are known as the dogs of the dow in the assumption that they 're well trusted but not as strongly sought and therefore perhaps not bid up as strongly i have no opinion on it i 'm just mentioning it for comparison

well perhaps have a dedicated tax advisor is an answer then i    would n't have thought of this as it 's not specifically about    taxation is it or more broadly consult with a dedicated    professional for the situation in detail yes that is the only real answer you can get anything else will vary between highly localized to entirely incorrect pensions are rarely defined benefit anymore and not many countries still keep state sponsored defined benefit pension plans for most what 's left is social security system which is in no way a pension this is an insurance and is paid as tax which is rarely refundable but you wo n't always have to pay it if you 're a foreigner in the country usually social security benefits are only available to citizens and in some rare cases residents of that country so it is unlikely although possible that you 'll benefit from social security payments of more than one country some countries have treaties that make your social security payments in one count in the other if you 're in a country that has such an agreement with the netherlands you 're lucky your personal pension savings are basically tax deferred investment accounts but tax deferral in one country does n't necessarily work in another in the us you have 401k or ira accounts but in your own country they may very well be taxable so you gain the tax deferral in the us but if your own country taxes them you lost the benefit and you will still have to abide by the us tax rules when taking the money out if you do n't plan properly you can easily be hit by double taxation in such cases bottom line you need to plan your pension savings on your own privately with a good and solid tax advice and pension planning advice that would be relevant to all the countries that you are tax resident at at any given time you can easily be resident for tax purposes in more than one country these advisers have to take into account the laws of the countries involved the tax treaties between themselves and between them and the country of your citizenship   and the future countries you 're planning on visiting or getting old at its complicated and most likely you wo n't be able to predict everything especially because the laws and treaties tend to change over time

revenue canada allows for some amount of tax deferral via several methods the point is that none of them allow you to avoid tax but by deferring from years when you have high income to years when you have lower income allows you to realize less total tax paid due to the marginal rate for personal income tax the corporate dividend approach as explained in another answer is one way tfsas are another way but as you point out they have limits   since you brought tfsas into your question about the best and easiest tax deferral option available in canada is the rrsp if you do n't have a company pension you can contribute something like 18 of your income if you have a pension plan you may still be able to contribute to an rrsp as well but the maximum contribution amount will be lower the contribution lowers your taxable income which can save you tax interest earned on the equity in your rrsp is n't taxed tax is only paid on money drawn from the plan because it is deemed income in that year they are intended for retirement but you 're allowed to withdraw at any time so if you have little or no income in a year you can draw money from your rrsp tax is withheld which you may or may not get back depending on your taxable income for that year you can think of it as a way to level your income and lower your legitimate tax burden

using fundamental and technical analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer   the whole idea behind trading with technical analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time for example you might use a moving average ma as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days hits the ma and then reverses and starts moving back up if however you also include a stochastic oscillator so to indicate when the stock is oversold under 20 and if the price rebounds from the ma average at the same time as the stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position then this may be a higher probability trade if you also only trade stocks that are fundamentally healthy as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks then this might increase the probabilities again then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up then this will increase your chances again a few weeks ago at a seminar the the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8 he then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room a man or a woman the statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next this is what we try to do with technical analysis increase our chances when we take a trade of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room just like any trade can go against you and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you lets look at an example where you could incorporate fa with ta to increase your chances of profits   above is a candlestick chart of select harvest the green line above the price is the perceived value the pink line is the 40 day ma the blue line is the eps and the white lines is the stochastic oscillator above 80 being overbought and below 20 is oversold from feb 2015 to start of aug 2015 the stock was uptrending since then the price reversed and started to downtrend the stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price and the eps starting to increase regularly from mid april thus as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the ma could be seen as a buy opportunity in fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st march and 11th june where price had reversed and rebounded off the ma the so crossed over in or near the oversold area the price did reverse and then rebounded off the ma again on 9th july however the so was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion so not as high in probability terms the price still rebounded and went up again however another momentum indicator not shown here shows some bearish divergence in this case so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time a good signal to get out of the trade that is your stop loss has not already taken you out is when the price breaks and closes below the ma line this occurred on 7th august so if we had bought on the first signal on 31st march for $ and sold when the priced broke through the ma on 7th august for $ we would have made a profit of approx 59 in just over 4 months if bought on the second signal on 11th june for $ 9.98 and again sold on 7th august for $ we would have made about 18 in under 2 months so the fundamentals the price in relation to ma and the so where all lining up to provide two high probability trades of course you would need to incorporate you risk management including stops in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought if the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances   unless you day trade which i would avoid a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day that way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether this can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules after the price broke down through the ma we can see that a downtrend which is still current today in fact i just took a short trade on this stock yesterday we can also see that the perceived value whilst still above the price has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the eps after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months so maybe the fundamentals are starting to a bit on this stock it may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future so basically you can continue using fundamental analysis to select which stocks to buy place them in a watch list and then use technical analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades

joe has explained how most mortgages work a mortgage is simply a loan backed by a property and because it 's    both very large and very common covered by some specific laws as    such the bank is n't an investor in your house it simply is lending    you money with the property as collateral so it does n't get any    share of the profit however there are some mortgages when the bank takes part of the increase in the property value e.g. ’s but to let equity loan in the uk   other products allows a old person to take money out of their property in exchange for say 60 of what the property sells for on their death islamic mortgages also work in a different way as interest is not allowed to be charged   for example unlike a conventional mortgage where the purchaser borrows money from    a lender which is then repaid with interest al bank 's sharia    compliant islamic mortgage alternatives home purchase plans or    are based upon the islamic finance principles of a co ownership    agreement diminishing with leasing

a couple ways but its not a guarantee   you have to have special charts instead of each tick being 1 min 5 min or whatever it is a set number of trades say 2000 since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts there will be small volume per tick an institutional investor however would have a much much higher trade lot size even if using an algo thus large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail similarly daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest as they have much larger trade sizes you could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used ie every time price hits vwap a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling especially if it happens multiple times in a row

not to pick your words apart but i 'm used to the word laddering as used with cds or bonds where one buys a new say 7 year duration each year with old money coming due and in effect is always earning the longer term rate while still having new funds available each year   so the article you link suggests that there 's money to be saved by not taking a long term policy on all the insurance you buy they split $ 250 k 30 year $ 1 m 20 year the money saved by going short on the bigger policy is they say $ 11k.   it 's an interesting idea will you use the $ 11 k saved to buy a new $ 1 m 10 year policy in 20 years or will you not need the insurance there are situations where insurance needs drop e.g. 20 years into my marriage college fully funded as are retirement accounts i am semi retired and if i passed there 's enough money there are also situations where the need runs longer the concept in the article works for the former type of circumstance

dividend prices are per share so the amount that you get for a dividend is determined by the number of shares that you own and the amount of the dividend per share that 's all people like to look at dividend yield because it lets them compare different investments that 's done by dividing the dividend by the value of the stock however determined that 's the percentage that the question mentions a dividend of $ 1 per share when the share price is $ 10 gives a 10 dividend yield a dividend of $ 2 per share when the share price is $ 40 gives a 5 dividend yield if you 're choosing an investment the dividend yield gives you more information than the amount of the dividend

both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local seller 's market in 2001 2002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brother in law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it 's time to sell if i 'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship i 've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer 's contracts and he told me it 's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants

you have made a good start because you are looking at your options because you know that if you do nothing you will have a big tax bill in april 2017 you want to make sure that you avoid the underpayment penalty one way to avoid it is to make estimated payments but even if you do that you could still make a mistake and overpay or underpay i think the easiest way to handle it is to reach the safe harbor if your withholding from your regular jobs and any estimated taxes you pay in 2016 equal or exceed your total taxes for 2015 then even if you owe a lot in april 2017 you can avoid the underpayment penalty if you agi is over 150 k you have to make sure your withholding is 110 of your 2015 taxes then set aside what you think you will owe in your bank account until you have to pay your taxes in april 2017 you only have to adjust your withholding to make the safe harbor you can make sure easily enough once your file this years taxes you only have to make sure that you reach the 100 or 110 threshold from irs pub 17 who must pay estimated tax if you owe additional tax for 2015 you may have to pay estimated tax    for 2016 you can use the following general rule as a guide during the year to    see if you will have enough withholding or if you should increase    your withholding or make estimated tax payments   general rule     in    most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2016 if both of the    following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2016 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of a. 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2016 tax return or b. 100 of the tax shown on your 2015 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later    your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months reminders estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers if your 2015    adjusted gross income was more than $ 150,000 $ 75,000 if you are    married filing a separate return you must pay the smaller of 90 of    your expected tax for 2016 or 110 of the tax shown on your 2015    return to avoid an estimated tax penalty

       what should i expect from therapy you should expect one or a series of confidential appointments of up to an hour in length in a suitable professional setting the process should also provide you with the opportunity to   make sense of your individual circumstances have contact with a therapist who will help identify the choices for change feel supported during the process of change reach a point where you are better equipped to cope with the future is counselling and psychotherapy confidential everything you discuss is confidential between you and the counsellor or psychotherapist there can be certain legal exceptions and the practitioner should clarify this with you prior to the establishment of any agreed contract for working you may have specific queries about confidentiality depending on the format of the therapy for example with online counselling you may wish to ask the following questions to your therapist   are the notes from therapy protected by passwords and encrypted are held in a secure cabinet what happens when there are technical problems should my therapist carry liability insurance professional liability insurance is not currently a legal requirement however a number of professional associations strongly recommend that therapists take out appropriate insurance coverage examples of insurance policies which a therapist might have are professional indemnity public and products liability libel and slander to name a few it is suggested that you check your therapist has appropriate and adequate insurance in place before engaging their services if you are unsure then you should consult an insurance professional or a legal expert for further guidance the insurance is not only intended to protect the therapist but offer peace of mind that if something should go wrong there are funds in place to compensate you in such an event for further information you may find the british insurance association website useful author professional risks

say you have $ 15,000 of capital to invest you want to put the majority of your capital into low risk investments that will yield positive gains over the course of your working career   $ 5,000 government bonds and mutual funds split how you want   $ 9,500 low risk trusted companies with positive historical growth if the stock market is very unfamiliar for you i recommend google finance yahoo finance and 's to learn about smart investments you can make you can also research the investments that hedge fund managers and top investors are making google warren buffett or carl icahn portfolio and this will give you an idea of stocks you can put your money into do not leave your money into a certain company for more than 25 years rebalance your portfolio and take the gains when you feel you need them you have no idea when to take your profits now but 5 years from now you will be a smart and experienced investor a safe investment strategy to start is to put your money into an etf that the s&p 500 over the past 20 years the s&p 500 has yielded gains of about 270 during the financial crisis a few years back the s&p 500 had lost over 50 of its value when it reached its low point however from when it hit rock bottom in 2009 it has had as high percentage gains in six years as it did in 12 years from 1995 to 2007 which about 200 the market is very strong and will treat your money well if you invest wisely $ 500 medium high risk speculative stocks there is a reason this category accounts for only approximately 3 of your portfolio this may take some research on the weekend but the returns that may result can be extraordinary speculative companies are often innovative low priced stocks that see high volatility gains or losses of more than 10 over a single month the likelihood of your $ 500 investment being completely evaporated is very slim but if you lose $ 300 here the thousands invested in the s&p 500 low risk stocks government bonds and mutual funds will more than recuperate the losses   if your pick is a winner however expect that the $ 500 investment could easily double triple or gain even more in a single year or over the course of just a few perhaps 2 4 years will see a very large return i hope this advice helps and happy investing sending your money to smart investments is the key to financial security freedom and later a comfortable retirement good luck matt

unfortunately there is very little data supporting fundamental analysis or technical analysis as appropriate tools to time the market i will be so bold to say that technical analysis is meaningless on the other hand fundamental analysis has some merits for example the realization that cdos were filled with toxic mortgages can be considered a product of fundamental analysis and hence provided traders with a directional assumption to buy cdss however there is no way to tell when there is a good or bad time to buy or sell the market behaves like a random 50/50 motion there are many reasons for this and interestingly there are many fundamentally sound companies that take large dips for no reason at all depending on your goal you can either believe that this volatility will smooth over long periods and that the market has generally positive drift on the other hand i feel that the appropriate approach is to remain active you will be able to mitigate the large downswings by simply staying small and diversifying   not in the sense of traditional finance but rather looking for uncorrelated products remember volatility brings higher levels of correlation my second suggestion is to look towards products like options to provide a method of shaping your p l giving up upside by selling calls against a long equity position is a great example ground your trades with fundamental beliefs if need be but use your tools and knowledge to combat risks that may create long periods of drawdown

i would not classify utilities including electric as additional fees   in many cases you interact directly with the utility not the landlord and pay for what you use   there are exceptions like when renting a room the renter 's insurance also is not part of the landlord 's profit it is simply there to protect you   in the case of loss the landlord can not insure your property you have to provide your own insurance   its pretty low costs typically less than 20 per month the application fee is typical    the move in fee is something that could be negotiated away and sounds pretty sketchy    you can always let your fingers do the walking and find out the fees before you look at the place

that number may be based on a long term historical view of the stock market   if you look at some long term charts for the dow   or the s&p500 you 'll see that overall the upward trend is pretty good   however there are some pretty huge flat spots in those charts and if the majority of your have been made during one of those periods you may not have seen a lot of growth if you look at periods between 10 17 years or so you can find places where it would have really sucked to be you look at the s&p chart and imagine 66 to 83 ouch and places where things were stellar    if you expand to about say 30 years or so then it 's hard to find a period without at least some good growth in there somewhere   if you panicked during a downturn and sold on the low things of course get much worse   how your own portfolio has done will depend a lot on how the funds you chose have done how much you put into equity vs fixed income and if the fixed income was in actual bonds or a bond fund    bond funds are subject to a lot more as interest rates rise or fall than something like a t bill or i bond that you own outright and plan to hold to maturity

to answer the heart of your question it would be illegal for any credit bureau or creditor to somehow penalize you just for trying to make sure that what 's being reported about you is accurate   that 's why the fair credit reporting act exists that 's where the rights and mechanisms come from for letting you learn about and request accurate reporting of your credit history every creditor is responsible for reporting its own data to the bureaus using the format provided by those bureaus for doing so a creditor may not provide all of the information that can be reported and it may not report information in as timely a manner as it could or should e.g. payments made may not show up for weeks or even months after they were made etc the bottom line is that the credit bureaus are not of the data they report   they simply report   they do n't draw conclusions they do n't make decisions on what data to report   if a creditor provides data that is within the parameters of what the bureaus ask to be provided then the bureaus report precisely that nothing more nothing less if there is an or mistake on your report it is the fault and responsibility of the creditor and it is therefore up to the creditor to correct it once it has been brought to their attention   federal laws spell out the process that the bureau has to comply with when you file a dispute and there are strict standards requiring the creditor to promptly verify valid information or remove anything which is not correct the credit bureaus are simply automated clearinghouses for the information provided by the creditors who choose to subscribe to each bureau 's system   a creditor can choose which or none of the bureaus they wish to report to which is why some accounts show on one bureau 's report on you but not another 's what i caution is just because a credit bureaus reports on your credit does n't mean they have anything to do with the accuracy or detail of what is being reported   that 's up to the creditors

what does points mean in any stock market there are certain stocks that go up and certain stocks that go down hence if we want to find the generic health of stock market i.e. on an average is it going up or down we have no means to find out   a practise that has evolved over the years is take a set of companies and find if on average they have gone up or gone down in very simple terms say in 1970 i take the market capitalization of a set of 50 companies lets say its value is x i would now call this index as value of 100 now after a month if the market capitalization is 2x the index value would be 200 after another month if the market capitalization come down to 1.5x then index value would be 150 so essentially now one is able to get the general trend more easily s&p is an index of select 500 companies based on various parameters so in isolation 2000 does not mean anything however as a comparison it does give quite a bit of insight note there are various adjustments made to factor i.e. certain companies go bankrupt or are not doing well are removed from index share splits mergers etc this ensure that the index is neutral and does not show spikes

the title question suggests an answer balance   there are countless stories of who saved their money but led miserable lives   keep in mind you are looking at debt while still earning an income lower than you 'll see after you get your phd do n't add more debt while working towards the phd but do n't think that this is the time to aggressively pay it off either   i 'd look at it this way when you get a full time job money itself will be cheaper it will cost you fewer hours to earn the same number of euros when i was in college the us minimum wage was just over $ but i had an engineering degree and back then a starting salary of over $ 20/hr while still in school my time was precious and the $ 10,000 i borrowed for spending money was 3300 hours that i did n't need to work but it was paid back with just 500 work hours   your question also goes to the future a home purchase there are 2 approaches first pay off the student loan then save for the down payment for many anti debt people this is ideal but if your goal is to be in the house sooner save now for the down payment and only pay the minimum on the loan once you are in the house you can decide to pay the student loan faster but 1.5 i 'd just pay the mortgage faster   i do n't know the cost of housing where you will choose to live but in general i 'd suggest finding the house that you can afford on a 15 year mortgage but take out a 30 this will give you flexibility in your budget life happens and it 's tough to plan for every possible outcome i 'd prefer to have room in the budget for the first years in the house and for potential marriage and the kids that may follow it 's far easier to pay extra on loans than to get lower payments when you realize the budget is too tight   happy to update edit to address any comments you may have

i 'm not a financial expert in my opinion it might be best to have as much in savings aka being liquid and the funds are insured by the fdic as possible for a couple of reasons if you lose your job your equity line could then get frozen if the bank finds out what you want to avoid is only owing 20 grand on your home because you paid a chunk off with your savings but because you lost your job you ca n't take any money out of your home and suddenly you are equity rich cash poor and jobless that is a potential for big trouble i 'm curious why you borrowed on the heloc since you seem to have a significant amount in savings anyways what you really might want to look into is lowering your mortgage interest rate to around 3.5    i would use the credit card debt as a reality check make sure every month you are making at least a 10 to 15 of the total due payment this dilutes the interest rate charge and lets you see the true drag credit card debt payments really have on your life    i do n't know this for sure but the higher amount credit card payments you make probably reflects well on your credit score and of course never be late with the credit card payments either

mortgage or other interest rates are determined by the banks on cost of funds risk and operating cost    the fed raises money from the markets by issuing bonds at a specified rate this rate at which it raises money varies on the economy thus there are 2 rates the rate at which banks can borrow money from the fed which is higher than the rate that the fed would give banks for excess money deposited with them so if the cost of borrowing is less banks can borrow this money from the fed and loan it to individuals at a slightly higher rate that would cover their costs plus a small profit the risk associated with a mortgage is less and hence these would be cheaper then say a personal loan   if the cost of borrowing goes up the mortgage rate will go up if the cost of borrowing money goes down the cost would come down banks may not always borrow money to lend if they have existing money they can either park it with the fed for a lower interest rate or loan it to individuals for a rate higher than what they would have received from the fed

it is difficult to find investment banks that offer both low fees and low minimum investments if you google around for no fee low minimum mutual funds you can find various articles with recommendations such as this one   one fund they mention that looks promising is the schwab total stock market index fund which apparently has a minimum investment of only $ 100 and an expense ratio of 0.09   i 've never heard of this fund before so i 'm just repeating the info from the site   be sure to look into it more thoroughly to see if there are any hidden costs here   i 'm not recommending this fund just mentioning it as an example of what you may be able to find another possibility is to make use of funds in an existing brokerage account that you use for yourself   this could allow you to make use of craig w.

this is several questions wrapped together how can i see the company 's financial information how strong a claim does a stockholder or have to see the company 's financials what information do i need to know about the company financials before deciding to buy in i 'll start with the easier second question which is quasi implicit   stockholders typically have inspection rights   for example delaware general corporate law 220 gives stockholders the right to inspect and copy company financial information subject to certain restrictions check the laws and corporate code of your company 's state of incorporation to find the specific inspection right   if it is an llc or partnership then the operating agreement usually controls and there may be no inspection rights   if you have no corporate stock then of course you have no statutory inspection rights   my admittedly incomplete understanding is that generally have no inspection rights unless somehow contracted for   so if you vest as a corporate stockholder it 'll be your right to see the financials which may make even a small purchase valuable to you as a continuing employee with the right to see the financials   until then this is probably a courtesy and not their obligation the first question is not easy to answer except to say that it 's variable and highly personal for small companies   some people interpret it as or the implication being that the founders are either hiding something or that you need to examine really closely the mouth of their beautiful gift horse   other people may be much cooler about the question understanding that small companies are risky and you 're being   and in some smaller companies they may believe giving you the expenses could make office life awkward if you approach it professionally directly and briefly do not over explain yourself with the responsible accountant or hr person if any then i imagine it should not be a problem for them to give some information   conversely you may feel comfortable enough to review a high level summary sheet with a founder or to find some other way of reviewing the right information in any case i would keep the request vague simple and direct and see what information they show you   if your request is too specific then you risk pushing them to show information a which they refuse to do but a vague request would've prompted them to show you information b.   a too specific request might get you information x when a vague request could have garnered xyz   vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections the third question is difficult to say   my personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity you did n't say how new this startup is or what series stage they are on so i 'll try to stay vague the actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change   most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent usually at a monthly rate   a high burn rate relative to of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of i.e. failing before exit   burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup   of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you   high burn rate might not be bad if the company is booming along towards a successful exit you might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet rather than financials alone   you want to gauge the size of the market most startups like to claim or markets so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the   you 'll also have to have a sense for the business plan and model and whether it 's a good investment or a ridiculous rehash it 's twitter for dogs meets for russian orthodox singles   in other words appraise it like an investor or vc and figure out whether it 's a prospect for decent return   typical things like competition customer acquisition costs manufacturing costs are relevant depending on the type of business activity of course i would n't ignore psychology note that economists and finance people do n't generally condone the following sort of emotional thinking   if you do n't invest in the company and it goes big you 'll kick yourself   if it goes really big other people will either assume you are rich or feel sad for you if you say you did n't get rich   if you invest but lose money it may not be so painful as not investing and losing out the opportunity   so if you consider the emotional aspect of personal finance it may be wise to invest at least a little and hedge against syndrome   that 's more like emotional advice than hard financial advice so much of the answer really depends on your particular circumstances   obviously you have other considerations like whether you can afford the investment which will be on you to decide   and of course the 83(b election is almost always recommended in these situations which seems to be what you are saying to convert ordinary income into capital gain   you may also need cash to pay any up front taxes on the 83(b equity depending on your circumstances

your comment to james is telling and can help us lead you in the right direction my work and lifestyle will be the same either way as i said    this is all about how it goes on the books emphasis mine as an independent consultant myself when i hear something like the work will be the same either way i think here be dragons   let me explain if you go the independent contractor route then you better act like one   the irs and the cra for canadians does n't take lightly to people claiming to be independent contractors when they operate in fact like employees since you 're not going to be behaving any different whether you are an employee or a contractor and assuming you 'll be acting more like an employee i.e. exclusive etc then the irs may later make a determination that you are in fact an employee even if you choose to go on the books as an independent contractor if that happens then you may find yourself retroactively denied many tax benefits you 'd have claimed and owe penalties and interest too   furthermore your employer may be liable for additional withholding taxes benefits etc after such a finding so for those reasons you should consider being an employee   you will avoid the potential headache i outlined above as well as the additional paperwork etc of being a contractor if on the other hand you had said you wanted to maintain some flexibility to with other clients build your own product on the side choose what projects you work on or do n't maybe hire subcontractors etc then i 'd have supported the independent contractor idea   but just on the basis of the tax characteristics only i 'd say forget about it on the financial side i can tell you that i would n't have become a consultant if not for the ability to make more money in gross terms i.e. before tax and expenses   that is your top line revenues ought to be higher in order to be able to offset many of the additional expenses you 'd incur as an independent   imho the tax benefits alone   would n't make up for the difference one final thing to look at is form mentioned at the irs link below   if you 're not sure what status to choose the irs can actually help you   but be prepared to wait and wait   additional resources

in the united states if someone refers to the interest rate especially if heard on news or talk radio in particular they are almost always referring to the federal funds rate a rate set forth and maintained by the united states federal reserve the fed for short if the fed opts to raise or lower this rate it subsequently effects all interest rates whether by being directly connected in a chain of loans   or by market demand through the efficiency of financial markets in the case of bond auctions the fomc meets eight times each year to determine the target for the federal funds rate   the federal funds rate effects all interest rates because it is the originating rate of interest on all loans in the chain of loans because of this significance as a benchmark for all interest rates it is the rate most commonly referred to as interest rate when used alone that is why other rates are specified by what they actually are e.g. mortgage rates 10 year 30 year for 10 year treasury and 30 year treasury bond yields respectively savings rate auto rate credit card rate cd rate all rates of interest effected by the originating loan that is the federal funds rate   this is true in the united states but will vary for other countries in general though it will almost always refer to the originating rate for all loans in a given country institution etc   note that bonds have yields that are based on market demand that is in turn based on the federal funds rate it is because of the efficiency of financial markets that the demand and thus the yields are correlated to the federal funds rate

in maryland a landlord must hold your security deposit in an escrow account and pay you interest when returning the deposit   the interest is simple interest it does not compound the interest rate that they must pay has changed over the last 43 years   before october 1 2004 the rate was 4   until january 1 2015 the rate was 3   currently the rate is 1.5 or the simple interest rate accrued at the daily u.s. treasury yield curve rate for one year as of the first business day of each year whichever is greater   this year the rate is 1.5   maryland 's department of housing and community development has a security deposit calculator for easy calculation of this interest however it only works for deposits since january 1 2015 it is unclear to me whether the interest rate in effect is the one that was in place when the security deposit was made or if the rate changes over the years    at most if you get 4 interest every year i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 43   the interest is accrued every 6 months so you would not get any interest for the 3 months that you rented in your year with the new law that took effect this year interest is accrued monthly at least if the interest rate changes with the new laws i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 + $ 158 3 + $ 158 1.5 0.5 some text on the security deposit calculator suggests that the laws for prince george 's county are different than the rest of the state   if you are in that county you 'll need to check the local ordinances to see what security deposit policies apply

if you were making that large of a payment via a cashiers check or other    withdrawal means from a cash account    to a credit card would the payment    generate a cash transaction report probably yes if it does require the bank to make a ctr then is there any harm in    that or anything to be concerned about    like that transaction appearing    suspicious personal reporting    implications etc are there any    other reasons why one might want to    make sure payments to a credit card    are broken up made in amounts smaller    than $ 10 k you should be concerned if you can not explain the source of the money legally if you withdrew cash from your own account and paid your credit card with it in case of questions asked you can show the account statement with the matching withdrawal and you 're done the point in this report is to point at people who move around large amounts of cash usually people pay credit cards with checks or ach transactions but if you want cash it 's your right as long as the cash was obtained legally but if you 're paying your credit cards off with the cash you got as a bribe or by selling cocaine on the streets then you should be worried by the way breaking into smaller payments may not save you from being reported to the money laundering detection agencies the report is per transaction not per payment so if the credit card statement is $ 11 k and you pay $ 5 k and $ 6 k the transaction is still $ 11k. also the bank can file a report even if it is not required it was clarified in the other answer to the same question you 're referring to if the clerk thinks the transaction is suspicious this leaves the decision on filing a report solely on the banks common sense and internal policies which you do n't know so even paying $ 10 in cash may trigger a report if the bank suspects wrongdoing

you can receive money directly into your savings bank account it is perfectly legal fyi the bank as part of regulation would report this to rbi as the funds are received for the services you have rendered you are liable to pay tax on the income the income is taxed as professional income similar to the income of doctors lawyers accountants etc if you are paying your colleagues it would be treated as expense not only this you can also treat any phone calls you make or equipment your purchase laptop desk etc as expense the difference become your actual income and you would be taxed as per the rate for individuals it 's advisable you contact an accountant who would advise you better for a nominal fee few thousand rupees and help you pay the tax and file the returns with or without accountant it is very important for you to record all payments and expenses in a book of accounts

first of all i recommend reading this short e book that is aimed at young investors the book is written for american investors but they same rules apply with different terms e.g. the equivalent tax free savings are called isas in the uk if you do n't anticipate needing the money any time soon then your best bet is likely a stocks and share isa in an aggressive portfolio of assets you are probably better off with an even more aggressive asset allocation than the one in the book e.g. 0 15 bond funds 85 100 equity funds in the long term this will generate the most income for an up to date table of brokers i recommend if you are planning to use the money as a deposit on a mortgage then your best bet might be a help to buy isa you 'll have to shop around for the best deals if you would rather have something more liquid that you can draw into to cover expenses while at school you can either go for a more conservative isa 100 bond funds or even a cash isa or try to find a savings account with a comparable interest rate

you could do a voluntary repossession while a repossession never looks good on your credit a voluntary repossession is slightly better a good friend of mine had a situation like this about 11 years ago   she was in an accident did n't have replacement coverage insurance and was left with a large chunk of debt on a wrecked vehicle that she then rolled into a new car in the end it came down to the simple fact that she could not afford a car loan on a vehicle that never was worth as much as she owed   since the car was worth less than the loan she really could n't sell it to fix the problem she called and arranged a voluntary repossession   she stopped making payments and parked the car till they came and picked it up   took about 4 months and 20 phone calls from her for them to come get it   in the mean time i purchased her a much older used but decent car for a couple thousand and she paid me back over the next year   the total she paid me back was less than the money she would have paid in the 4 months it took them to come get the car   in fact by the time they picked up the car she had paid back over half on the car i bought her yes the repossession did stay on her credit for seven years but during that time she was approved for a mortgage cellphone plans and credit cards etc   therefore i do n't know that it did that much damage to her credit when her car was sold at auction by the repo company it sold for much less than the loan amount technically she was on the hook for the remaining amount the outstanding balance on the loan was then sold several times to several different collection agencies over the years since then she has gotten letters every now and then demanding she pay the amount off she ignores these   most of these letters even included very favorable terms full forgiveness for 20 of the amount   at this point the statute time has run out on the debt so there is no recourse for anyone to collect from her the statute time limit varies from state to state   some states it is as long as 10 years in others it is as short as 3 years what this means is that counting from the date of the repossession of debt last payment or agreement to pay whichever is later if the statute period has elapsed and the lender collector has not filed a suit against you by the end of the period then they have effectively abandoned the debt and can not collect    find out what that period of time is in your state   if you can avoid the collection agencies till that period runs out you are scott free you just have to make sure that you do not ever send them any money or agree to pay them anything as this resets the calendar if you do not want to wait for the calendar to run out if you wait long enough you will probably be offered favorable terms to pay only a fraction of the remaining amount you just have to wait it out note i normally would not endorse anyone not paying off their debts   however sometimes it is necessary and it is for this type of situation that we have things like this and bankruptcy

well if they have whole food locations to ship from seems pretty easy it 's just a shift in resources whereas before you paid checkout clerks you now pay 1 clerk to watch 6 self pay stations if delivery is available you might be able to assume that the number of people coming into the store would be less and certainly the numbers of items they 're purchasing would go down so you can reallocate labor to delivering orders rather than checking out customers    granted i do n't think this type of change would be sudden but certainly over time as millennials begin to manage their own households

sounds like you have a in your ear the coinage act does n't restrict you from using foreign currency or lawful commodity or service to fulfill a debt you are free to do that whenever you enter into an explicit or implicit contract with another party if that was n't the case your kid trading his bag of chips for a bag of cookies at lunch would be a criminal act   it does mean that you ultimately must accept us currency to settle a debt following the previous example if your kid gives his friend the bag of chips but the cookies get destroyed somehow before being transferred the friend can offer a couple of dollars to complete the transaction the whole point of the coinage acts is to set a level playing field if you do n't pick one dominant store of value you have a situation where it is impossible to evaluate the cost of goods and services it has nothing to do with some competition with foreign currency a robust modern economy requires an adequate supply of capital and a common reference point for value within the economy think about it further with respect to article 1 section 10 of the constitution would you want a fiscally profligate state like california or new york to be able to print money and compel you as a contractor employee or creditor to accept their scrip as payment or worse require payment in gold or vermont issued dollars but pay you in their money of course not that 's why the federal government controls the currency and a dollar in alaska is the same as a dollar in georgia

you can move money from a 403b to a 401k plan but the question you should ask yourself is whether it is a wise decision unless there are specific reasons for wanting to invest in your new employer 's 401k e.g. you can buy your employer 's stock at discounted rates within the 401k and this is a good investment according to your friends neighbors and brothers in law you would be much better off moving the 403b money into an ira where you have many more choices for investment and usually can manage to find investments with lower investment costs e.g. mutual fund fees than in a typical employer 's 401k plan on the other hand 401k assets are better protected than ira assets in case you are sued and a court finds you to be liable for damages the plaintiff can not come after the 401k assets if you can not pay   to answer the question of how you need to talk to the hr people at your current employer to make sure that they are willing to accept a roll over from another tax deferred plan not all plans are agreeable to do this and get any paperwork from them especially making sure that you find out where the check is to be sent and to whom it should be payable then talk to your previous employer 's hr people and tell them that you want to roll over your 403b money into the 401k plan of your new employer fill out the paperwork make sure they know to whom to cut the check to and where it is to be sent etc in my personal experience i was sent the check payable to the custodian of my new ira account and i had to send it on to the custodian my 403b people refused to send the check directly to the new custodian the following january you will receive a 1099-r form from your 403b plan showing the amount transferred to the new custodian with hopefully the correct code letter indicating that the money was rolled over into another tax deferred account

the risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both    however in terms of mitigating the risk investor a is conservative on upside ie will exit if he gets 10 while is ready to take unlimited downside his belief is that things will not go worse while investor b is wants to make at least 10 less than peak value and in general is less risk averse as he will sell his position the moment the price hits 10 less than max peak value so it more like how do you mitigate a risk as to which one is wise depends on your belief and the loss appetite

having worked in insurance i can give you a few pointers firstly state that you may have to complain insurers hate complaints because they really complicate matters are loads of work and must be tracked i would advise not actually escalating it to a complaint until later as this may cause a delay as the actual process is quite convoluted mentioning the possibility of complaint sometimes makes people a bit more active try and resolve the issue and if you are n't getting anywhere then make a complaint maintain a friendly polite if you get angry and aggressive you 'll not likely get far remember that the people on the end of the phone are both human and more knowledgeable about insurance than you you want them on your side not against you make notes if you can record calls if you are recording calls you will likely legally need to give them the option of not being recorded so make sure you mention that you 're recording each individual call as soon as you start speaking to the handler   refer to your notes and make sure you carry out actions you say you will if you spend a few days sending something you said you 'd email over that day and you then chase them a few days after that they may not have had the document through their workflow yet it also urgency if you 're acting promptly and suggests that you do n't really care if you 're taking your time   get names this is an important step as this gives the handler someone to talk to who may be familiar with your case you may end up speaking to the same people more than once so try and build a rapport if you do i like this guy may lead to a bit more effort being put in and a potentially better outcome in my experience can be a bit slow to respond to things so you 'll likely have to chase them up if you chase them up and say i called on x date discussing y with z and z said they would do a b and c. has this been done yet it looks better than saying i called about a week ago and spoke to one of your colleagues who said he 'd do something for me he 's not done it what 's going on as to a plan of action i would split this into two points mis sold policy and definition of commuting mis sold policy if they truly gave your wife two options then they messed up the standard 3 offered by are social domestic and pleasure and and business use other companies sometimes roll commuting into as standard on the comparison sites however there are usually the three separate options and if you used one to set the policy up and clicked only then you may be in trouble   social domestic and pleasure only does not include commuting whilst it is your responsibility to thoroughly check any documentation that comes through it could be argued that if given two options between business use and then a reasonable person could be considered to assume that definition of did include commuting therefore they need to prove to you that there were three options offered and that your wife specifically excluded commuting if they ca n't then you should be able to argue that only two were offered and that commuting could have reasonably been assumed to be included use that term reasonable person btw it 's used in a lot of internal literature at least at the insurer i worked at not commuting firstly clarify their definition of commuting if your wife was on her way to work afterwards then they may well consider she was commuting for instance at present i drive from my house to my son 's then to my wife 's work and finally to mine my commute could be argued to be 1 minute my workplace is probably a minutes drive from my wife 's but i ca n't park in her car park but if i were to have an accident between my house and my son 's ~15 mins drive the insurers would probably consider that commuting   if she was not on her way to work afterwards and assuming your wife arranged her visit via text or whatsapp fb messenger or similar you should easily be able to show that your wife had driven from a friends house to the if she was on a holiday day or was not working on that day then that 's also something you should be able to prove either with proof of her working pattern or proof of her holiday if she does n't have a job at all then again that 's something that 's provable proof reigns king in claims so if you can prove certain key facts then you should be on to a winner

by rounding my house payments up to the nearest $ 50.00 my 30 year mortgage was paid off in 7 years   initially my mortgage payment was roughly $ 600 $ 50 going to principal and $ 550 going to interest banker 's profits by paying $ 650 i was actually doubling the amount i was paying on principal   since interest is computed as a function percentage of the outstanding principal balance the amount of my fixed payment that went to interest decreased each month and the amount that went to principal increased in 7 years i owned my home free and clear and started putting the money i had been putting into the mortgage payments into investments a rule of thumb i have discovered is that it takes half the time to save money to meet a goal that it takes to pay off the same debt

assuming usa it is possible to make the interest deductible if you go to the trouble of structuring and filing the loan as an actual mortgage on a primary residence intra family loan will find several firms which specialize in this it costs about $ 700 for all the paperwork and filing fees as of last time i checked so unless you 're going to pay at least three times that in interest over the life of the loan it probably is n't worth considering for an additional fee they 'll take care of the payment processing   if you 'd really rather be hands off about it i have no idea whether the paperwork fees and processing fees can be deducted from the interest as a cost of producing that income in theory that ought to be true but i am not a lawyer or accountant note one of the interesting factors here is that the irs sets a minimum interest rate on intra family loans it 's pretty low around 0.3 so in most cases you can say you gifted the difference if you 'd prefer to charge less but that does set a floor on what the irs will expect the lender to declare and pay taxes on there 's a lot more that can be said about this but since i am not an expert i 'll refer you to those who are i have no affiliation with any of this except as a customer once it seemed pretty painless but i ca n't claim to know whether they were really handling everything exactly correctly the website seemed to do a pretty good job of explaining what choices had to be made and their effects as well as discussing how these can be used to avoid excess gift taxes by spreading the gift over a number of years

before we were married my wife financed a car at a terrible rate i think it was around 20 when trying to refinance it the remaining loan was much larger than the value of the car so no one was interested in refinancing i was able to do a balance transfer to a credit card around 10 this did take on a bit of risk which almost came up when the car was totaled in an accident fortunately the remaining balance was now less than the value of the car otherwise i would have been stuck with a credit card payment and no vehicle

well to put things simply the government debt level has to do with the money spent by government vs the revenue the government collects the only tenuous connection between the stock market price and the capital gains tax collected at the end of the year granted there should be an increase in the cgt it would be on the actual transactions made that incurred in capital gains that is at best a drop in the bucket which trump by the way wants to reduce since over a year 100 of the shares are not exchanged this would not be even remotely close to the increase in stock market value    the government simply us no ownership over the stock market value the stock market also does not count into gdp so you could n’t use that to say your debt to gdp ratio declined    they are just so unrelated that it ’s senseless to link them

it sounds like the postage amount was paid to you rather than returned   if it had been returned and the payment originated on the card they would have to return it to the card   if it was processed as a payment it looks like someone is giving you money   paypal ca n't credit it to the card as the sender could request a refund   if paypal put the money on the card against a previous payment then they would n't be able to refund    if they add money to your bank account then they can withdraw it if a refund is required    one reason that you might get a payment is if you were being reimbursed for spending money outside of paypal   if the amount is more than you originally paid they ca n't put it on your card   they can only refund to the card   they ca n't deposit to it    if you do n't want to give them your bank account information you can just wait until the next time you use paypal and use your balance to pay   then you can bill the remainder to your credit card    if you do n't normally use paypal and just want your money back you can process a chargeback through your credit card   note that this would probably annoy paypal as it costs them and potentially money   to do this you must have paid the postage with your credit card originally   if you spent money outside paypal and were reimbursed through paypal then there 's nothing to chargeback   in that circumstance you 'd have to accept one of their options   pay with balance or deposit to bank account

as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate    we can trace it back to the early 1900s but because of electricity oil automobiles and computers it is best to track it from nixon taking us off the gold standard     coincidence i do n’t think so a fundamental change in the nature of the money supply almost exactly with a fundamental change to the shape of the nation ’s economy is the simultaneous in income inequality a coincidence too   keynesians may respond that correlation does not necessarily imply causation and though we do not know the exact causation there are a couple of strong possibilities that may have productivity   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for policymakers gdp growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency or in infrastructure but instead by just pumping money into the system   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for businesses revenue growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency   and it ’s not just total factor productivity that has been lower than in the years when america was on the gold exchange standard as a bank of england report recently found gdp growth has averaged lower in the pure fiat money era 2.8 vs 1.8 and financial crises have been more frequent in the non gold standard years   it is the best explanation for a fall in productivity even factoring in computers

first of all you do not co sign a car i assume what you mean by this is that you co signed a loan and the money was used to buy a car once you signed that loan you owed the money once a loan exists it exists and you will owe the money until the loan is paid if you do not want to owe the money then you need to pay back the money you borrowed you may not think you borrowed the money because the car went to someone else the bank and the courts do not care all they care about is that you signed the loan so as far as they are concerned you owe the money and you owe all of the money to the bank and the only way to change that is to pay the money back

question i live in half of a duplex together with other college students i put my rent roughly $ 750 in cash in the landlord 's mailbox while he was out of town for three weeks i told him ahead that i would do this but he claims i never did and he would have asked me not to anyway now he claims the money was not there when he returned and i still owe $ 750   answer well that 's tough it could be that the money was stolen from the mailbox it could be that the landlord pocketed the money and is trying to scam you your problem is that you have no receipt and no evidence at all that you paid the money there 's little you can do other than paying up again and learning from this expensive lesson

our banking system is pretty archaic compared to europe 's   i never realized it until i started managing bank accounts overseas for work   i manage many in the u.k. with their banking system you can send money to any person or company using a sort code amp account similar to our routing and account and it 's free simple and reaches the other account within 2 hours    you can include invoice s etc    it 's the same banks that we have over here hsbc citi etc i imagine the only reason why they have n't rolled it out over here is because they make a lot of $ $ $ off of wires in the us similar concept but we pay $ 30 60 per each domestic transfer and it can take days   when my boss moved over here from uk and opened a personal bank account he was horrified to find out that the bill pay function in online banking sent paper checks and that you could n't just send money to people companies easily and immediately   the infrastructure and technology is already in place at the big banks but the banks make big fees off offering us archaic features and too few americans realize it can be so much easier until we legislate that banks offer us the better services that already exist elsewhere i doubt we 'll get them

the purpose of long term care insurance is to pay for your long term care while protecting your assets this is highly recommended to people who have high risk factors or family history people who will most likely receive care should purchase this as early as possible in order to avoid the soaring cost of coverage and care another reason why people should buy this is is because of the much longer life expectancy today statistics would show that about 70 of people who are 65 years old will need long term care this is obviously high and alarming for me this is enough to encourage people to prepare for their future and buy insurance for long term care

the most important thing is to keep in mind the deadline if you want to have it count for 2016 you need to open the account and transfer the funds by tax day do n't wait until the last day to do it or you could run out of time setting up the initial account and them verifying your information and transferring the money could take a few days first decide how much of a lump sum you want to invest   initially this will determine some of your options because the mutual fund will have a minimum initial investment many of the funds will allow subsequent investments to be smaller   the beauty of a ira or roth ira is that if the fund you want is out of reach for this initial investment in a few years you can transfer the money into another fund or even another fund family without having to worry about tax issues now decide on your risk level and you time horizon because you said you are student and you want a roth ira it is assumed that you will not need this money for 4 + decades so you can and should be willing to be a little more risky as said an index fund is a great idea many also advise an aged based fund my kids found that when they made their initial investments the age based funds were the only one with a low enough initial investment for their first few years   then pick a fund family based on the general low fees and a large mix of options the best thing is that in a few years as you have more money and more options you can adjust your choices

most answers have concentrated on this being a scam however it is possible this is an innocent mistake australian bank account numbers do not have redundant digits to be used to validate an account number all of the numbers are data and uniquely identify a bank and branch the number and an account the account number computer check digits are not part of bank account numbers because bank account numbers pre date computers it is entirely possible that someone entering an incorrect number can by chance hit upon an existing account as the bank clearance system in australia is entirely automatic there is no cross checking of account numbers with account names   internet banking in australia is not a wire transfer as is common in places like the usa although these can be done here you are effectively accessing your bank 's back office nor is it like the service which   is used primarily by b to c businesses as a way for their customers to pay their bills when using this service the biller code will show you who you are paying and the customer number does have check digit validation i run a business in australia and it has happened to us on several occasions than an employee or supplier has given us incorrect numbers usually it is not a real account and after a week or so the money makes its way back to us with a message like no account or a c closed   very occasionally however the wrong number hits a live account when that happens the person who up needs to contact their bank and try and get the transaction reversed if there is money in the destination account this usually happens with little fuss however if the destination account has been closed or emptied things get problematic of course taking money that is n't yours is stealing even if it happens to be sitting in your bank account however unless the sum involved is significant the police are usually not interested in diverting their attention away from serious crimes like armed robbery and terrorism so the party is usually on their own that said this is probably a scam because they called you rather than your bank doing so they can not get your phone number from your account number they have to know who you are and what your account number is this is not as hard to do as it sounds since both your name and account number are prominently printed on your cheques and deposit books possibly your phone number as well which saves them looking it up in the white pages

the strategy could conceivably work if you had sufficient quantity of shares to fill all of the outstanding buy orders and fill your lower buy orders   but in this case you are forcing the market down by selling and reinforcing the notion that there is a sell off by filling ever lower buy orders   there is the potential to trigger some stop loss orders if you can pressure it low enough   there is a lot of risk here that someone sees what you are doing and decides to jump in and buy forcing the price back up   could this work sure   but it is very risky and if you fail to create the panic selling then you risk losing big   i also suspect that this would violate sec rules and several laws   and if the price drops too far then trading on the stock would be halted and is likely to return at the appropriate price bottom line i can not see a scenario where you do not trigger the stop net a profit and end up with as many or more stock that you had in the first place

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

i really like rocky 's answer some more info keep in mind there is no limit on punitive damages   you could sue for the pants 160 + the filling fee 50 + a reasonable hourly rate to compensate your time assume 200 + punitive damages of   assume 5000 limit on small claims court   when facing a suit of 5000 it could be much cheaper to settle for 160 keep in mind you do n't have to take it   once you file you may only settle for the pants plus filling fee   once you actually get to court you may only settle for the pants + filling fee + some time compensation if you have the claim ticket you will win   the question becomes how much punitive damages could you also win   filling fee easy   the compensation for your time very likely    once the owner is served a summons they will probably go to a lawyer   the lawyer will tell them to settle asap   use that to your advantage    one thing you might be able to settle for is free dry cleaning   they might give you the $ 160 plus another $ 160 in free dry cleaning if you are willing to use them again

they are wrong agreed the problem i have is that sooner or later you get in so much debt no one will lend money to you anymore at that point austerity is forced on you the increased spending comes from domestic and foreign investors we all know how fickle the financial markets can be if our debt gets too high and they cut off the tap we are fucked i do n't think we are anywhere near that point now however things can change dramatically in the course of a few months political tensions global uncertainty and social unrest could all cause enough of a panic that people start questioning the safety of u.s. treasuries we could also see the day where everyone collectively demands the u.s. stop ripping them off with negative bond yields like i said i see no indication of that now but who knows how long it will take   i know this is a bit of a tangent but it is clear my solution borrow money to improve the economy while you can but make sure that your dollars count to fixing the economy otherwise you are going to be stuck with a stagnant economy   and at a serious risk of bankruptcy when the financial markets no longer see you as a wise investment you ca n't save yourself from falling off of two at the same time so our politicians should stop dicking around and start looking for real solutions with the money they are borrowing instead of pissing it away on useless shit

bob should treat both positions as incomplete and explore a viewpoint which does a better job of separating value from volatility so we should start by recognizing that what bob is really doing is trading pieces of paper say stocks from fund 1 or bonds from fund 2 to pick historically volatile and non volatile instruments for pieces of paper   in the end this is a trade and should always be thought of as such   does bob value his stocks more than his bonds   then he should probably draw from fund 2   if he values his bonds more he should probably draw from fund 1 however both bob and his financial adviser demonstrate an assumption that an instrument whether stock bond or dollar bill has some intrinsic value which may raise over time   the issue is whether its perceived value is a good measure of its actual value or not from this perspective we can see the stock fund 1 as having an actual value that grows quickly 6.5 = and the bond fund 2 as having an actual value that grows slower 4.5 1.15 $ = $   now the perceived value of the stocks is highly volatile   the chairman of the fed and a high velocity trader drives a stock up or down at a rate that would give you this perspective aligns with the broker 's opinion   if the stocks are low it means their perceived value is artificially low and selling it would be a mistake because the market is those pieces of paper as being worth less than they actually are   in this case bob wins by keeping the stocks and selling bonds because the stocks are perceived as undervalued and thus are worth keeping until perceptions change on the other hand consider the assumption we carefully into the argument without any the assumption that the actual value of the stock aligns with its historical value   past performance does not predict future results   its entirely possible that the actual value of the stocks is actually much lower than the historical value and that it was the perceived value that was artificially higher   it may be continuing to do so who knows how overvalued the perceived value actually was   in this case bob wins by keeping the bonds   in this case the stocks may have underperformed to drive perceptions towards their actual value and bob has a great chance to get out from under this market the reality is somewhere between them   the actual values are moving and the perceived values are moving and the world mixes them up enough to make lottery tickets look like a decent investment instrument   so what can we do bob 's broker has a smart idea he 's just not fully explaining it because it is unprofessional to do so   historically speaking bobs who lost a bunch of money in the stock market are poor judges of where the stock market is going next arguably you should be talking to the joes who made a bunch of money they might have more of a clue   humans are emotional beings and we have an emotional instinct to cut ties when things start to go south   the market on emotional thinkers happily giving them what they want in exchange for taking some of their money   bob 's broker is quoting a well recognized phrase that is a polite way of saying you are being emotional in your judgement and here is a phrasing to suggest you should temper that judgement of course the broker may also not know what they 're doing   i 've seen arguments that they do n't   plenty of people listened to their brokers all the way to the great crash of 2008   brokers are human too they just put their emotions in different places   so now bob has no clear voice to listen to   sounds like a trap however there is a solution   bob should think about more than just simple dollars   bob should think about the rest of his life and where he would like the risk to appear   if bob draws from fund 1 liquidating stocks then bob has made a choice to realize any losses or gains early specifically now   he may win he may lose   however no matter what he will have a less volatile portfolio and thus he can rely on it more in the long run if bob draws from fund 2 liquidating bonds instead then bob has made a choice not to realize any losses or gains right away   he may win he may lose   however whether he wins or loses will not be clear perhaps until retirement when he needs to draw on that money and finds fund 1 is still under performing so he has to work a few more years before retirement   there is a magical assumption that the stock market will always continue rewarding risk takers but no one has quite been able to prove it once bob includes his life perspective in the mix and does n't look just at the cold hard dollars on the table bob can make a more educated decision   just to throw more options on the table bob might rationally choose to do any one of a number of other options which are not extremes in order to find a happy medium that best fits bob 's life needs i intentionally chose to label fund 1 as stocks and fund 2 as bonds even though this is a terribly crude assumption because i feel those words have an emotional attachment associated to them which 1 and 2 simply do not   given that part of the argument is that emotions play a part it seemed reasonable to dig into underlying emotional biases as part of my wording   feel free to replace words as you see fit to remove this bias if desired

hard to give an answer without knowing more details interest rates remaining principle on loans especially how soon the new roof is needed   maintaining the value in your home unless you are planning to walk away from it or short sell or something is of paramount importance and the cost of a leak should it happen can be substantial if the roof is a few years out and you have loans with interest rates about oh i 'd say around more then i would pay off those loans and take the money you were paying there and start putting it into a fund to pay for the roof i am also a huge fan of doing whatever you can to max out your 401 k contributions   money put into a 401 k early has a lot more value than money put in later and since you do n't pay taxes on it the cost out of your pocket is much lower eg at a 20 tax rate it costs you only $ 80 out of pocket to put $ 100 into your 401 look at that you just made like 25 return on that $ 80 paying off loans is pretty much equivalent to making a risk free return on the money equal to the interest rate on the loan   but to really make that work what you need to do is in a virtual sense keep making the loan payment just now pay it to yourself putting that money into a savings account or towards your 401 k or whatever   if you just torn around and start spending that money then you are not really getting as much value to paying off the loan early

first you should diversify your portfolio   if your entire portfolio is in the roth ira then you should eventually diversify that   however if you have an ira and a 401k then it 's perfectly fine for the ira to be in a single fund   for example i used my ira to buy a riskier reit that my 401k does n't support    second if you only have a small amount currently invested e.g. $ 5500 it may make sense to put everything in a single fund until you have enough to get past the low balance fees   it 's not uncommon for funds to charge lower fees to someone who has $ 8000 $ 10,000 or $ 12,000 invested   note that if you deposit $ 10,000 and the fund loses money they 'll usually charge you the rate for less than $ 10,000   so try to exceed the minimum with a decent cushion    a balanced fund may make sense as a first fund   that way they handle the diversification for you   a targeted fund is a special kind of balanced fund that changes the balance over time   some have reported that targeted funds charge higher fees   commissions on those higher fees may explain why your bank wants you to buy    i personally do n't like the asset mixes that i 've seen from targeted funds   they often change the stock bond ratio which is not really correct   the stock bond ratio should stay the same   it 's the securities stocks and bonds to monetary equivalents that should change and that only starting five to ten years before retirement   prior to that the only reason to put money into monetary equivalents is to provide time to pick the right securities fund   retirees should maintain about a five year cushion in monetary equivalents so as not to be forced to sell into a bad market    long term i 'd prefer low load index funds   a bond fund and two or three stock funds   you might want to build your balance first though   it does n't really make sense to have a separate fund until you have enough money to get the best fees   70 75 stocks and 25 30 bonds should add to 100 e.g. 73 and 27   balance annually when you make your new deposit

i sell gas to gas stations your profit is n't much in gas it 's in the convenience store so if you 're going to do it focus on your store here in the midwest we have a brand of stations called everyone loves these gas stations and will go out of their way if they need gas because they 're very clean and the workers are friendly   do n't build a branded station right now branded gas is cheaper than wholesale in a lot of markets but that 's not usually typical it 's better to have options and not be locked into a bp station where you can only buy their gas no matter the price additives are bs it 's a commodity    operating capital will be fairly high   roughly per truck at say 3.00 cents gal is about $ 22,500 in a high traffic area you could be pulling 1 truck per day to keep supply full this is an assumption based on what we sell to customers do some math and that 's quite a bit of operating capital can you finance that we set credit limits on our customers but they 're not high think 50 100k for small stations which is only a couple truck loads   i do n't think it 's a terrible business to be in but i would almost rather own the trucks hauling gas to your station and charging on the gallon or on the supply side of the equation where gas is more profitable

a moving average will act as support or resistance to a stock only when the stock is trending the way it acts as support for instance is similar to a trend line take the daily chart of cba over the last 6 months the first chart shows cba with an uptrend support line   the second chart shows cba during the same period with 50 day ema as a support   both can be used as support for the uptrend generally you can used these types of support or resistance in a downtrend to determine when to buy a stock and when to sell a stock if i was looking to buy cba whilst it was uptrending one strategy i could use was to wait until it hit or got very close to the support trend line and then buy as it re bounces back up if i already held the stock i could use a break down below the uptrend support line as a stop to exit out of the stock

has good advice here i would like to add my notes if they give a 50 match that means you are getting a 50 return on immediately i do not know of a way to get a better guaranteed roi next when investing you need to determine what kind of investor you are i would suggest you make yourself more literate in investments as i suggest to anyone but there are basic things you want to look for if your primary worry is loss of your go for conservative investments this means that you are willing to accept a reduced expected roi in exchange for lower of loss of principal this does not mean you have a 100 safe investment as the last market issues have shown but in general you are better protected the fidelity investments should give you some information as to volatility or if they deem the investments conservative conservative investments are normally made up of trading bonds which have the lowest roi in general but are the most secure you can also invest in blue chip companies although stock is inherently riskier it is pointed out in comments that stocks always outperform bonds in the long term and this has been true over the last 100 years i am just suggesting ways you can protect yourself against market downturns when the market is doing very well bonds will not give you the return your friends are seeing i am just trying to give you a basic idea of what to look for when you pick your investments nothing can replace a solid investment adviser and taking the time to educate yourself

there is a white paper on the weekend effect of equity options it is a good paper and shows that for the most part option values do lose money from friday to monday which makes sense because it is getting closer to expiration of course this not something that can be counted on 100   if there is some bad news and the stock opens down on a monday the puts would have increased and the calls decreased in value article summary from the authors we find that returns on options on individual equities display markedly lower returns over weekends friday close to monday close relative to any other day of the week these patterns are observed both in unhedged and delta hedged positions indicating that the effect is not the result of a weekend effect in the underlying securities we find even stronger weekend effects in implied volatilities but only after an adjustment to quote implied volatilities in terms of trading days rather than calendar days   our results hold for puts and calls over a wide range of maturities and strike prices for both equally weighted portfolios and for portfolios weighted by the market value of open interest and also for samples that include only the most liquid options in the market we find no evidence of a weekly seasonal in bid ask spreads trading volume or open interest that could drive the effect we also find little evidence that weekend returns are driven by higher levels of risk over the weekend   the effect is particularly strong over expiration weekends and it is also present to a lesser degree over mid week holidays finally the effect is stronger when the ted spread and market volatility are high which we interpret as providing support for a limits to arbitrage explanation for the persistence of the effect christopher s. jones you can read more about this at this link for

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

not really on the corporate finance side so excuse me if my explanation seems a bit   nobody wants to give away control of their company but investors are going to demand a pretty steep discount on your equity if you do n't give them some way to steer management control is valuable and to this extent voting shares should always be worth at least as much as non voting shares   if the owner still retains 51 of the company however then the voting shares provide essentially no benefit over non voting barring the founder 's sudden with this in mind there 's basically no reason to issue voting shares in the first place   on the other hand with 40 of the voting power the founder 's still have a key vote and will rarely be overturned unless a 84 of the other investors disagree this still gives them de facto control while offering equity holders some degree of security if the founders were ever to suddenly lose their mind this added security allows the voting shares to trade at a premium over non voting which in turn allows the company to raise more money from their equity issuance

when you give a gift to another person or receive a gift from another person there is no impact on your taxes you do not have to report certain amounts in your income including the following    gifts and inheritances if you give a gift to a charity or similar organization you can reduce your taxes it is my recollection that when a family member gives a large amount of money to a child tax on the income that money earns typically interest should be paid by the giver not the child but i ca n't find any publications to that effect on the cra site there is a bit of language about gifts from an employer that are really employment income gifts and other voluntary payments 1.3 the term gift is not defined in the act in common law jurisdictions the courts have said that a bona fide gift exists when    is a voluntary transfer of property    donor freely of his or her property to a donee and    donee no right privilege material benefit or advantage on the donor or on a person designated by the donor 1.4 whether a transfer of property has been made voluntarily is a question of fact in order for a transfer to be considered voluntary there must be no obligation to make such a transfer amounts received as gifts that is voluntary transfers without consideration and which can not be attributed to an income earning source are not subject to tax in the hands of the recipient 1.5 however sometimes individuals receive a voluntary payment or other valuable transfer or benefit by virtue of an office or employment from an employer or from some other person in such cases the amount of the payment or the value of the transfer or benefit is generally included in employment income pursuant to subsection or paragraph see also guide guide taxable benefits and allowances similarly voluntary payments or other transfers or benefits received by virtue of a profession or in the course of carrying on a business are taxable receipts if the people in question are adults who are not related to each other and do n't have a business or employment relationship then you should find that regardless of the amount of the gift neither giver nor recipient will have a tax consequence

credit risk and insurance risk are highly correlated for a single legal party   trouble with one could indicate trouble with another any increase in credit risk such as new borrowing will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of insurance risk manifested as a fraudulent or subconsciously induced claim   any claim of insurance will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of default manifested as a default voluntary or not to a creditor insurer only the law applies therefore private arrangements between the borrower insured and third parties do not factor because the creditor insurer has no hope of recourse against such third parties in most places around the world regardless of whether there is a price ceiling on compensation for damages to assets limiting an insurers costs if a risk is realized then it can be presumed through sequential sampling as well as other reliable statistical techniques that future risk has risen   the aforementioned risk dominoes subsequently fall generally speaking the lower one 's financial variance the lower the financial costs   in other words uncertainty can be mostly quantified with variance and other mathematical moments as well   any uncertainty is a cost to a producer thus a cost to the consumer   a consumer who is perfectly predictable with good outcomes will pay much lower costs on average than not so one who keeps a tight financial ship not exposing oneself to financial risks and better yet not realizing financial risks will see less financial variance thus will enjoy lower costs to financing which includes insuring

money market accounts insured in the same way as other deposits are strange hybrids of traditional bank deposits and bond mutual funds because of the high inflation of the 1970s banks were starved of deposits and could not produce loans at sufficient rates   for this reason they desired a way to fund loans and congress enacted the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act which permitted a new form of account that retained the functionality of a deposit account such as checking and now electronic transfers yet transferred the risk to the account thus most of the profit   this allowed banks to fund each others new loans through packaging them into asset backed securities to be held in these special accounts as an added protection they are not permitted to carry a market value less than what 's owed to depositors and are forcibly liquidated and paid in such event   this is a rare occurrence because of the nature of the assets held credit assets such as commercial paper mortgages and corporate bonds   this is the opposite case of deposits because so long as a bank can maintain payments on its liabilities and satisfy a few other regulatory requirements non regulation satisfying assets could theoretically carry a zero balance meaning that a bank could owe depositors more than what could be paid by liquidating all assets money market accounts will typically pay a higher rate because of their structure   while inflation is low and immediate term interest rates set by the central bank are also low the net figure will not appear high but the ratio will be fantastic usually something like 3x the one downside to money market accounts is that withdrawals are restricted by frequency   this is not such a problem as before since brokerages are now issuing debit cards tied to brokerage accounts and excess money can be swept into money market accounts bypassing the regulatory restriction in short money market accounts are currently a far better choice than traditional checking accounts but pay less than savings accounts

the best way to save on clothes is up to you   i have friends who save all year for two yearly shopping trips to update anything that may need updating at the time   by allowing themselves only two trips they control the money spent   bring it in cash and stop buying when you run out on the other hand in my family we shop sales   when we determine that we need something we wait until we find a sale   when we see an exceptionally good sale on something we know we will need basic work dress shoes for example we 'll purchase it and save it until the existing item it is replacing has worn out   our strategy is to know what we need and buy it when the price is right   we tend to wait on anything that is n't on sale until we can find the right item at a price we like which sometimes means stretching the existing piece of clothing it is replacing until well after its prime if you 've got a list you 're shopping from you know what you need   the question becomes how will you control your spending best   carefully shopping sales and using coupons or budgeting for a spree within limits

i recognize you are probably somewhere in the middle of various steps here but i 'd start and go through one by one in a disciplined way that helps to cut through the overwhelming torrent of information that 's out there here is my start at a general checklist others can feel free to edit it or add their input how much house would you like to buy in terms of $ $ $ and bedrooms sq ft you can start pretty general here but the idea is to figure out if you can actually afford a brand new 2,500 sq ft house upwards of $ 500 k in your neck of the woods according to or maybe with your current resources you 'll be looking at something like a that is more entry level but still yours some might recommend that this is a good time to talk to any significant others and understand manage expectations my wife usually cares a lot about schools at this stage but i think it 's too early just ballpark whether you 're looking at a $ 500 k house a $ 300 k house or a $ 200 k   how much house can you afford in terms of monthly payments only not considering other costs like utilities yet looking around at calculators like this one from bankrate.com can help you figure this out set the interest rate 5 30-year loan and change the mortgage amount until you have something that is about of what you currently pay in rent each month i 'll get to why to your rent payment later   crap ca n't afford my dream house if you do n't have the down payment to make the numbers work remember that this does n't even include closing costs yet there are other loan options like fha loans that can go as low as about 5 down payment the math would be the same but you replace 0.8 with 0.95   then look at your personal budget come up with general estimates of what you currently bring in and spend each month overall just ballpark it   next figure what you currently spend towards housing in particular whether you are paying for it or your landlord is paying for it someone pays for a lot of different things for housing for now my list would include 1 rent 2 mortgage payment 3 electricity 4 gas 5 sewer 6 water 7 trash 8) other utilities tv internet phone 9 property insurance 10 renter 's insurance and 11 property taxes   i would put it into a table in excel somewhere that has 3 columns the first has the labels the second will have what you spend now and the third will have what you might spend on each one as a homeowner if you pay it now put it in the second column if your landlord pays it right now leave it out as that 's included in your rent payment obviously each cell wo n't be filled in fill in the rest of the third column you wo n't pay rent anymore but you will have a mortgage payment you probably have a good estimate of any electricity bills etc that you currently pay but those may be slightly higher in a house vs. a condo or an apartment as for things like sewer water trash or other community utilities my bet would be that your landlord pays for those if you need a good estimate ask around with some co workers or friends that own their own places they would also be a good resource for property insurance estimates shooting from the hip i would say about $ 100/month based on this website i 'm not affiliated   the real ouch is going to be property tax rates based on the data from this website your county is about 9 of property value so add that into the third column as well   can you really afford a house round 2 now add up the third column and see how that monthly expense amount on housing compares against your current monthly budget if it 's over you do n't have to give up but you should just understand how much your decision to purchase a house will strain your budget also you should use this information to look again at how much house can you afford   now do some more research if you need to get a revised loan amount based on the fha loan decision then use the bankrate calculator to find out what the monthly payment is for a 95 loan against your target price but remember that an fha loan will also carry pmi that is extra on top of your monthly payment or if you need to revise your mortgage payment downwards or upwards change the loan amount accordingly   once you 've got the numbers set look for properties that fit this way you can have a meaningful discussion with yourself or other stakeholders about what you can afford as far as arranging financing a realtor will be able and willing to point you in the right direction for obtaining funding etc and at that point you can just check anything you 're offered by shopping interest rates etc against what the internet has to say   feel free to ask us too it 's hard to give much better direction without more specifics

interest means that the money on the accounts belongs to you regardless of who 's name is the account titled to for example if you give money to someone non us person say   trying to avoid fbar requirements and that person puts it in his account but will give you money whenever you ask for it you have interest in that account this is in order for people not to avoid fbar requirements by putting their money into someone 's else accounts signature authority means that although the account is not in your name and the money on it is not your money you have the right to access that account and perform operations on it this usually happens when people are employees of a company and have signature authority over the company 's accounts but it is also frequently the case for people having signature authority over the accounts that belong to their family members for example your parents are not us persons but they gave you access to their account because they do n't know how to work with the bank and you do you have signature authority over the account if you have your own account you have both interest in it and signature authority over it

no need just look at the father of modern louis the french scientist   what a surprise publicly funded research in french universities    you know the big problem is that we do n't have a dozen parallel universes where we can test various systems to see which one is best in terms of health outcomes but even the data that you want to go and fetch for me is kind of absurd the number of new drug discoveries who cares it 's not the number that counts its the end results on public health longevity etc for instance you can have 10 new opioid drugs not sure that proves anything capitalism is known for inventing stuff people do n't really need convincing them through mass marketing that they actually do need it you could achieve for instance the same health outcomes with simple basic prevention policies healthy eating less pollution than pump complex drugs into people 's bodies to compensate for other toxic stuff they or eat    anyways i think that quite simply we should let capitalist firms do what they are best at mass production via economies of scale and let universities that are not only seeking profit do the actual research   also public research can cope with tons of wasteful research it happens all the time that researchers test correlations that turn out to be negative no one throws a fuss about it that 's the way research is meant to advance

what percent of my salary should i save is tightly coupled with its companion what size nest egg should my husband and i have and by what age interestingly mr 's answer 10 is the number that plugs into the equation that i reference jay 's 25x rule is part of this we start with the assumption that one 's required income at retirement will be 80 of their pre retirement income that 's high by some observations low by others a quick look at the expenses that go away in retirement the above can total 35 40 it would be great if it ended there but there are costs that go up the above extra spending is tough to nail down after all you knew what you spent and what 's going away but the new items crapshoot for non native speakers this refers to a game with dice meaning a random event again referencing mr 's answer financial planners whom you could pay to give you a very accurate number i 'm going to disagree with that consider when retirement is 30 years away you do n't know much if i can offer an analogy i once had the pleasure of hearing jim the played by tom in apollo 13 give a speech he said that for the first 99 of the trip to the moon they simply aimed ahead of their target never directly at the moon in this manner i suggest that with so many variables accuracy is impossible it 's a moving target start young take the 10 offered and keep saving every few years stop and see if you are on target if not bump the number a bit   better to turn 50 and find that after a good decade you 've reached your number and can drop your savings to a minimum perhaps just to capture a 401(k match than to turn 50 and realize you 've and need to bump to an unsustainable level imagine planning ahead in 1999 you 've seen 2 great decades of returns and even realizing that could n't continue you plan for a below average 7 this would double your 1999 balance in 10 years instead you saw zero return for a decade in sum when each variable has an accuracy of + you are not going to combine them all and get a number with even 10 accuracy as if were wrong but the pro would tell you 11 is right for you this is as absurd as packaging up a bunch of c rated debt and thinking that enough of this paper would yield a final product that was aaa

the blurb from the law site is accurate i 'm not going to say any other info from them is or is n't accurate though as i have not read their site at all if you check the public resources from fair directly you will get similar wording to that of the law firm presence of adverse public records    bankruptcy judgements suits liens    wage etc collection    items and/or delinquency past due    items once the items are on your report they will weigh the score down though less over time also paying the accounts off other than a successful pay for delete can have a negative impact on your score by paying the account off you 'll trigger a status change that will allow the account record to stick around for up to 7 more years 10 for medical debts which is why it is a better idea to let accounts fall off than it is to pay them once they are over a certain age be aware that paying off a collection    account on which you previously missed    a payment will not remove it from    your credit report your fico score    will still consider this information    because it reflects your past credit    pattern source fair understanding your fico score pdf paying an account off and getting it marked paid in full or settled or anything else really wo n't help you at all the adverse account record drags on your score just for being there

there are 2 main types of brokers full service and online or discount basically the full service can provide you with advice in the form of recommendations on what to buy and sell and when you call them up when you want to put an order in and the commissions are usually higher whilst an online broker usually does n't provide advice unless you ask for it at a specified fee you place your orders online through the brokers website or trading platform and the commissions are usually much lower the best thing to do when starting off is to go to your country 's stock exchange for example the asx in sydney australia and they should have a list of available brokers some of the online brokers may have a practice or simulation account you can practice on and they usually provide good educational material to help you get started if you went with an online broker and wanted to buy facebook on the secondary market that is on the stock exchange after the ipo closes you would log onto your brokers website or platform and go to the orders section you would place a new order to buy say 100 facebook shares at a certain price you can use a market order meaning the order will be immediately executed at the current market price and you will own the shares or a limit price order where you select a price below the current market price and wait for the price to come down and hit your limit price before your order is executed and you get your shares there are other types of orders available with different brokers which you will learn about when you log onto their website you also need to be careful that you have the funds available to pay for the share at settlement which is 3 business days after your order was executed some brokers may require you to have the funds deposited into an account which is linked to your trading account with them to sell your shares you do the same thing except this time you choose a sell order instead of a buy order it becomes quite simple once you have done it a couple of times the best thing is to do some research and get started good luck

whoa these things are on two dimensions   it 's like burger and fries you can also have chicken sandwich and fries or burger and onion rings    you can invest in an taxable brokerage account and/or an ira   and then within each of those   you can buy index funds and/or anything else all 4 combinations are possible   if someone says otherwise take your money and run   they are a shady financial advisor who is ripping you off by steering you only into products where they get a commission those products are more expensive because the commission comes out of your end   not to mention any names       if you want financial advice that is honest find a financial advisor who you pay for his advice and who does n't sell products at all   or just ask here   but i would start by listening to suze orman dave ramsey whomever you prefer   and read john bogle 's book    they can tell you all about the difference between money market bonds stocks managed mutual funds ripoff and index funds ira accounts roth ira accounts and taxable accounts are all brokerage accounts   within them you can buy any security you want including index funds   the difference is taxation   suppose you earn $ 1000 and choose to invest it however   later you withdraw it and it has grown to $ 3000   investing in a taxable account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000 when you later withdraw the $ 3000 you pay a tax on $ 2000 of income   if you invested more than a year it is taxed at a much lower capital gains tax rate   with a traditional ira account you pay zero taxes on the initial $ 1000   later when you take the money out you pay normal income tax on the full $ 3000   if you withdrew it before age 59 1/2 you also pay a 10 penalty $ 300   with a roth ira account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000   when you withdraw the $ 3000 later you pay nothing in taxes   provided you followed the rules    you can invest in almost anything inside these accounts money market funds terrible return   you wo n't keep up with the market   bonds   low return but usually quite safe   individual stocks   good luck    managed mutual funds   you 're paying some genius stock picker to select high performing stocks he has a huge staff of researchers and   good social connections   he also charges you 1.5 per year overhead as an expense ratio which is a total loss to you   the fact is he can usually pick stocks better than a monkey throwing darts   but he 's not 1.5 better   index funds   these just shrug and buy every stock on the market   there 's no huge staff or genius manager just some intern making small adjustments every week   as such the expense ratio is extremely small like 0.1     if any of these investments pay dividends you must pay taxes on them when they 're issued if you 're not in an ira account   this problem gets fixed in etf 's   index etf 's   these are index funds packaged to behave like stocks   dividends increase your stock 's value instead of being paid out to you which simplifies your taxes   if you buy index funds outside of an ira use these   too many other options to get into here

it makes sense as democrats tend to spend money more internally and republicans tend to spend more on foreign but with such a small sample size you get too big of an error thrown in from the random timing of events   the internet boom had very little to do with clinton   the housing bust had very little to do with bush   nixon ford and carter were victim of the up inflation from artificially maintaining the gold standard for too long   eisenhower had massive war debt dropped on his lap    i suspect that the effect is real but i doubt it is as pronounced as the raw numbers suggest   furthermore i am a lot more concerned about the long term effects of policies than the effect they have in the few years a president is around   stimulating the economy is easy   maintaining that stimulated economy and the debt load that stimulation up is another matter entirely

i believe that an understanding of the taxation system can help to understand our place in it and how that impacts each of our personal finances i will try to remain unbiased here but this is a somewhat subjective question so please bear with me if you disagree on any point some of these tax savings are well advertised and can be used by many people such as tax credits for mass transit passes which exists in some countries but some of these tax savings are things you never heard of before until it winds up on the news why do some people seem to get tax savings that you and i can not get and why do those people always seem to have so much more money than us a simplistic answer can show this in three parts 1 the source of one 's income 2 transaction costs and 3 tax loopholes tax savings occur proportionately to one 's income and if the savings apply to investment income they occur proportionately to one 's wealth if someone living paycheck to paycheck with a minimal amount in a bank account saves tax on investment income they might reduce their taxable interest from $ 50 to $ 0 that 's because they simply do n't have any other investment income to reduce all of their income comes in the form of employment which is typically very hard to save taxes on most governments have a very firm grasp on the taxation of employment income because it is a huge proportion of income in the country and therefore has the largest amount of tax associated and because it is very straightforward work for someone = employment income a more cynical person than i might point out that investment income is earned by the very wealthy who can afford to lobby for politicians to pass favourable investment income laws even very straightforward tax saving opportunities may cost money to enable the simplest example would be if a tax saving opportunity is so complicated that an average person ca n't understand it themselves then an accountant lawyer or banker will need to be the one to explain it and that can cost you money if your tax is n't so much to begin with then the transaction costs to achieve the tax savings could be higher than the tax savings themselves for example most countries have tax savings deferrals if you start a corporation these rules typically exist to promote investment in the local economy but someone who earns $ 10k in a side business might not be able to afford the $ 3k in incorporation costs just to save $ 2k in taxes the more income and wealth you have the more these transaction costs become worthwhile i 'm going to generally define tax loopholes for the purposes of this answer as something where a somewhat arbitrary situation allows for taxes that a layman would consider unfair or unexpected this often occurs with good intentions but poor legislation the government tries to provide a benefit to a deserving group or to promote an activity but ends up allowing another group to take advantage   for example in canada there existed until a few years ago tax saving rules about passing on wealth to children at lower tax rates only when a close family member is near death setting up a testamentary trust between a grandparent and a could in some circumstances allow that trust to be created with additional tax brackets meaning more income would be taxed at a less than top tax rate before being distributed to the grandchildren   the rules were put in place with the idea that oh gee a family member has died and the ol' family is so hard they ca n't distribute the wealth to the next generation for a few months on account of all the crying we should make it so that the estate is taxed like a person and if they earn only a little income they have a low tax rate and they only get taxed at the full rate if they have a lot of income seems reasonable enough but if a family is ready to pass on wealth at the same time as someone is the bucket with their foot a morbid discussion with your lawyer and accountant could set your children up for life with forever reduced taxes on massive inheritances   in the case of the panama paradise leaks tax savings are due to all 3 of the above those who have massive wealth and therefore earn the majority of their income from investments instead of employment can afford the transaction costs associated with taking advantage of specific tax loopholes the simplest example of which is just that income earned in a foreign country might have a lower tax rate than income earned domestically this is often a result of cracks in the foreign tax treaties between countries which exist generally to promote business between countries and prevent double taxing individuals who need activity in both countries for whatever reason take for example the apple loophole apple has operations around the world some activity occurs in low tax jurisdictions apple reports a high percentage of the value of r&d as being associated with those jurisdictions those branches in low tax jurisdictions charge the high tax branches such as the us with fees for use of their valuable research so much of apple 's income is reported in those foreign jurisdictions it wo n't be taxed in the us until apple the cash back to the us until then the cash sits in the foreign jurisdiction accruing less tax this and similar rules can be used by individuals wealthy enough to hold corporations in foreign jurisdictions with low tax rates how each particular rule loophole works will depend on the nature of a specific case tax law is complex and the rules between countries are even more so these foreign tax loopholes are closing every year it is getting harder and harder to hide money offshore and it is getting less and less likely that you will be able to find a country with the right loopholes for your own offshore wealth these types of news leaks will only help to expedite those changes

i know folks who considered retiring to another country their conclusion was that while base cost of living was lower the cost of the things that they enjoy doing not to mention the cost of spending time with friends they did n't want to give up would be sufficiently higher to erase most of the advantages those of us who grew up in or close to cities feel much the same way about moving out to less populated and less expensive parts of our own country   basically when cost of living is high it tends to be because there are more people who want to live there and are competing for resources and driving prices up low cost of living is generally tied to less desired locations for the same reasons if you can find a location that appeals to you and if you can get the resources there which your preferred lifestyle requires this may make sense for a while there were a number of professional writers moving from the us to ireland in part because the irish tax structure heavily favored writers and other creative artists spent several years living in a renovated irish castle i 'm not sure how many have stayed there after the novelty wore off

as stated in the other answer debit card payments even contactless ones do not debit instantly or anywhere near instantly they can take several days or even longer however the fact that the payment was approved would indicate that the contactless device used by the retailer managed to connect to your bank account and could see there were sufficient funds   at this time the payment should also have reserved the funds so it will be pending as such   your online banking may not show all types of pending transactions it may only show direct debits for example if you ring the bank i expect they will be able to see this payment and advise accordingly out of interest who do you bank with if you can see your available funds you should find that includes this payment having been reserved ie you ca n't use that money but if it 's a small amount you may struggle to spot it   again this will vary by bank and how their internet banking system has been implemented i would expect this payment to debit your account the working day after you made it or at worst the day after that   in theory with faster payment technology it could happened within 2 hours but not all banks implemented that system in the same way so delays can and do occur   if the retailer merchant banks with the same bank you do in theory the transaction could be instantaneous again depending on the bank short answer short the transaction is fine it wo n't be void you just need to wait probably a day or two this link has more info especially useful if you bank with natwest as i say the technology is likely to vary by bank to some extent   your own bank should have their own version of this

gt i m genuinely enjoying the conversation and sorry about the name calling most of my political and economic debates happen with family where name calling is not only accepted but expected lol   same we ca n't even talk about politics anymore because it became to contentious it is a shame since i do enjoy talking about it    gt this link seems to contradict that   from your source school assistant professor of strategy craig and his find that when the population of uninsured americans increases hospitals end up bearing the cost by providing care   and also from your source most of it is in the form of disproportionate share hospital payments which according to federal law are owed to any qualified hospital that serves a large number of medicaid and uninsured patients    so basically just like i said when an uninsured or person gets treated but then does n't pay the hospitals file a claim and seek reimbursement from medicare medicaid to get some of that non payment back the only thing is they only get a percent of the non payment reimbursed how do many of these hospitals deal with this by jacking up prices in the hopes of getting a larger chunk of the actual cost reimbursed    from your source   the payments are less than the care that ’s provided explains   gt this is dangerously false the industry is nt known for and going over budget    i think we are both looking at our respective industries through rose colored glass i think we can agree that each of us can point out instances where industry and government have the bed you can probably spill out a dozen example of government wasted dollars and i can tell you a dozen example of corporations that were n't efficient that were slow and that the government beat them at a task    i think we are both right and that both exist in a world where they can be inefficient and wasteful and they can also be speedy and innovative if you would like to see examples i will share some    what we have n't seen is a world in which commercial runs it all and runs everything efficiently we have seen places where government runs it all and it went to hell in a ussr nk east germany are all prime examples i actually lived in germany when the wall came down so i got to see what an and a government only run program looks like firsthand

i think the answer to this question depends on how much you trust yourself most people are wonderful at deceiving themselves i 'd personally not trust myself i 'll use 's points for the pitfalls some people get into you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights   this is actually the risk i 've seen many people do they 'll blow their money in one semester under the assumption that they 'll just earn more in summer and keep it for expenses or the future another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit no credit in the usa is actually a good standing many sensible banks or credit unions will happily give people with no credit a loan this makes intuitive sense if you think about it imagine two people with the same income one owes money regularly to multiple sources and the other has no debt obligations which one are you loaning money to simplifying things a lot great credit is best followed by no credit then good credit and then bad credit the advantage of great credit over no credit is simply that some institutions in some sectors do n't have the policies in place to process no credit people no credit people plan to not apply for credit often for self explanatory reasons so this is a point

you can file a revised w-4 with your employer claiming more allowances than you do now more allowances means less federal tax and if applicable and likely with a separate form less state tax this does n't affect social security and medicare with holding though   that being said us taxes are on a pay as you go system if the irs determines that you 're claiming more allowances than you 're eligible for and not paying the proper taxes throughout the year they will hit you with an underpayment penalty fee which would likely negate the benefits of keeping that money in the first place this is why independent contractors and self employed people pay quarterly or estimated taxes depending on the employer they may require proof of the allowances for adjustment before they accept the revised w-4

trust me so am i.   we really had feared the scenario you painted everyone in the hoa has been very pleased that it did n't happen that way   my point is n't that you are wrong i think in some markets what you are talking about undoubtedly is happening rather that it is n't necessarily happening that way everywhere   indeed some of the people who have bought in our area were people who seem to have a more frugal solid long term mindset and who had rented throughout the bubble years often of ever being able to afford a home but being unwilling to pay the high prices go deep into debt w/o any equity at all so they simply endured it and saved and saved hoping to someday and their patience has been rewarded some have been able to use what they thought would merely be a modest down payment to nearly buy the houses outright taking on minimal debt and then using that to refurbish the homes

well like a lot of stuff on there is not a simple answer but generally it is not a good thing take a look at the wikipedia entry on net operating loss basically the company is commenting that when they do make money they will receive preferential tax treatment on that income     so whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on a couple of things nol does n't directly impact book value other than how the actual assets of the company changed over the previous quarter i believe there is a 1:1 correspondence to how the assets change and nol but i am sure someone could clarify that for me in another answer or as a comment

you bought a rental property in 2001 hopefully you paid fair value else other issues come into play   say you paid $ you said you have been taking depreciation which for residential real estate is taken over 27.5 years so you are about halfway through since you do n't depreciate land you may have taken a total $ 50 k so far   with no improvements and no transaction costs you have $ 50 k in depreciation recapture taxed at a maximum 25 or your lower marginal rate and a cap gain of the 5 10 k you mentioned either can be offset by losses you 've been carrying forward if you suffered large stock losses at some point

they 're not necessarily assigning the risk outright because it 's just an option if a company makes a certain product there 's often some put in to spare parts from the outset it 's not exactly a huge risk for a company to order knobs in a lot of 15,000 and keep 500 as spares    what is way cooler is the possibility of a company not having to make a physical product at all but simply providing designs to the customers once a certain limit of buyers has been reached somewhat like a kickstarter campaign the article talked about this briefly but i think that 's where the real revolution will happen   touches on this in the diamond age i believe in which 3d printers are vending machine type boxes in every street corner 7 11 you purchase a product that 's made on the spot no matter what it is

there are tax free bonds in the united states   they are for things like public housing and other urban projects   they are tax free for everyone but only rich people buy them   why    the issue is that the tax free nature of the bond is included in its yield   so rather than yielding say a 5 return they figure that the owner is getting 20 off due to not paying taxes   as a result they only give a 4 return but are as risky as a 5 return investment   net result only rich people invest in tax free bonds   rich is defined here to mean people paying a 20 tax on long term investment returns    or take the state and local tax salt deduction which has been in the news recently   again it is technically open to everyone   but there is also a standard deduction that is open to everyone   for the typical family state and local taxes might be 5 of income   so for a family making $ 100k a year that 's $ 5k   the same family can take a $ 13k or so standard deduction instead of itemizing   so why would they take the smaller deduction    as a practical matter two groups take the salt deduction   people rich enough to pay more than $ 13k in state and local taxes and people who also take the mortgage interest deduction   so it helps a lot of people who are rich quite a bit   and it helps a few middle class people some    but if you are lower middle class with a $ 30k mortgage on a tiny house and paying 4 interest then that 's only $ 1200 a year   add in property taxes of $ 3000 and salt of $ and that 's only $ 7k   even if the person gives $ 3k to charity the $ 13k deduction is a lot better and requires less paperwork    contrast that with someone who has $ 500k mortgage at 3.6 interest   that 's $ 18k in interest alone   add in a salt of $ 7k and property taxes of $ 50k and there 's $ 75k of itemized deductions much better than $ 13k   now a $ 7k donation to charity is entirely deductible   and even after the mortgage interest deduction goes away the other $ remains

the answer depends on whether the company involved has limited liability most but not all public and listed companies and corporations have this but not all so it is worth checking and understanding what you are getting involved with    the expression limited liability means that the owners shareholders of a company have a liability up to the amount of the face value of the shares they hold which they have not yet paid for the difference is usually minor but basically it means that if you buy $ 10 of shares you have no liability but if the company gives you $ 10 of shares and you pay them in cash or kind $ 5 then you still have a liability of $ 5 if the company fails the debtors can come after you for that liability   an unlimited liability company is a different animal altogether lloyds insurance is probably the most famous example lloyds worked by putting together to underwrite risk if the risk does n't happen the consortium keeps the premiums if it does they cover the loss most of the time they are very profitable but not always for example the which covered asbestos caused the bankruptcies of a great many very wealthy people

contributions are post tax so there 's no direct tax benefit to choosing a year i just made a 2010 contribution today and the institution 's form explicitly asks me if i want it on 2010 or 2011   the primary advantage of like this is being able to contribute 5k more over your lifetime than otherwise possible under the timing constraints while there may be a year in the future which you do n't contribute the max contributing now lets you build up earnings tax free for 10 vs 11 you 're probably holding cash so it 's not a big deal but over five years is a long time to hold cash or invest with tax penalty

well if you only own the option you are only limited to loosing the premium with futures at least with the brokers i talked to most of the time you need to sign a margin contract just to trade futures i do n't want to go into debt and i do n't think i would do too well to be fairly honest i am a college student and want to limit my risk and so just trading the option would help me get access to the commodity markets without having to get margin like many brokers want me to do i am not trying to do any hedging or anything which i am aware you can do all i want to do is do an inflation trade and i believe commodities are the best way to me honest if i had my way i would just buy and hold and that is the strategy i want to emulate closest even though i know i ca n't hold it forever basically i want to avoid debt but still trade commodities

for those that are on the forefront of innovation and are passionate about their work sure but i 'd guess that demographic only makes up about 10 percent of the workforce for the rest of us you have to ask yourself the question is it worth it   the rest of us are mostly maintaining society and providing services what if 2 people worked the same job that 1 person works each putting in 3 days a week instead of 5 unemployment would go down    maybe people only work these long weeks because they 've been told it 's their only option also we do n't really have the choice if i apply for a job and tell them i 'd like to only work 3 days a week they 'd laugh me out

this would be no different than asking if you can live in one state and earn a paycheck then move to another state with a lower tax rate before your tax bill is due so you can save on your taxes for that income answer no the tax on lottery winnings is based on the state where the lottery was held because for legal purposes that 's where the winnings are considered to have been earned for taxation purposes also changing where you live after earning money does not change your tax liability at all   you still owe the state where the money was earned the tax that is due i hope this helps good luck

how i understand it is supply demand affect price of stock    negatively positively respectively correct volume is the amount of buying selling activity in these stocks more    volume = more fluctuation right sort of   higher volume means higher liquidity   that is a stock that is traded more is easier to trade   it does n't necessarily mean more fluctuation and in the real world it often means that these are well understood stocks with a high amount of analyst coverage   this tends towards these stocks not being as volatile as smaller stocks with less liquidity company revenue and profit will help an investor predict company    growth that is one factor in a stock price   there are certain stocks that you would buy without them making a profit because their future revenue looks potentially explosive   however these stocks are very risky and are bubble prone if you 're starting out in the share market it 's generally a good idea to invest in index funds i am not a broker my advice should not be taken as financial advice   these funds aggregate risk by holding a lot of different companies   also statistics have shown that over time buying and holding index funds long term tends to dramatically outperform other investment strategies particularly for people with low amounts of capital

by basic public pension i assume you mean social security which is pretty much the only quasi universal pension like thing in the usa   if she has any other sort of pension e.g. from a job you 'd need to get more specific info about that as for social security as described here while you are working your earnings will reduce your benefit amount only until you reach your full retirement age according to the calculator on that site if she is 65 now her full retirement age would be 66 so if she retires after that age her ss benefit wo n't be reduced due to extra income as described here if she has considerable income apart from ss she may have to pay taxes on her ss income   this would not reduce her income but means the benefit of her extra blog income would be reduced   this page describes how to calculate your provisional income to determine whether ss benefits will be taxed   according to that page if your provisional income is less than $ 25,000 for single or head of household returns or $ for joint returns then your social security benefits will not be taxed based on the numbers you gave this suggests she would not incur an ss tax   however she should probably take a look at the social security retirement estimator and other tools on that site if she has n't already done so to get a sense of what sort of income ss will be providing her i 'd suggest that she talk to a retirement planner and/or cpa to get a handle on what her finances would be like   at the least she should find someone knowledgeable about social security policies and tax issues in the usa   as you say you are unfamiliar with the way these matters work in the usa so your ability to help her make financial decisions is limited

this popped up on /r health recently     one thing that i 'd point out   the assertions that you 'll suffer just as much from slow diets as crash ones are speculative toward the end of the article it notes that is now conducting a study using a slower weight loss method and following for three years instead of one   obviously but it does n't with my experience   i got fat   did n't like it   i started eating a diet where i would lose weight slowly and exercising a little more   now i 'm not fat   i eat a quantity of food pretty much commensurate with my expenditure i do n't spend my days starving and thinking constantly about food and enjoy exercising regularly   this effect if it exists is definitely not universal

you can not claim back vat what happens is that if you sell goods with vat and charge customers vat you would have to send that vat straight to hmrc but if your business itself paid vat then you already paid vat so you have to send less   as an example if you send an invoice for £ 10,000 plus £ 2,000 vat and you paid yourself £ 500 vat on business related expenses then you need to send £ 2,000 £ 500 = £ 1,500 to hmrc   but if you do n't send invoices including vat then you owe hmrc £ 0 any vat you paid on business related expenses is lost hmrc wo n't pay you money   btw only vat on business related expenses can be deducted so if you want to be smart register for vat and get the vat on your weekly shopping bill refunded forget it

well there is a gap    in a democracy we vote for our government    we believe in them at least the majority does      and generally government fights on the side of capital and produces rhetoric on the side of capital and the same people who voted for their government believe the shit they 're being fed   government generally has the difficult job of balancing labour and capital    both are incredibly important tools to manage     if i voted for the governing party and they produce against a labour dispute well no shit i 'd believe them they 're the people i voted for and trust      it 's unfortunate

today typically a business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account it is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency so one can have an account number say and have it in say aud and usd so the balance will always show as x aud and y usd if you deposit funds electronic check or cash in usd your usd balance goes up likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies   so in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts with the advantage of remembering only one account number designate a particular currency as default currency so if you do n't quote a currency along with the account number it would be treated as default currency otherwise you always quote the account number and currency of course bundled with other services like free fx advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive edit if you have aud 100 and usd 100 if you try and withdraw usd 110 it will not be allowed unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion   if you deposit a gbp check into the account by default it would get converted into aud assuming aud is the default currency
