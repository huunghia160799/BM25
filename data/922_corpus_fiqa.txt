you will have to write it off as an offset of capital gains or as bad debt against personal income limited to $ yr write off 3k this year 2k next here 's the tax code you 'll need to file a form 8949 link below so this requires that it is a loan acknowledged by both you and the borrower with terms of repayment and stated interest as well as wording for late payments and time for delinquency   the loan document does n't have to be fancy but it must show a reasonable intention of repayment to distinguish it from a gift   then send out a for cancellation of debt this is a starting point it 's a good idea to run everything by your tax to make sure you 're meeting the requirements for bad debt with your contact and payment communication

i 'd be down with student loan debt but only after massive reform to who can take out student loans the fact that we have students studying fields with limited possibility of ever finding work and borrowing $ 150k to do so is patently ridiculous if you want to study anthropology no you ca n't borrow 6 figures it 's a super cool subject i 'd love to study it but fuck no i 'm not going to borrow money to do that any more than i 'd borrow 6 figures to travel around europe for 4 years social sciences are generally a big part of the problem right now and students are frankly being misled by schools who the career potential of many fields   sociology women 's studies anthropology comparative religion studies american studies psychology etc all excellent and worthy subjects if you can afford them but students should n't dig a hole for themselves to study them and then complain later when they ca n't find work

i think you are asking a few questions here why is gold chosen as money in a free market there are five characteristics of a good money gold and silver meet all five characteristics   diamonds are not easily divisible which is why they are not normally used as money   copper iron and lead are not scarce enough you would need a lot of these metals to make weekly or daily purchases   paper is also way too plentiful to be used as money by the way historically silver has been used for money more than gold how does international trade work with gold as money is this what you are asking with your hypothetical example of 10 countries each with y amount of gold typically a government will issue a currency that is backed by gold   this means you can redeem your currency for actual gold   then when an american spends 5 us dollars usd to purchase a chinese good the chinese man now owns 5   the chinese man can either redeem the 5 usd for gold or spend the 5 usd in the us   if a government issues more currency then they have gold for then the gold will start to flow from that country to other countries as the citizens of the other countries redeem the over issued currency for gold   this outflow of gold restricts governments from over issuing paper currency who creates the procedures and who them in modern worldwide economy the federal reserve imf and bank of international settlements all are involved in the current system where the us dollar see bretton woods agreement is the reserve currency used by central banks throughout the world   some think this system is coming to an end   i tend to agree

i wo n't answer in a detailed manner because most people at this site like answers with certain bias on these questions like pool resources always relative to which partner is asking   if you follow the above advice you are hoping things work out   great   what if they do n't   it will be very messy   unlike most of my peers i did not follow the above advice and had a very clean exit with both of us feeling very good and no lawyers got involved either win win for both of us with all the money we saved one assumption people make is the person with the lowest income has the strictest limits   this is not always true i grew up in poverty but have a very high income and financial waste   i can live on about € 12,000 a year and even though my partner made a little less my partner liked to spend    counter intuitive right   i was supposed to be the spender because i had a large income but i was n't   also think about an example with food sharing expenses   is it fair for one partner to split protein if one partner consumes it but the other does n't answer in my view no my advice based on your questions balance the frugal vs. mentality rather than income ratios   if you 're both frugal then focus on income ratios but one may be more frugal than the other and the thought of spending € 300 a month on housing is just insane to a person like me whereas to most it 's too little   are you both exactly the same with this mentality and be honest common costs that you both agree on can be easily split 50 50 and you can often benefit from economies of scale like internet cell phone both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both do n't want to take money from each other this is so healthy for a relationship   my partner and i split and we both still really love each other   we 're headed in different directions but we did not want to end   what you wrote is part of why we ended so well we both were very independent financially    kids are going to be a challenge because they come with expenses that partners do n't always agree on   what do you and her think of childcare for instance   you really want to know all this upfront again a frugal vs. mindset could cause some big tensions

a couple of distinctions first if you were to invest in real estate were you planning to buy a home to live in or buy a home to rent out to someone else   buying a home as a primary residence really is n't investing in real estate per se   it 's buying a place to live rather than renting one   unless you rent a room out or get a multi family unit your primary residence wo n't be income producing   it will be income draining for the most part   i speak as a homeowner second if you are buying to rent out to someone else buying a single home is quite a bit different than buying an reit   the home is a lot less liquid the transaction costs are higher and all of your eggs are in one basket   having said that though if you buy one right and do your homework it can set you on the road for a very comfortable retirement

as an individual i am not aware of any insurance you can buy that will cover legal costs for any event that may occur whether criminal or civil i imagine this is because the risk is too difficult to measure and the moral hazard too great i do notice you mention rental property small business needs   if your concern is truly for costs relating to some legal issue that arises out of your professional operations then   professional liability insurance may be what you are looking for oftentimes referred to as errors and or for short   this insurance is specific to whatever business you engage in however will typically protect you against legal claims including defense costs as a result of your business operations   note however that what is actually covered will be specific to your policy as duffbeer703 mentioned the purpose of insurance is for covering specific losses i.e. protecting you from legal claims that may arise during the course of business   if you are looking for a solution that will e.g. provide you a standard set of legal documents maybe a lease agreement then you are not in fact looking for insurance but instead legal services at a fixed rate why would an insurance company pay for services both you and it already know you need

assuming the amount of your car payment and student loan are n't crazy you should be fine i would suggest starting with a baseline budget listing your monthly income and expenses be sure to include miscellaneous expenses like car maintenance insurance food clothes etc the common things that sometimes get overlooked in a budget after all of your necessary expenses fluff like entertainment does n't count if your employer has a 401k with a match i would contribute to that up to the match amount   next i would save an emergency fund to cover unforseen events such as car repairs etc $ 1000 is not an uncommon amount to see people suggest for this next i would knock out your car loan then student loan as fast as possible this will free up some cash flow which gives you more freedom to do what you want at this point you save more so you do n't have to finance the next car or have a down payment for a home or whatever   building your savings to be 3 6 months of income is a good idea this covers things like being laid off or other larger unexpected events after you get to that point how you handle your budget is pretty open

as far as the banker himself goes it 's a customer service issue   wf is not going to tell you about their internal discipline or ought n't anyway other than potentially to confirm that the banker does or does not still work there that 's the closest they should get to telling you about it   i 'm a very former retail manager and that 's absolutely the most i 'd ever do in a case like this and trust me even with good customer service reps you get requests to fire someone a lot sometimes valid sometimes not you did the correct thing from your end you brought the issue to their attention   despite the quota it 's hopefully not permitted to sign people up without their permission since that 's illegal and i can say that in my retail experience with these promotions with great incentive to cheat in this manner one of the main things our loss prevention department did was to monitor data to see if people were signing people up for cards or otherwise cheating the system   that could be a very bad thing from a customer service point of view and from a legal point of view what you should have done or possibly did but it 's not clear in your post is after you reported the issue asked for a re contact on a particular date in the future not after you 've looked into it but next friday i would like to get a call from you to discuss the resolution   again they 're not going to tell you the discipline but they should tell you at least that they 've investigated it and will make sure it does n't happen again or similar   it 's possible they will want more information from you at this point and this is a useful way to make sure that request does n't fall off of their plate   they should be able to at least tell you if there was a perceived issue on their end it might be something meaningless to you like he thought you said to sign up or something more descriptive like he pushed the button to send you a notice but our computer system screwed that up and made it an application   you never know these days how easy it is to screw these things up now they certainly should have fixed the issues on your end   hopefully they did whatever you needed them to do banking wise or else you withdrew your money and went somewhere else   if not follow up with that supervisor 's supervisor or go up a level or two to a regional director or equivalent   they may not be able to cancel the card for you but the other banking related things they certainly should fix   the card you probably just have to cancel and be done with as far as the misuse of personal information one thing i 'd consider doing is placing a freeze on your credit report   then this could never have happened you would have to lift it to have your report pulled to be given the card   this is not free though so consider this before doing this

the way this works as i understand it is that financial advisers come in two kinds some are free to recommend you any financial products they think fit but many are restricted in what they can recommend most advisers who work for finance companies are the second kind and will only offer you products that their company sells i believe they should tell you up front if they are the second kind they should certainly tell you that if you ask so in essence your scotiabank advisor is not necessarily making bad decisions for you but they are restricted in what they will offer and will not tell you if there is a better product for you that scotiabank does n't sell in most cases management fees means something you pay to the actual managers of the fund you buy not to the person who sells you the fund you can compare the funds you are invested in yourself both for performance and for the fees charged making frequent unnecessary changes of investment is another way that an advisor can milk you for money but that is not necessarily restricted to bank employed advisors if you think that is happening to you ask question and change advisors if you are not happy

cd laddering is a process of buying multiple cds at longer terms to take advantage of better interest rates while still having liquidity the benefit of a cd ladder is based on this assumption   without higher rates for longer terms i would n't ladder cds   so let 's assume you have $ 10,000 to invest    and let 's say you have a 12 month cd at 1 and a 24 month cd at 2 available to purchase you could lock all of your money up for 2 years and buy the 24 month cd at 2    this is a good rate of return but locks up your money for longer than you might otherwise have planned the laddering approach is to buy longer term cds over a regular interval    in this case we could buy a 2 year cd at 2 every 6 months    your ladder would look like this this gives you the 2 year rate 2 but you are always less than 6 months until your next cd matures giving you some liquidity when each cd matures you then purchase another 2 year cd at the more beneficial rate   you 'll always have something maturing every 6 months now if you want to start with your money immediately you can seed your ladder by buying partial terms like this the two year time maturity time frame and the interest rates are all examples   you could have 12 cds with one maturing every month one maturing every quarter etc the benefits of cd laddering are that a portion of your money is never far from maturity and that your interest rate is better than it otherwise would be the risks of cd laddering are the same as the risks of buying cds   if you think cds are a good investment cd laddering is a good way to invest at higher rates

to address the issue in the title of your question many expenses strike at what for all practical purposes are random intervals roof starts leaking car needs repair etc do n't have a fixed cost every month medical expenses can certainly be more extreme than many other expenses but their nature is the same and so the way to budget for them is the same you figure out what your average expenses are over a long period of time then you start putting away a little more than this amount every month keep putting away until you have a reserve larger than any expense you are likely to get hit with all at once   i have no idea what your particular expenses are so let me use myself for an example my medical bills last year were unusually large about $ 6,000 i have lousy insurance and a couple of chronic conditions so my bills are usually maybe $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per year so i plan on about $ 150 per month for medical bills most insurance policies have an out of pocket maximum this should be the most you 'd ever have to lay out in a year mine is $ 13,000 i told   you my insurance sucks so i have an account that i have now built up to $ 13,000 worst case i wipe out that account in any case if my bills are that large the doctors or hospital will normally agree to a payment plan i still owe a few hundred on my bills from last year and the hospital is letting me pay it off at $ 120 per month your question brings up a lot of issues about difficulties of working with insurance and the u.s. medical system in general i 'm not sure if your intent was to get advice on the rest of it all simple not pleasant but simple answer if you 're insurance is provided by your employer you 're pretty much stuck with the policy that the employer negotiates i do n't know how much you 're contributing to premiums usually the company pays the bulk of it you could investigate getting a policy on your own but odds are that any policy you could get for what you 're contributing now would be way worse than what you can get through the company you could always investigate but i doubt you 'll do better you can talk to hr if it 's a big company they may have some muscle with the insurance company and could help you out failing that it becomes a political question of how the laws affecting medical care and insurance in the u.s. are set up and while i have many ideas for how it could be improved sadly i 'm not in a position to do much about it and i doubt you are either unless you have the resources to run for president

welcome to the what should otherwise be a simple choice turns into a huge analysis debate if the choice were actually simple we 've have one golden answer here and close others as duplicate but new questions continue to bring up different scenarios that impact the choice   4 years ago i wrote an article in which i discussed the density of your ira in that article i acknowledge that with no other tax favored savings you can pack more value into the roth   in hindsight i failed to add some key points first let 's go back to what i 'd describe as my main thesis a retired couple hits the top of the 15 bracket with an income of    $ i include just the standard deduction and exemptions the    tax on this gross sum is $ for an average rate of the tax paid or avoided upon deposit is one 's marginal rate but    at retirement the withdrawals first go through the zero bracket i.e.    the std deduction and exemptions then 10 then 15 the above is the simplest snapshot i am retired and our return this year included sch a itemized deductions property tax interest insurance donations added up fast and from a gross income ira withdrawal well into the 25 bracket the effective average rate was reported as 7.3 if we had saved in roth accounts it would have been subject to 25   i 'd suggest that it 's this phenomenon the save at marginal 25 but withdraw at average effect that account for much of the resulting tax savings that the ira provides   the way you are asking this you 've been focusing on one aspect i believe the density issue that assumes the investor has no 401(k option if i were building a spreadsheet to address this i 'd be sure to consider the fact that in a taxable account long term gains are taxed at 15 for higher earners i take the liberty to ignore   that wealthier taxpayers will pay a maximum 20 tax on long term capital gains this higher rate applies when your adjusted gross income falls into the top 39.6 tax bracket and those in the 10 or 15 bracket pay 0 with median household income at $ 56 k in 2016 and the 15 bracket top at $ 76 k this suggests that most people gov data shows $ 75 k is percentile have an effective unlimited roth so long as they invest in a way that avoids short term gains they can rebalance often enough to realize lt gains and pay zero tax   it 's likely the $ earner does have access to a 401(k or other higher deposit account if they do n't i 'd still favor pretax iras with $ 11 k for the couple still 10 or so of their earnings it would be a shame to lose that zero bracket of that first $ 20 k withdrawal at retirement again working backwards the $ 78 k withdrawal would take nearly $ 2 m in pretax savings to generate all in today 's dollars

california is very aggressive about enforcing llc franchise taxes   the only correction i 'd make to 's answer is that the fee is $ 800 minimum or some percentage of the llc 's total business volume in the state   what 's killer about it is that the tax is dependent not on what your llc 's profit is but what its revenues are   here 's a good link explaining how the tax is calculated california llc franchise tax rates be very careful about making sure you comply with every dot in the california codes or else you really wo n't like what happens   it 's one of the reasons so many companies avoid locating operations in california if at all possible i hope this helps good luck

having been in the situation of commuting and working long hours at a low wage to just scrape by i faced the following dilemma i used all my income to pay bills and taxes and could not afford to go back to college to get another degree or pay for distance learning even if i could afford to pay for classes i could n't figure out when i 'd have the time to study because i was often only home 9 hours a day and needed to eat and sleep shower and get ready for work a wealthy friend of mine liked to read books about people who great obstacles and she was sure i could figure out lot a way to improve my situation if i 'd just try harder one day i handed her a piece of paper showing my income after taxes and monthly bills and asked her to get back to me with a plan that would allow me to afford classes and give me say an average of 6 hours of study time per week she was happy to do it here was her for opportunity to show me it was possible to pull myself up by my bootstraps after she studied my income expenses and schedule she decided she could n't devise a plan that would work and she never again told me i was n't trying hard enough

i like the answers others gave if it 's some substantial debt you definitely could go the bankruptcy route but it damages your future also it 's morally unethical to borrow all that money and not intend to pay second if you can pay off the entire balance and clear out the 23 interest than i 'd do that first one less bill to concern yourself with now let 's say you 've been making $ 100 payments monthly on each card my assumption for this examples sale now instead of paying $ 100 to the remaining cards balance each month and saving the other $ 100 pay $ 200 against the remaining credit cards balance by not taking home any money this way you are tackling the liability that is costing you money every month unless you have a great investment opportunity on that remaining $ 1000 or have n't created much of an emergency fund yet i 'd consider putting more of that money towards the debt gaining 0.01 on savings interest still means you 're eating in debt monthly if you 're able to i 'd venture out to open a zero interest card and do a balance transfer over to that new card there will be a minimal transfer fee but you may get some cash back out of it and also that zero interest for a year would help hold off more interest accruing while you 're tackling the balance

firstly the banks are far less risky than the people they lend to most of the interest banks charge borrowers covers defaults but banks rarely default to the fed especially those able to borrow from the fed   secondly most banks borrowing is in the form of overnight loans to cover short term reserve fluctuations they are not borrowing dollars to lend to you   thirdly if govt does it 's job of keeping some competition in the banking sector then the rates offered you and me should be near the actual cost to service such loans so are the true value of those loans since there are a significant number of banks that i can borrow from with a multitude of options in how to borrow there is likely still decent competition for my business   finally the fed funds rate is not currently 0 so the banks are not getting interest free money

the problem with predicting with accuracy what a stock price will do in any given situation is that there are two main factors that affect a stocks price the first factor is based somewhat in math as it takes into account numbers such as supply and demand earnings per share expected earnings book value debt ratio and a wide variety of other numbers you can compile all those numbers into a variety of formulas and come up with a rational estimate of what the stock should sell for this is all well and good and if the market were entirely rational it would rarely make news because it would be predictable and boring this is where our second factor throws a wrench in the works   the second factor affecting stock price is emotional there are many examples of people 's emotions affecting stock price but if you would like a good example look up the price fluctuations of apple   aapl after their last couple earnings reports numerically their company looks good their earnings were healthy their eps is below average yet their price fell following the report why is that   there really is n't a rational reason for it it is driven by the emotions behind expectations in a more general sense sometimes price goes down and people get scared and sell causing further decline sometimes people get excited and see it as opportunity to buy in and the price it is much more difficult to anticipate the reaction the market will have to people 's emotional whims which is why predicting stock price with accuracy is near impossible   as a thought along the same line ask yourself this question if the stock market were entirely rational and price could be predicted with accuracy why is there such a wide range of available strike prices available in the options market   it seems that if stock price could be predicted with anything remotely accuracy the options market need a much smaller selection of available strike prices

yes it is indeed hard to get out of poverty but for the people that do and sacrifice it all in order to make a better life for their children would you then tax them so their children have to start over at nothing again   that sounds like poverty again and it does n't actually fix anything if unemployment benefits and higher taxes are the problems keeping people in poverty i do n't see how the solution should be to tax more so that we can what have more benefits programs that poverty   it feels good to demonize the rich because we all can participate the homeless can blame the $ 40k income can blame the $ 250k income can blame the $ 1 m income can blame the 1 because they have more stuff than we do but taking that stuff away does n't increase the standard of living for anyone it actually makes it more difficult for everyone

you are faced with a dilemma if you use a 529 plan to fund your education the short timeline of a few years will limit your returns that are tax free most people who use a 529 plan either purchase years of tuition via lump sum when the child is young or they   put aside money on a regular basis that will grow tax deferred tax free some states do give a tax break when the contribution is made by a state taxpayer into a plan run by the state the long term plans generally use a risk profile that starts off heavily weighted in stock when the child is young and becomes more fixed income as the child reaches their high school years the idea is to protect the fund from big losses when there is no time to recover if you choose the plan with the least risk the issue is that the amount of gains that are being protected from federal tax is small if you pick a more aggressive plan the risk is that the losses could be larger than the state tax savings look at some of the other tax breaks for tuition to see if you qualify credits an education credit helps with the cost of higher education by    reducing the amount of tax owed on your tax return if the credit    reduces your tax to less than zero you may get a refund there are    two education credits available the american opportunity tax credit    and the lifetime learning credit who can claim an education credit there are additional rules for each credit but you must meet all    three of the following for either credit if you ’re eligible to claim the lifetime learning credit and are also    eligible to claim the american opportunity credit for the same student    in the same year you can choose to claim either credit but not both    you ca n't claim the if you were a nonresident alien for any part    of the tax year unless you elect to be treated as a resident alien for    federal tax purposes for more information about and foreign    students visit american opportunity tax credit information for    foreign students deductions tuition and fees deduction you may be able to deduct qualified education expenses paid during the    year for yourself your spouse or your dependent you can not claim    this deduction if your filing status is married filing separately or    if another person can claim an exemption for you as a dependent on his    or her tax return the qualified expenses must be for higher    education the tuition and fees deduction can reduce the amount of your income    subject to tax by up to $ 4,000 this deduction reported on form    tuition and fees deduction is taken as an adjustment to income this    means you can claim this deduction even if you do not itemize    deductions on schedule a form 1040 this deduction may be beneficial    to you if for example you can not take the lifetime learning credit    because your income is too high you may be able to take one of the education credits for your    education expenses instead of a tuition and fees deduction you can    choose the one that will give you the lower tax

as i stated in my comment options are futures but with the twist that you 're allowed to say no to the agreed on transaction if the market offers you a better deal on whatever you had contracted to buy or sell you have the option of simply letting it expire options therefore are the insurance policy of the free market you negotiate a future price actually you usually take what you can get if you 're an individual investor the institutional fund managers get to negotiate because they 're moving billions around every day then you pay the other guy up front for the right of refusal later how much you pay depends on how likely the person giving you this option is to have to make good on it if your position looks like a sure thing an option 's going to be very expensive and if it 's such a sure thing you should just make your move on the spot market it 's thus useful to track futures prices to see where the various big players are predicting that your portfolio will move a put option which is an option for you to sell something at a future price is a hedge against loss of value of your portfolio you can take one out on any single item in your portfolio or against a portion or even your entire portfolio if the stock loses value such that the contract price is better than the market price as of the delivery date of the contract you execute the option otherwise you let it expire a call option which is an option to buy something at a future price is a hedge against rising costs the rough analog is a pre order in retail but more like a holding fee they 're unusual in portfolio management but can be useful when moving money around in more complex ways basically if you need to guarantee that you will not pay more than a certain per share price to buy something in the future you buy a call option if the spot price as of the delivery date is less than the contract price you buy from the market and ignore the contract while if prices have soared you exercise it and get the lower contract price stock options offered as benefits in many companies are a specific form of call option with very generous terms for whomever holds them a swaption basically a put and a call rolled into one allows you to trade something for something else call it the free market 's exchange policy for a price if a security you currently hold loses value you can exchange it for something else that you predicted would become more valuable at the same time one example might be airline stocks and crude oil when crude spikes airline stocks generally suffer and you can take advantage of this if it happens with a swaption to sell your airline stocks for crude oil certificates there are many such closely related inverse positions in the market such as between various currencies between stocks and commodities gold is inversely related to pretty much everything else and even straight up cash for bad debt arrangements credit default swaps which we heard so much about in 2008

you 're talking about money in a savings account and avoiding the risks posed by an ongoing crisis and avoiding risk if you are risk averse and likely to need your money in the short term you should not put your money in the stock market even in safe stocks like coca cola etc even these safe stocks are at risk of wild price swings in the short- to intermediate term especially in the event of international crises such as major european debt defaults and the like these stocks are suitable for long term growth objectives but they are not as a replacement for a savings account coca cola lost a third of its value between 2007 and 2009 it 's recovered and is currently doing better than ever went from $ to $ it 's partially recovered and back at $ 63 on the other hand these stocks may indeed be suitable as long term investments to protect you against local currency inflation and yes they even pay dividends if you 're after this investment a good option is probably a sector specific exchange traded fund such as a consumer staples etf it will likely be more diversified and safer than anything you could come up with using a list of individual stocks you can also investigate recommendations that show up when you search for a defensive etf if you do not wish to buy the etf directly you can also look at listings of the etf 's holdings read the prospectus for an idea of the risks associated with these funds you can buy these funds with any brokerage that gives you access to us stock exchanges

the end result is basically the same it 's just a choice of whether you want to base the final amount you receive on your salary or on the stock market you pay in a set proportion of your salary and receive a set proportion of your salary in return the pension both contributions and benefit are based on your career earnings you get x% of your salary every year from retirement until death these are just a private investment basically you pay a set amount in and whatever is there is what you get at the end normally you would buy an annuity with the final sum which pays you a set amount per year from retirement until death as with the above the amount you receive depends on how much you pay in and the performance of the investment if the stock market does well you 'll get more if it does badly you could actually end up with less in general in as much as anything relating to the stock market and investment can be a defined benefit plan is usually considered better for security or at least public sector ones and a majority of people in my experience would prefer one but it entirely depends on your personal attitude to risk i 'm on a defined benefit plan and like the fact that i basically get a benefit based on a proportion of my salary and that the amount is guaranteed no matter what happens to the stock market in the meantime i pay in 9 of my salary get 2 of my salary as pension for each year i pay into the pension no questions no if 's or no performance indicators others prefer a defined contribution scheme because they know that it is based on the amount they pay in not the amount they earn although to an extent it is still based on earnings as that 's what defines how much you pay in and because it has the potential to grow significantly based on the stock market unfortunately nobody can give you a which is best answer if i knew how pension funds were going to perform over the next 10 50 years i would n't be on stackexchange i 'd be out there making a rather large fortune on the stock market

it depends on the terms of the mortgage generally speaking residential mortgages specifically prohibit letting out a property without the bank 's express permission but as you say that tends to assume that the whole property is being let not just a part of it conversely buy to let mortgages generally prohibit living in the property yourself the final as to what is allowed under a mortgage is the mortgage provider so the safest option is to speak to one or more banks and see what they say note that if you 're changing the use of part of a property from business to residential you may need to apply for permission check with your local council

any time there is a share adjustment from spin off merger stock split or reverse there is zero chance for the stockholders to hang on to fractional shares they are turned into cash    for the employees in the 401 k program or investors via a mutual fund or etf this is n't a problem because the fraction of a share left over is compared to the thousands or millions of shares owned by the fund as a collective for the individual investor in the company this can be a problem that they are n't happy about   in some cases the fractional share is a byproduct that will result from any of these events in the case of a corporate merger or spin off most investors will not have an integer number of shares so that fraction leftover that gets converted to cash is n't a big deal when they want to boost the price to a specific range to meet a regulatory requirement they are getting desperate and do n't care that some will be forced out in other cases it is by design to force many shareholders out they want to go private they to split if you had less than 1000 shares pre split then you will end up with zero shares plus cash they know exactly what number to use the result after the split is that the number of investors is small enough they they can now fall under a different set of regulations they have gone dark they do n't have to file as many reports and they can keep control of the company   once the board of directors or the majority stockholders votes on this the small investors have no choice

i did read the article i 'm very surprised that such a simple and alternative idea was poorly received but i have a feeling it 's because you did n't read my response carefully enough the 3 5 years which you took to mean the training time was presented as the commitment in return for free training which i expected would take around 6 12 months the candidates suggested would already have master 's degrees in other fields and so it 's to be expected they 'll need around 30 60 hours to train them to an academic level full time this should only take a year    an h1-b visa takes around 6 months to process and when you factor in the amount of time it takes someone to actually move from a foreign country it can easily be faster to train than transport in any case you could do both while you transition to a training process   here 's an article on the processes that i am discussing where peter is interviewed by the wharton business school the gist of it is that because companies control every aspect of the hiring and job creation process it is a large part of the fault on their shoulders when they ca n't find the right person      thanks for playing

it 's an artifact of risk neutral pricing but the intuition is this   a call option can be viewed as a levered equity position meaning you can get the same exposure by borrowing money and buying the stock     say you can buy some call options for $ 150 with a position delta of 1 so it looks just like the stock   you could also buy the stock outright for $ 1000 by borrowing $ 850 at the risk free rate and using your $ 150 cash   if the risk free rate rises your cost of carry on the stock position increases   in the case of the call option the change in price can be viewed as the cost of leverage increasing

this is only partly true   the main problem is that the average person is not a fully informed healthcare consumer    for example if you go to your local doctor with lower back pain one doctor might prescribe a whole bunch of expensive tests another might tell you to go to a and yet another might tell you to take some cheap pain killers and come back in six weeks time if nothing has changed most people will have no way of knowing which is the best course of action then in a country like the us which is very all the doctors will recommend the most comprehensive and expensive care package so that they do n't get sued    ultimately economists do not work in healthcare and are not qualified to recommend the best financial model for healthcare delivery   to quote who knew that healthcare was so complicated certainly not the economists

when i bought the house i had my lawyer educate me about everything on the forms that seemed at all unclear since this was my first time thru the process on of the pieces of advice that he gave was that title insurance had almost no value in this state unless you had reason to believe the title might be defective but wanted to buy the property anyway in fact i did get it anyway as an impulse purchase but i 'm fully aware that it was a bad bet especially since i had the savings to be able to self insure which is always the better answer if you can afford to risk the worst case scenario also ask the seller whether they bought title insurance often it is transferrable at least once

there really can not be a straightforward answer to this question it all depends on what lengths you take to make the situation advantageous   if you manage to have a constant flow of people living at the place during all of the times you are not living there and manage to find a cleaning service for a reasonable price then yes there is a chance that this could be advantageous for you   if you are simply looking for a way to offset some of the costs of the place you are n't living at full time then you need to draw a comparison between upkeep and how often you will actually have customers   it is likely you will have down time in which there will be no one staying at the house hiring a cleaning service will cut some of your profit and depending on how much that profit is it could be a pretty big cut now not being an expert on taxes i can not say how this will impact those but it is likely that you will have to pay taxes on money earned   all this in mind its a decision you will need to make taking all of the factors into consideration maybe give it a trial run see if after one tenant you make any kind of reasonable profit in the end and decide from there

the more i read of these articles about uber lyft etc and the superior service that they are offering over taxi companies the more i think about the increasingly strong links between uber and the google self driving car    when self driving vehicles are available the service will be even better where the service provider will be embarrassed about and probably offering discounts to anyone waiting more than 10 minutes   once self driving vehicles are available then all of these over uber vs the taxi industry become moot if regulations wo n't allow me to use uber and i do n't want to wait for a taxi then i can just order a self driving vehicle from a car rental company it will essentially offer me exactly the same service but without the regulations delivery of the vehicle   if as can be expected extra regulations are put in the way of car rental companies then i will join a car sharing company and order a self driving one to deliver itself to me it will essentially offer me exactly the same service but without the regulations delivery of the vehicle   tl;dr the writing is on the wall for taxi companies uber is the start but the arrival of self driving cars will signal their demise

edit this is so i pasted it here   london the synthetic cdo a villain of the global financial crisis is back   a decade ago bad bets on collateralized debt obligations helped fuel the crisis billed as safe they turned out to be anything but now more investors are returning to cdos and so are concerns that excess is into the aging bull market   in the u.s. the cdo market sunk steadily in the years after the financial crisis but has been fairly flat since 2014 in europe the total size of market is now rising again up 5.6 annually in the first quarter of the year and in the last quarter of 2016 according to the securities industry and financial markets association   collateralized debt obligations package a bunch of assets such as mortgage or corporate loans into a security that is chopped up into pieces and sold to investors   the assets inside a synthetic cdo are n’t physical debt securities but rather derivatives which in turn reference other investments such as loans or corporate debt   during the financial crisis synthetic cdos became a symbol of the financial of the era labelled an atomic bomb in the movie the big short they ultimately were the vehicle that spread the risks from the mortgage market throughout the financial system   synthetic cdos crammed with exposure to subprime mortgages or even other cdos are long gone the ones that remain contain credit default swaps referencing a range of european and u.s. companies effectively allowing investors to bet whether corporate defaults will pick up   desperate for something that pays better than basic government bonds insurance companies asset managers and high net worth investors are up investments like synthetic cdos bankers say which had largely become the preserve of hedge funds after 2008   investment banks which create and sell cdos are happy to oblige markets have made trading revenue weak this year and such structured products are an increasingly important business line   synthetic cdos got bad press says champion head of credit strategies at paris based hedge fund la investment solutions but that market has never ceased to fully function he added   these days mr. champion still trades synthetic cdos receiving a stream of income for effectively insuring against a sharp rise in european corporate defaults   many investors though still view the products as unnecessarily complex and are concerned they may be hard to offload when markets get as they did in the last crisis from the amount outstanding of european collateralized debt obligations has been growing again after years of shrinking   we do n’t see that demand from our clients and we would n’t recommend it said markus chief investment officer at lloyds private banking citing concerns over the lack of transparency and lack of liquidity meaning it could be hard to offload a position when needed   the return of synthetic cdos could present other risks even if banks are currently less willing to loan money to help clients juice returns credit default swaps can be very leveraged potentially allowing investors to make bets   structured products accounted for nearly all the $ 2.6 billion year on year growth in trading division revenue at the top 12 global investment banks in the first quarter according to research director at financial consultancy coalition   there has been an uptick in interest in any kind of yield enhancement structure said a managing director in sa ’s investment bank   the fastest growth this year has come in credit the of the 2007 08 crisis the top global 12 investment banks had around $ 1.5 billion in revenue in structured credit in the first quarter according to coalition more than doubling since the first quarter of 2016 structured equities are largest overall a business dominated by sales of derivatives linked to moves in stock prices with revenue of $ 5 billion in the first quarter   the low yield environment hurts said a credit fund manager at investment managers so there are a lot of asset owners looking at structured credit   these days the typical synthetic cdo involves a portfolio of credit default swaps on a range of companies the portfolio is sliced into tranches and investors receive payouts based on the performance of the swaps those investors owning lower tranches tend to get paid more but are subject to higher losses if the swaps sour structured revenues from structured products such as collateralized debt obligations are rising faster than of stocks bonds and currencies   for instance an investor can sell insurance against a pick up in defaults in the lowest or of the europe index a widely traded cds benchmark that tracks european investment grade companies in return the investor will receive regular payments but those will shrink with every company default and stop altogether once 3 of the portfolio has been wiped out through defaults   during the financial crisis synthetic cdos based on standardized indexes like europe suffered losses as traders expected defaults to pick up investors who held on though have since done great says mr. champion   investors who agreed to insure against a rise in defaults for 10 years on the equity tranche of the europe index in march 2008 have made roughly 10 a year according to an analysis of data from markit that ’s despite defaults from two companies in the index italian lender monte dei di and portugal telecom international finance   in contrast investors who sold insurance on tailored cdos packed with riskier credits such as icelandic banks or insurers would have been on the hook for losses   synthetic cdos have evolved since the crisis bankers say for instance most are shorter dated running up to around two to three years rather than seven to 10 years some banks will only slice and dice standardized cds indexes that trade frequently in the market rather than craft tailored baskets of credits   there are also fewer banks involved in arranging these trades those active include bnp paribas sa citigroup inc. goldman sachs group inc. j.p. morgan chase amp co. and   regulations have forced banks to set aside more capital against these transactions and use less leverage that has encouraged banks to parcel out the risk to clients rather than keeping it on their own books   there is a lot more regulation and scrutiny and a lot less leverage said mr.   mr. champion says he only trades tranches based on standardized cds indexes which he says are easier to buy and sell than more tailored products currently he sees value in selling default protection on super senior tranches   mr. champion said he has to lay down only around $ 1 million in upfront margin costs on a $ 100 million trade of this kind   the cost of leverage in the derivatives space is very low he said   any expectations of default rates picking up could inflict losses on synthetic cdos though at the moment analysts forecast they should decline still the memory of how the market behaved in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis is likely to keep many investors on the sidelines   if you ’re the person responsible for buying the synthetic cdo that suddenly goes wrong your career risk is bigger than if you ’d bought a plain vanilla bond that goes wrong it has a bad name said a portfolio manager at start up hedge fund impact who until recently credit for one of sweden ’s public pension funds

there is no relationship between the government appraisal and the mortgage appraisal   the loan appraisal is done by a lender to determine if the property value is in agreement with the loan amount the government appraisal is done to determine how much to charge you in taxes they use the values of residences and commercial property to get their operating budget each year they also set the rate to generate the amount of income money they need if they cut all appraisals in half they would just double the rate in some jurisdictions the government appraises every year in other places every three years some only when the property is sold in some jurisdictions the maximum increase or decrease in government appraisal is set by law but then they reset after the house is sold that being said use this time to review the appraisal from the government they may have facts wrong they may think you have a pool or more bedrooms or a garage when you do n't some jurisdictions use an automated process others do a more detailed individual process if there was a mistake ten years ago with the description it will never get caught unless you complain   check with the website for how to appeal some have windows of opportunity for an appeal

tl;dr i think you can find a much better deal doing a refi will cost you some amount of money   however a 2.5 fee top of closing costs seems really high   you can get a quote from quicken loans pretty quick and compare their fee   also i would check with a local bank preferably one you already do business with   the 2.5 is probably their commission for originating the loan   if you are in the southeast i have had great luck with regions bank   they are large enough but also small enough   please know that i have no affiliation with either company btw the rate also seems high   doing a quick search of bank rate it seems you can get 3.25 with zero fee as of this writing   the worse deal they show is with a .75 fee much better than you were quoted if you can afford it i would also encourage you to think outside the box   a client of mine was able to obtain a home equity loan not line of credit to replace their mortgage   they went for a 7 year pay off with the loan in first position at a rate about .75 below the then current 15 year rate   the key was there was zero closing costs   it saved them quite a bit of money also look at a 10 year fixed   it might not be much more than you are paying now

in theory this could lead to problematic investments being made since no individual robot would know what the others are doing   for instance one robot might decide to sell a certain stock or fund for tax loss harvesting purposes but a different robot might buy the fund the next day for its own reasons   this would count as a wash sale and would affect your tax liability but neither robot would be aware of it so they probably would n't notify you of it correctly so you might not pay the correct tax which would clearly be bad similar problems could arise for instance if the different robots have different rebalancing strategies leading to an overall allocation that is n't optimal in general the idea of these services is that the robots do complicated things that can save you or make you money and they hide this complexity from you   without knowing exactly what they 're doing it 's difficult to ensure that the aggregate action of multiple robots would still be beneficial they could be canceling each other out or worse

wanting save enough money to purchase a home is an issue that a lot of people face regardless of where they live the most simple answer is to save save save create a budget so that you are able to track every dollar after you do so for a few weeks then you will be able to see exactly how your money is being spent and where you can cut costs if you need to pick up a second or third job in your spare time then you can contribute your salary from that to your savings if possible consider moving in with friends or family paying them rent of course but it might be cheaper than renting on your own you might also consider exchanging house work for rent times might be lean when you are saving but you should remind yourself of what the ultimate goal is   i am unfamiliar with the government policies in pakistan but perhaps there is some kind of housing relief program where you can relocate to temporarily your situation is unfortunate and i sympathize with you best of luck

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

thanks for your question definitely pay the car down as soon as possible reasoning to follow in fact i would go even further and recommend the following why 1 make money risk free the key here is risk free by paying down the loan now you can avoid paying interest on the additional amount paid toward principal risk free imagine this scenario if you walked into a bank and they said if you give us $ 100 we 'll give you $ 103 back today would you do it that is exactly what you get to do by not paying interest on the remaining loan principal 2 the spread you might make by investing is not as large as you may think let 's assume that by investing you can make a market return of 10 however these are future cash flows so let 's discount this for inflation to a real 8 return then let 's assume that after fees and taxes this would be a 7 real after tax return you also have to remember that this money is at risk in the market and may not get this return in some years assuming that your friend 's average tax rate on earned income is 25 this means that he 'd need to earn $ 400 pre tax to pay the after tax payment of $ 300 so this is a 4 risk free return after tax compared to a 7 average after tax return from the market but one where the return is at risk the equivalent after tax risk free return from the market think t bills is much lower than 7 you are also reducing risk by paying the car loan off first in a few other ways which is a great way to increase peace of mind first since cars decline in value over time you are minimizing the possibility that you will eventually end up under water on the loan where the loan balance is greater than the value of the car this also gives you more flexibility in terms of being able to sell the car at any point if desired additionally if the car breaks down and must be replaced you would not need to continue making payments on the old loan of if your friend loses his job he would own the car outright and would not need to make payments finally ideally you would only be investing in the market when you intend to leave the money there for 5 + years otherwise you might need to pull money out of the market at a bad time remember annual market returns vary quite a bit but over 5 10 year periods they are much more stable unfortunately most people do n't keep cars 5 10 + years so you are likely to need the money back for another car more frequently than this if you are pulling money out of the market every 5 10 years you are more likely to need to pull money out at a bad time 3 killing off the buy now pay later mindset will result in long term financial benefits stop paying interest on things that go down in value save up and buy them outright and invest the extra money into things that generate income dividends this is a good long term habit to have people also tend to be more prudent when considering the total cost of a purchase rather than just the monthly payment because it feels like more money when you buy outright as a gut check for whether this is a good idea here is an example that dave ramsey likes to use suppose that your friend did not have the emergency fund and also did not have the car loan and owned the car outright in that case would your friend take out a title   loan on the car in order to have an emergency fund i think that a lot of people would say no which may be a good indicator that it is wise to reduce the emergency fund in order to wipe out the debt rather than maintaining both

as stock prices have declined the net worth of people has come down imagine owning a million shares of a stock worth $ 100/share this is worth $ 100,000,000 now if the stock is suddenly trading at $ 50/share then some would say you have lost $ the value of the stock is less the uncertainty is always there as there are differences between one day 's close and another day 's open possibly the sale price is likely to be near the last trade is what is being used here if you place a market order to sell your stock the price may move between the time the order is placed and when it is filled there are limit orders that could be used if you want to control the minimum price you get though you give up that the order has to be filled as otherwise people could try to sell shares for millions of dollars that would n't work out well

the point is that the bid and ask prices dictate what you can buy and sell at at market at least and the difference between the two or spread contributes implicitly to your gains or losses for example say your $ 1 stock actually had a bid of $ 0.90 and an ask of $ 1.10 i.e. say that $ 1 was the last price you would have to buy the stock at the ask price of $ 1.10 but now you can only sell that stock at the bid price of $ 0.90 thus you would need to make at least that $ 0.20 spread before you can make a profit

interesting as i am in the exact same situations as yourself   i in fact just incorporated   you will be able save more in taxes in the end   the reason i put save in quotes is that you do n't necessarily save on taxes but you can defer taxes   the driving factor behind this is that you specify your own fiscal calendar year   incorporating allows you to defer income for up to 6 months   meaning that if you make your fiscal year starting in august or september for example you can claim that income on the following year august + 6 months = february   it allows you to keep the current year taxes down   also any income left over at year end is taxed at 15 the corporation rate rather than the 30 40 personal rate you get with a sole proprietorship   in a nutshell with sole proprietorship all income is taxable after write offs in a corporation you can take some of that income and keep it in the corporation gives your company a value and is only taxed at 15 big saving there i primarily work with us businesses   i am however a dual citizen us and canadian which allowed me as a sole proprietor to easily work with us companies   however as a sole proprietor or a corporation you simply need to get an ein from the irs and any us company will report earnings to that number with no deductions   at year end it is your responsibility to file the necessary tax forms and pay the necessary taxes to both countries   therefore you can solicit new us business if you choose but this is not restricted to corporations   the real benefit in incorporating is what i mentioned above my suggestion to you is to speak with you ca who can outline all benefits   revenue canada 's website had some good information on this topic as well please let me know if you need anything else explained

if you sell an asset for more than you paid for it the excess amount realized is called a capital gain and is generally considered a form of income for tax purposes generally one pays income tax on realized capital gains unless the sale is exempt such as the sale of one 's principal residence capital gains tax can also be avoided or deferred by holding assets in a tax advantaged investment account like a tfsa or rrsp when taxable the effective income tax rate on capital gains income is half the normal rate due to the capital gains inclusion rate capital gains income is generally not considered to be employment earned or working income however individuals who say trade stocks frequently and earn a substantial portion of their income that way may have their gains considered employment income and subject to regular income tax instead of the better rate i suggest you contact service canada and ask them about the impact of a one time sale of personal property that would result in a realized capital gain while you would owe income tax on the capital gain it might not have any impact on your disability benefits because it would not be earned or employment income you should also check with your private insurer they may also consider the sale a capital gain and not employment income however only they would be able to tell you for sure whether it would have any possible effect on your benefits

that number may be based on a long term historical view of the stock market   if you look at some long term charts for the dow   or the s&p500 you 'll see that overall the upward trend is pretty good   however there are some pretty huge flat spots in those charts and if the majority of your have been made during one of those periods you may not have seen a lot of growth if you look at periods between 10 17 years or so you can find places where it would have really sucked to be you look at the s&p chart and imagine 66 to 83 ouch and places where things were stellar    if you expand to about say 30 years or so then it 's hard to find a period without at least some good growth in there somewhere   if you panicked during a downturn and sold on the low things of course get much worse   how your own portfolio has done will depend a lot on how the funds you chose have done how much you put into equity vs fixed income and if the fixed income was in actual bonds or a bond fund    bond funds are subject to a lot more as interest rates rise or fall than something like a t bill or i bond that you own outright and plan to hold to maturity

an employer can decide that the employee funds are automatically vested the new company could have had a more aggressive vesting schedule and grandfathered in all the employees of the company they acquired this could have been part of the purchase    i would be surprised if they did it for employees that left years ago especially if they were beyond the return period i would n't keep money in a plan with a former employer just in case it happens check the plan documents to see all the verbiage regarding vesting here is a paragraph from one you will receive one year of vesting service for each calendar year    during which you complete 850 or more hours of service once you have    five years of service your account is fully vested and any future    company contributions made to your account will be immediately vested    full vesting also occurs at age 59½ total disability or death while    employed by the company if you leave the company prior to 100    vesting any unvested portion of your plan account will be forfeited

talk about coincidence we just recieved letters from our bank saying that our interest only loans will be going up by and if we want to keep our lower rate we will need to change early to now our interest only periods end in 6 months to about 16 months anyway we have decided to change to p&i early and save on our interest expenses why because the main purpose of investing is to make money not to save on tax even if you are on the highest marginal tax rate for every extra dollar of expenses you spend and claim as a deduction you will only get about 50 cents back through tax savings if you are on the lowest marginal tax rate your tax savings will reduce to less than 20 cents for every extra dollar spent if you are investing in order to save on tax you may be investing for the wrong reasons your primary reason for investing should be to make money for wealth creation a good reason to stay with an interest only loan for an investment property would be if you require the extra cash flow you would receive compared with an loan

as other people have indicated traditional iras are tax deductable for a particular year please note though that traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free accounts meaning that you 'll have to pay taxes on any money you take out later regardless of why you 're making the withdrawal a lot of people mistakenly call them tax free which they 're not there is no such thing as a tax free retirement account really in terms of roth vs. traditional iras it 's pay now or pay later with the exception of special circumstances like this i recommend investing exclusively in roth iras for money that you expect to grow much or that you expect to produce substantial income over time just to add a few thoughts on what to actually invest in once you open your ira i strongly agree with the advice that you invest mostly in low cost mutual funds or index funds the advantage of an open ended mutual fund is that it 's easier to purchase them in odd increments and you may be able to avoid at least some purchase fees whereas with an etf you have to buy in multiples of that day 's asking price for example if you were investing $ 500 and the etf costs $ 200 per share you could only purchase 2 shares leaving $ 100 uninvested minus whatever fee your broker charged for the purchase the advantage of an etf is that it 's easy to buy or sell quickly usually when you add money to a mutual fund it 'll take a few days for it to hit your account and when you want to sell it 'll similarly take a few days for you to get your money when i buy an etf the transaction can occur almost instantly the fees can also be lower if the etf is just a passive index fund also there 's a risk with open ended mutual funds that if too many people pull money out at once the managers could be forced to sell stocks at an unfavorable price

there has been almost no inflation during 2014 2015 do you mean rental price inflation or overall inflation housing price and by extension rental price inflation is usually much higher than the basket of goods cpi or numbers the low levels of these two indicators are mostly caused by technology oil and food price deflation at least in the us uk and europe other inflation my slightly biased i 've just moved to a new rental property and entirely london centric empirical evidence suggests that 5 is quite a low figure for house price inflation and therefore also rental inflation your landlord will also try to get as much for the property as he can so look around for similar properties and work out what a market rate might be within tolerances of course and negotiate based on that for the new asked price i could get a similar apartment in similar condos with gym and pool this one does n't have anything or in a way better area closer to supermarkets restaurants etc suggests that you have already started on this and that the landlord is trying to artificially inflate rents if you can afford the extra 5 and these similar but better appointed places are at that price why not move it sounds like the reason that you are looking to stay on in this apartment is either familiarity or loyalty to the landlord so it may be time to benefit from a move

i actually love this question and have hashed this out with a friend of mine where my premise was that at some volume of money it must be advantageous to simply track the index yourself there some obvious touch points most people do n't have anywhere near the volume of money required for even a $ 5 commission outweigh the large index fund expense ratios there are logistical issues that are massively reduced by holding a fund when it comes to winding down your as you get near retirement age index funds are not touted as categorically the best investment they are being touted as the best place for the average person to invest there is still a management component to an index like the s&p500   the index does n't simply buy a share of apple and watch it over time   the s&p 500 is n't simply a single share of each of the 500 us companies it 's market cap weighted with frequent rebalancing and constituent changes   voo makes a lot of trades every day to track the s&p index passive index investing is almost an oxymoron the most obvious part of this is that if index funds were the best way to invest money berkshire hathaway would be 100 invested in voo   the argument for passive index investing is simplified for public consumption   the reality is that over time large actively managed funds have under performed the large index funds net of fees   in part the of the advice is that the average person is or should be more concerned with their own endeavors than they are managing their savings   investment professionals generally want to avoid how come i my money only returned 4 when the market index returned 7   if you track the index you wo n't do worse than the index this helps people sleep better at night in my opinion the dirty little secret of index funds is that they are able to charge so much less because they spend $ 0 making investment decisions and $ 0 on researching the quality of the securities they hold   they simply track an index xyz company is 0.07 of the index then the fund carries 0.07 of xyz even if the manager thinks something shady is going on there the argument for a majority of your funds residing in mutual funds etfs is simple when you 're of retirement age do you really want to make decisions like should i sell a share of amazon or a share of exxon   would n't you rather just sell 2 units of index fund and completely maintain your investment diversification and not pay commission   for this simplicity you give up three basis points   it seems pretty reasonable to me

i work in corporate finance at a large bank here 's my opinion   i 'd say learn sql tableau and first in that order    i do know java but have never personally used it at work i know some people that do and java is usually the language of choice for banks it 's really good to know but it 's rare that a company would expect an accounting or finance person to use it   but almost every team in corporate finance will use at least one of the other three most finance accounting people do n't take the time to learn these so most teams have one or two hot shots that do most of the work   also you can learn those three easily over the summer if not sooner they are n't very difficult java is more complicated so maybe take your time learning that after the other ones

planned obsolescence   planned obsolescence or built in obsolescence in industrial design and economics is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life so it will become obsolete that is or no longer functional after a certain period of time the rationale behind the strategy is to generate long term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases referred to as shortening the replacement cycle   producers that pursue this strategy believe that the additional sales revenue it creates more than offsets the additional costs of research and development and opportunity costs of existing product line in a competitive industry this is a risky strategy because when consumers catch on to this they may decide to buy from competitors instead     artificial demand   artificial demand constitutes demand for something that in the absence of exposure to the vehicle of creating demand would not exist it has controversial applications in microeconomics pump and dump strategy and advertising   a demand is usually seen as artificial when it increases consumer utility very for example a physician unnecessary surgeries would create artificial demand government spending with the primary purpose of providing jobs rather than any other end product has been labelled artificial demand     artificial scarcity   artificial scarcity describes the scarcity of items even though either the technology and production or sharing capacity exists to create a theoretically limitless abundance as well as the use of laws to create scarcity where otherwise there would n't be the most common causes are monopoly pricing structures such as those enabled by laws that restrict competition or by high fixed costs in a particular marketplace the inefficiency associated with artificial scarcity is formally known as a loss     perverse incentive   a perverse incentive is an incentive that has an unintended and undesirable result which is contrary to the interests of the incentive makers perverse incentives are a type of negative unintended consequence or cobra effect     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r business about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

take a look at irs publication 15 this is your employer 's bible for withholding the correct amount of taxes from your paycheck most payroll systems use what this publication defines as the percentage method because it requires less data to be entered into the system in order to correctly compute the amount of withholding the computation method is as follows taxes are computed dollar amounts up to a are taxed at x% and then dollar amounts between a and b are taxed at y% so total tax for b dollars is + b here is the table of rates for income earned in 2012 on a daily basis by a person filing as single to use this table multiply all the dollar amounts by the number of business days in the pay period so do n't count more than 5 days per week even if you work 6 or 7 find the range in which your pay subject to withholding falls subtract the more than amount from the range multiply the remainder by the w h for that line and add that amount to the w h base amount which is the cumulative amount of all lower tax brackets this is the amount that will be withheld from your paycheck if you file single or married filing separately in the 2012 ty if you file married filing jointly the amounts defining the tax brackets are slightly different there 's a pretty substantial marriage advantage right now withholding for a married person in average wage earning range is half or less than a person filing single in your particular example of $ 2500 biweekly 10 business days pp with no allowances and no pre tax deductions so with zero allowances your employer should be taking $ out of your paycheck for federal withholding now that does n't include pa state taxes of on $ 2500 that 's $ plus other state and federal taxes like ss 4.2 on your gross income up to medicare medicaid 1.45 on your entire gross income and .8 on the first $ 8000 but you also do n't get a refund on those when you fill out the 1040 except if you claim deductions against state income tax and in an exceptional case which requires you to have two jobs in one year thus doubling up on ss and taxes beyond their wage bases if you claim 3 allowances on your federal taxes all other things being equal your taxable wages are reduced by $ leaving you with taxable income of $ still in the 25 bracket but the wages subject to that level are only $ for taxes in the 25 bracket of $ plus the withholding base of $ equals total federal w h of $ per paycheck a savings of about $ those allowances do not count towards other federal taxes and i do not know if pa state taxes figure these in it seems odd that you would owe that much in taxes with your withholding effectively maxed out unless you have some other form of income that you 're reporting such as investment gains child support alimony etc with nobody claiming you as a dependent and no dependents of your own filing single and zero allowances on your w-4 resulting in the tax withholding above a quick run of the 1040ez form shows that the feds should owe you $ the absolute worst case scenario of you being claimed as a dependent by someone else should still get you a refund of $ 800 if you had your employer withhold the max the numbers should only have gotten better if you 're married or have kids or other dependents or have significant itemized deductions such as a home mortgage on which the interest and any property taxes are deductible if you itemize remember that state income tax if any is also deductible i would consult a tax professional and have him double check all your numbers unless there 's something significant you have n't told us you should not have owed the gov't at the end of the year

true my thinking is the higher the rates are the less people you 'll have borrowing the less chance of people defaulting more people buying with flat cash and of course cheaper housing prices   whereas with low interest rates you 'll have more people borrowing thus increasing the likelihood of more people defaulting more people buying homes technically not buying technically just borrowing money and putting down mortgages and more expensive housing prices   quite frankly i think the way that the western world can solve its issue with unaffordable housing is by raising the interest rates to at least the double digits like they once were when housing was still cheap

the simplest answer to why you ca n't see it in your online statement is a design business decision that was made most probably originally to make online statements differ as little as possible from old fashioned monthly printed statements the old printed statements never showed holds either some banks and card services actually do show these transactions online but in my experience these are the rare exceptions though with business commercial accounts i saw this more but it was still rare this is also partly due to banks fearing lots of annoying phone calls from customers and problems with merchants as people react to hey renting that car did n't cost $ 500 and do n't realize that the hold is often higher than the transaction amount and will be justified in a few days or weeks etc so please do n't dispute the charges just yet behind the scenes i 've had bankers explain it to me thusly the practice has bitten me before and it bothered me a lot so i 've talked to quite a few bankers about this there are two kinds of holds soft holds and hard holds in a soft hold a merchant basically asks the bank hey is there at least $ 75 in this account the bank responds and then has it 's own individually set policy per account type as to how to treat that hold sometimes they reserve no money whatsoever you are free to spend that money right out and rack up nsf fees to your heart 's content yet some policies are to treat this identically to a hard hold and keep the money locked down until released the hard hold is treated very much like an actual expenditure transaction in that the money is locked and shown as no longer available to you this varies by bank some banks use an account balance and an available balance and some have done away with these dual terms and leave it up to you to determine what your balance is and what 's available or you have to call them the key difference in the hard hold and a real expenditure is technically the money is still in your bank account your bank has merely reserved it it for a specific purchase and gently promising the merchant they can have their money later but the biggest difference is there is a time limit if a merchant does not process a completion to the transaction to claim the money your bank will lift the hold after a period of time i 've seen 7 30 days as typical in the us again varying by institution returning your money to your balance that is available for purchasing and withdrawal in every case any vaguely decent banking institution allows you to call them speak to some bank employee and they can look up your account and inform you about the different sort of holds that are on your account that are not pending completed purchase transactions from a strictly cynical perhaps rightly jaded point of view yes this is also used as a method to extort absurdly high fees especially from customers who keep a low balance in their account i have had more than one bank charge nsf fees based on available balances that were due to holds made by gas pumps for instance even though my actual money in my account never went below $ 0 the holds were for amounts larger than the actual transaction and yes the banks usually would waive those fees if you bothered to get someone on the phone or in person and made yourself a nuisance to the right person for long enough but they made you work for it but i digress the reality is that there are lots of back and forth and middle men in transactions like this and most banks try to hide as much of this from you the client as possible partly because its a huge confusing hassle and its part of why you are paying a bank to handle this nonsense for you to start with   and as with all institutions rules and policies become easily adjusted to maximize revenues and if you do n't keep sizable liquid minimum balances 100 of the time all year long they target you for fees   to avoid this without having fat of extra cash in those accounts is use an entirely disconnected credit card for reservations only especially when you are traveling and will be making rentals and booking hotels just tell them you wish to pay with a different card when you are done and most merchants can do this without hassle since it 's a credit card with monthly billing you can often end up with no balance no waiting around for a month for payments to clear and no bank fees it is n't 100 but now i never if i can possibly avoid it use my debit bank card to reserve or rent anything ever

reits can be classified as equity mortgage or hybrid a security that sells like a stock on the major exchanges and invests in real estate directly either through properties or mortgages trades like equity but the underlying is a property ot mortgage so you are investing in real estate but without directly dealing with it so you would n't classify it as real estate cd looks more like a bond if you look at the terms and conditions they have many conditions as a bond i.e. callable that is a very precious option for both the buyer and seller self occupied house yes an asset because it comes with liabilities when you need to sell it you have to move out you have to perform repairs to keep it in good condition foreign stock mutual fund classify it as foreign stocks for your own good investments in a foreign country are n't the same as in your own country the foreign economy can go bust the company may go bust and you would have limited options of recovering your money sitting at home and so on and so forth

now my own answer   if you join and receive equity do the 1/3 split as a max truthfully if it were my company i would try to negotiate with you to only give you because as an advisor you 're not going to be involved in executing the idea to turn it into a business   if you contribute capital do it as a loan end of story   you do n't own more because you financed growth you should n't the growth will have come because of the collective performance of the whole team you should get paid back at a fair rate for your investment if the company can handle it i would argue something like 10 interest is reflective of the risk you 're taking with your money   if the finances are so tight that the interest repayment is n't an option do the math behind what you should be paid for the loan in interest and convert that to shares or equity somehow and get paid back for the invested capital   if the company ca n't repay your loan the business model may not be sound enough or developed enough to be investing in to begin with

during world war ii the united states us instituted wage and price controls   to attract better employees companies would offer benefits to get around salary limits   health insurance was one of the more successful benefits    at that time income taxes were newer and there were many ways to evade them   companies could generally deduct expenses   so at that time health care was deductible because everything was   and at that time only wages were taxable compensation from employer to employee    since that time many other benefits have become non deductible for employers e.g. housing or the reduced deduction for meals and entertainment   but health care is generally regarded as different as a necessity   while everyone needs to eat not everyone needs to eat at a $ 100 a meal restaurant   people who need expensive health care really need it   people who eat expensive food just prefer it    and of course health care is more intermittent where food is relatively consistent   you do n't need ten thousand calories one day and zero the next   but some families have no health care expenses in a year while another might have cancer or a pregnancy   note that medical care expenses can be deducted for individuals if they are large enough in aggregate and you itemize    and of course both businesses and workers have incentives to maintain the current system with deductibility   health insurance is a common benefit   housing is not although it 's worth noting that travel housing and meals are deductible   so there have been few people impacted by making housing taxable while many people would be impacted by taxable health insurance    you can deduct health insurance costs if self employed   it 's also not true that health insurance is the only benefit with preferential tax treatment   retirement and child care are also deductible   even meals and housing can be deducted in certain circumstances   the complex rules about what and how much is deductible    there have been about the tax treatment of health insurance and medical care but there is a lot of opposition   insurance companies oppose making all healthcare expenses deductible as that reduces their effective benefit   they would prefer only insurance premiums be deductible   traditionally employed individuals oppose making health insurance taxable as that would increase their taxes   so the situation persists   there is n't quite enough support to move in either direction although the current compromise is economically silly

i could be wrong but i doubt that bernie started out with any intention of defrauding anyone really   i suspect it began the first time he hit a quarter when his returns were lower than everyone else 's or at least not as high as he 'd promised his investors they 'd be so he the numbers and lied to get past the moment thinking he 'd just make up for it the next quarter   only that never happened and so the lie carried forward and maybe grew as things did n't improve as he expected it only turned into a ponzi because he was n't as successful at investing as he was telling his investors he was and telling the truth would have meant the probability that he would have lost most of his clients as they went elsewhere   bernie could n't admit the truth so he had to keep up the fiction by actually paying out returns that did n't exist which required constantly finding new money to cover what he was paying out   the source of that money turned out to be new investors who were in by people already investing with bernie who told them how great he was as a financial wizard and they had the checks to prove it i think this got so far out of hand and it gradually dragged more and more people in because such things turn into black holes swallowing up everything that gets close had the 2008 financial crisis not hit then bernie might still be at it   the rapid downturns in the markets hit many of bernie 's investors with margin calls in other investments they held so they requested redemptions from him to cover their calls expecting that all of the money he 'd convinced to leave with him really existed   when he realized he could n't meet the flood of redemptions that was when he up and the bubble burst could he have succeeded by simple investing in berkshire   probably   but then how many people say that in hindsight about them or amazon or google or any number of other stocks that turned out similarly grin   taking people 's money and parking it all in one stock does n't make you a genius and that 's how bernie wanted to be viewed   to accomplish that he needed to find the opportunities nobody else saw and be the one to get there first   unfortunately his personal crystal ball was wrong and rather than taking his by admitting it to his investors his pride and ego led him down a path of deception that i 'm sure he had every intention of making right if he could   the problem was that moment never came keep in mind one thing   the $ 64 billion figure everyone cites is n't money that really existed in the first place   that number is what bernie claimed his fund was worth and it is not the amount he actually defrauded people out of   his actual cash intake was probably somewhere in the $ 20 billion range over that time   everything else beyond that was nothing more than the returns he was claiming to get for his clients   it 's what they thought they had in the bank with him rather than what was really there

what is essential is that company you are selling is transparent enough because it will provide additional liquidity to market when i decide to sell i drop all volume once at a time liquidation price will be somewhat worse then usual but being out of position will save you nerves for future thinking where to step in again cold head is best you can afford in such scenario in very large crashes there could be large liquidity holes but if you are on upper side of you will be profiting from selling before that holes appear problem is nobody could predict if market is on upper fall mid fall or down fall at any time

having spent all of 3 minutes reading about this my impression is insurers are going to have to have more money on hand to cover every line of business as independent silos instead of keeping it all pooled together and being able to shift money around as needed between their lines of business   in order to acquire this capital they will take on more debt now as the expectation is interest rates will rise in the future which would increase their cost of debt vs. acquiring the debt now when interest rates are low

it depends a lot on your investment period and the quality of the bonds that you want to invest for example if you want to invest until the maturity of the bonds and the bonds are very safe i.e. they are not expected to default it does not matter that the interest rate rise that is because at the maturity of the bond it will converge to its maturity value which will be independent of the change of the interest rates although on the middle of the life the price of the bond will go down but the coupon should remain constant is a floating coupon an option could be to invest in an etf with short term bonds e.g. 1 year with aaa credit rating high quality so very low default rate it wo n't yield much but is more than 0 if you hold it until maturity

how often should one use dollar cost averaging trivially a dollar cost averaging dca strategy must be   used at least twice more seriously dca is a discipline that people typically investors with relatively small amounts of money to invest each month or each quarter   use to avoid to the temptation to time the market   as mhoran_psprep points out it is well suited to 401k plans and the like e.g. 403b plans for educational and non profit institutions 457 plans for state employees etc and indeed is actually   the default option in such plans since a fixed amount of money gets invested each week or every   two weeks or every month depending on the payroll schedule many plans offer just a few mutual funds in which to invest though far too many people having little knowledge or understanding of   investments simply opt for the money market fund or guaranteed annuity fund in their plans   in any case all your money goes to work immediately since all mutual funds let you invest in of a share some plans allow investments in stocks through a brokerage but i think that using dca to   buy individual stocks in a retirement plan is not a good   idea at all the reasons for this are that not only must shares must be bought in whole numbers but it is generally cheaper to buy stocks in round lots   of 100 or multiples of 100 shares rather than in odd lots of say 37 shares so buying stocks weekly or biweekly or monthly in a 401k plan means paying more or having the money sit idle until enough is accumulated to buy 100 shares of a stock at which point the brokerage executes the order to buy the stock and this is really not dca at all   worse yet if you let the money accumulate but you are the one calling the shots buy 100 shares of appl today instead of letting the brokerage execute the order when there is enough money you are likely to   be timing the market instead of doing dca so are brokerages useless in retirement fund accounts   no they can be useful but they are not suitable for dca strategies involving buying stocks stick to mutual funds for dca do people use it across the board on all stock investments as indicated above using dca to buy individual stocks is not the best idea regardless of whether it is done inside a retirement plan or outside dca outside a retirement plan works best if you not trust yourself to stick with the strategy i forgot to mail the check yesterday oh well i will do it next week but rather arrange for your mutual fund company to take the money out of your checking account each week month quarter etc and invest it in whatever fund(s you have chosen most companies have such programs under names such as automatic investment program etc why not have your bank send the money to the mutual fund company instead well that works too but my bank charges me for sending the money whereas my mutual fund company does for free but ymmv dollar cost averaging generally means investing   a fixed amount of money on a periodic basis an alternative strategy if one has decided that owning 1200 shares of co is a good investment to have is to buy round lots of 100 shares of each month the amount of money invested each month varies but at the end of the year the average cost of the 1200 shares is the average of the prices on the 12 days on which the investments were made of course by the end of the year you might not think is worth holding any more this technique worked best in the   good old days when blue chip stocks   paid what was for all practical purposes a guaranteed dividend each year and people bought these stocks with the intention of passing them on to their and children

the answer to almost all questions of this type is to draw a diagram   this will show you in graphical fashion the timing of all payments out and payments received   then if all these payments are brought to the same date and set equal to each other using the desired rate of return the equation to be solved is generated in this case taking the start of the bond 's life as the point of reference the various amounts are pay out = x received = a series of 15 annual payments of $ 70 the first coming in 1 year   this can be brought to the reference date using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity plus received = a single payment of $ 1000 made 15 years in the future   this can be brought to the reference date using the simple interest formula set the pay out equal to the present value of the payments received and solve for x i am unaware of the difference if any between current rate and rate to maturity finding the rate for such a series of payments would start out the same as above but solving the resulting equation for the interest rate would be a daunting task

yes this unions are what ruined the german economy and put them at the bottom of the list of world manufacturers they are bleeding so many jobs to china   and south east asia experts are predicting they wo n't have any manufacturing sector jobs left within the year this is going to exacerbate germany 's already sky high unemployment rate and god knows how they are going to pay off their enormous national debt   on another point i just do n't understand how we allow police and fire unions as they do n't make those jobs any safer and just end up costing the tax payers more money if it were n't for them we could pay our police and fire fighters minimum wages that would equate to about a hundred dollars in tax savings for each and every property owner in a municipality   furthermore the rights of the workers are best represented by their employers and not an expensive corrupt union you can clearly see the efficiency with which large employers like flour takes care of their non union employees sure the non union people have a much higher medical debt load less home ownership and more frequent bankruptcies due to unpaid medical debt but that is not without its advantages

there ai n't no such thing as a free lunch it has always been the case that the only way to talk to a human is to pay because the human needs a salary but the only difference is that in the past the cost was to you because it was bundled in with the cost of the primary product or service now they 're it so you see it as a separate cost this is actually a good idea in my opinion

first i think you 're doing for your age here 's what i 'd do in your situation disclaimer these are just my personal opinions from experience with my own finances i 'd do all those things and partition the money so that i ensure i do them all that may mean not dollar cost averaging monthly but rather quarterly to keep fees percentages down but i think that 's reasonable for your age something i do n't think you should overlook with regard to your mortgage is the freedom afforded you by paying off a home it provides you with the freedom to be out of work between work or take an extended leave without the fear of how to pay your bills the mortgage to be a significant percentage of the monthly bills if that 's not something you 've considered not a concern or not something you care about then paying off your home probably is n't a priority so i 'd drop that step and put more money into investments

there are many tactics you can use   if your biggest problem is regretting your larger purchases i 'd suggest giving yourself rules before making any purchases over a certain minimum dollar amount that you set for yourself   for example if that amount is $ 50 for an item then any item starting at an average price of $ 51 would be subject to these rules one of your long term goals ought to be to become the kind of person who finds joy in saving money rather than spending it   make friends with frugal people look for those who prefer games nights and to nights out at the club buying expensive drinks and dinners at the newest steak joint in town   learn the thrill of a deal but even more learn the thrill of your savings growing   you do n't want to enjoy money in the bank for the purposes of becoming a miser   instead you want to realize that money in the bank helps you achieve your goals   buying the house you want donating a significant amount of money to a cause you support allowing you to take a dream vacation letting you buy with cash the car you always wanted the possibilities are endless   as dave ramsey says live like no one else so you can live like no one else

student loan is a class of unsecured loan   the characteristics that define a student loan are primarily that it is a loan that is intended to be used by someone who is currently a student   beyond that though there are many variations the different kinds of requirements usually have to do with who is eligible for the loan and with what the loan is allowed to be used to pay   some loans have other limitations such as only being allowed to be directly paid to the institution some student loans are federally guaranteed meaning the federal government will repay the bank if you default   those have a lower interest rate typically and often have more stringent requirements such as only full time students being eligible being need based and limitations on what the loan 's funds can be used for   see for more information many private student loans have quite lax limitations some for example have nearly no limitation as to what they can fund many are allowed to be taken out by part time students and even non degree seeking students in some cases   private loans usually have somewhat higher rates as they 're entirely unsecured to go along with the lower restrictions and higher borrowing limits   you 'd have to see the specific details of any particular loan to know what it 's allowed to pay for so if you choose this route know what you plan to use it to pay for before you go looking

it seems like there are   a few different things going on here because there are multiple parties involved with different interests the car loan almost surely has the car itself as collateral so if you stop paying the bank can claim the car to cover their costs   since your car is now totaled however that collateral is essentially gone and your loan is probably effectively dead already   the bank is n't going let you keep the money against a totaled car   i suspect this is what the meant when he said you can not keep the car because of the loan the insurance company sounds like they 're going to pay the claim but once they pay on a totaled car they own it   they have some plan for how they recover partial costs from the wreck   that may or may not allow you or anyone else to buy it from them   for example they might have some bulk sale deal with a salvage company that does n't allow them to sell back to you they may have liability issues with selling a wrecked car etc   whatever is going on here should be separate from your loan and related to the business model of your insurance company   if you do have an option to buy the car back it will almost surely be viewed as a new purchase by the insurances company and your lender as if you bought a different car in similar condition

even with a good investment strategy you can not expect more than 8 10 per year in average reducing this by a 3 inflation ratio leaves you with 5 7 which means consider seriously if you could live from that amount as annual income longterm if you think so there is a second hurdle the words in average a good year could increase your capital a bit but a bad year can devastate it and you would not have the time to wait for the good years to average it out for example if your second year gives you a 10 loss and you still draw and inflation eats another 3 you have only left effectively and future years will have to go with imagine a second bad year as a consequence you either need to be prepared to go back to work in that situation tough after being without job for years or you can live on less to begin with if you can make it on 10k$ to begin with and do even in good years you have a pretty good chance to get through your life with it note that make it with x always includes taxes health care etc nothing is free i think it 's possible as people live on 10k$ a year but you need to be sure you can trust yourself to stay within the limit and not give in and spent more not easy for many people

there are some who argue that you should lease an electric car these factors are in addition to all the normal pros and cons of leasing vs. buying the technology is still new and is advancing rapidly in 2 3 years the newer model may have significantly improved features range and efficiency as well as lower prices if you are the type of person to upgrade regularly to the latest and greatest leasing can make it a smoother transition it is hard to predict the depreciation of the vehicles this is both because of the above factors but also because these kinds of cars are newer and so the statistical models used to predict their future values are less refined the models for predicting gas car prices have been for decades ev manufacturers have in the past made some mistakes in their residual value estimations when you lease a car you get essentially an option to buy the car at the future predicted residual value if at the end of the lease the market value of the car is higher than the residual value you can purchase the car at the predetermined price making yourself some extra money if the value is lower than the residual you can return the car or renegotiate i know a relatively large number of electric vehicle owners most or all of the ones who got the vehicle new leased it the rest bought used vehicles coming off lease which can also be a good deal

well first of all they clawed back 75 of those bonuses paid out so they really did n't get paid that money   second not every executive not even probably more than one executive was even aware this was happening there is one who might have known it was happening but the reality is that a lot of these decisions and plans are implemented several levels down from the executive team the executives do not get involved in day to day shit typically   third those bonuses to executives are paid out in stock options stock options glean their value from the price of the stock if the stock price goes down then their bonuses lose value or become worthless essentially meaning that they get reductions in pay or no bonus when the stock price goes down so if the scandal had no affect on the stock price why would n't they get paid their bonuses the stock is the best indicator of the public 's reaction to the entirety of the bank

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

the standard double entry approach would just be to create a liability account for the loan and then make a transfer from that account to your asset savings account when the loan proceeds are distributed to you after that point the loan does n't belong to your savings account in any way each account and transaction is tracked separately so you might for instance pay that loan back with a transfer from your checking account even though the initial disbursement arrived into your savings account in order to see how much of a loan you have remaining you need to look at the loan 's liability account to see what transactions occurred in it and what its remaining balance is it sounds like what you 're really trying to accomplish is the idea of   or putting into an envelope certain assets for certain purposes this kind of budgeting is n't really something that gnucash at it does have some budget features but there 's more about being able to see how actual expenses are to expected expenses for a reporting period not about being able to ask how much discretionary assets do i have left before i start hitting my emergency fund the closest you get is splitting up your asset accounts into subaccounts as you suggest in which case you can allocate funds for your specific purposes and make transfers between them as needed that can work well enough depending on your exact goals though it can sometimes make it a little trickier to reconcile with your actual bank statements but there 's not really an accounting reason to associate the emergency fund portion of your assets with the remaining balance of your loan though there 's nothing stopping you from doing so if that 's what you 're trying to do accounting answers questions like how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now if you want to ask how much am i allowed to spend on x right now or am i likely to run out of money soon you may want a budgeting tool rather than an accounting tool

your only real alternative is something like t bills via your broker or treasurydirect or short term bond funds like the vanguard short term investment grade fund   the problem with this strategy is that these options are different animals than a money market you 're either going to subject yourself to principal risk or lose the flexibility of withdrawing the money a better strategy imo is to look at your overall portfolio and what you actually want if you have $ 100k in a money market and you are not going to need $ 100k in cash for the future you are paying via the low yield for flexibility that you do n't need if get your money into an appropriately diversified portfolio you 'll end up with a more optimal return if the money involved is relatively small doing nothing is a real option as well $ 5,000 at 0.5 yields $ 25 and a 5 return yields only $ 250 if you need that money soon to pay tuition use for living expenses etc it 's not worth the trouble

what 's the primary factor keeping a consumer from handing out fees as as corporations or small businesses do power can an individual or more appropriately what keeps an individual from being able to charge fine or penalize a business if it could be accomplished but at a high cost let 's assume it 's based on principal and not monetary gain and have a legal entitlement to money back   no   you are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like $ 50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around but there 's no legal obligation for him to pay up unless he signed a contract stating that he would do so corporations also can not simply send you a fine or fee and expect you to pay it you must have either agreed to pay it in the past or now agree to pay it in exchange for something in these cases the corporations have the power you have to agree to their rules to play ball    however consumers do have a significant power as well in well competed markets the power to do business with someone else   you do n't like the fee   buy from amazon which offers free shipping on returns   you do n't like paying a no show fee from the doctor   find a doctor without one or with a more forgiving fee or with a low enough that you do n't have to make appointments early   your ability to fine them exists as your ability to not continue to patronize them in some markets though consumers do n't have a lot of power for example cable television or other utilities the fcc has a list of customer service standards which cable companies are required to meet and many states have additional rules requiring penalties for missed or late appointments tougher than that    and in the case of the doctor if your doctor is late find one that is   or try sending him a bill   it does apparently work from time to time particularly if the doctor wants to keep your business

a bank is insolvent when it can no longer meet its short term obligations   in this example the bank is insolvent when depositors withdraw more cash than the bank can pay out in this case it 's probably something in the range of $ 600 700k because the bank can borrow money from other banks using assets as collateral in the us we manage this risk in a few ways first fdic insurance provides a level of assurance that in a worst case scenario most depositors will have access to their money guaranteed by the government this prevents bank panics and reduces the demand for cash the risk that remains is the risk that you brought up in your scenario bad debt or investments that are valued we mitigate this risk by giving the federal reserve and in some instances the us treasure the ability to provide nearly unlimited capital to get over short mid term issues brought on by the market in cases of long term structural issues with the bank balance sheets regulators like the fdic federal reserve and others have the ability to assume control of the bank and sell off its assets to other stronger institutions the current financial regime has its in the bank panics of the 1890 's when the shift from an agricultural based economy where no capital is available until the crops come in to an industrial economy revealed the weakness of the unregulated model where ad hoc groups of banks backed each other up good banks were being destroyed by panics until a trusted third party jp morgan stepped in committed capital and make personal guarantees

a mortgage backed security or mbs is the security   it 's not an entity it 's essentially a contract   as an investment they function more or less the same way a bond does there is nothing wrong with the concept behind a mortgage backed security   functionally securities like these allows banks and other institutions to lend to high risk borrowers   you package small slices of a wide range of risk from a large number of mortgages and the investor receive something similar to the average of the rates being charged   essentially from a big pool of mortgages of varying risk you will create a different big pool of bonds that can be sold to investors based on some sort of expected return   for a frame of reference on a much smaller scale look at peer to peer lending sites like lendingclub and prosper   the idea is lots of people of varying risk profiles make requests for loans of varying amounts   you bring your $ 2,500 and invest $ 25 in to 100 different loans   this way even if a few default you will still eek out a profit   it also allows you to include riskier borrowers without materially impacting your expected return

hi all confused about how employee option pools interact with pre money and post money vc valuations   from what i understand the pool essentially dilutes pre money valuation a quote from startup tools calculating true pre money valuation    gt say the vc wants 20 if the company is valued at $ 10 m then the vc would put in $ 2.5 m for a post money of $ 12.5 m $ 2.5 m $ 12.5 m = 20 however if a 30 option pool is added then the post money will be $ 20 m the pool will be $ 6 m and the vc will put in $ 4 m $ 1.5 m or 60 more than before the pre money would have jumped to $   i get that in both cases the founder stays at a $ m true valuation and a pool dilutes founder pre money ownership from to in this case but it seems like the pool is adding value out of nowhere the only additional money is coming from the vc but somehow the pool is worth $ 6 m

in simplest terms when a company creates new shares and sells them it 's true that existing shareholders now own a smaller percentage of the company   however as the company is now more valuable since it made money by selling the new shares the real dollar value of the previous shares is unchanged that said the decision to issue new shares can be interpreted by investors as a signal of the company 's strategy and thereby alter the market price   this may well affect the real dollar value of the previous shares   but the simple act of creating new shares does not alter the value in and of itself

yes and no any great idea excluding new technologies discoveries usually involves a trade off good ideas taken to their extremes usually are   i 've generally worked in the open communication environment musk describes for most of my career for 25 years and i 've seen where it works and where it does n't and what musk 's email misses is where it does n't work it is a good starting   for one thing there need to be filters a vp director senior manager ceo or other higher up can not deal with 1000 emails per day for ideas criticisms etc he does mention avoiding chit chat but employees with good ideas for technology or business do not see their suggestions as chit chat most actual good ideas from juniors are too low level for senior management such as different platforms coding methods etc most ideas that senior management are needed like company direction organization etc require a sophisticated knowledge and experience of business contracts etc most of the junior ideas i 've seen including my own were bad ideas that came from lack of experience in business   or take some new hr policy imagine the thousands of direct responses of people straight to hr on the policy that would grind things to a halt the whole purpose of direct managers and supervisors is to filter information down up and sideways so that other people can do their jobs   you do n't want to have high value people knowledge experience spending their day dealing with emails and other people 's ideas you want them providing that value to the business so you need filters people who can recognize the good from the bad and pass on the bad that could be direct managers at the employee 's side or it could be administrative help at the department 's side either way it 's necessary to be efficient   then there 's the problem of including all stakeholders if you are junior and work out a solution to a problem with a junior in another problem but in implementing it you break a whole system which i 've seen happen you 've just caused a lot of harm to the organization neither of you may fully understand the implications of your solution on other things people with responsibility for those things need to be included in the discussion and take responsibility for any implementation   i hate bureaucracy and sometimes it can be a major inefficiency and for getting simple and obvious things done but bureaucracy can also improve efficiency and value and a lack of it can be i 've seen marketing and sales people continually take engineers off of important development work in order to build demos for potential new clients all of which failed to materialize why because the marketing and sales people were chasing leads for contracts without any review of the technical solution the ideal one what the solution to the customer needs really involves what was needed to improve efficiency was a bureaucratic process that reviewed the market opportunities with the technical offerings of the company and either reject opportunities early on or plan and schedule how best to chase the leads   in my experience what works best in most cases is open communication but clear guidelines a on what is appropriate or not to go direct b that the communications are about ideas only and coming up with solutions and c that actions or implementations require bringing the chain of command into the loop for comment or objection before doing anything   complaining to management is n't usually of much value and does n't change much but identifying the problem that is part of the complaint identifying a workable solution with stakeholders and asking for permission via the chain of command is usually a good way to get things done without creating the problems of a free for all

take ownership of these things bottled water running water oxygen tanks etc those things are man made products or services for a market i can go to a public body of water and swim in it because no one owns it i can go to the shore in my favorite suit and swim in the beautiful ocean water if i so please without needing to pay or trade with anyone for access to the ocean but i can not start pumping water out of the ocean and into a big tank for me to haul away the government needs to step in and put an end to anyone that does that sort of thing same goes for anyone trying to with the water or doing something that is harmful to people or the life living in the water government needs to stop all of that also yes the municipality then and the water and pumps it to your house in public facilities and treats the resultant sewage but are you also claiming that it was the government that created the solution to clean and our water supplies because they sure did n't   as for electricity the way it is delivered and made available to our homes is a commodity electricity is natural but just like how water when bottled becomes a consumer product the generation and delivery of electricity to our homes is a product and service if a company delivering electricity to customers in a city is using public infrastructure then of course they have to share it that makes sense as the electric company does not own the utility poles streets etc the government should regulate that   the government handling trade agreements is a job of the government we need them to do that i believe in an open free and consumer driven market i do n't want a lot of regulation on this such as tariffs that trump has talked about because history shows that could lead to the costs inflating with quality not following suit his rants on jobs fleeing followed by his talks of tariffs on foreign imports would be a terrible idea i want the government to negotiate trade deals as long as it is in the best interest for this country this is what grows an economy imagine if apple could n't import iphones unless they paid a 30 tax since it was assembled in china that would kill sales of iphones because apple would have to pass most if not all of that cost on to the consumer samsung phones for argument 's sake let 's say these are n't made in china i do n't think they are anyway but just saying would begin to take a larger share of the consumer market because prices would be lower since samsung did n't have to pay a 30 tax   as for the coffee pot from china starting a fire in my house no one would by a coffee pot if there was a known fire starting issue with those coffee pots the government telling china that coffee pots need to be a certain specification is really irrelevant the issue would resolve itself because no one would by the coffee pots once this became a known problem stores would take it off the shelves and no longer sell it we have cars that are recalled left and right car seats for and that are recalled every year so on and so forth i know the federal government has a recall process but usually its the manufacturer that will announce the recall first if there is a bad product out there it will die out and no longer be made available for purchase i do n't see the the federal government regulations on car manufacturers that mandate all tires must not fall off of the car while in motion no instead the manufacturer who is in the business of making money which they need to sell cars to make money would create a car where the tires are not likely to ever fall off while a car is in motion or even when idle   the last thing i want to touch on is the obamacare mandate if i do n't want something why am i being forced to pay for it why do you agree with this i am already paying into social security and i wish i was n't i will make my own investments with my income to prepare for retirement why should i pay for health insurance if i do n't want it the government should not be making my life choices for me i have one responsibility on this earth as it pertains to my behavior that is to respect others inalienable rights such as the right to life liberty property and the pursuit of happiness as long as i do not harm someone in an immoral way e.g. steal kill physical harm property damage disclose personally identifiable information etc i should be free to live my life without government interference i am fine with paying into a system for true welfare cases some people fall into bad situations that they could not help some people are born into a terrible situation those people need help but i do n't want to pay for stupid ass things like chuck 's idiotic idea of medicare for people over 55 he wants to lower the medicare age by 10 years this is the insane progressive ideas that literally just worsen societies in 2016 medicare benefit payments totaled $ 675 billion up from $ 375 billion in medicare issue brief the facts on medicare spending and a $ 300 billion increase in just 10 years and that schmuck wants to lower eligibility by 10 years if this were ever signed into law i am plus other american workers going to be forced to pay into this that means less money for me to save and invest for retire or an emergency less for my daughter less for my mortgage less for me to continue my education less on whatever i choose to do with my money that i spend 40 hours week in an office for my time is spent doing something asked of me by a corporation that corporation pays me for my time it 's a mutual agreement resulting in a trade of money for my services i do it because i want to do things and provide for my family i do n't do it because someone decided to spend 4 years for a degree in graphic design and ca n't get a job i also do n't do it for people that have a cash only income both illegal immigrants and legal citizens do this and do n't declare all of their income making them eligible for obamacare and lastly i do not do it for people that decide to live off of the system and are physically and mentally fit to work in some capacity i should not be forced to pay a mandate just because i 'm here breathing   obama just like all progressives normalized this breathing tax it is n't right of course obamacare falls apart if there are n't enough healthy people to subsidize the sick people that 's why the mandate was obviously put in place but just because the mandate is needed to make it work does n't make it right to force on people my mortgage needs to get paid if all my neighbors in $ i could make it work well is it right to force my neighbors to pay my mortgage nope i made the decision to buy my house they did not not to mention with socialized health care services are and that is just sickening big gov oh you 're 80 years old and you need a knew knee well you did live for 80 years so we 're going to deny that request in a system where i pay for my own health care and insurance i can get a new hip and a new knew if i needed it and it would all be done within a week or 2 most likely you have 51 week old charlie who britain and the wonderful eu sarcasm ordered to die he did so just last week even though his parents had the money to fly him here and have a doctor perform a potentially life saving surgery yep when the government owns healthcare they own your health that 's my other big reason for hating obamacare it truly is a bad thing we have world history that can easily show anyone what it looks like if we keep going down this path   i am done for now i am not trying to convince you of anything that usually does n't happen as people are set in their ways if anything this exchange of messages is for the out there that want to learn what is right and what is wrong what liberty is and what it is n't taxing people as a way to redistribute wealth is wrong imposing mandates so people buy a product service is just straight up wrong our income is a representation of our time spent fulfilling the responsibilities of an agreement that we voluntarily made with an employer our money is our time our time is our liberty and if we are n't on the rights of others during our time then the government needs to stay out   catch you later

what the automation mostly does is make short term trading that much more difficult day trading is a zero sum game so if they win more everyone else wins less   long term trading years to decades is a positive sum game the market as a whole tends to move upward for fairly obvious reasons at its basis it 's still investing which in turn is based on lending and as long as folks make fairly rational decisions about how much return they demand for their investment and the companies are mostly producing profits there will be a share of the profit coming back to the investors as dividends or increased share value or both day to day churn in individual stocks gets averaged out by diversification and time and by the assumption that if you 've waited that long you can wait a bit longer if necessary for to settle out time periods between those will partake of some mix of the two

first do n't use yahoo 's of the xbrl data to do financial analysis   get it from the horse 's mouth search for facebook select the latest 10-q and look at the income statement on pg 6 linked in the table of contents   this is what humans do when you do this you see that yahoo omitted fb 's admittedly trivial interest expense   i 've seen much worse errors if you 're trying to scrape yahoo well do what you must   you 'll do better getting the xbrl data straight from edgar and it yourself but there 's a learning curve and if you 're trying to compare lots of companies there 's a problem of mapping everybody to a common chart of accounts second assuming you 're not using fcf as a valuation metric which has got some problems you do n't want to exclude interest expense from the calculation of free cash flow   this becomes significant for heavily indebted firms you might as well just start from net income and adjust from there which as it happens is exactly the approach taken by the normal indirect form of the statement of cash flows   that 's what this statement is for   essentially you want to take cash flow from operations and subtract capital expenditures from the cash flow from investments section   it 's not an encouraging sign that yahoo 's lines on the cash flow statement do n't sum to the totals as far as definitions go working capital is not assets liabilities it is current assets current liabilities   furthermore you want to calculate changes in working capital i.e. the difference in net current assets from the previous quarter   what you 're doing here is subtracting the company 's accumulated equity capital from a single quarter 's operating results which is why you 're getting an insane result that in no way resembles what appears in the statement of cash flows   also you seem to be using the numbers for the wrong quarter instead of i ca n't figure out where you 're getting your depreciation number from but the statement of cash flows shows they booked $ m in depreciation for your number is high fb does n't have negative fcf

the point of insurance is to trade high variable costs for much lower fixed costs the question is n't whether you can afford what would be a catastrophic event for anyone else but whether it would be better to pay a small amount regularly vs. a possibly larger amount occasionally one of the reasons to buy insurance is to avoid costly litigation rich people are more frequently targeted for litigation by purchasing liability insurance the insurance company pays for the litigation and/or settlement if you are wealthy enough to keep an experienced litigation firm on retainer you may not need that benefit but it might be worth giving that stress to a third party life insurance is also an important part of estate planning because of the tax treatment of insurance payouts compared to the tax treatment of a large estate there are certainly classes of insurance that make less sense for those with great cash flow but money does n't all the benefits of insurance

any one of your three options is viable and has its advantages and disadvantages personally i would go for the used option but i am can do kind of person if you do n't like micro managing a car you may prefer leasing a new car is sort of the middle of the road option leasing will be most expensive and most liability if you have an accident the leasing arrangements are designed to extract money from you heavily even a minor accident can require you to pay for expensive repairs usually much more expensive than if you had your own car fixed so not only will you pay more per month but your accident liability will be a lot higher with your own car you will need to sell it or bring it back to the uk obviously a used car will be the cheapest option a non used car from the local area can also make you blend in and be less like to be targeted by a criminal as an outsider as long as you stay away from dealers and buy the car from a private person of good reputation you have an odds on chance of getting a decent car make sure you check out the person and make sure they are real some dealers called try to pretend to be original owners you can always spot such frauds because the title will be new make sure the same owner has had the car for at least 3 4 years and that it says that on the title also try to buy from somebody who is financially well off they have less reason to try to screw you students people under 30 and working class are bad people to buy from married professionals over age 35 are the right kind of person to buy from

gross income is used because there are a lot of variables inherent in the calculation of a net income including a lot of things under your direct control that you could use to game the system net income as others have inferred is a very flexible term for the average individual the definition that would most easily come to mind is likely post deduction post tax earnings take home pay it sounds reasonable too as the amount you take home each month can be easily demonstrated with your two most recent pay stubs which you need to bring in anyway to verify gross earnings however even that simplistic definition is fraught with possibility you have the ability to modify your pre tax deductions such as for retirement or healthcare and that in turn affects your taxes and thus your net take home pay to assume that you wo n't do that is foolish for the loan officer other definitions of net income such as in the case of shopping for a house disposable income plus current rent are the result of even longer lists of deductions from gross pay many are also dependent on your current home your electric bill is a function of the size location and construction of your current home all of which will change as soon as you move in your other bills such as telecom tv phone internet are also more or less location dependent as even within a single city or metro area your choice of services and service providers is dictated by the home 's physical location you may have to pay through the nose right now because your current home is n't serviced by anyone 's fiber optic network while the home you 're moving into could be in a hotly contested area with access to multiple fiber optic so to simplify all this mortgage companies simply ask for gross income then apply a metric that makes relatively conservative assumptions about your spending habits to arrive at a final amount the upside is simplicity the downside being that two people both making $ may have two completely different financial pictures behind that single number

if you have multiple accounts you have to empty them all before you can deduct any losses your loss is not a capital loss its a deduction it is calculated based on the total amount you have withdrawn from all your roth ira 's minus the total basis it will be subject to the 2 agi i.e. if your agi is > 100 k none of it is deductible and you have to itemize to get it bottom line think twice summarizing the discussion in comments if you have a very low agi i would guess that your tax liability is pretty low as well even if you deduct the whole $ 2 k and all of it is above the other deductions you have which in turn is above the standard deduction of almost $ 6 k you save say $ 300 if you 're in 15 tax bracket that 's the most savings you have however i 'm assuming something here i 'm assuming that you 're itemizing your deductions already and they 're above the standard deduction this is very unlikely with such a low income you do n't have state taxes to deduct you probably do n't spend a lot to deduct sales taxes and i would argue that with the low agi you probably do n't own property and if you do you do n't have a mortgage with a significant interest on it you can be in 15 bracket with agi between roughly $ 8 k and $ 35 k i.e. you can not deduct between $ 160 and $ 750 of the $ 2 k so it 's already less than the maximum $ 300 if your agi is $ 8 k the deduction does n't matter might cover all of your taxes anyway if your agi is $ 30 k you can deduct only $ 1400 so if you 're in the 15 bracket you saved $ 210 that again assuming it 's above your other deductions which in turn are already above the standard deduction highly unlikely as i said in the comments i do not think you can realistically save on taxes because of this loss in such a manner

there are several causes of inflation one is called cost push that is if the price of e.g. oil goes up sharply as it did in the 1970s it creates inflation by making everything cost more another is called demand pull if labor unions bargain for higher wages as they did in the 1960s their wage costs push up prices especially after they start buying the kind of inflation that the banks cause is monetary inflation that is for every dollar of deposits they can make $ 5 or $ 10 of loans so even though they do n't print money the fed does it 's as if they did the result could be the kind of inflation called too much money chasing too few goods

the earlier answers answered the question on how a more practical trader can lose money here i 'd like to mention some obtuse ways   using debt to buy stocks if one is borrowing at a higher rate than they are getting back from an economics prospective their stocks are losing money even if the value of those stocks are going up using debt to buy stocks i 'll simplify the nightmare situation i know someone who has y dollars of cash their broker will loan them x. with their x+y money they purchase some equities through the broker the agreement of the loan is that if the value of those equities drops below a certain percentage of the outstanding debt ex 150 the broker will automatically and without notification sell some equities to reduce the outstanding debt being in high interest debt but buying stocks there are millions of people who are paying interest rates on consumer debt while investing and getting 5 returns or less on average similar to an earlier point from an economics prospective the choice to buy equities is a profit losing choice

yep   it 's psychological same thing with amazon and shipping costs   i do n't pay shipping with amazon because i let them take a few days to get the product to me   in reality i absolutely do pay for shipping but it 's indirectly baked into the cost of the product itself it 's great seeing the cost upfront when deciding whether or not to buy it   it sucks to see one price then get hit with a ton of bs charges when checking out

the biggest reason why one might want to leave 401k money invested in an ex employer 's plan is that the plan offers some superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere e.g. some mutual funds that are not open to individual investors such as s&p index funds for institutional investors these have expense ratios even smaller than the already low expense ratios of good s&p index funds or hot funds that are usually temporarily closed to new investors etc the biggest reason to roll over 401k money from an ex employer 's plan to the 401k plan of a new employer is essentially the same the new employer 's plan offers superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere of course the new employer 's   401k plan must accept such roll overs i do not believe that it is a requirement that a 401k plan must accept rollovers but rather an option that a plan can be set up to allow   for or not   another reason to roll over 401k money from one plan to another   rather than into an ira is to keep it safe from creditors if you are   sued and found liable for damages in a court proceeding the plaintiff can come after ira assets but not after 401k money   also you can take a loan from the 401k money subject to various rules about how much can be borrowed payment requirements etc which you can not from an ira that being said the benefits of keeping 401k money as 401k money must be weighed against the usually higher administrative costs and usually poorer and more limited choices of investment opportunities   available in most 401k plans as muro has said already

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

there is no ideal number of stocks you should own there are several factors you should consider though first how actively do you want to manage your portfolio if you want to be very active then the number of stocks you own should be based on the amount of time you have to research the company by reading sec filings and listening to conference calls so you are not surprised when the company reports every quarter if you do n't want to be very active then you are better off buying solid companies that have a good reputation and good history of performance   second you should decide how much risk you are willing to take if you have $ 10,000 that you can afford to lose then you can put your money into more risky stocks or into fewer stocks which could potentially have a higher return if you want your $ 10,000 grow or lose with the market better off again going with the good rep and history stocks or a variety of stocks   third this goes along with your risk to some extent but you should consider if you are looking for short term or long term gains if you are looking to put your money in the market for the short term you will probably be looking at fewer stocks with more money in each if you are looking for long term you will be around 5 stocks that you swap as they reach goals you set out for each stock   in my opinion and i am not a financial expert i like to stay at around 5 companies mostly for the fact that it is about the ideal number of companies to keep track of

i never intended to get into a big debate on taxation my point was that a buyback is the sane as a divided   would you agree to that here 's an interesting test does he have the same problem with dividend producing stocks if he does then how else are firms supposed to give s return to investors   do n't even think about saying through price appreciation because i 'm sure you also have a rant for the drive for stock price   this is n't a do we tax or not   that 's overly broad for this piece   also he is n't talking about taxing away profits but using taxes to cause businesses to make investments   would n't you agree that if that extra factory was unproductive if it would nt have had an economical case to be invested in otherwise issuing taxes as a blunt tool to cause businesses to throw money at random projects is about the definition of misallocation   can we agree to this absent a taxation debate i generally avoid like the plague   you really are in a corner on how a company effectively passes a return to those who invested in them without the whole pricing mechanism unless that is your point to do government control for all investments yeah

even ignoring the match which makes it like a non deductible ira the 401k plans that i know all have a range of choices of investment   can you find one that is part of the portfolio that you want   for example do you want to own some s&p500 index fund   that must be an option   if so do the 401k and make your other investments react to it reduce the proportion of s&p500 because of that the values in the 401k are pretax so only count in asset allocation   the tax deferral is huge over time   for starters you get to invest the 30 40 you would have paid as taxes now   yes you will pay that in taxes on withdrawal but any return you generate is yours to keep   the same happens for your returns

you have a small emergency fund   good be open about your finances with each other   no secrets except around gift giving holidays pay off the debts asap   do n't accumulate more consumer debt after it 's paid off i would n't contribute anything more to the 401k beyond what gives you a maximum match   free money is free money but there are lots of strings attached to tax advantaged accounts be sure you understand what you 're investing in   if your only option is an annuity for the 401k learn what that is retire into something   do n't just retire from something   put another way do n't retire   do n't wait until you 're old to figure out what you want to retire into save like crazy before you have kids   it 's much harder afterwards

central banks are essentially a cartel designed to let banks in general borrow money from depositors at relatively low interest rates   they do this in two ways   by reassuring depositors that momentary cash flow problems at banks will not result in banks failing they lower the interest rates that depositors demand   and by imposing strict regulations on banks that are borrowing from depositors at high interest rates   people who move money to the banks offering the highest interest rates are especially likely to participate in bank runs borrowing too much from the central bank is considered to be a sign of a bank that is too weak to attract deposits from depositors at reasonable interest rates if a bank borrows too much as a percentage of the bank 's assets from the central bank the bank regulators will subject the bank to heavy scrutiny   if the bank fails to find ways to reduce its borrowing from the central bank the bank regulators are likely to steal the bank from its shareholders and sell the bank to a stronger bank that pays lower interest rates

if that company issues another 100 shares should n't 10 of those new 100 shares be mine those 100 shares are an asset of the company and you own 10 of them when investors buy those new shares you again own a share of the proceeds just as you own a share of all the company 's assets a company only issues new share to raise money it is a borrowing from investors and in that way can be seen as an alternative to taking on loans both share issuing and a loan bring new capital and debt into a company the difference is that shares do n't need to be repaid

in the united states investing towards donation is a great idea because you can donate appreciated securities directly rather than donating cash   notice how much this can benefit you so you get to both a donate untaxed money and then b deduct that unrealized money from your income total on your tax return with the above in mind a good strategy for investing towards this type of donation would be to pick securities that are likely to increase in market value but not likely to produce any other sort of income   so bonds which produce lots of interest income or stocks with dividends or equity mutual funds which distribute dividends as capital gains would all be suboptimal for this purpose of course an even better strategy would be to establish a widely diversified investment portfolio without thought to future donations   then once a year or whenever evaluate all your investments and find some where the market value has increased   then donate some of those shares   no special advance planning necessary note that your tax consequences could be more complicated depending on your exact situation   read the section about capital gain property in irs pub 26 for all the details   there may be special limits on the amount you can deduct   also donations of short term capital gains are treated much less favorably so make sure you donate only long term capital gain property

most countries with income tax including the usa design their withholding system so that in straightforward cases tax is withheld from each month 's paycheck on an annualized basis tax for a month is calculated on the assumption that you will keep earning the same monthly amount for the rest of the year and the withholding is set so that the tax is spread evenly across the year another way of putting that is that in practice you only get the tax brackets allocated proportionately throughout the year so up till the end of august you 'll only have been assigned of the $ bracket and so on so if your income does n't change and your general tax affairs do n't change your paycheck also should n't change if your income is irregular or changes during the year then things can get more complicated as other answers have noted withholdings are calculated according to tables that normally just take into account that specific month 's income there are various possible changes to your tax affairs that might cause the withholdings to change for example there 'd be an impact from any change in your contributions to tax advantaged things like health insurance or retirement health or education savings you might also use form w-4 to change your withholdings yourself note that even with a regular income that does n't change through the year you might find yourself either owing money or being owed a refund when you file your taxes after the end of the year it 's worth making sure that your w-4 accurately records the allowances you are entitled to to minimize or eliminate this adjustment

is this even legal how can a bank refuse to deposit legal tender in    the united states legal for all debts public or private does n't mean quite what i used to think either   per the fed this statute means that all united states money as identified above is    a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when to a    creditor there is however no federal statute mandating that a    private business a person or an organization must accept currency or    coins as payment for goods or services private businesses are free to    develop their own policies on whether to accept cash unless there is a    state law which says otherwise yes they can refuse loose change also they are n't refusing your deposit just requiring that it be rolled what do i do with my change i do not want to spend the time rolling    it and i am not going to pay a fee to cash my change there are n't many other options change is a nuisance i believe coinstar machines reduce remove their fee if you exchange coins for gift cards so that might be the best option for convenience and retaining value

as these all seem to be us equity just getting one broad based us equity index might offer similar diversification at lower cost over 5 years 20 basis points in fees will only make about 1 difference however for longer periods retirement saving it is worth it to aim for the lowest fees for further diversification you might want to consider other asset classes such as foreign equity fixed income etc

in addition to the already good answers you also want to consider your time horizon unless you are looking out 10 + years building your down payment in an account that is invested in the market is probably subject to too much market risk are you willing to delay purchasing a home by five years if the market turns down at the wrong time a better option is to just use a savings accounts to avoid spending the money you can open a dedicated account separate savings account for a special purpose are s common feature at credit unions and probably are available at many regular banks as well then for funding the account many employers allow you to split direct deposits amongst multiple accounts so you will just need to provide the routing number and fractional amount of your paycheck for that account

wishful thinking   like it or not we exist in a global economy today the u.s. has certain competitive advantages in that economy and we need to build expand them but cheap labor is not one the days when assembly manufacturing workers could union up and command high wages or increasingly even middle class wages are basically gone and as another commenter here alluded to workers can choose to take a job at lower wages or not have a job   go ahead and complain about ceo pay if you want it does n't change the basic argument of labor supply vs. demand that sets wages workers are n't owed some of company profits

what would you consider good worthwhile and why it would give you satisfaction to benefit society i 've done various things that can be considered good worthwhile but the more i 'm around people the less i want to contribute anything to their well being and the more i want to out at them unfortunately getting substantial money generally requires interacting with people and showing up   i would enjoy such things as profiting off target gift cards if i knew about the promotion or if the idea occurred to me because it 's profit for relatively little effort the money that i 've worked hard for does n't mean that much to me because the cost was too high

i agree it 's crony capitalism i think people should make that clear instead of just saying capitalism all those things you mentioned are from the government corporations will try to make profit that 's what they 're suppose to do i mean nobody blames apple for making shit tons of money    the politicians are the ones that need to stop selling out america for their own benefits they 're   the ones that does n't allow buying health insurance across state lines they 're   the ones that wo n't let car manufacture sell directly to consumers they 're the reason i can only get comcast you think i love comcast    ca n't blame capitalism for shitty politicians   love the debate though

why would anyone listen to someone else 's advice because they believe that the person advising them knows better than they do it 's as simple as that   the fact that you 're doing any research at all indeed the fact that you know about a site on the internet where personal finance questions get asked and answered puts you way ahead of the average member of the population when it comes to pensions   if you think you know better than the adviser and i do n't mean that aggressively just as a matter of fact then by all means do your own thing but remember about unknown unknowns you do n't know everything the adviser might say depending on your circumstances and changes to them over time

deposit check and send a personal check resulting in tax and irs reporting issues that 's a bad idea unless maybe the check you 're receiving is a certified bank draft suppose the insurance company are crooks and the check is fraudulent it could take weeks or months for some investigation to catch up to that long after your own personal check was cashed by the pharmacy the bank will then put you on hook for the 20 grand by reversing the check even though the funds had been deposited into your account do not put yourself into the position of a money handler you do n't have the cash base insurance government protection and whatever else that a bank has and of course you 're being a free money handler if you do that you 're not even compensated for postage time and whatnot if you 're handling money between two parties you should collect a percentage or else refuse that percentage has to be in proportion to the risk since cashing a check for someone carries a risk similar to and is effectively a form of making a loan

the answer to your question does n't depend on who you trade with but what country you live in if you live outside of the us you will have to pay tax on dividends sometimes this depends on the tax treaty that your country has with the us canada australia uk and a few other countries have favorable tax treaties with the us that allow you to not be double taxed you must look into the tax treaty that your home country has with the us to answer the question each country is different

it really varies based on the stock volatility is the main determining factor and whether you are talking about temporary or permanent price impact   how long you are trading etc the below paper fits a functional form to a set of citigroup data and estimates for a 10 trade in a large cap like ibm the price would move on the order of presumably would be more expensive their estimate seems a bit low to me but i 'm more familiar with futures so maybe it 's not unreasonable

amazon is always going to be pointless for screws and nails because you ca n't ship that economically   you ca n't do items like lumber sheet rock or concrete due to weight   you can never ship large items due to size   amazon fits for that are expensive enough to ship but small and light enough for prime   their weakness is still needing to ship things   plus it ca n't be underestimated that you need to return shit because it does n't fit or the contractor needs an exchange for something else   makes sense to make a home depot run stupid if you need to ship it back to amazon to do an exchange   this only works if amazon enters the warehouse showroom space and has exchanges returns and purchases done face to face   this is something home depot already has the advantage in   amazon may attempt to kill them with a thousand cuts with light bulbs hammers and small parts

the short answer is no you can only deduct actual expenses the long answer is that it would be impossible for the irs to determine the value of your time and it would open the tax system to an enormous amount of fraud think of being able to make up time spent or writing off time spent volunteering at a soup kitchen or any other charity now you can write off expenses you have involved in doing the work equipment and supplies used to do the work along with any wages you paid an employee or contractor to do said work

if you are diversifying just for diversification purposes then all you are doing is averaging down your returns you should n't just buy two securities because you think it is safer than putting all your money into one a better method is to use money management and position sizing to limit your risk and exposure in any one security you should know what your maximum risk is before you buy any security and know when it is time to get out of it there are better ways to manage your risk do n't put all your eggs in the one basket yes but do n't diversify just for diversification purposes
