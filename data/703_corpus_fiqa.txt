in the united states tax law a group of people who are neither an individual nor an incorporated entity is called partnership   here 's the irs page on partnerships income derived by such a group is essentially a partnership income with the group members being the partners however as you can see from the questions in the comments the situation can become significantly more complex if this partnership is not managed properly

no suppose you have 100 canadian dollars and the exchange rate is 2 cad = 1 usd   you use your 100 cad to purchase 50 usd in your bank account that is in usd   some time later the canadian dollar grows stronger so that now 1 cad = 1 usd   if you now withdraw your 50 usd and get canadian dollars you will receive 50 cad   you have lost half your money if you want to make money on currency exchange rates which is a risky plan you should buy the currency that is cheap i.e. weak   if say oil is very cheap you do n't make money by selling oil you buy it and sell it later when the price goes up   likewise if the canadian dollar is n't worth much and the us dollar is you should buy canadian dollars not us dollars hoping to sell them later when the exchange rate is more favorable   see also this similar question

i 'm going to subtly and change the obvious advice there are three ways to deal with negative cashflow not two you 're currently studying for a degree you do n't say what country you 're in or how your studies are funded but most people in the us uk and a fair number of other countries run up debts while studying for a degree they do this because a degree is valuable to them they ca n't avoid it because the tuition alone costs more than most students can generate in income never mind their living expenses so by all means look for savings 1 clearly strangers on the internet ca n't just think up ways for you to spend less money without knowing anything about what you do spend money on but you can at least list your expenditures for yourself and see what 's necessary consider also how much fun you want your studies to be 4 years in a cold house to avoid paying for heating and never going out with friends to avoid spending on unnecessary stuff is all very well but with hindsight you 'll regret yourself if you 're ever well off enough to pay back whatever you would have borrowed to use for heating and fun only do 2 if it does n't affect your studies or if the money you 're paid justifies delaying the valuable asset you seek to acquire a degree leading perhaps to a better job but at least to the capacity to do a full time job rather than fitting work around your studies there are some jobs that are really good fits for students reasonably low hours that do n't clash with classes and some jobs that are terrible if these fail resort to 3 i do n't mean dishonest book keeping i mean accept that you are going to borrow money in order to pay for something of value that you can account as an asset work out now what you 'll need to borrow and how you think you can pay it back make sure the sum is worth it budget for that stick to your budget you 'll still have negative cashflow nothing changes there but your capital account looks fine personally i would n't actually put a monetary value on the degree i 'm not that bothered about the accounts and it 's really difficult to be accurate about it you can just consider it more than i expect to borrow and be done with it studying costs money once you 've graduated you probably are n't going to be back here saying i want to buy a house but i have no capital and i do n't want to go into debt are you although if you are the answer happens to be islamic mortgage i do n't know whether islamic banks have an equivalent answer for student debt since they ca n't own a share of your degree like they can a share of your home unless you 're a muslim presumably the ways that islamic finance avoids interest payments would not in any case satisfy your desire to be not in debt

what is the best way that i can invest money so that i can always get    returns would it be to set up an fd in a bank to buy land to buy a    rental house to buy a field or maybe to purchase gold forever is a long time of the options you listed the only one guaranteed to generate returns is a bank account the returns may well be very small but absent an economy wide financial failure you will get the stated return land does n't always retain its value nor do rental houses or fields gold clearly fluctuates but you would be better served to think about goals and how you can attain them what do you want to do with the returns if you are trying to set yourself up for purchasing a home paying for college or retirement then the small returns on a bank account may be insufficient and in that case you might be better served by worrying more about the size of the returns you need than the certainty of them there may be many better investments if you more clearly define what you expect to achieve by your investment

like others have already said it may cause an immediate dip due to a large and sudden move in shares for that particular stock however if there is nothing else affecting the company 's financials and investors perceive no other risks it will probably bounce back a bit but not back to the full value before the shares were issued why whenever a company issues more stock the new shares dilute the value of the current shares outstanding simply because there are now more shares of that stock trading on the market the earnings per share eps ratio will drop since the same profit and company value has to be spread across more shares example   if a company is valued at $ 100 dollars and they have 25 shares outstanding then the eps ratio equates to $ 4 per share = 4   if the company then issues more shares stock to employees who sell or keep them let 's say 25 more shares then shares outstanding increase to 50 but the company 's value still remains at $ 100 dollars eps now equates to $ 2 per share = 2 now sometimes when shareholders especially employees and especially employees who just received them suddenly all sell their shares this causes a micro panic in the market because investors believe the employees know something bad about the company that they do n't other common shareholders then want to dump their holdings for fear of impending collapse in the company this could cause the share price to dip a bit below the new diluted value but again if no real immediate risks exist the price should go back up to the new diluted value example 2 if eps was at $ 4 before issuing more stock and then dropped to $ 2 after issuing new stock the micro panic may cause the eps to drop below $ 2 and then soon rebound back to $ 2 or more when investors realize no actual risk exists after the dilution phase plays out the eps could actually even go above the pre issuing value of $ 4 because investors may believe that since more stock was issued due to good profits more profits may ensue hope that helps

you ca n't really avoid inflation as the population grows the amount of money needed will grow as well because the people will grow up and go to work and earn money and someone has to create it to pay them one of the definitions of inflation is increasing amount of money increasing amount of money causes devaluation for example if instead of 1000 dollars we now have 2000 dollars in circulation because the population tripled in the last 50 years while in russia the population remained the same and they have the same 1000 rubles as they had 50 years ago 1 ruble will no longer cost 1 dollar but rather 2 i.e. prices rise this is very simplified of course and there are a lot of causes and triggers for inflation inflation when controlled and within certain limits is necessary for growth as mentioned but when uncontrolled and very high it causes a lot of damage and that 's what troubles people about inflation not its mere existence as to bringing the prices the prices do n't go down the   gallon of gas will not go back to $ 0.25 it 's just the buying power of the money goes down because of inflation you could buy a gallon of gas for 0.25 50 years ago but you had to work for 1/2 hour to earn these 0.25 now you have to pay $ 4 but if you still need to work for 1/2 hour for that then the price did n't rise effectively

i always enjoy reading analyses like that but something i 've always wondered is whether they look at anything besides specifically the minimum wage   having worked a warehouse job i was paid 50 cents above minimum wage now that amount is n't arbitrary it is 50 cents above minimum wage and if minimum wage went up so would that wage i reckon there 's a whole lot of people making near minimum wage and it seems rather incomplete to talk about only 1.8 million americans when that number could balloon just by including wages within a dollar of the minimum   i 'm not saying that is fact i just wish the analysis was n't so matter of fact when it appears to me they 've somehow overlooked a pretty import subset of people affected by the minimum wage

when you hear advice to buy index funds that usually comes with two additional pieces of investment discipline advice that are important these two elements are important to give you relative predictability in your outcome 20 years from now   in this old blog post of mine i linked to warren buffett talking about this also   mentioned it in a comment on another answer it 's perfectly plausible to do poorly over 20 years if you buy 100 stocks at once without dollar cost averaging or rebalancing it 's very very very plausible to do poorly over 10 years such as the last 10 in fact can you really say you know your financial situation in 20 30 years and for sure wo n't need that money because predictability is important i like buying a balanced fund and not pure stocks http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ feel a little bad linking to my blog but all that into this answer seems dumb here 's another tip you can go one step past dollar cost averaging and try value averaging however chances are you are n't even going to be good about rebalancing if it 's done by hand so personally i would not do value averaging unless you can find either a fund or a financial advisor to do it for you automatically finance buff blog makes a case for a financial advisor in case you like that more than my balanced fund suggestion like rebalancing value averaging makes you buy more when you 're depressed about the market and less when it 's exciting it 's hard   dollar cost averaging is easily done by setting up automatic investment of course so you do n't have to do it manually in the way you would with value averaging if you read the usual books on index funds and efficient markets it 's easy to remember the takeaway that nobody knows whether the market will go up or down and yes you wo n't successfully time the market but what you can do successfully is use an investment discipline with risk control assume that the market will fluctuate that both up and down are likely and possible and optimize for predictability in light of that most importantly optimize to take your emotions and behavior out of the picture some disciplines for example are there are dozens out there many of them snake oil i think these i mentioned are valid anyway you need some form of risk control and putting all your money in stocks at once does n't give you a lot of risk control there 's no real need to get creative a balanced fund that uses index funds for equity and bond portions is a great choice

the perceived risk depends on the entire situation but often it is considered more risk especially if you want to occupy yourself things you need to consider it can be very difficult to show a property with tenants occupying it there are many reasons for this and most homes show sell better empty i have found many tenants make it difficult on the seller leaving their areas a mess being and especially in markets that are flooded with options a lot of buyers just wo n't bother with the difficulty of scheduling a showing in occupied properties i 've tried to purchase many properties where the renter insists on being there during a showing but wo n't open the door and there 's no recourse for the landlord because his lease or laws in the area do n't allow you to enter without permission also it can be difficult to look past a lot of clutter and other people 's decorating and preferences to be kind is the property currently under lease and what is the period of that lease it could be that the lease is month to month or it could be years remaining on the lease period it is likely a legal requirement in most areas that you honor the existing lease i would never buy a property that has multiple years remaining while some amateur landlords will allow 2 or even 5 year leases this is a very bad idea for many reasons what are laws like in your area for evicting tenants you should know this regardless of whether or not you intend to occupy or keep it a rental it can be a very difficult process evicting tenants and this process is vastly different from country to country and state to state here in the usa look into the security deposit assuming there is one how much is the deposit will it cover damage that may not exist yet do n't think that just because you plan on evicting them soon it is n't important people can trash a place on the way out and an expensive lawsuit could be your only recourse it is far easier to take a deposit than sue i would absolutely demand that the deposit transfer to you upon sale view the current renters with a fresh eye especially if you are considering leave it a rental look into all of the typical requirements their monthly income their credit history their criminal record their payment history their references are they likely to be good or terrible renters if you 're interested in the property consider an offer which requires the current landlord to evict within the time frame of the buy sell agreement this is n't an uncommon requirement i think the first thing to do is go look at the property and see if you can determine for yourself why it has n't sold yet properties all have different reasons for not selling in a reasonable time to the local market having renters alone in most markets should n't be that big of a factor i would suspect bad smells nasty renters or an unfavorable lease agreement exists

for finance you need to have a strong handle on how to use excel i do n't mean i can write some formulas and make a complicated worksheet i mean i know the vba language and can utilize macros and specific coding to streamline processes and eliminate some tasks having vba on your resume is a definite plus especially in addition to the cfa here 's a great resource for learning vba   in addition to vba the ability to use r the stats program can also be incredibly helpful that 's a whole new beast than excel and has amazing capabilities that are almost perfect for finance here 's a for learning the programming but it requires a strong understanding of statistical methods and maybe another stats program like if you google learn r quickly or something like that you can come up with something   it sounds like you 're a amazon boeing russell and so am i. if you 'd like help networking feel free to pm me i 'm a recent college grad and over the past few years i 've built a pretty solid network in the investments community here i can at least connect you to people that might be able to help out if nothing else i can at least give a ton more resources to learn from    edit also russell often uses linkedin to find new hires to interview if you have a lot of groups and stuff in common with the hr team you pop up higher in their searches look up their hr team and find out what groups they 're in what companies they follow etc    also do you know if you want to go into corp finance or investments two very different games

tesla ca n't be valued and its earning this year are completely irrelevant   will it ever sell annual vehicles   even if one day 10 m annual electric vehicles will be made there is no guarantee that tesla will maintain a majority share   no guarantee that tesla will acquire or prevent the patents that allows them the share   i can appreciate respect for musk though   betting for or against tesla is like betting on the 2017 kentucky today based seeing a few promising newborn

a system comparing students to themselves a year ago is what i think would work best therefore you are graded based off the students you have not the grade you are in   this would mean if i was in 2nd grade and read at a 1st grade level then went to 3rd grade and read at a 4th grade level then the teacher would receive higher marks this would of course be averaged out throughout the class with outliers left off because some students always get a 's and some not so much    its not a perfect system but its better than saying that the only performance indicators are not touching children and keeping your job long enough to get tenure

as has been said before going from nothing to something is an infinite percent increase it is not 100 maybe you had a dollar and now have $ 101 that is a 10000 increase quite remarkable i often work with percent changes like spc = 100 where i compute the percent with respect to the average first this is more stable as often measurements can have noise the average is more reliable   second advantage is also that this is so going from 95 to 105 is a 10 increase while going from 105 to 95 a 10 decrease of course you need to explain what you show

your wealth will go up if your effective rate after taxes is less than the inflation rate   that is if your interest rate is r and marginal tax rate is t then you need to be less than inflation to make a loan worth it   lately inflation has been bouncing around between 1 and 1.8   let 's assume a 25 tax rate   is your interest rate lower than between 1.3 and 2.4   if not do n't take out a loan another thing to consider when you take out a loan you have to do a ton of extra stuff to make the lender happy inspections appraisals origination charges etc   these really add up and are part of the closing costs as well as the time trouble of buying a house   i recently bought my house using 100 cash   it was 2 weeks between when i agreed to a price to when the deal was sealed and my realtor said i probably saved about $ 10,000 in closing costs   i think she was exaggerating but it was a lot of time and money i saved   my final closing costs were only a few hundred not thousands of dollars tl;dr loans are for suckers avoid if possible

in the us money talks and bullshit walks you can skip any credit history requirement if you demonstrate your ability to pay in a very obvious way credit history is just a standardized way of weeding out people that can not reliably pay instead of having to listen to an individual 's excuses about how the bank their account five times while they were waiting for their friend to pay them back for bubble gum if you can show up with a wad of cash you can get the car or the apartment or the bank account without the troubles of everyone else   but you can begin building credit with a secured credit card pretty easily this will be useful for things like utilities and sometimes jobs also banks wo n't be opposed to giving you credit if you have a lot of money in an account with them you should be able to maintain an exemption from all socioeconomic problems in the united states solely due to your experience with money and assets

powers makes a good point trading costs may eat up a significant portion of your roi a fee as little as 2 can consume more than 50 of your long term roi a rule of thumb is keep your fees to less than 1 one way to do that is to buy stock in companies that have a drip with a share purchase plan often the allows investors to purchase shares for low fees or free once you have the ability to purchase shares for virtually free you can   use roughly you send more money to the companies whose share prices are near their 52-week low and less money to those who are near their 52-week high getting back to your original question

gt it 's very funny that you call an analysis of the current state of the industry speculation and then go on to talk about something you think is going to happen which by the way has had six years to happen and has n't yet also it 's as if you do n't think first mover advantage exists six years is a long time to build up a lead especially in automotive where product cycles and development times are so long   i freely admit that my opinion is just opinion speculation   anyone who talks about the stock market with certainty is someone not to listen to      gt honestly look up the words vertical integration before continuing the conversation and the word panasonic as well   i know all about them      gt but wait i thought you said they were wrong because actual battery companies are n't involved and that actual battery companies know better than them but i guess the actual battery companies do n't actually know anything and they should listen to an idiot on the internet who has so far proven himself to be wrong about everything he 's said   panasonic has n't yet agreed to put up a penny   they will build batteries they are confident tsla can sell that is all     gt it seems panasonic is not as optimistic about the plant as you are gt well again if you listened to the call which is a pretty basic first step to talking about the quarterly results which for some reason you insist on continuing to do despite being completely ignorant of them then you might not be saying such stupid things   like what   you are the one who insisted panasonic was putting up a billion dollars which is a lie    gt panasonic you see is a rather conservative japanese company this is even mentioned in your article when they talk about plasma displays this is why they are always measured in their public statements because that 's what japanese companies do but as specified in the call panasonic 's actions as a partner to tesla have always been excellent and if you actually bothered to read your own article you would see that they 've committed to 2 billion cells and 200 300 million for the factory you know an actual battery company   so tell me when they put up a dollar    gt and if you actually bothered to read any other article you would see that that very same quote of yours was followed up with however tesla is a very important partner to us and discussions are continuing we need to look very carefully at auto demand and respond appropriately so of course that means taking a step by step approach to investment   yes that is the polite thing anyone would say    gt also there have been rumors of talks with lg and samsung should panasonic not decide to partner i 'm not sure i believe the rumors and also i think they 're unnecessary because panasonic will be a full partner in the gigafactory they know that tesla has been a huge source of profit for them and their automotive supply i.e. tesla has been one of the best performing parts of their company for some time now mark my words panasonic 's investment will end up being approximately $ 1 billion all told you can come back in a few years and check if you like   we 'll see    gt you mean like an actual battery company the ones putting up the money   they have n't put up any money   gt so since your point was so reliant on actual battery companies having expertise and specialization and so on does that mean you 're now dropping that point because you realized your bullshit would n't fly and moving on to another sort of bullshit until one of them sticks because if you 'd like to fix your ignorance i can help you with that but if you would n't as seems to be the case it seems somewhat like a waste of time to continue trying to explain basic concepts to you   they have n't put up a penny   here is what people who know about batteries are saying

number 2 so before i try to answer number 1 i 'll just mention that academics generally ignored negative real interest rates and have always admitted that negative nominal rates were perfectly possible   there 's nothing in his explanation that i think is controversial at this point though   as for number 1 a drop in a company 's share price affects the company 's ability to raise cash in the present and future   in a closely related issue that drop can affect the company 's ability to compensate its employees through options and restricted stock grants   in the long run and i suspect you already know this and drop in the share price affects the shareholders wealth and can lead them to demand that changes be made to be firm 's operations usually changes made to who 's running the firm   if a firm does n't need more financing and it does n't pay any employees with stock or derivatives on its stock then changes to its stock price wo n't affect the firm 's operations in the slightest   naturally this assuming that the change in stock prices is n't indicative of changes to the economy but that 's a causal relationship in the other direction the stock price reflects changes in operations not the other way around

well consider this even if you bought some at every all time high prior to this one you would have still made a profit i was kicking myself when i passed up an opportunity to buy some at $ 30 after its wild ride up to $ 1,200 and subsequent fall i made sure to start buying around $ 250 bitcoin is not going away there are hundreds of different cryptos out there but bitcoin is the gold standard and it is becoming more every day regulators and governments passed it off as a fad for years but are now paying attention because people are actually using it to get around all kinds of bottlenecks that exist due to the structure of the current global banking system if you feel like it will continue to be used more extensively and become more scarce over the next several years then it is probably worth investing at least something into it of course never invest more than you can afford to lose   full disclosure i hold some bitcoin but i am mostly in ethereum right now because i think there is greater potential there bitcoin is pretty expensive right now and ethereum is still catching up to it in market cap i think we will see some great practical uses for it in the coming years there are already some major players involved including the russian state owned banks

almost any financial institution has the technical ability to do this simply called sweeps auto sweeps or deposit sweeps the issue you face is finding an institution that is willing to do it for you   i think you will have the most luck at your primary financial institution where you currently keep the majority of your banking relationship   you will have better luck at small town banks and credit unions   the mega banks will likely not from their established policies deposit sweeps are common for business accounts   they are usually tied to a savings account which is usually held within the same institution however this is not a requirement   the sweep can send money to any us bank if you can provide the routing number and account number   the sweep will establish a peg balance or floor balance on the checking account   at the end of the day any amount above the peg is swept into the savings account automatically i doubt you will find what you ’re asking for within an online banking system   you will likely have to go into a branch and speak with a personal banker   explain to them you want to establish a sweep on your checking account and want to send the funds to another financial institution   you will have better luck asking for a peg of $ 100 or some other small amount   they may not take your request seriously if you want to completely empty the checking account to zero

the $ per share figure is the trading price or fair market value of the old johnson controls and should not be used to figure your gain nor to figure your basis in the new johnson controls international your new basis is the total of the gross proceeds received that is the cash   plus the fair market value of the new shares which was $ per share i am not referring to cash in lieu for fractional shares but the $ per share received upon the merger a person holding 100 shares of the old johnson controls would have received $ plus shares of the new company   ignoring the fractional share for simplicity 's sake gross proceeds would equal 83 x $ = $   in fair market value of shares plus the cash of $ for a total of $ this is your basis in the 83 new shares regarding the fractional share since new basis is at fair market value there should be no gain or loss recognized upon its sale

you have actually asked several questions so i think what i 'll do is give you an intuition about risk neutral pricing to get you started   then i think the answer to many of your questions will become clear physical probability there is some probability of every event out there actually occurring including the price of a stock going up   that 's what we call the physical probability   it 's very intuitive but not directly useful for finding the price of something because price is not the weighted average of future outcomes    for example if you have a stock that is highly correlated with the market and has 50 chance of being worth $ 20 dollars tomorrow and a 50 chance of being worth $ 10 it 's value today is not $ 15   it will be worth less because it 's a risky stock and must earn a premium   when you are dealing with physical probabilities if you want to compute value you have to take the probability weighted average of all the prices it could have tomorrow and then add in some kind of compensation for risk which may be hard to compute risk neutral probability finance theory has shown that instead of computing values this way we can embed risk compensation into our probabilities   that is we can create a new set up probabilities by adjusting the probability of good market outcomes downward and increasing the probability of bad market outcomes   this may sound crazy because these probabilities are no longer physical but it has the desirable property that we then use this set of probabilities to price of every asset out there all of them equity options bonds savings accounts etc   we call these adjusted probabilities that risk neutral probabilities   when i say price i mean that you can multiply every outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate to find its correct price     to be clear we have changed the probability of the market going up and down not our probability of a particular stock moving independent of the market   because moves that are independent of the market do not affect prices we do n't have to adjust the probabilities of them happening in order to get risk neutral probabilities anyway the best way to think of risk neutral probabilities is as a set of bogus probabilities that consistently give the correct price of every asset in the economy without having to add a risk premium if we just take the risk neutral probability weighted average of all outcomes and discount at the risk free rate we get the price   very handy if you have them risk neutral pricing we ca n't get risk neutral probabilities from research about how likely a stock is to actually go up or down   that would be the physical probability   instead we can figure out the risk neutral probabilities from prices if a stock has only two possible prices tomorrow u and d and the risk neutral probability of u is q then price = + the exponential there is just discounting by the risk free rate   this is the beginning of the equations you have mentioned   the main thing to remember is that q is not the physical probability it 's the risk neutral one   i ca n't emphasize that enough   if you have what u and d can be then there is only one unknown in that equation q. that means you can look at the stock price and solve for the risk neutral probability of the stock going up    the reason this is useful is that you can same risk neutral probability to price the associated option   in the case of the option you do n't know its price today yet but you do know how much money it will be worth if the stock moves up or down   use those values and the risk neutral probability you computed from the stock to compute the option 's price   that 's what 's going on here   to remember the same risk neutral probability measure prices everything out there   that is if you choose an asset multiply each possibly outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate you get its price   in general we use prices of things we know to infer things about the risk neutral probability measure in order to get prices we do not know

i 'm surprised by all the pro credit answers here debit has some definite advantages most importantly when you pay with a credit card the merchant pays around 3 of the transaction to the credit company in many states they are forced to charge you the same amount and this is frequently as consumer protection but consider what this means for the business they loose money for every credit transaction and they 're legally forbidden to do anything about it so you 're taking 3 from a business and handing it over to a massive cooperation   to make matters worse the buisness is inevitably going to have to raise their prices by a small amount so in the end the average consumer has gained nothing on the other hand the credit card company wins big and they use their profits to pay lobbyists and lawyers to keep these rules in place to put in the worst possible light it 's essentially legal extortion on corruption as for the fraud protection offered while it may be true that credit cards will offer a more hassle free reimbursement i.e. you just do n't have to pay the bill if your card is stolen consumer protection laws also extend to debit in many cases your bank is legally required to cut you a check for all the money you lost

with 40 of your take home available you have a golden opportunity here actually two and the second builds out easily from the first   golden opportunity 1 layoff immunity ok not really immunity most people do n't think of themselves getting laid off and do n't prepare of course it may not happen to you but it can it 's happened to me twice the layoff itself is an emotional burden getting rejected is hard but then you 're suddenly faced with a gut how am i gon na pay the rent if you have no savings it 's terrifying put yourself in that spot imagine that tomorrow you 're out of a job for how many months could you pay your expenses with the money you have three months one not even that   how about shooting for 12 months it 's really really comforting to be able to say i do n't have to worry about it for a year 12 months saved up gives you emotional and financial stability and it gives you options you do n't have to take the first job that comes along   now saving 12 months of expenses is huge but you 're in the wonderful spot where you can save 40 of your income it would only take 2.5 years to save up a year 's worth of income but actually it 's better than that because your 12-month layoff immunity fund does n't have to include the amount for retirement or taxes or that 40 we 're talking about your expenses are less than 60 of take home you 'd only need 12 months of that so you could have a fully funded 12-month layoff immunity fund only in a year and a half   golden opportunity 2 freedom fund do you like your job would you still do it if you did n't need the money if so great but if not why not get yourself into a position where you do n't need it that is build up enough money from saving and investing to where you can pay your expenses forever from your investments the number to keep in mind is 25 figure out your annual expenses and multiply it by 25 that 's the amount you 'd need to never need a job again that works out to a 4 withdrawal rate adjusting for inflation every year with a low risk of running out of money it 's a rule of thumb but smart people doing a lot of math worked it out here you keep saving and investing that 40 in solid mutual funds in a regular taxable account between your savings and the compounding returns off the investments you could easily have a fully funded freedom fund by the time you 're 50 in fact by 45 is n't unreasonable   it could be even better if you live in that high rent area because of the job and would n't mind living were the rents are lower once you quit your target amount would be lower between that working toward this goal and maybe a little luck you might even be able to do this by age 40   final thoughts there are other things you could put that money toward like a house of course the key take away here is to save it and invest it   you 're in a unique position of being able to do that with 40 of your income that 's fabulous but do n't think it 's the norm most people ca n't save that much and once you lose the ability to save that much it 's very difficult to get it back expenses creep in lifestyle wants become needs and so on if you get into the habit of spending it it 's very difficult to shrink your lifestyle back down down to what right now you 're perfectly comfortable with so spend some time figuring out what you want out of life and in the mean time sock that 40 away

in general scholarship income that you receive that is not used for tuition or books must be included in your gross income and reported as such on your tax return   scholarship income you receive that is used for those kinds of expenses may be from your gross income   see this irs information and this related question i believe that as represented on the 1098-t this generally means that if box 5 scholarships and grants is greater than box 1 or 2 only one of which will be used on your 1098-t you received taxable scholarship income   if box 5 is less than or equal to box 1/2 you did not receive taxable scholarship income   this page draws the same conclusion however you should realize that the 1098-t is not what makes you have to pay or not pay taxes   you incur the taxes by receiving scholarship money and you may reduce your tax liability by paying tuition   the 1098-t is simply a record of payments that have already been made for instance if you received $ 10,000 in scholarship money that is actually received checks for that amount or had that amount deposited into your bank account then your income went up by $ 10,000   if you yourself paid tuition it is likely that you can exclude the amount of the tuition from your taxable income reducing the tax you owe see the irs page linked above   however if you received $ 10,000 in actual money and in addition your tuition was paid by the scholarship with money you never actually had in your own bank account then the entire $ 10,000 would be taxable   you do not give enough information in your question to be sure which of these situations is closer to your own   however you should be able to decide by looking at your bank account look at how much money you received and how much you spent on tuition   if you received more scholarship money than the tuition you paid out of pocket you owe taxes on the remainder   i emphasize that this is just a general rule of thumb and should not be taken as tax advice you should review the irs information and/or consult a tax professional to determine what part of your scholarship income is taxable in addition as this now rather old article from the new york society of cpas notes many colleges and universities prepare incorrectly and report tuition and related expenses   this means you should be careful to reconcile the 1098-t with your own financial records of what money you actually received and paid   when i was in grad school there was a good deal of hand wringing and hair pulling each year among the students as we tried to determine what relationship if any the 1098-t bore to the financial facts

i can answer this question for my jurisdiction florida usa because i lived through it my dad alice passed away in 2008 just as the housing crisis was starting to heat up what happened to the mortgage my dad had a will in place   it was an old will from the 1980 's but never the less a will   we had to provide paperwork to the court that my mom had already passed away and my oldest brother was living out of state he would have been the executor otherwise   with the proper paperwork i became the executor and the property passed in to probate   at this point the estate was responsible for the house and the mortgage on it meaning me as i was the executor we decided to sell the house so we hired a realtor and set an asking price about $ 40k over what was owed on it   as we waited for it to sell i had to make monthly mortgage payments and payments to the hoa otherwise the hoa could put a lien on the property making it more difficult to sell should we find a buyer is it automatically transferred in most jurisdictions i would say not automatic   i definitely had get an estate lawyer and file the proper legal paperwork with the local county courthouse   some states have an easier probate process summary administration in florida that the requirements for small estates is bob expected to pay it off all at once no the mortgage holder was happy for me to make payments out of other estate assets in lieu of my dad   the were earning interest after all   this is probably true in most cases can the house be foreclosed on yes   in our case being 2008 we had a hard time selling the property   the asking price quickly went from $ 40k over what was owed to $ 20k over to $ 10k over then to being equal to the mortgage value   finally i approached the bank about options   they suggested a deed in lieu of foreclosure process   it was easier for us and the bank had to pay less lawyers and such   otherwise a deed in lieu is effectively the same as a foreclosure   at that point we stopped making payments   eventually me and all my siblings the heirs had to sign the proper paperwork giving the house over to the bank in our case the bank did not pursue us or rather the estate for the difference between final auction sale price and the mortgage balance it was an fha loan so the us government wound up picking up the difference   from what i understand this could have happened and we would have wound up with basically nothing out of the estate can the lender force the sale i ca n't give a definite answer on this but it probably depends   if you do n't pay   yes they sure can it 's usually part of the standard mortgage contract   i see 2 other options

the bill proposed to under existing law employers may take tax deductions for the costs associated with moving jobs out of the country the proposed legislation would have eliminated that and used the resulting new revenue to fund a 20 percent tax credit for the costs companies run up labor back into the u.s. from as found by i will explain this in an example below    lets use allen edmonds i manufacture shoes and sell them in the us the facts we will assume is revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 50 tax rate is 10 therefore profit before tax is $ 100 = $ 50 tax is $ 5 net profit is $ 45   however suppose offshoring to canada saves money they say please and thank you at every opportunity and the positive work environment allows them to work faster correspondingly to make the same number of shoes our costs has decreased because we pay less for labour the manufacturing cost decreases to $ 30 however we incur costs to move such as severance payments to layoff contracted employees i promise to hire you and pay $ 1 a year for 2 years i fire you at the end of the first year to be fair i pay you $ 1 however it can be any legitimate expense under the sun in this case we suppose this moving cost is $ 10 revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 30 moving cost is $ 10 tax rate is 10 profit before tax is $ 100 = $ 60 tax is $ 6 net profit is $ 54 yay more jobs for canadians    however the legislation would have changed this it would have denied that moving expense if you were moving out of the country therefore we can not consider $ 10 worth of expenses for tax purposes therefore revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 30 tax rate is 10 profit before tax for tax purposes is $ 100 $ 30 = $ 70 tax is $ 7 net profit for tax purposes is $ 63 however my accounting net real profit is $ 53 i must deduct the $ 10 associated with moving the difference between the two scenarios is $ 1 in general our net profit changes by our moving cost our tax rate   there is no tax break associated with moving in canadian tax any business expense in general can be deducted as long as it is legitimate and not specifically denied i am uncertain but would assume us tax law is similar enough moving expenses in general are legitimate and not specifically denied and therefore can be deducted   offshoring and are seen as legitimate business activities as in general companies do things to increase profit forget about patriotism for the moment   the bill was to make offshoring more expensive and therefore fewer companies would find offshoring profitable however republicans defeated this bill in congress most likely the house   for completeness let us examine what would happen when we onshore bring jobs from canada to us in our example silly unions demand unrealistically high wages and increase our cost of manufacturing to $ 50 again we decide to move back to the us because if it is the same everywhere for the sake of silly national pride we move our jobs back to the us we incur the same moving cost of $ 10 therefore we have revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 50 moving cost of $ 10 tax rate is 10 profit before tax for tax purposes is $ 100 $ 60 = $ 40 tax is $ 4 however we are given a 20 tax credit for moving expense $ 10 .2 = 2 the government only assess us tax of 2 net profit is $ 38 tax credits are a one time deal so profit in the future will be $ 100 $ 5 = $ 45 same as the first example   = outsourcing = offshoring for the purposes of this article not quite the same in real life

even if you 're working from a liveable wage people will still want extra luxuries that wage ca n't afford paying higher ranking positions more will give incentives for employees to work harder and earn promotions just as before    as for your second question ideally the would be implemented over a period of 3 6 years to allow the market time to adjust failing that some compromise solution may be reaching say a more modest raise to $ 12 which would still drastically increase the average american 's ability to make a living   however given that california 's recent raise in minimum wage to $ 15 has by all indications worked out quite well so far it seems like expanding that rise to more states should not be out of the question granted what works for california may not work for the nation but overall i 'd say a $ 15 minimum wage is pretty reasonable

if and only if there is a zero interest installment plan available technically the only risk is that there will likely be a hard inquiry on your credit report which may or may not also have a corresponding debt obligation attached to it personally i recently signed up for one such plan with google and i had a hard inquiry but no debt added to my report the other risks are that 1 your monthly payment goes up so if you are living on a tight budget the added payment might make it harder to meet your next bill and 2 you could miss a payment which generally triggers interest to accrue retroactively at a high rate and in some cases could be grounds for immediate repayment the pro reward of these plans is that you have to spend less of your capital upfront which you may be able to use for other purposes presumably with a higher net present value than purchasing the item you 're considering outright a larger example would be purchasing a new car you want to buy a $ 50k car and you have the cash on hand to pay in full but you are being offered 0 interest for 36 months you may be more inclined to take a loan at 0 with 0 down payment and invest your money in another vehicle no pun intended that offers you a decent rate of return and you will come out ahead in the end of course this example works in a perfect world where you can get such an offer there are no extra fees available you are n't worrying about your debt to income ratio in preparation for a big purchase like a house there is n't a higher insurance premium to consider etc in short 0 financing be it for a phone or a car can be a nice perk for the informed consumer who is not using the financing as a way to purchase outside their financial means but it is offered by companies as a way to make people buy things they normally would not and hopefully capitalize on people missing payments in order to reap the sweet 20%+ interest rates generally seen with these offers   in your specific situation with the phone you should consider if you get a discount on your monthly plan for purchasing outright or if you can get the phone subsidized if you sign a contract and you know you like your provider enough to stay for its duration if the monthly plan rate stays the same and you 're looking at either $ 500 now or $ 500 over 24 months and you do n't mind a hard inquiry there 's not much of compelling reason to pass on the financing and hold on to your $ 500

i read the linked article as did it states that the bank must stop charging pmi but my understanding is different i understood that the requirement to remove pmi at sub 80 loan to value only occurred after the natural amortization time had passed for example you buy a $ 100 k home you will be at 80 ltv the day you owe this date can be calculated at the closing as you know your numbers by then there 's nothing stopping you from asking the bank to stop charging pmi sooner but i believe they already have an end date in mind   besides the appraisal request what exactly did they give as the reason they wo n't cancel pmi   edit i just re read the link the line you show that the value of the property has n't gone down makes the bank 's appraisal request reasonable imho

there are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home a sell it and take the profit in the case of a home you presumably still have to live somewhere so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it this does n't get you anywhere if you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location whatever you consider nice to be than this sounds like a winning option if it means moving to a less desirable home then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home you 'll have to decide if it 's worth it b use it as collateral for a loan in this case that means a second mortgage home equity loan or a home equity line of credit but this can be dangerous house prices are very volatile these days if the value of the house falls you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets in my humble opinion you should be very careful about doing this borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse 's life saving operation may be reasonable borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea the vacation will be over within a couple of weeks but you could be paying off the debt for decades

yahoo 's adj close data is adjusted for splits but not for dividends despite yahoo 's webpage 's footnote saying   close price adjusted for dividends and splits we can see empirically that the adj close is only adjusted for splits for example consider siemens from jan 27 2017 to mar 15 2017 the adj close adjusts for splits on any particular day the adj close is equal to the close price divided by the cumulative product of all splits that occurred after that day if there have been no splits after that day then the adj close equals the close price since there is a 2-for-1 split on mar 14 2017 the adj close is half the close price for all dates from jan 27 2017 to mar 13 2017 note that if siemens were to split again at some time in the future the adj close prices will be for this future split for example if siemens were to split tomorrow then all the adj close prices seen above will be divided by 3 the adj close is thus showing the price that a share would have traded on that day if the shares had already been split in accordance with all splits up to today the adj close does not adjust for dividends notice that siemens distributed a $ dividend on feb 02 2017 and dividend on jan 30 2017 if the adj close value were adjusted for these dividends then we should expect the adj close should no longer be exactly half of the close amount but we can see that there is no such adjustment the adj close remains up to rounding exactly half the close amount note that in theory the market reacts to the distribution of dividends by reducing the trading price of shares post dividend this in turn is reflected in the raw closing price so in that sense the adj close is also automatically adjusted for dividends but there is no formula for this the effect is already baked in through the market 's closing prices

yes by paying double the amount each month you would have in effect paid the loan off in less than half the time for $ at 3 over 60 months your monthly repayments would be $ if you double your monthly repayments to $ you would end up paying the loan off by the end of the 29th months more than halving your loan term as long as there are no penalties for paying the loan off early

as a general rule in many countries pyramid schemes are illegal so do n't plan on getting rich anytime soon by being involved in one   anything you earn through such a scheme is subject to forfeiture because it is ill gotten gains the entire basis of a pyramid scheme is that the focus is principally on recruiting new not selling a product or service   i would strongly advise you to find a different way to riches    multi level marketing very rarely makes much money for anyone except the first people in the food chain and the odds of finding such an early stage opportunity are exceedingly small   for every successful mlm program there are probably 25 that never make it off the launch pad   be honest in asking yourself if it was really that easy why would n't everyone just get into mlm   it 's more hype than substance   do you know who buys most of the product   the newest people who drink the because they 're convinced they need to have plenty of inventory on hand for their potential customers   i ca n't tell you how many people i know who spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on buying product they never managed to sell   it 's much tougher than people think even with a good product

most of the time when a stock splits to create more shares it is done to bring the price per share down to a level that makes potential investors more comfortable there are psychological reasons why some companies keep the price in the $ 30 to $ 60 range others like to have the price keep rising into the hundreds or thousands a share   the split does n't help current investors with the possible exception that the news spurs interest in the stock which leads to a short term rise in prices but it also does n't hurt current investors when a reverse stock split is done the purpose is for one of several reasons

there is no simple way to calculate how much house any given person can afford in the answer keshlam gave several handy rules of thumb are mentioned that are used as common screening devices to reject loans but in every case further review is required to approve any loan   the 28 rule is the gold standard for estimating how much you can afford but it is only an estimate all the details that you do n't want to provide are required to give you anything better than an estimate in the spirit of joetaxpayer 's answer i 'm going to give you a number that you can multiply your gross income by for a good estimate but my estimate is based on a 15 year mortgage assuming a 15 year mortgage with a 3 interest rate it will cost $ per $ 100,000 borrowed so to take those numbers and wrap it up in a bow you can multiply your income by and have the amount of mortgage that most people can afford if you have a down payment saved add it to the number above for the total price of the home you can buy after closing costs are added in property taxes and insurance rates vary widely and those are often rolled into the mortgage payment to be paid from an escrow account banks may consider all of these factors in their calculators but they may not be transparent if you ca n't afford to pay it in 15 years you really ca n't afford it compare the same $ 100k loan in 30 years at 4 you pay about $ with a total of about $ in interest over the life of the loan in 15 years at 3 you pay about $ but the total interest is only $ 24k and you are out of the loan in half of the time the equity earned in the first 5 years is also different with for the 15 year loan vs. 9.5 on the 30 year loan   without too far into general economics 15 year loans would also have averted the mortgage crisis of 2008 because more people would have had enough equity that they would n't have walked out on their homes when there was a price correction

apart from legal requirements to have insurance e.g. 3rd party car that other answers have covered well we can think of all insurance as protecting our usable income as we can use cashflow to pay the costs of a loan to replace whatever we decided not to insure     so for example if i do n’t insure my house contents i can replace them on my credit card if needed therefore we are paying for insurance out of our income so as to protect our income knowing that the cost of the protection is on average more than the benefit we get from it but we all know that having an income of $ 50 k is less than double the value of having an income of $ 25k.    e.g. being able to eat and remain warm is more important to us then being able to go on anther holiday   this is way when someone has a higher income it requires more money to effect their actions loss aversion is another factor we are people not logistical machines

for 401(k and regular ira you pay income tax on withdrawals from the account at a certain age there is a required minimum distribution this is an amount you must withdraw from the account or you face penalties i 've also read about but am not familiar with mechanisms by which you can retire early and start taking withdrawals before the regular official retirement age these may or may not be legit i did n't do any research on it a roth ira which is not tax deferred and thus not technically covered by your question there is no tax on withdrawals assuming you are at retirement age and no required minimum distribution something to watch out for on your accounts are fees that they charge for withdrawals i was in a 401(k once that had a $ 50 fee per withdrawal a monthly check from this account would eat your money i paid the fee once when i rolled it into an account at a brokerage after leaving the company

what no not at all not even a little bit the argument made in his book is that political elites were looking for easy fixes to stagnant wages at the bottom which were caused by large scale forces like globalization and information tech but those problems are hard to deal with so they let them eat credit they lowered home loan standards and gave them govt guarantees in order to give them higher standards of living and of course it collapsed i think his views are different than krugman who i would guess would actually be supportive of such an absurd idea least do a cursory search before making a cynical self comment

there are many flaws with your idea say i want to borrow $ to accrue interest on a 1.20 apy    account i promise that i can not withdraw nor touch the    account by legal contract if you break the contract and lose the money the lender is out the money they can take you to court and will win but if you do n't have the money then they do n't get paid you ca n't squeeze water out of a rock even if a judge orders you to by sharing the interest with me on a loan they keep a percentage that they 'd normally get if you 're investing the money at 1.2 and the lender gets some amount less than that then they are getting much less than they normally get lenders typically get somewhere from 5 15 on loans the money can also be used to fund a stock trading account regardless of whether i profit i pay interest on the loan and split the profit shares 24/7 how can the lender lose with legal enforcing again if you lose the money no amount of legal enforcing can force you to pay money that you do n't have even if you go to jail for fraud the lender still does n't get paid simply no bank would ever agree to this

the value of a company is simplified the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt there are some other things to add subtract to that but just think about those for now   you could also say the value of a company is the value of its assets or more precisely the value of the net cash flows those assets will generate in the future   so let 's say you want to start a company so you want to buy some assets maybe you want to buy a $ 200 asset well you only have $ 100 so you take out a loan debt for $ 100 for the remainder you buy the asset and start generating income   let 's say after a month you get bored and decide to sell the company let 's assume the value of the assets has n't changed your equity is worth $ 100 and you find a buyer who is willing to pay $ 100 for your company great right   well there 's still the $ 100 loan you owe so you have to pay that back and suddenly you now have $ 0    so in fact you should have negotiated $ 200 with the buyer because that 's what the assets are actually worth then you can pay back the loan and still have the $ 100 in equity you deserve alternatively you could have negotiated the buyer to assume responsibility for the loan same outcome for you   did that help

how realistic is it that i will be able to get a home within the 250,000 range in the next year or so   very unlikely in the next year   the debt income ratio is n't good enough and your credit score needs to show at least a year of regular payments without late or default issues before you can start asking for mortgages in this range you do n't mention how long you 've been employed at these incomes this can also count against you if you have n't both been employed for a full year at these incomes they will look even more on the employment situation if they are n't both full time jobs although if you have a full year 's worth of paychecks showing the income is regular then that might mitigate the full time part time issue next year or so if you pay down your high interest debt car credit cards and maintain employment keep your check stubs and tax returns the loan officer will want copies then there 's a slight chance and from this quick snap shot of our finances does it look like we would be able to qualify for a usda loan probably not   mostly for the same reasons the only time a usda loan helps is when you would be able to get a regular loan if you had the down payment even with an available down payment of 50k you would n't be able to get a regular loan therefore it 's unlikely that you 'd qualify for a usda loan if you are anxious to get into a house choose something much smaller in the range it would improve your debt loan ratio enough that you might then qualify for a usda loan   however i think you 'd still have issues if you have n't both been employed at this rate of income for at least a year and have made regular payments on all your debts for at least a year i 'll echo what others have suggested though strengthen your credit eliminate as much of your high interest debt as you can car credit cards and keep your jobs for a year or two   start a savings plan so you can contribute a small down payment at least 3 5 of the desired home price when you are in a better position to buy during this time keep track of your paycheck stubs you may need them to prove income over the time period your loan officer will request note that even with a usda loan you still have to pay closing costs and those can run several thousand dollars so do n't expect to be able to come to the table with no cash lastly there 's good reason to be very conservative regarding house cost and size   if you can consider buying the house as if you only had the per year   move the debt to the person making the lower income and if you buy the house in the name of the person only making per year then the debt loan ratio looks very positive   further it may be that the credit history of that person is better and the employment history is better   if one of you has better history in these ways then you might have a better chance if only one of you buys the house   banks ca n't tell you about this but it does work   keep in mind though that if you two part ways it could be very unhappy since one would be left with all the debt and the house would be in the other 's name   not a great situation to be in so make sure that you both carefully consider the risks associated with the decisions made

that was n't an inheritance that arrived out of the blue and the bank contacted your girlfriend by email was it a uk tax code is basically an assessment of how much money you can earn in the uk before you have to pay tax on it basically it 's a coding for a tax allowance and as a uk tax payer hmrc the uk version of the irs gives you one for free if your girlfriend is not a uk tax payer she should get the necessary paperwork to show that she is n't although i 'm not sure if that 's got any bearing on inheritance tax there are no lawyers involved in that process normally any appropriately accredited accountant can do that for you in the uk if you 're not in the uk when i had to apply for a change of tax status in the uk it certainly did n't cost me $ to do so via my accountant there in fact the whole thing cost a few pounds to pay for my accountant 's time and that was it in fact that whole thing smells fishy to me as someone who used to live in the uk care to divulge the name and possibly address of the bank here 's inheritance tax information straight from the horse 's mouth that should clear up any questions if your girlfriend is even liable for any inheritance tax in the uk in the first place and then given the sums involved get the recommendation for a good lawyer and a good accountant in the uk or an accountant who can recommend a lawyer to make sure that that end of the transfer goes smoothly

although this is possible with many brokers it 's not advisable in many cases you may end up with both trades executed at the same time this is because during the opening the stock might spike up or down heavily bid ask spread widens and both of your orders would get picked up resulting in an instant loss your best bet is to place the stop manually sometime after you get filled

the best answer to your question would to be what the interest rates are like in australia itself   the reserve bank sets the target cash which is the market    interest rate on overnight funds it uses this as the instrument for    monetary policy and influences the cash rate through its financial    market operations decisions regarding the cash rate target are made    by the reserve bank board and explained in a media release announcing    the decision at 2.30 pm after each board meeting prior to december    2007 media releases were issued only when the cash rate target was    changed from investopedia how rates are calculated   each central bank 's board of directors controls the monetary policy of its     country and the short term prime    interest rate that banks use to borrow from each other when the    economy is doing well interest rates are in order to curb    inflation and when times are tough cut rates to encourage lending and    inject money into the economy have a look at this from graph from i would then go to a website that allows you to compare graphically whichever interest rate you you could get the raw data and run some analysis to each his own   fyi this topic fx is incredibly complex and i hope my answer satisfies your needs otherwise talk to a quant you will need a ton of data inputs to model the entire economy of australia to try and predict what the central bank will do which is what people try and do everyday best of luck

gt i ve read that consumer spending stimulates an economy more than investment somewhere   investment is necessary for an economy to grow as is consumer spending neither is more important if you lack one of those stimulating it will do more than stimulating the other   it 's like a racing team saying the driver is more important than the car in situations where everyone 's cars are as good as they 'll get improving the driver is more important in situations where the quality of cars differs improving the car becomes more important   gt;also the theory that decreasing the income gap helps society in many other ways   there is strong speculation that that is the case however it 's 100 fact that increasing everyone 's wealth helps society much more it 's why you 'd rather live today than in any more egalitarian point in our past if tinkering with income inequality gets in the way of overall wealth creation it will do more harm than good

you can invest for yourself be your own boss make your own hours my boyfriend and i both trade for our personal income and we work from home and have these as our only jobs he chooses to work longer hours and devote more time to it because he values money over free time more than i do if you consciously choose what you value most the ratio of work time to free time you can make it your goal to secure a job which follows your values if you let your job dictate your hours values for you for example accepting a position somewhere because it will make you a lot of money but it will leave you with little free time you may be unhappy if that 's not what you want i think people have a lot more control over their happiness and work hours than they give themselves credit for good luck in your path

it is easier to get a loan on a rental than a flip which is a huge advantage to rental properties leverage allows you to increase your returns and make more money off appreciation and higher rents i use arms to finance my rental properties that are amortized over 30 years i have to put 20 percent down but my portfolio lender lets me get as many loans as i want because i put 20 percent down on my rental properties and they still have great cash flow i can buy three times as many properties as i could with cash purchases   buying more rental properties amplifies the other advantages like cash flow equity pay down and the tax advantages

in march the news it shaping up data giving rise new economy did a feature on data and had an interesting take on antitrust rules    as with other laws including tax the statute is woefully behind the market i think the implications of big data require the concept monopolies to be as companies can gather data across the multitude of platforms you 're ok with they are able to better understand consumers the threat is if everyone uses google maps or waze owned by google google could create a monopoly on traffic driving human habits data   an analog to this is thinking about insurance large insurance companies can rely on huge amounts of data to model out their risk reward on policies this will allow them to make better decisions and price themselves better in the market than smaller competitors without this data some governments require large insurance companies to share data with smaller ones as a form of antitrust rules   i agree that sheer size is n't an issue however i think more thought has to be put on the monopoly of data

essentially though at sam 's club and costco you 'll probably get your membership revoked by asking to see your receipt and items you 're submitting to a search and the company has no legal authority to force you to do so basically every time an employee asks to see your receipt and items they are accusing you of theft and demanding you submit to a search no most employees do n't know the legal details about this they also ca n't stop you from saying no i do n't submit to a search of my items and walking right past them    it might or might not be a big hassle i 've seen people walk right by them at walmart at my own grocery store we had no legal way to restrain people who were stealing we could yell at them take pictures of their face and give the evidence to police but as non police personnel we could n't physically restrain them we had a designated security guy who could do it and if he was n't working that day no one was getting restrained the tiny girl working in the garden section of walmart asking to see your receipt probably is n't private security or walmart loss prevention   it just depends how strongly you feel about the 4th and 5th amendment i personally get pissed that i have a 13 month old i 'm carrying and then i have to put everything down open my bags while watching my 13 month old to keep her from all for an 18 year old to just draw a yellow line through my receipt after they barely glanced at my items it 's a hassle for me and unnecessary if walmart had a loss prevention team worth a shit but they refuse to adequately staff their stores hell you do n't even need a good loss prevention department if you have enough employees on the floor to deter theft

partly i suspect this is selection bias you say you see so many luxury cars go by but if you 're looking for them you 're going to notice them have you calculated the actual percentage do they make up 50 of the cars that pass a specific point in a specific period of time or just 10 if you really counted you say you live in baltimore county maryland that 's a relatively wealthy area so i 'd expect the percentage of luxury cars to be higher than the national average you 'd likely see considerably fewer in the of mississippi that said some people who own luxury cars ca n't really afford them i 'm reminded of a wonderful tv commercial i saw recently where a man is showing off all his material goods he talks about his big house and his swimming pool and his fancy car with a big smile on his face standing tall and generally looking proud and happy and then he says how do i do it and suddenly his expression changes to complete despair he down and says i 'm in debt up to my eyeballs it turns out to be a commercial for a debt counseling service some people put very high value on owning a fancy car and are willing to sacrifice on other things if having a big fancy car is more important to you then say having a nice house or the latest computer or a big screen tv or dining out more often or going on more expensive vacations or whatever you have to give up to get the car well that 's your decision personally i do n't care much about a fancy car i just want something that gets me where i want to go and i 've always figured that with an expensive car you have to constantly worry about getting in an accident and damaging or destroying it if you put your money into a big fancy house at least houses rarely with each other personally i make a nice income too and i have a $ 500/month mortgage and zero car payment because i drive a 2003 pickup that i bought with cash but i have two kids in college and i 'm trying to get them through with no debt that 's where all my money is going

your first step should be to visit with the financial aid office of the university that you are considering attending perhaps even before filling out the fafsa you may be eligible for grants scholarships and subsidized loans as well as unsubsidized loans you should pursue the first two options first and then when you know how much remains to be financed we can evaluate which of your investments you might liquidate if further financing is needed there are a range of views on debt on this board i take a very cautious approach to going in to debt i worked full time and took night classes to finish my degree without debt but depending on your program that might not be an option it seems that you also have a healthy relationship with debt considering the shape of your savings and finances as outlined above apart from the above information about how much money could be obtained and at what interest rates the other missing information is your current salary and your expected salary range after completing the program with all of that information i could make specific recommendations but at this point my only recommendation is to avoid liquidating any retirement accounts in your effort to invest in yourself if at all possible

depending on the improvement you have to amortize or depreciate it over time which effectively allows you to write off the value over a period of years even if you pay for it all up front this messes with cash flow which is different than profitability but when you span the write off over five or ten years the distinction between cash flow and profitability for a private self funded company is irrelevant if the money ai n't there the money ai n't there operating capital is life blood   taxes also alter the roi equation of the investment since you do n't keep all the money you put in   way over simplified example lets say i close out the year with some arbitrary profit ten million bucks in my war chest 3.5 could go to taxes i also know that my supplier ca n't handle my volume for next year while the season is hot so i 'd like to buy inventory in the off season last year i sold 6.5 mill worth of stuff from this supplier but i estimate i could sell 9 10 mill if i did n't have availability problems if i buy 9 10 mill in inventory i ca n't pay taxes if i pay taxes i ca n't buy enough to grow next year    sure cogs is a deductible expense but the expense is n't realized until the inventory is sold which wo n't be until long after these taxes are due   i now have taxes interfering with my expansion even though eventually i can write that off   now lets look at the manufacturer sure he could expand his capacity and make more money but he has to deduct the 5 mill machine he needs over twenty years or ten or whatever while the purchase price needs to be made today this year he 's gon na pay tax on 90 or 95 of the money he used to buy that machine which would eat into the money he needs to buy raw materials to fill orders he already has   of course the real world is much more complicated and you can leverage leasing agreements and purchasing terms to alleviate this to some extent but i wanted to illustrate a point i hope my extremely simplified example communicated what i mean   does that make sense

i 've done exactly what you are describing and it was a great move for me a few years back i had two credit cards one had a $ 6000 balance and a fairly high interest rate that i was making steady payments to including interest   the other was actually tied to a heloc home equity line of credit whose interest rate was fixed to prime which was very low at the time i think my effective rate on the card was around 3   so i pulled out one of the cash advance checks from the heloc account and paid off the $ 6000 balance then i started making my monthly payments against the balance on the heloc and paid it off a bit more quickly and with less overall money spent because i was paying way less interest another similar tactic is to find a card that does n't charge fees for balance transfers and that has a 0 interest rate for the first 12 months on transferred balances i am pretty sure they are out there open an account on that card transfer the balance to it and pay it down within 12 months and try not to use the card for anything else if you can help it

before we all argue about his pricing blah blah let me explain to you how he absolutely fleeced consumers under the guise of helping them   had a handful of sales strategies   40 off   50 off   buy one get one for $ 0.01   buy one get one for $ 0.99   60 off   green tag clearance where things were up to 90 off discounted prices items as low as $   what he did was basically eliminate all of the different kind of sales and just discount a straight 40   meaning that before when you were screwed the worst you would do is their everyday low pricing today if you went in and bought at their worst 40 sale you got exactly what he offers you right now if you were lucky and went in at a better time you actually saved more generally around 50 with type of stuff   not only that he killed coupons this is where you could really rake you would   save money with your card   $ 10 off orders of $ 25   $ 10 off orders of $ 30   $ 10 off orders of $ 50 $ 15 off $ 75 $ 25 off $ 100   again these all varied but you could stack coupons on top of savings   shoppers like me stopped going there because the savings ceased to exist we 're not stupid but he played us like we were and he counted on people 's outrage of sales to dupe them as you can see by the scheme i 've shown you not only saved more before but way more and the argument that it 's better now is patently false because their prices are identical to their worst sale without any coupons   why do you think the red stickers go over the price because they want to hide it the same items at kohls have the sticker from union bay or whoever on it it 's all the same msrp it 's just that he tried to fool the shoppers he did n't have with false outrage but alienated the rest of the shoppers who look at their receipt

i would second the advice to not do this real estate ownership is complex to begin with involving a constant stream of maintenance financing and other decisions   it is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit a couple but at least spouses are forced to compromise friends are not and you can end up with long running conflicts and financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships and friendships are no exception if you want your friendship to do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment my advice would be to steer clear no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property but it will be 100 yours and will save tons of headache since you are still considering this deal it 's a great time to politely change your mind and walk away believe me a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration good luck

if i really understood it you bet that a quote currency stock market anything will rise or fall within a period of time     so what is the relationship with trading i see no trading at all since i do n't buy or sell quotes you are not betting as in betting on the outcome of an horse race where the money of the participants is redistributed to the winners of the bet you are betting on the price movement of a security to do that you have to buy sell the option that will give you the profit or the loss in your case you would be buying or selling an option which is a financial contract that 's trading then since anyone should have the same call when a currency rises and put when it falls how can you know what will be the future rate of exchange of currencies it 's not because the price went up for the last minutes hours days months years that it will continue like that because of that everyone wo n't have the same strategy also not everyone is using currencies to speculate there are firms with real needs that affect the market too like importers and exporters they will use financial products to protect themselves from forex rates not to make profits from them how the brokers websites can make money the broker or bank will either i 'm really afraid to bet because i think that they can bankrupt at any time are my fears correct there is always a probability that a company can go bankrupt but that 's can be very low probability brokers are usually not taking risks and are just being intermediaries in financial transactions but sometime their computer systems have troubles thanks to that they are not likely to go bankrupt you after you buy your option also they are regulated to insure that they are solid last thing if you fear losing money do n't trade if you do trade only play with money you can afford to lose as you are likely to lose some maybe all money in the process

mutual funds generally have a minimum amount you must start with to own any of the fund for vanguard funds they have a $ 1,000 minimum for certain target date funds and $ 3,000 for most everything else what you would do is open an account at vanguard or other brokerage that handles vanguard funds and send them a check for $ 3,000 after it clears you can specify which fund you want it to go into and it buys what the price at end of day was divided into your account balance number of shares fractional share are fine and your balance will not usually be an even number of shares most brokerages will let you set up an automatic transfer where some amount out of your paycheck is put into your account each pay period you can specify which of the funds you own it goes into once you 've got the minimum to be in the fund you can add whatever amount you like each month

one idea if you came up with a model to calculate a fair price range for a stock then any time the market price were to go below the range it could be a buy signal and above the range it could be a sell signal there are many ways to do stock valuation using fundamental analysis tools and ratios dividend discount model peg etc see wikipedia stock valuation and while many of the inputs to such a fair price range calculation might only change once per quarter market prices and peer sector statistics move more frequently or at different times and could generate signals to buy sell the stock even if its own inputs to the calculation remain static over the period for multinationals that have a lot of assets and income denominated in other currencies foreign exchange rates provide another set of interesting inputs i also think it 's important to recognize that with fundamental analysis there will be extended periods when there are no buy signals for a stock because the stocks of many popular profitable companies never go on sale except perhaps during a panic moreover during a bull market and especially during a bubble there may be very few stocks worth buying fundamental analysis is designed to prevent one from overpaying for a stock so even if there is interesting volume and price movement for the stock there should still be no signal if that action happens well beyond the stock 's fair price otherwise it is n't fundamental analysis it 's technical analysis whereas technical analysis can by definition generate far more signals because it largely ignores the fundamentals which can make even an overvalued stock 's movement interesting enough to generate signals

you ca n't run a business without making $ $ $    good will and good intentions only go so far and they do not always equate to positive results capitalism rewards the positive results of proper decision making in the market place as businesses generate enough profit to allow them to stay afloat and expand while those businesses that do not follow through with proper decision making reap negative results fail and eventually go out of business these are facts which govern how capitalism works i.e. success is rewarded failure is punished and both of these results serve as lessons for all others in the marketplace who dare to heed these lessons based offered up by success and failure which are to be found in a capitalist economy    so if the current market conditions dictate that allowing workers more free time increased perks etc will increase productivity and lead to success then it is only rational and reasonable for businesses to attend to the needs of their employees    however if the costs of these perks begin to spiral out of control and/or are no longer relevant or favorable in the marketplace then cost cutting measures are needed to ensure that businesses are able to secure their profits and stay afloat those who do not rein in or alleviate these cost issues in their businesses will quickly go under as these costs eat out their bottom line and competitors move in to under cut them in the market place nevertheless attempting to place some sort of emotional or political reasoning and judgment as to how and why businesses act in regards to cost cutting measures without first taking into account the reality of the circumstances in which they must operate in i.e. having to make a profit in order to survive is unreasonable and flat out childish

generally etfs and mutual funds do n't pay taxes although there are some cases where they do and some countries where it is a common case what happens is the fund reports the portion of the gain attributed to each investor and the investor pays the tax in the us this is reported to you on 1099-div as capital gains distribution and can be either short term as in the scenario you described long term or a mix of both it does n't mean you actually get a distribution though but if you do n't it reduces your basis

what about changing the income tax to a national sales tax and putting different products and services on a tiered system   basic necessities would be taxed at a lower rate if at all then you work up the tiers towards purely luxury items that are taxed at a much higher rate   that would give us the benefits of a sales tax while at the same time not placing an extra burden on the lower class who would presumably need to spend a higher portion of their income on basic necessities

sure   even milton friedman called hayek 's economic work   much of the austrian economic foundation rests without as solid of a   philosophical or mathematical foundation as most other schools of thought   i suppose the easiest way to understand this is to look at three foundational works   i recommend reading each of these anyways but skimming and paying attention to references should give you a good idea of the varying levels of rigor introduced into each school of thought   leaf through das = = = = = = = = false this is marx 's primary   it is far older than the following two that i will present   nevertheless it perhaps more than any other book played a pivotal role in the 20th century    leaf through a general theory of employment interest and = = = = = = = = = false this is the foundational work of the keynesians   there is much more here than simply the advice to increase government spending to stabilize demand during economic downswings   and it has been probably the most widely accepted work by the greatest number of economists over the 20th century      leaf through the theory of money and credit this is the austrian from von mises   it is the newest of the three   it is also likely the least rigorous   but please judge for yourself   von mises did do some more rigorous work in other areas     but all schools of economics ultimately rest on their theory of capital   so before you pick which church to belong to it 's worth reading their respective

value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time not the amount of contributions   so you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets shares etc and some cash you start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow   perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8 growth rate is reasonable   or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that if in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path you would put more money into it possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account   on the other hand if the share component is growing too fast you would put all your additional savings into cash   so if your investments are doing well you 're not supposed to spend the excess money but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall in theory this has the auto benefit of dollar cost averaging but even better when prices are high you 'll automatically buy fewer shares or even sell some conversely when prices are low you 'll buy extra shares from your reserve account if it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3 you 'll end up with an entirely share portfolio and a ride than you might have liked   if you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash which has happened though not yet in the usa then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio the original book value averaging by has a pretty good explanation of various cases though i would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail i have not implemented this myself one reason being that the amount i 'm able to save from year to year varies as it probably does for you and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes   you could still do it i suppose i think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market 's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average

pete b mentioned adjusting your payments using the debt snowball method and i agree it is one possible solution another being the debt avalanche method here is a link that describes both   there was a time in my past when i had 17 credit lines open totaling about $ 12,000 if i had paid them the way the banks asked minimum monthly payments it would have taken decades to pay off then i was shown these two techniques and as a result i was able pay them down rapidly and close all but 2 lines within 5 years like others i am going to say that if you already own your house free and clear never never never put a loan on it unless the loan is a to improve the house or b a life death emergency if you get sick or fired and miss even a single payment on a heloc you could lose your house forever and that just plain sucks not only will you then be forced into renting a place money down the drain but your credit rating will take such a huge hit it will be years if ever before you can even try and buy a new home   debts come and go as do the toys and other things we buy with that debt homes are security stability for tomorrow never give that up for a little ease comfort today update i had to go looking for it but here is some software that i used all those years ago to figure out my strategy for paying down all my credit bills it 's a bit clunky but it 's super easy to use plus it has some other variations on snowball and avalanche methods as well i definitely found it helpful

i do n't want to hate on those other comments but as a college student having a 4.0 and going to a target school are not realistic goals for everyone the best advice i would give you is to be passionate about the field it sounds dumb on its face but being involved in student investment clubs funds or competing in investment competitions are great ways to get exposure and meet people in the field while building your resume internships are incredibly important because that 's where you prove to yourself and others that you are a capable person    you also have a lot of options ahead of you you can do research client facing roles cfp and even corporate finance i was n't a finance major but i spent 3 years in college working in our student managed investment fund and it absolutely paid off now doing corporate finance you have to want to learn and grow it 's not realistic for a college student with limited resources to get your cfa level 1 or series exams especially if it does n't suit your field be open to different types of jobs and build relationships with your professors who are well connected it does help to have stellar grades and it helps to be at a top school but our state school has put kids on the street you just have to be hungry and realistic about your talents and passion    good luck to you

the focus of this article is n't on tax revenue the author is discussing income disparity    the laffer curve does n't tell the whole story you are correct a higher tax rate does not imply higher tax revenue and a lower tax rate does not imply less revenue changing tax rates is n't going to significantly affect tax revenue however there are a broad range of other effects when changing tax rates in evaluating adjustments to tax rates our focus needs to be on these secondary effects    we are taxed on income not   when i sell you a $ 10 widget that i paid a worker $ 2 to produce from $ 5 of materials i pay taxes on the $ 3 net income not the $ 10 revenue i received from you     the main way businesses avoid high marginal tax rates is by increasing deductible expenses such that their net income after these expenses keeps them below their desired tax bracket   it is far better to spend that money on something that can benefit the business than simply give it to the government any businessman would rather keep his earnings if possible if that is not possible he 'd prefer to spend them on something that can help him rather than squandering it on junk or giving it away to the government    for most businesses the largest deductible expense is payroll any decent employer would prefer to pay out a christmas bonus instead of giving that same amount to uncle sam any businessman would prefer to pay for additional advertising or a charitable donation to a worthy cause rather than paying the irs    run up the top tier tax rate and suddenly businessmen feel a compelling need to lower their prices and pay their workers more run up the tax rate and income disparity shrinks   run up the tax rate and you put more money in the hands of consumers

the following is from wikipedia term life insurance with very minor editing because term life insurance is a pure    death benefit its primary use is to    provide coverage of financial    responsibilities for the insured    such responsibilities may include but    are not limited to consumer debt    dependent care college education for    dependents funeral costs and    mortgages term life insurance is    generally chosen in favor of permanent    life insurance because it is usually    much less expensive depending on the    length of the term many financial    advisors or other experts commonly    recommend term life insurance as a    means to cover potential expenses    until such time that there are    sufficient funds available from    savings to protect those whom the    insurance coverage was intended to    protect for example an individual    might choose to obtain a policy whose    term expires near his or her    retirement age based on the premise    that by the time the individual    retires he or she would have amassed    sufficient funds in retirement savings    to provide financial security for    their dependents this suggests the questions why do you have this policy also how many term life policies do you need or how much insurance do you need clearly you will be better off investing the premiums in the market   your beneficiaries may be better off either way depends when you die and to a lesser extent on market performance if you are not able to retire now but expect to be able to later you should strongly consider having sufficient insurance to provide income replacement for your spouse   this is a fairly common why

to address the issue in the title of your question many expenses strike at what for all practical purposes are random intervals roof starts leaking car needs repair etc do n't have a fixed cost every month medical expenses can certainly be more extreme than many other expenses but their nature is the same and so the way to budget for them is the same you figure out what your average expenses are over a long period of time then you start putting away a little more than this amount every month keep putting away until you have a reserve larger than any expense you are likely to get hit with all at once   i have no idea what your particular expenses are so let me use myself for an example my medical bills last year were unusually large about $ 6,000 i have lousy insurance and a couple of chronic conditions so my bills are usually maybe $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per year so i plan on about $ 150 per month for medical bills most insurance policies have an out of pocket maximum this should be the most you 'd ever have to lay out in a year mine is $ 13,000 i told   you my insurance sucks so i have an account that i have now built up to $ 13,000 worst case i wipe out that account in any case if my bills are that large the doctors or hospital will normally agree to a payment plan i still owe a few hundred on my bills from last year and the hospital is letting me pay it off at $ 120 per month your question brings up a lot of issues about difficulties of working with insurance and the u.s. medical system in general i 'm not sure if your intent was to get advice on the rest of it all simple not pleasant but simple answer if you 're insurance is provided by your employer you 're pretty much stuck with the policy that the employer negotiates i do n't know how much you 're contributing to premiums usually the company pays the bulk of it you could investigate getting a policy on your own but odds are that any policy you could get for what you 're contributing now would be way worse than what you can get through the company you could always investigate but i doubt you 'll do better you can talk to hr if it 's a big company they may have some muscle with the insurance company and could help you out failing that it becomes a political question of how the laws affecting medical care and insurance in the u.s. are set up and while i have many ideas for how it could be improved sadly i 'm not in a position to do much about it and i doubt you are either unless you have the resources to run for president

you do not have to pay tax on any earnings inside a tfsa quoting wikipedia 's article investment income including capital gains and dividends earned in a tfsa is not taxed even when withdrawn this is backed up by the official tfsa government site which states investment income earned in a tfsa is tax free this makes the tfsa an appropriate vehicle to store investments which produce dividends for example if you invest $ 5500 and receive a total of $ 500 in dividends this year you will not pay tax on that $ 500 either in this tax year or even subsequently when you withdraw money out of your tfsa of course tfsas are n't meant to be used for regular withdrawals if you are planning on investing $ 5500 this year and withdrawing the dividends i 'd urge you to be careful and consider if this is actually the best sort of savings vehicle for you but that 's really just a general warning nothing specific to dividends it is possible to do this indeed withdrawing $ 500 in dividends this year will increase your available contribution room in the next tax year not in this tax year for example you contribute $ 5500 at the beginning of this year by the end of november you have accumulated $ 500 in dividends you withdraw these in december in the following tax year you can this $ 500 in addition to the standard $ 5500 contribution room so you could contribute $ 6000 just be careful with your calculations i messed mine up and ended up paying a rather substantial penalty for my overcontribution

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

never carry a balance on a credit card there is almost always a cheaper way to borrow money the exception to that rule is when you are offered a 0 promotion on a credit card but even then watch out for cash advance fees and how payments are applied typically to promotional balances first paying interest on daily spending is a bad idea generally the only time you should pay interest is on a home loan car loan or education loan   basically that 's because those loans can either allow you to reduce an expense e.g. apartment rent taxi fair or increase your income by getting a better job you can try to make an argument about the utility of a dollar but all aside you are better off investing than borrowing under normal circumstances that said using a credit card with no annual fee can build credit for a future car or home loan the biggest advantage of a credit card is cash back if you have good credit you can get a credit card that offers at least 1 cash back on every purchase   if you do n't have good credit using a credit card with no annual fee can be a good way to build credit until you can get approved for a 2 card e.g. citi double cash additionally technically you can get close to 10 cash back by chasing sign up bonuses however that requires applying for new cards frequently and keeping track of minimum spend etc credit cards also protect you from fraud if someone uses your debit card number you can be short on cash until your bank fixes it   but if someone uses your credit card number you can simply dispute the charge when you get the bill you do n't have to worry about how to make rent after an unexpected charge side note it is a common mis that credit card issuers only make money from cardholder interest and fees card issuers make a lot of revenue from interchange fees paid by merchants every time you use your card some issuers e.g. amex make a majority of their revenue from merchants

michael pryor 's answer is accurate to the actual question asked the current accepted answer from dheer is not entirely true but roughly provides an overview of the different entities involved in a typical transaction with some wrong corrected and improved below   the issuing bank the one that issues the credit card to the customer when it comes to the service fee split the issuer bank takes on the majority of the cut in the service fee paid by the merchant to the different entities for example on a 2.5 overall fee paid by merchant roughly 1.5 goes to the issuer 0.3 goes to the card network visa master card etc and the remaining 0.7 goes to the acquiring bank reward programs have a partnership with participating merchants where merchants are charged a higher service fee for the likelihood of driving a higher volume of transactions to the merchant a portion of the rewards also comes from the issuer who shares a percentage of their fee back to the customer in exchange for the same likelihood of making more profit through increased volume in total transactions for example a reward program may charge merchants 4.5 fee with 3.5 of it going to the issuer upto 3 of this can be given back to the customer for their loyalty in using the card service the banks can afford to take as little as 0.5 instead of their regular 1.5 due to the increased volume of transactions and the fixed fee they collect as membership fee note that costco has a similar business plan but they make money entirely of membership fee so with enough clients banks can theoretically afford to run their program entirely on membership fees costing no additional service fee to merchants the service fee depicted above is arbitrary and it can be lowered if the merchant is also a client of the issuing bank that is both the issuing bank and acquiring bank are the same so it is kind of a win win win situation and as usual the banks can afford to make a larger income if the customer ends up paying interest for their credit although the rewards program is not designed accounting on this

ex date is a function of the exchange as well as the dividend consider deutsche bank ag db on the nyse on xetra for a given dividend each exchange sets the ex date for trades on that exchange   see for a description of how it works in the us other exchanges countries are similar this ex date is normally based on the dividends record date which is when you must be on the company 's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend and based on when trades for an exchange are settled the ex date is the first date for which trades on that date will not settle until after the record date this means that the ex date can be different for different exchanges if you sell your shares on an exchange before the ex date for that exchange you will not get the dividend if you sell your shares on or after the ex date for the exchange you do not get the dividend so it depends on the time zone of the exchange most stock exchanges trade t+3 but this can still come into play if there are bank holidays in different countries at different times

i think i have a better answer for this since i have been an investor in the stock markets since a decade and most of my money is either made through investing or trading the financial markets yes you can start investing with as low as 50 gbp or even less if you are talking about stocks there is no restriction on the amount of shares you can purchase the price of which can be as low as a penny i investing in stocks when i was 18 with the money saved from my pocket money which was not much but i made investments on a regular period no matter how less i could but i would make regular investments on a long term remember one thing never trade stock markets always invest in it on a long term the stock markets will give you the best return on a long term as shown on the graph below and will also save you money on commission the broker charge on every transaction the brokers to make money for themselves will ask you to trade stocks on short term but stock market were always made to invest on a long term as warren buffet rightly says and if you want to trade try commodities or forex forex brokers will offer you accounts with as low as 25 usd with no commissions the commission here are all inclusive in spreads   is this true can the average joe become involved yes anyone who wants has an interest in the financial markets can get involved knowledge is the key not money is it worth investing £ 50 here and there or is that a laughable idea 50 gbp is a lot i started with a few indian rupees if people laugh let them laugh only morons who do n't understand the true concept of financial markets laugh there are fees rules involved is it worth the effort if you just want to see the problem with today 's generation of people is that they fear a lot unless you crawl you do nt walk unless you try something you do nt learn the only difference between a successful person and a not successful person is his ability to try fail fall get back on feet again try he succeeds i know its not instant money but i 'd like to get a few shares here and there to follow the news and see how companies do i hear that bric russia india and china is a good share to invest in brazil india the good thing is share prices are relatively low even the commissions mostly roi return on investment on a long term would almost be the same can anyone share their experiences maybe best for community wiki always up for sharing please ask questions no matter how stupid they are i love people who ask for when i started i asked and people were generous enough to answer and so would i be

so some background here when corporations large ones have to deal with tax they generally try to avoid as much tax as possible since there are places that are tax havens where there is less to even no tax on profit a lot of money gets routed there to avoid taxes in other places us or other unfavorable countries the problem with this from an irs government view is that they keep losing millions billions of dollars in money because of this i think the corporate federal tax rate is around 35 and that is without state taxes        unfortunately when you have less and less money at home less investment at home happens corporations stop doing business at home because they have more money somewhere else and it makes sense to move more of the company to where the money is or to more favorable tax locations even worse the corporation might just save its money somewhere else and kill all reinvestment thus the money is effectively dead to the rest of the economy       there is a lot of talk about a one time repatriation tax to allow companies that have dodged their tax burdens to have their money come back to the us and thus can be used locally at 10 instead of 35 since there is a vast amount of cash that would be injected into the us economy the government is hoping this stimulation will help gdp grow taxes grow and help the economy as a whole in reality it will reward corporations that broke the law even though everyone does it and probably just go into savings accounts here in the us and not be the silver bullet to the economy on verge of collapse again

looks more like an idea for a business rather than an actual business especially since it has n't even launched that said it does have its merits what bank actually holds the deposit funds becomes irrelevant and may change from time to time as they forge better partnerships with different banks   think of it like a mutual fund the individual stocks if there are stocks in the fund are less important than the balance of risk vs. income and the leveling of change over the course of time it offers services banks offer without fees at least that is the proposal with the addition of capability as well it does have downsides as well there is an increased level of between you and your money they propose to simplify the banking business model but in fact are only hiding it from you   the same complexity that was there before is still there with the added complexity of their service on top of it   it 's just a matter of how much of that complexity you would have to deal with directly with that in mind i would reiterate that they are not a business yet just a proposed business model   even the sign up process is a red flag for me   i understand they need to gauge interest in order to forge initial relationships with various banks but i do n't see the need for the invitation only sign up method   it just sounds like a way to increase interest who does n't like feeling exclusively invited and is a bit too for my taste but like i said the idea has merit i have my reservations but will reserve full judgement until they are an actual operating business

volume weighted average price   in finance volume weighted average price vwap is the ratio of the value traded to total volume traded over a particular time horizon usually one day it is a measure of the average price at which a stock is traded over the trading horizon   vwap is often used as a trading benchmark by investors who aim to be as passive as possible in their execution many pension funds and some mutual funds fall into this category     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r finance about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

little pisses me off more than knowing i worked my ass off for shitty employers for decades to enrich lazy rich fuckers who have continuously turned the screws of oppression on me    they need to pay   why would additional tax breaks inspire an uber rich person to make legitimate investments in the greater economy if they already have so much cash they do n't do anything but inflate the stock market    stupid economics    when a person with needs has money they spend it on needs until their needs are met and bolster the economy    the majority with constant worry about money with no hope for relief in sight while get preferential treatment is mean and economics    does anyone really wonder why there is so much hatred violence suicide addiction

something to consider is how do you want to handle fractional shares most open end funds can easily go to fractional shares to that if you want to invest $ 500 in a fund each month it is a relatively easy transaction where some shares will be fractional and handled easily an etf may not always work that way unless you go through something like sharebuilder that would allow the fractional shares as if the etf is trading at $ you could buy 3 shares but still have $ 50 that you want to invest but ca n't as stocks trade in whole share numbers usually this is without adding brokerage commissions depending on the broker re investing dividends may or may not be that simple as fractional shares could be a problem since those 3 shares are n't likely to have enough of a dividend to equal another share being bought with the proceeds if you want the flexibility of stop and limit orders then the etf may make more sense while the open end fund is simply to invest whole dollar amounts that then lead to fractional shares do n't forget to factor in minimums and other stuff as vfiax may have a bit of a minimum to it as well as possible fees that could be annoying as i remember vfinx having some account maintenance fees that were a bit back in the day that may still be around in some cases so be sure to read the fine print on things

divided by hours worked or even effort for that matter ignores economies of scale   no not at all let 's go back to    when more units of a good or a service can be produced on a larger scale yet with on average less variable input costs   economies of scale are said to be achieved   the good produced in our comparison is salary   the variable input costs are hours worked the fixed costs are an annual time period ie it takes them both one year to produce their annual salary output regardless   we have two guys one is making 100k annually working 5 hours a week the other makes 500k working 80 hours per week   they both have a the same fixed costs of time period of a year    if we plot them both on a graph you 're correct the 500k salary output is a larger output but at much greater variable costs efficiency is lost by the guy working 80 hour weeks   the guy getting 100k for 5 hour weeks is optimizing his variable costs much more effectively   sure he could make more but would suffer diminishing returns on his output     dude above claims that you 're not successful unless you make 500k   i was just illustrating that success can be defined outside of straight compensation

while people will say i 'm going to sue you for all your worth that 's not how it really works when someone brings a lawsuit they are supposed to show how much harm you actually caused them the court then awards them an amount equal to whatever the judge or jury are convinced was the actual harm so in the case of a car accident if someone can convince the court that you caused the accident and that he had $ 100,000 in medical bills lost wages from work and/or whatever other expenses than the court will order you to pay $ 100,000 a court can add on compensation for pain and suffering and it can add punitive damages if you were reckless and irresponsible but that does n't change the point here if you 're a billionaire and this is less than you spend on lunch in a week good for you you pay it and you 're done if your only assets are the clothes you 're wearing and your iphone and you do n't have enough insurance to cover it then you will be in debt for a long long time saying sorry i do n't have that much money will not help your liability is not limited to what you can afford to pay many people say that in real life courts will order big companies that are responsible for an accident to pay more than it would order an ordinary person to pay because they figure that they can afford it i do n't know whether that 's true but even if the court goes easy on you because you 're poor you can still be ordered to pay a substantial amount of money if the amount is totally beyond what you have if the court orders you to pay $ 1 million and you make $ 10,000 a year than the other person ca n't expect to ever get all their money but you 'll be paying for the rest of your life

the 0.14 is coming out of the assets of the fund itself the expense ratio can be broken down so that on any given day a portion of the fund 's assets are set aside to cover the administrative cost of running the fund a fund 's total return already includes the expense ratio this depends a lot on what kind of account in which you hold the fund if you hold the fund in an ira then you would n't have taxes from the fund itself as the account is sheltered there may be notes in the prospectus and latest annual and semi annual report of what past distributions have been as remember the fund is n't paying taxes but rather passing that along in the form of distributions to shareholders also there is something to be said for what kinds of investments the fund holds as if the fund is to hold small cap stocks then it may have to sell the stock if it gets too big and thus would pass on the capital gains to shareholders other funds may not have this issue as they invest in large cap stocks that do n't have this problem some funds may invest in municipal bonds which would have tax exempt interest that may be another strategy for lowering taxes in bond funds depending on the fund quite a broad range actually in the case of the fidelity fund you link it is a fund of funds and thus has a 0 expense ratio as fidelity has underlying funds that that fund holds what level of active management are you expecting what economies of scale does the fund have to bring down the expense ratio and what expense ratio is typical for that category of fund would come to mind as a few things to consider that fidelity link is incorrect as both morningstar and fidelity 's site list an expense ratio for the fund of funds at i 'd expect an institutional us large cap index fund to have the lowest expense ratio outside of the fund of fund situation while if i were to pick an actively managed fund that requires a lot of research then the expense ratio may well be much higher though this is where you have to consider what strategy do you want the fund to be employing and how much of a cost are you prepared to accept for that is vanguard target retirement fund which has a expense ratio which is using index funds in the fund of funds system

i found the best way to do this was to make a spending plan at the beginning of the month with someone else if you 're married or in a relationship where you pool resources then this is a natural way to sync up on your expectations if you do n't have a relationship of that nature it 's still good to have a friend that you talk to about things you are planning on buying if i do n't allow myself to buy things on a whim if i have to take the time to justify my purchases to someone else then i have to first think about the purchase and justify it to myself often the actual process of thinking it through is enough for me to talk myself out of it consider the tactics of car salesmen each time you attempt to leave the lot to think about it overnight they sweeten the offer to try to get you to buy before leaving they know that if you leave the lot you are much less likely to decide that you must have that car you should have a policy of sleeping for one night before making any purchase over an arbitrary dollar amount say $ 250 or $ 500 or $ 1,000 having that rule and following it will save you a lot of buyers remorse as an aside i 've had my eye on a 35 mm prime lens for my camera for over a year now i was ready to pay ~$500 for a nice lens that was discounted by $ 100 and i was a little sad that i missed the discount however i am very deliberate in my shopping and i did n't want to buy until i read enough of the reviews to be certain about it it turns out that the lens has a fatal flaw for landscape photography that most reviewers did n't notice because they were using it for portrait photography i finally concluded that the lens i really wanted was an $ 800 lens i looked at resale prices on my $ 600 lens and they are in the $ 350 range so instead of missing out on a $ 100 discount i missed out on a $ 150 loss trading up to the lens that i really want for the long term

there is no unique identifier that exists to identify specific shares of a stock just like money in the bank there is no real reason to identify which exact dollar bills belong to me or you so long as there is a record that i own x bills and i can access them when i want of course unlike banks there is still a 1:1 relationship between the amount i should own and the amount they actually hold if i may reach a bit the question that i assume you are asking is how are shared actually tracked transferred and recorded so that i know for certain that i traded you 20 microsoft shares yesterday and they are now officially yours given that it 's all digital while you can technically try and request a physical share certificate it 's very cumbersome to handle and transfer in that form   ownership of shares themselves are tracked for brokerage firms in the case of retail trading which i assume is the context of this question as we 're discussion personal finance your broker has a record of how many shares of x y and z you own when you bought each share and for how much and while you are the beneficial owner of record you get dividends voting rights etc your brokerage is the one who is holding the shares when you buy or sell a stock and you are matched with a counterparty the process of which is beyond the scope of this question then a process of settlement comes into play in the us settlement takes 3 working days to process and technically ownership does not transfer until the 3rd day after the trade is made though things like margin accounts will allow you to effectively act as if you own the shares immediately after a buy sell order is filled settlement in the us is done by a sole source the depository trust clearing corporation this is where retail and institutional trade all go to be sorted checked and confirmed and ultimately returned to the safekeeping of their new owners representatives your brokerage interestingly the is also the central custodian for shares both physical and virtual and that is where the shares of stock ultimately reside

there can be the question of what objective do you have for buying the stock if you want an income stream then high yield stocks may be a way to get dividends without having additional transactions to sell shares while others may want capital appreciation and are willing to go without dividends to get this you do realize that both pfizer and are companies that the total stock value is over $ 100 billion yes thus neither is what i 'd see as a growth stock as these are giant companies that would require rather large sales to drive earnings growth though it may be interesting to see what kind of growth is expected for these companies in looking at current dividends one is paying 3 and the other 5 so i 'm not sure either would be what i 'd see as high yield reits would be more likely to have high dividends given their structure if you want something to research a bit more

to answer length validity and security implications of draft checks issued and negotiated within the united states i am heavily addressing the common erroneous assumptions of where the funds sit while they 're in a draft check and how to get them out tl;dr the existing answers are incomplete and in some ways dangerously misleading jerry can still be potentially defrauded by tom and even if the check is legitimately drawn and negotiable jerry may still experience delayed access to the funds the funds sit in an account held by the issuing bank as long as the bank has sufficient funds the check does however there are significantly more factors that go into whether a check will be returned unpaid bounce if i hand you $ 5000 in cash will you give me $ 5000 in cash probably and you 'd probably be pretty safe how about i give you a $ 5000 draft check will you give me $ 5000 in cash without doing anything except looking at it to verify the check i hope not cash america sure would n't but people sell expensive goods with the same as cash attitude remember the only non cash form of payment which can not somehow be held reversed or returned unpaid in the u.s. without consent of the receiving party is a payment order a.k.a wire transfer the draft check is as good as cash in the sense that the money for a draft check is withdrawn from your account before the check is negotiated deposited this does not mean that a draft check will not bounce so jerry is not as secure in handing the goods to tom as if tom had handed him cash as it is still a check jerry 's bank will not receive the funds for tom 's draft check for an average 3 to 5 business days same as a personal check jerry will probably have access to the first $ 5000 within two business days provided that he deposits the draft check in person at his bank 's branch or in a bank owned atm in the united states regulation cc governs funds availability regarding official draft or tellers checks if the customer desires next day availability of funds from these checks your bank may require use of a special deposit slip   mobile deposit availability in the u.s. is not regulated in this way and will likely be subject to a longer hold on more if not all of the check draft checks do n't as a habit bounce in the sense of returned for insufficient funds this is because they are prepaid and drawn upon a financial institution 's account banks are insolvent far less frequently than other businesses or individuals draft checks tellers checks official checks bank checks etc can however be returned unpaid if one of the following is true as an aside an institution is not obligated to honor a stale dated check but may do so at its discretion if you have a personal check outstanding for over 6 months it may still clear and potentially overdraw your account in this case contact your bank asap to process a reversal the depositing bank mis scans the check and the issuing bank refuses the resulting data i have seen systems mis read which data field is which or its contents also there is the possibility the image if the check will be to the issuing bank the draft check has been cancelled stop paid this can happen if   a the check was fraudulently bought from the issuing bank using tom 's account   b tom has completed an agreement that the check was lost or otherwise not used for its intended purpose without fraud having occurred against tom c the draft check is paid to the state as unclaimed property this case is a subset of case 1 but will lead to a different return reason stamped on the image replacement document of the check the draft check was never any good in the first place because of the perception that draft checks are as good as cash they 're not but are a lot better than personal checks forgery and attempted fraud is shockingly common these are n't actually underwritten by a real bank even if they appear to be the only money in them is what the fraudster can get out of you jerry did not properly endorse the check before presenting it for deposit or otherwise negotiating it in my time in banking i most commonly saw cases 3 and 4 unlike most counterfeit cash case 3 will fool jerry and jerry 's teller tom gets an immediate payout a car a wire transfer a payday loan etc and jerry 's bank does n't know the check is n't valid until they call the alleged issuing bank to verify its or in the case of smaller checks into lower risk accounts it is simply returned unpaid as fraudulently drawn to conclude call the alleged issuing bank 's verification line before handing over the goods always properly endorse your deposits and address what happens if one does not receive or collect on prompt payment in your contracts

definitely do n't borrow from your 401k.   if you quit or get laid off you have to repay the whole amount back immediately plus you are borrowing from your opportunity cost   the stock market should be good at least through the end of this year    as one of the commentators already stated have you calculated your net savings by reducing the interest rate   you will be paying closing costs and not all of these are deductible only the points are   when calculating the savings you have to ask yourself how long you will be hanging on the property   are you likely to be long term landlords or do you have any ideas on selling in the near future    you can reduce the cost and principal by throwing the equivalent of one to two extra mortgage payments a year to get the repayment period down significantly by years   in this way you are not married to a higher payment as you would be if you refinanced to a 15 year term    i would tend to go with a eat the appraisal cost not refinance and b throw extra money towards principal to get the term of the loan to be reduced

you probably have a ugma account while the money in that account belongs to you as long as you 're a minor which is until the age of 18 in california you can not directly access it instead your or or any other trustee manages that account for you with your best interests in mind while you may want to spend that money or give it away to your boyfriend or whoever else it is very likely not in your best interest to do that that is why your dad refuses he has a legal responsibility which is called fiduciary duty to ensure the money is spent in a way that is best for you if the fiduciary just lets you spend the money away you could later when you 're no longer a minor sue that person for the breach of trust when you 're older and a bit more mature you 'll be able to make your own decisions and do whatever you want with that money but as long as your parents have the responsibility to act in your best interests it is likely that your boyfriend will stay in pennsylvania for a while

you need to be clear about who gets your money if you pay the existing owner $ 25 k and s)he gives you half the business then you now own half of a $ 50 k business an the original owner has an extra $ 25 k in spending cash   the value of the business has not changed if you contribute $ 25 to the company new equity shares are created   shares should be priced correctly meaning you now own $ 25 k worth of shares in a company worth $ 75k so you should have 1/3 of the outstanding shares counting both old and new shares   if you get more or less than this then the transaction has happened in an unfair way if this is a public company that would most likely be illegal and the sec may throw you in jail   if it was a private company and your friend created enough shares that you own half the company then s)he has given you a gift if you are contributing to the company at a fair price you would need to contribute $ 50 k in order to end up with half the equity of the new and now more valuable firm in that case the firm would be worth $ 100 k after your contribution bottom line this is a common and not complex transaction and should end up with a completely fair outcome   any unfair situation you can imagine is probably based on false assumptions or a situation where a non arms length transaction is transferring wealth contrary to normal rules and procedures

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

when you say promptly paying off the outstanding balance do you mean you pay it off literally as soon as you have incurred the debt it is important to actually let the debt post on a statement before you pay it off if you pay it off before the statement posts then this wo n't help your credit at all once the statement posts you can pay the entire balance off before the due date and you will still pay no interest assuming you are allowing the balance to actually post on your statements you can simply continue to do this and your credit score will improve over time as your account(s get older and you show that you are reliable the only other way to improve your credit score is to open more accounts in the short term this will actually hurt your score as it will decrease your average age of account and add an inquiry however in the mid long term this will improve your score as having more accounts of a variety of types is better for your score having an installment loan such as an auto loan or home loan is good for your score as it is different from a credit card however you should definitely not engage in one of these unless it makes financial sense for other reasons do n't add debt just to build your credit score you could just open more credit cards like i said it will hurt your score in the short term but improve it in the mid long term open cards with a variety of benefits so you can use them for different things to get better rewards

yes he can retract the offer it was a cash only offer and if you 're financing it 's no longer cash unless of course you get the financing through your local bank credit union and they hand you a check like on a personal loan then it 's still cash however the salesman can still retract the offer unless it 's in writing because you have n't signed anything yet the price of financing will always be higher because the dealer does n't get all their money today also if you finance you are not paying just the cost of the vehicle you are paying interest so your final cost will be higher unless you were one of the lucky souls who got 0 financing employee pricing and therefore are actually saving money by having a payment

to be honest i do n't know how any of this work in the us so my answer will be of very limited value to yourself i suspect but when it comes to the uk if you 're going to get the same pay gross either way than being independent makes very little sense   running your own business is hassle is generally more risky although possibly not in your case and costs money some of the most obvious costs are the added ni probably the need for an accountant at around £ 1200 p a for basic accountancy service you are obliged by law to have liability insurance and you probably want professional indemnity insurance this will be around £ 600 p a and so on and so forth   on top of that anyway as a contractor you really should n't be getting any benefits from the client and so health insurance company car even parking are all meant to be arranged by and paid by your company and ca n't or rather should n't be charged to the client so i would say if you 're seriously thinking about setting up a consultancy company and this client is first of many set up a company but take into account the sums you need to earn if you 're really thinking about employment be an employee

if you are trading cfds which are usually traded on margin you will usually be charged an overnight financing fee for long positions held overnight and you will receive an overnight financing credit for short positions held overnight most cfd brokers will have their overnight financing rates set at + or 2.5 or 3 from the country 's official interest rates so if your country 's official interest rate is 5 and your broker uses + or 2.5 you will get a 2.5 credit for any short positions held overnight and pay 7.5 fee for any long positions held overnight in australia the official interest rate is 2.5 so i get 0 for short positions and pay 5 for long positions held overnight if you are looking to hold positions open long term especially long positions you might think twice before using cfds to trade as you may end up paying quite a bit in interest over a long period of time these financing fees are charged because you are borrowing the funds to open your positions if you buy shares directly you would not be charged such overnight financing fees

invest because you are young and have lots of time i recommend opening an investment account and putting most 1000 £ or all in something like an s&p 500 index fund or etf start building   your savings now because compound growth over time will build significant wealth you can still invest the other in something a bit less volatile if you think you 'll need the money in < 5 years if you expect your income to continue to grow and you expect to have extra cash every month for the foreseeable future i 'd just put it all in an index fund you can weather any temporary market swings and in the worst case scenario you can always sell a few shares if you need the cash the advantage of an index fund is that it has very low fees and it 's an invest and forget approach you do n't have to watch the market every day because your money will simply match the market and in the long term the market does much better than most managed funds or etfs

i would encourage you to read the warren buffett way   its a short read and available from most libraries as an audio book   it should address most of the ignorance that your post displays    short term prices offered in the market do not necessarily reflect the future value of a company   in the short term the market is a popularity contest in the long run prices increases based on the performance of the company   how much free cash flow and related metrics does the company generate   you seem way overly concerned with short term price fluctuations and as such you are more speculating expecting a 10 in 2 3 years is unrealistic   has it happened sure but it is a rare thing   most would be happy to have a 2 in that time frame if i was in your shoes i 'd buy the stock and watch it   provided management meet my expectations and made good business decisions i would hold it and add to my position as i was able and the market was willing to sell me the company at a good price    it is good to look at index funds as a diversification    assuming everything goes perfectly in 2 3 years you would have an extra 1 k dollars   big deal   how much money could you earn during that time period   simply by working at a fairly humble job you should be able to earn between 60 k and 90 k during that time   if you stuck 10 of that income into a savings account you would be far better off 6 k to 9 k then if this stock actually does double   hopefully that gets you thinking staring out is about earning and saving investing   start building funds that can compound   very early on the rate of return provided it is not negative is very unimportant   the key is to get money to compound
# 532139
the upvoted answers fail to note that dividends are the only benefit that investors collectively receive from the companies they invest in if you purchase a share for $ 100 and then later sell it for $ 150 you should note that there is always someone that purchases the same share for $ 150 so you get $ 150 immediately but somebody else has to pay $ 150 immediately so investors collectively did not receive any money from the transaction yes share repurchase can be used instead of dividends but it can be considered really another form of paying dividends the fair value of a stock is the discounted value of all future dividends the stock pays it is so simple this shows why dividends are important somebody might argue that many successful companies like berkshire hathaway do not pay dividend yes it is true that they do n't pay dividend now but they will eventually have to start paying dividend if they reinvest potential dividends continuously they will run out of things to invest in after several hundred years has passed so even in this case the value of the stock is still the discounted value of all future dividends the only difference is that the dividends are not paid now the companies will start to pay the dividends later when they run out of things to invest in it is true that in theory a stock could pay an unsustainable amount of dividend that requires financing it with debt this is obviously not a good solution if you see a company that pays dividend while at the same time obtaining more cash from taking more debt or from share issues think twice whether you want to invest in such a company what you need to do to companies fairly is to estimate the amount of dividend that can sustain the expected growth rate it is typically about 60 of the earnings because a part of the earnings needs to be invested in future growth but the exact figure may vary depending on the company furthermore to a company you need the expected growth rate of dividends and the discount rate you simply discount all future dividends correcting them up by the expected dividend growth rate and correcting them down by the discount rate

an emergency fund is about managing risk what would you do if your furnace water heater and cars all broke down at the same time being in michigan i can imagine that you would n't want to take cold showers heat the entire house by wood fire and walk to work every day so how do you manage this risk what would happen if you lost your job and could n't find one for a few months by only having $ 5k in the bank in an emergency fund you are putting your family at risk if these sorts of things happened you would be in trouble you would have to borrow money either hurting equity in the home that you have worked hard to build up or by some other means you and your spouse should sit down and decide what a good emergency fund looks like for your family a reserve of 3 6 months of expenses is a good emergency fund this could cover your family in the event of a lost job while you look for a new one it would also cover you when murphy strikes and things break down all at the same time once you and your spouse have determined how much you want to set aside you two must determine how you will get there maybe you put in some extra hours at work maybe you lower the retirement contributions temporarily maybe you try to pay off the car as quickly as possible then put what you were paying on the car into the emergency fund it will likely take a mix of things to get you there you do n't have to get it done in a day a month or even a year but once you have that emergency fund fully funded you will feel better what may be a catastrophe now will be a minor annoyance with a fully funded emergency fund finally i 'd recommend going to your bank and setting up a separate account for this emergency fund a separate account specifically labeled as your emergency fund this way you will think twice before spending it on a non emergency

while you would reduce risk by diversifying into other stock etfs across the world developed market returns and emerging markets to a lesser extent are generally highly correlated with another correlation of 0.90 this implies that they all go up in bull markets and go down together in bear markets you are better off diversifying into other asset classes given your risk tolerance such as government bonds as you have mentioned alternatively you can target a portfolio owning all of the assets in the universe assuming you 're trading in frankfurt a combination of something similar to and but with higher volumes and/or lower fees a good starting resource would be the bogleheads wiki

wow wow   they grew the fed balance sheet from 800 billion to 4.5 trillion by buying up every bad debt and funny money contract that the banking sector had fraudulently entered into spite of the fact that every economist in the world told them that socializing the debt was bullshit .they gave their banker trillions of dollars of tax payer money money never entered the real economy and remain tied up between the fed and the banks .the real economy never grew inflation never picked up and the wage and income gap grew and the banks got richer and everybody got poorer and now they are going to unwind us 4.5 trillion the fuck that means nobody is buying those toxic assets because they have no value then and not now   if the banks buy it back they are right back where they started with 4.5 trillion of bad debt    so all it could mean is they are going to write it off as a loss and that would mean they have been lying to the american public about what great profits and have mean while transferred us 4.5 trillion free money at tax payer expense to the banks

never thought about the difference in goals between manufacturers and local businesses   ultimately they have the same goals sale of product services   but they have a hugely different emphasis   john deere wants you to buy john deere brand products and they really do n't care where you buy it   walmart target generally do n't really give a crap what brand you buy so long as you buy it from walmart target   so john deere 's advertising is all about convincing you to only be interested in buying a john deere from where ever   and the retailer aka local business whether a chain or independent advertising is all about getting you to come back to their store to buy well whatever which can be specific or anything and everything they sell   those things can coincide when there is some exclusive relationship so the local john deere dealer is interested in promoting the john deere brand but really only to the extent that you buy a john deere from them and not from some other dealer store   and likewise the local buick dealer wants you to buy a buick but chiefly so that you will buy one from them and/or so that you will come to them to buy parts service which most dealers actually tend to make more money on than they do from the sale of the car itself     your knowledge about the facebook ad model might be able to help me with a personal project i 'm doing    i do n't know that it i would call it knowledge about the facebook ad model it 's more general knowledge about how the advertising marketing world and speculation with back of the napkin style calculations regarding about how far away from reality facebook 's supposed super specific targeting actually is     gt;if you care to take a whack at it read on what interested me before the ipo was the debate about the value of fb 's ad model   this is was kind of my whole point though i 'm coming from a different tack than you my view is that regardless of how effective ineffective fb 's ads prove to be   1 there is only so much commerce in the world granted it can grow but it does so on an incremental basis in real money terms   2 only a certain percentage of it is going to be spent on advertising   3 a lot of that probably 50 or more is local advertising marketing done not by the big players but by smaller more local operations   4 there is no way that facebook will capture anywhere near even 50 of even the big player advertising marketing money competing against all other types of media yeah not gon na happen and they are n't even trying to get any of the local money   5 as a result of the above there is no way for facebook to achieve the revenues much less the profit margins to support anything anywhere near the valuation it at   6 ergo the price of the stock will continue to drop especially as insiders amp previous investors cash in by selling additional stock into the float until it reaches a price that can be supported by a reasonable p e say in the 10 to 20 range that is based on actual achievable revenues which i do n't see any way for the final value of fb to be anything over $ 10 a share more likely the will end up in the $ 4 to $ 5 range and possibly even lower especially if they continue to things as they have recently ultimately especially if they dilute the shares as they seem likely to it will probably end up as a $ 1 to $ 2 stock   as to your questions i think we 're barking up different trees your approach sounds interesting but i would n't have any idea where you could get hard data on any of that at best you i think whatever data you can lay hands on is going to be a lot of highly dubious and speculative bs in no small part because i do n't think anyone really has any harder data maybe gm does and that is why they dropped their use of the stuff

it depends on what your plans for the future are taking out a loan is not a bad thing if it is at a good rate and under good terms and you are sure you can handle the payments if you buy the car with cash you may be giving up the opportunity to later get a great rate on that $ 8k however you are probably not utilizing that $ 20k to make as much interest as you 'd then be paying if you did take the $ 8k on loan since you say house fund i assume you are saving to make a down payment on a new house if you plan to buy that house within the next 6 months the hard pulls on your credit report from applying for the car loan will probably ding your credit score for the next 6 months which might cost you on your mortgage rate however if you do n't plan to buy for a few more years and if you 've never had a car payment before then the auto loan would actually be adding diversity to your credit history and in the long run would help your score another factor to consider is the loan to value ratio you are shooting for ltv affects the interest rate requirements for private mortgage insurance etc mortgage rates are at an all time low and lower than auto rates so depending on the terms of the house purchase that $ 8k might be better spent on the car than the house in short if you want to buy the house soon rates are market is a buyer 's market and you need that $ 8k to get a better mortgage rate or prevent you from being required to buy pmi you should probably put it toward the house otherwise you should probably put it toward the car last piece of advice if you absolutely must buy a house and a car in the same short time frame do them both on the same day so that your credit score is not dinged before applying for one or the other with mortgages this may be difficult considering the longer closing procedures but try to time it so that your credit is getting checked by the mortgage broker and the auto lender on the same day

when your options vest you will have the option to buy your company 's stock at a particular price the strike price a big part of the value of the option is the difference between the price that your company 's stock is trading at and the strike price of the option if the price of the company stock in the market is lower than the strike price of the option they are almost worthless   i say almost because there is still the possibility that the stock price could go up before the options expire if your company is big enough that their stock is not only listed on an exchange but there is an active options market in your company 's stock you could get a feel for what they are worth by seeing what the market is willing to buy or sell similar exchange listed options once the options have vested you now have the right to purchase your company 's stock at the specified strike price until the options expire   when you use that right you are exercising the option   you do n't have to do that until you think it is worthwhile buying company stock at that price if the company pays a dividend it would probably be worth exercising the options sooner options do n't receive a dividend   ultimately you are buying your company 's stock albeit at a discount   you need to see if your company 's stock is still a good investment if you think your company has growth prospects you might want to hold onto the stock   if you think you 'd be better off putting your money elsewhere in the market sell the stock you acquired at a discount and use the money to invest in something else if there are any additional benefits to holding on to the stock for a period of time e.g. selling part to fit within your capital gain allowance for that year you should factor that into your investment decision but it should n't force you to invest in or remain invested in something you would otherwise view as too risky to invest in a reminder of that fact is that some employees of enron invested their entire retirement plans into enron stock so when enron went bankrupt these employees not only lost their job but their savings for retirement as well

a stock bond or etf is basically a commodity where you bought it does not really matter and it has a value in usd only as there is a current market price quoted at an american exchange but nothing prevents you from turning around and selling it on a european exchange where it is also listed for an equivalent amount of eur arbitrage activities of investment banks ensure that the price will be equivalent in regard to the current exchange rate in fact this can be used as a cheap form of currency conversion for blue chips at least this is trivial exotic securities might not be listed in europe all you need is a broker who allows you to trade on european exchanges and hold an account denominated in eur if necessary transfer your securities to a broker who does which should not cost more than a nominal fee mutual funds are a different beast though it might be possible to sell shares on an exchange anyway or sell them back to the issuer for eur it depends in any case however transferring 7 figure sums internationally can trigger all kinds of tax events and money laundering investigations you really need to hire a financial advisor who has international investment experience for this kind of thing not ask a web forum

there are two questions financial institutions do not care about your nationality only your ability to pay over time for long term debt the lender will want assurances that the borrower has the ability and means to pay the debt over time a legal resident in the us should have no more difficulty obtaining financing than a citizen under similar life circumstances the lender is also under legal obligation to confirm that the borrower is who they say they are will have the ability to pay over time and have no malicious intent in the purchase persons who do not have legal status in the us and who do not have the means to pay for property outright will have difficulty obtaining financing as they will have trouble establishing the requirements of the lender this is simple math a lender will be reluctant to lend to any person who is more likely to have difficulty paying the obligation than another in your case your father would be an unlikely candidate for a mortgage because he can not establish his legal status nor can he guarantee that he will have the legal right to earn a means to pay the loan back this puts the lender at risk both of losing the money lent and losing the right to repossess the property if the borrower does n't pay   despite all of the obstacles i have indicated above it is still possible for your father to purchase property legally but the risk and the cost go way up for him as a borrower there may be sellers willing to finance property over time but your father 's status puts him at a disadvantage if the seller is not honest   there may be community which can help you work through the challenges of property ownership please see these related articles

it 's a tough question because there is society and individual to consider and the society 's effects on the individual   currently employers do n't have to provide insurance they do it to compete in the employee marketplace employers have an advantage over employees in that regard because they can procure insurance at a lower cost that employees can and they get tax breaks for doing so employers providing health insurance get a more stable relationship with their employees because employees always hold great value in having an employee who provides good benefits   the company i work for provides good benefits but suppose tomorrow they told me hey we 're not providing benefits anymore but we 'll bump your salary to what your benefits are worth plus enough to compensate for the tax break we get so now everything is equal to what it was before but i have to go out and find my own insurance which is a hassle but presumably because of the ppaca i can get a good value and carry this insurance with me wherever i go and never have to mess with changing every time i change jobs   but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up and they 've essentially pocketed the difference or passed it on to their customers now people have less money to buy health insurance and those near the bottom will now have to rely on the government to assist with providing health insurance   this is the way it works now with the minimum wage a recent report found that walmart employees rely on welfare to the tune of $ billion a fuels inequality epidemic taking advantage of our safety net while the company makes $ 15 billion in profit so 18 of walmart 's profits are an indirect subsidy from the us taxpayer which comes to about $ 48 per us citizen or about $ a year for the top 50 of wage earners   even so i think i 'd prefer to get my whole compensation package in one shot all else being equal that last part is important though i would need to get all the breaks my employer gets for providing myself with health insurance

are you serious   i used to get the occasional cold call at the last place i worked at   you can just smell them and i got them off the phone asap   i think cold calls are incredibly fucking rude and i hate people who make them   my advice is to find another way to make sales   if you are an intrusive asshole who wastes my time you will get absolutely nothing from me   and i am not the only one who feels that way    a cold call is like going up to a complete stranger them in the face and then asking them to buy something from you   it just does n't work very well

you expect interest because you forgo the opportunity of using the money as well as the risk of losing the money if the borrower can not pay you back   this is true also with gold you would expect interest if you loaned someone your gold for a time period when you deposit your money in the bank you are loaning your money to the bank who then loans the money to others   this is how the bank is able to pay interest on your accounts

if your money market funds are short term savings or an emergency fund you might consider   moving them into an online saving account   you can get interest rates close to 1 often above 1 in higher rate climates and your savings are completely safe and easily accessible   online banks also frequently offer perks such as direct deposit linking with your checking account and discounts on other services you might need occasionally i.e. money orders or certified checks    if your money market funds are the lowest risk part of your diversified long term portfolio you should consider how low risk it needs to be   money market accounts are now typically fdic insured they did n't used to be but you can get the same security at a higher interest rate with laddered cd 's or u.s. savings bonds if your horizon is compatible if you want liquidity or greater return than a cd will give you then a bond fund or etf may be the right choice and it will tend to move counter to your stock investments balancing your portfolio    it 's true that interest rates will likely rise in the future which will tend to decrease the value of bond investments   if you buy and hold a single u.s. savings bond its interest payments and final payoff are set at purchase so you wo n't actually lose money but you might make less than you would if you invested in a higher rate climate   another way to deal with this if you want to add a bond fund to your long term investment portfolio is to invest your money slowly over time dollar cost averaging so that you do n't pay a high price for a large number of shares that immediately drop in value

economic efficiency is overrated i would rather give money to a charity that spent 15 on human resources and 10 on marketing to get $ 10 million in incoming donations than to a charity with an 8 expense rate that receives $ 1 million in incoming donations

losing the manufacturing jobs is a necessary evil of any developed nation yes germany is an exception but that is only because they specialise in expensive high quality items this transition has happened before in every developed nation when manufacturing replaced agriculture as the main sector of income and the same is happening again   the key is that we have to adapt and accept that rather than fight it fighting this transition will simply slow progress people simply have to retrain and adapt to a knew skill set yes it is n't easy but trying to artificially stop low paid jobs moving to places with a cheaper labour force is impossible companies have to remain globally competitive    i appreciate if everyone globally gets paid a descent salary this would n't be an issue however this is not the case and will not be any time soon the reality is manufacturing of non luxury goods will hardly exist in   developed nations and will be solely down by the likes of china and india however give it another 20 years china will be in exactly the same boat losing their manufacturing jobs to a less developed nations or maybe robots by then

i never understood why anyone would overdraft their checking account until a conversation with a bank teller recently who told me that most young folks these days do n't bother to balance their anymore or to even bother with a checkbook at all they just check their available balance to see how much is in their checking account totally ignoring any checks or other charges that may have been made against their account but have not yet been debited         it 's hard to believe that young people can be that stupid but apparently some are

if you want to close the card close it   the impact on your credit score will be minimal if any and the impact on your life will likely be even less   first as you noted the history from your card does not disappear when you close the card it will stay on your credit report for as long as 10 years by that time you 'll have many years of on time payments from your other cards and the loss of this one card wo n't be significant   because the card has a low credit limit it wo n't have much effect on your credit utilization numbers either   finally your credit score might just be high enough that a small drop will have no impact on your financial life whatsoever   in my opinion hanging onto a credit card you do n't want just to try to attain some type of high score is pointless close the card

their analysts are actually pretty bright remember they downgraded facebook before the ipo however it does n't stop the sheep from buying the stock it 's just like those subprime mortgages that pretty much said this is crap all over the prospectus and people still brought it

i was in a similar situation about a year ago and the thing to do would be to remove your grandfather from the title   he would probably have to agree with this but i think he will if you approach it correctly in my case i was the cosigner for my son 's car loan and was told by the dealer that i had to be on the title   this is not true as far as virginia is concerned illinois may be different   i know this because when my son dropped his auto insurance i got the fine for having an uninsured vehicle and was told during the hearing that the dealer was mistaken it all worked out in the end but all we had to do was go down to the dmv and get my name taken off of the title i 'm sure if you approach it this way you do not want him to be responsible for things that you do who would get sued if you caused an accident he would agree to have his name removed from the title

nobody owes anyone else a living or preservation of a business model   creative wiki is good for progress   note that it is already the case that physical retailers charge less online for picking up the exact same item in the same store   for example walmart will sell you an ipod touch for $ for same day pickup but if you walked into the store and bought it from the shelves they charge $ 199   i do n't use amazon because i 'm probably one of the only honest californians and do n't want the hassle of working out use taxes   if amazon did collect sales tax i would consider them   the correct solution is of course to get rid of sales tax everywhere as it imposes a huge burden to collect and is wiki

in india the short is what is called in other markets call as naked short i think i got the right term it means that you can only short sell intra day and by the end of the day you have to buy back the shares at whatever price if you do n't the exchange will do it by force the next day in other markets the intra day shorts are not allowed and one can short for several days by borrowing shares from someone else arranged by broker india has a futures market so you can sell buy something today with the execution date of one month this is typically a fixed day of the month i think last thursday

1 low interest rate is n't the inflation rate currently and over the last couple of years also really low around 2 if you 're saying the inflation rate is going to go back up i 'm curious as to your reasoning i do n't see any general decrease in the money supply in the near future wages are stagnant and gdp looks like it 's along at standard rates however with the gini coefficient still rising more and more of that production is finding its way into fewer and fewer hands that do n't have a lot of incentive to re invest it

you said use a credit card to get my 3 cash back to withdraw cash then you said is there any way to do this without paying a cash advance fee or any fees in general right there you have stated the   withdrawing cash using a credit card is a cash advance   you may or may not be charged a fee for doing the cash advance but no credit card will offer you cash back on a cash advance so you ca n't earn your 3 by using cash advances as others have mentioned you can sometimes get close by using the card to purchase things that are almost like cash such as gift cards   but you have to make a purchase

yeah you could literally just set up a fixed amount of states set up a simple ar model based on normal components find the optimal parameters for the state spaces and the ar model and you 're done or you could set up a var model with student 's t components instead which makes it more complicated by a couple of magnitudes with student 's t components the regression is structurally complicated so i 've found i need to apply or is it or i have no damn idea lmao instead to be able to sample properly i might not be very bright but i would n't say that 's basic math also the regression for state spaces is a bit more complicated as well   it 'd be like me saying that exotic derivatives is literally just solving 's with simple numerical methods it 's a little bit more work to it
