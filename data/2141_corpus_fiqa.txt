in the usa you probably owe self employment tax the cutoff for tax on this is you will need to file a tax return and cover the medicaid expenses as if you were both the employer and employee   in addition if he earns income from self employment he may owe self employment tax which means paying both the employee ’s and employer 's share of social security and medicaid taxes the trigger for self employment tax has been $ 400 since 1990 but the irs may change that in the future also see the irs website   so yes you need to file your taxes how much you will pay is determined by exactly how much your income is   if you do n't file you probably wo n't be audited however you are breaking the law and should be aware of the consequences

if you receive a 1099-misc from youtube that tells you what they stated to the irs and leads into most tax preparation software guided interviews or wizards as a topic for you to enter   whether or not you have a 1099-misc this discussion from the irs is pertinent to your question you could probably elect to report the income as a royalty on your copyrighted work of art on schedule e but see this note in most cases you report royalties in part i of schedule e form 1040 however if you are in business as a self employed writer inventor artist etc report your income and expenses on schedule c or schedule c ez form 1040 whether reporting on schedule e or c is more correct or better for your specific circumstances is beyond the advice you should take from strangers on the internet based on a general question however know that there are potentially several paths for you    note that this is revenue from a business so if you paid for equipment or services that are 100 dedicated to your pc upgraded broadband video editing software vehicle miles to a shoot props etc then these are a combination of depreciable capital investments and expenses you can report against the income reducing the taxes you may owe   if the equipment services are used for business and personal use there are further guidelines from the irs as to estimating the split these apply whether you report on sch e sch c or sch c ez     quote self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer fees received for babysitting and lawn cutting are all examples of taxable income even if each client paid less than $ 600 for the year someone who repairs computers in his or her spare time needs to report all monies earned as self employment income even if no one person paid more than $ 600 for repairs

tl;dr because eventually the cc issuer will pass the fraud bill to the customer in the form of increased fees and/or taxes even with no liability in the case of fraud the customer should put effort into security measures with their card the expense from fraud may be the sole burden of the credit issuer bank as per ben miller 's answer but this expense will someday find its way into the customer 's pockets disclosure i work at a bank a banks best ability probably is risk management the ones that were bad at this probably went under in the last four decades with regulations such as sox and others it is impossible for a bank to neglect risk management every expense including operational losses a bank incurs will reflect in increased fees interest rates for the customers so in the case of a sharp raise of credit card fraud the banks will soon take measures to reduce these losses that may mean canceling the cards of high risk groups of customers increasing fees or interest a particular customer that is often the target of fraud way more than the average for that customer 's demographic will probably see his card not renewed or even cancelled or his limits decreased and/or rates fees going up

if the person has prepared put your affairs in order then they will have a will and an executor and this executor will have a list of the life insurance policies and will contact the companies to arrange payouts to the beneficiaries it 's not really the beneficiary 's job to do that if the person has n't made a list of their policies but has a will and an executor then the executor can try things like looking at recently paid bills you 're sending $ 100 a month to friendly life insurance company bet it 's a life insurance policy or paperwork that is in the person 's home or their safety deposit boxes even if you do n't have the key to those boxes a copy of the will and the death certificate will get the box drilled out for you if you do n't know what bank they might have sd boxes at again your paperwork will get the manager to find out for you if there is a box at that particular branch so a day spent visiting branches can be fruitful something i know from personal experience with someone whose affairs were nowhere near in order generally you find out you 're a beneficiary of a will because the executor tells you i suppose it 's possible that a person might name you beneficiary of their life insurance without telling you or anyone else and without writing a will but it 's pretty unlikely if you 're worried i suggest you encourage your parents grandparents and other likely of you to write up some paperwork and keep it somewhere family is likely to find it not hidden inside a book on a or in the back of the wool

if you enter a futures contract it costs nothing   so every time prices move against you there is a margin call and you must put up some new money inverse etf 's use a variety of similar strategies to get their returns   many of these strategies may indeed require a margin call to the etf issuer if prices move against you   but remember the etf did not cost nothing   investors contributed money in order to purchase each share of the etf   therefore the etf issuer has a big pot of money available for use as margin   that 's why the margin call never comes through to you in a sense you posted a ton of margin up front so you wo n't have to make any additional margin contributions   the money that will be used for margin calls is being kept in treasuries and money market securities by the etf issuer until it 's needed if prices move against you badly enough that it looks like the etf is at risk to not be able to post margin the etf would liquidate and you 'd get whatever pittance was left after they exit all those positions

you do n't have to use an agent broker as you call it but it is strongly advised in some counties lawyers are required in some not check your local requirements similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and of money you will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service i 'm guessing here but it makes sense to me you will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company and it might be hard without an agent agents required by law to know all the details of the process and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into they have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports they know what to demand from the seller disclosures information etc they know how and from where to get the hoa docs and disclosures and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information comparable sales comparable listings list vs sales statistics etc it is hard to do all that alone but if you do you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5 the agents fees are up to 5 mostly i bought several properties in california and in other states and i would n't do it without an agent on my side but if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title mortgage insurance or resale then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent and there are people doing that

your basic point is correct the savvy move is to use insurance only to cover losses that would be painful or catastrophic for you otherwise self insure in the specific example of car insurance you may be missing that it does n't only cover replacement of the car it also covers liability which is a hundreds of thousands of dollars risk the liability coverage may well be legally required it may also be required as a base layer if you want to get a separate umbrella policy up to millions in liability so you have to be very rich before this insurance stops making sense in the us at least you can certainly buy car insurance that does n't cover loss of the car or that has a high deductible and in fact if you can afford to self insure up to a high deductible on average as you say that should be a good idea same is true of most kinds of insurance a high deductible is best as long as you can afford it unless you know you 'll probably file a claim health insurance in particular is weird in many ways and one is that you often can estimate whether you 'll have claims on our auto policy the liability and uninsured coverage is about 60 of the cost while damage to the car coverage is 40 i 'm sure this varies a lot depending on the value of your cars and how much you drive and driving record etc on an aging car the coverage for the car itself should get cheaper and cheaper since the car is worth less while liability coverage would not necessarily get cheaper

yes you as the giver will owe us gift taxes if you give her that sum directly you can reduce it by taking advantage of the threshold being by person so for example if you and your wife each gave your daughter $ 17k you 'd individually be under the threshold and would n't owe gift tax even if the money comes from and goes to the same account given the time of year you could give her that now and another $ in january next tax year and avoid the gift tax if she does n't need all the money immediately that 's the simplest solution if she does need it all now and you do n't want to try arranging to   launder the money through relatives gift allowances which i think would be legal and legitimate actually the other solution is to set this up as an intra family loan web searching that phrase will find details but it essentially lets you spread the gift over multiple accounting years and pay income tax on a minimal amount of interest can be under 0.3 which you 'd also gift her with rather than paying gift tax it does require some paperwork to document and track it properly but it is n't bad i did this when making a large bridge loan to help a relative buy their new house before the old one had sold in that case it really was a loan though i 'm being paid back out of the proceeds from the sale

this is also true part of the strategy was to no longer battle for better prices than ups with large retailers ups and fedex end up undercutting each other so much that they lose money on large accounts ups is so much bigger that they can manage that better fedex is much smaller so it does n't make sense to battle on price also see my comment below about shifting it costs they moved it to fedex services bill the other fedex companies for it services and then operate fedex services at loss there is a lot of money moving around in big corporations like this to avoid taxes

not illegal with respect to littleadv response the printing of a check is n't illegal i can order checks from cheap check printers and they have no relationship to any bank so long as they have my routing number and checking account number they print   years ago 25 + i wrote my account details on a shirt in protest to owing the irs money and my bank cashed it they charged a penalty of some nominal amount $ 20 or so for non standard check format or something like that but in fact stupid young person rants aside you may write a check out by hand on a piece of paper and it should clear the missing factor is the magnetic ink but i often see a regular check with a strip to the bottom when the mag strip fails proving that bad ink will not prevent a check from clearing   so long as the person trying to send you the funds is n't going to dispute the transaction and the check is made out to you so i suppose they could n't even do that this process should be simple i see little to no risk so long as the image is n't intercepted along the way

the penny pilot program has a dramatic effect on increasing options liquidity bids can be posted at .01 penny increments instead of .05 increments a lot of money is lost dealing with .05 increments issues are added to the penny pilot program based on existing liquidity in both the stock and the options market but the utility of the penny pilot program outweighs the discretionary liquidity judgement that the cboe makes to list issues in that program the reason the cboe does n't list all stocks in the penny pilot program is because they believe that their data vendors can not handle all of the market data but they have been saying this since 2006 and storage and bandwidth technology has greatly improved since then

rules of thumb sure put down 20 to pay no pmi   the mortgage payment including property tax should be no more than 28 of your gross monthly income   these two rules will certainly put a cap on the home price if you have more than the 20 to put down on the house you like stop right here do n't put more down and do n't buy a bigger house set that money aside for long term investing i.e. retirement savings or your emergency fund you can always make extra payments and shorten the length of the mortgage you just ca n't easily get it back   in my opinion one is better off getting a home that 's too small and paying the transaction costs to 5 10 years later than to buy too big and pay all the costs associated with the home for the time you are living there the mortgage property tax maintenance etc the too big house can really take it toll on your wallet

following up on 's answer if you can find a less expensive loan you can refinance the car and reduce the total interest you pay that way or if your loan permits it not all do talk to the bank which holds the loan read the paperwork you did n't look at you may be able to make additional payments to reduce the principal of the loan which will reduce the amount and duration of the loan and could significantly reduce the total interest paid at the cost of requiring you pay more each month or pay an additional sum up front returning the car is not an option a new car loses a large portion of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer 's lot and it ceases to be a new car you ca n't return it you can sell it as a recent model used car but you will lose money on the deal so even if you use that to pay down the loan you will still owe the bank money given the pain involved that way you might as well keep the car and just try to refinance or pay it off next time read and understand all the paperwork before signing   if you had decided this was a mistake within 3 days of buying you might have been able to take advantage of cooling down period laws to cancel the contract if such laws exist in your area a month later is much too late

question 1 who do i report such fraud to walmart or their card processor they may be in their right to require the original purchaser to do the report generally credit card and debit card fraud must be reported to the bank within 60 days of the statement for them to take responsibility i do n't see why gift cards would be different you can also report it to the police but i believe you 'll be asked to file a report in the jurisdiction where the card was used again time is of the essence and there 's nothing much they could do with your report now question 2 how can i recover the $ 100 value of my walmart gift card at this point 2.5 years later when the card was used to buy prepaid cards there 's no way to catch the thief and recover the funds had you reported it promptly could have block the prepaid cards sold or track their usage but now is too late question 3 is citibank in any way liable the gift card was    fraudulently used shortly after within the same month i received    it from citibank i doubt it unless you can show a pattern it could be someone working for the citibank someone working for the usps or someone just stole a bunch of numbers and waited until they became activated

edit this is so i pasted it here   london the synthetic cdo a villain of the global financial crisis is back   a decade ago bad bets on collateralized debt obligations helped fuel the crisis billed as safe they turned out to be anything but now more investors are returning to cdos and so are concerns that excess is into the aging bull market   in the u.s. the cdo market sunk steadily in the years after the financial crisis but has been fairly flat since 2014 in europe the total size of market is now rising again up 5.6 annually in the first quarter of the year and in the last quarter of 2016 according to the securities industry and financial markets association   collateralized debt obligations package a bunch of assets such as mortgage or corporate loans into a security that is chopped up into pieces and sold to investors   the assets inside a synthetic cdo are n’t physical debt securities but rather derivatives which in turn reference other investments such as loans or corporate debt   during the financial crisis synthetic cdos became a symbol of the financial of the era labelled an atomic bomb in the movie the big short they ultimately were the vehicle that spread the risks from the mortgage market throughout the financial system   synthetic cdos crammed with exposure to subprime mortgages or even other cdos are long gone the ones that remain contain credit default swaps referencing a range of european and u.s. companies effectively allowing investors to bet whether corporate defaults will pick up   desperate for something that pays better than basic government bonds insurance companies asset managers and high net worth investors are up investments like synthetic cdos bankers say which had largely become the preserve of hedge funds after 2008   investment banks which create and sell cdos are happy to oblige markets have made trading revenue weak this year and such structured products are an increasingly important business line   synthetic cdos got bad press says champion head of credit strategies at paris based hedge fund la investment solutions but that market has never ceased to fully function he added   these days mr. champion still trades synthetic cdos receiving a stream of income for effectively insuring against a sharp rise in european corporate defaults   many investors though still view the products as unnecessarily complex and are concerned they may be hard to offload when markets get as they did in the last crisis from the amount outstanding of european collateralized debt obligations has been growing again after years of shrinking   we do n’t see that demand from our clients and we would n’t recommend it said markus chief investment officer at lloyds private banking citing concerns over the lack of transparency and lack of liquidity meaning it could be hard to offload a position when needed   the return of synthetic cdos could present other risks even if banks are currently less willing to loan money to help clients juice returns credit default swaps can be very leveraged potentially allowing investors to make bets   structured products accounted for nearly all the $ 2.6 billion year on year growth in trading division revenue at the top 12 global investment banks in the first quarter according to research director at financial consultancy coalition   there has been an uptick in interest in any kind of yield enhancement structure said a managing director in sa ’s investment bank   the fastest growth this year has come in credit the of the 2007 08 crisis the top global 12 investment banks had around $ 1.5 billion in revenue in structured credit in the first quarter according to coalition more than doubling since the first quarter of 2016 structured equities are largest overall a business dominated by sales of derivatives linked to moves in stock prices with revenue of $ 5 billion in the first quarter   the low yield environment hurts said a credit fund manager at investment managers so there are a lot of asset owners looking at structured credit   these days the typical synthetic cdo involves a portfolio of credit default swaps on a range of companies the portfolio is sliced into tranches and investors receive payouts based on the performance of the swaps those investors owning lower tranches tend to get paid more but are subject to higher losses if the swaps sour structured revenues from structured products such as collateralized debt obligations are rising faster than of stocks bonds and currencies   for instance an investor can sell insurance against a pick up in defaults in the lowest or of the europe index a widely traded cds benchmark that tracks european investment grade companies in return the investor will receive regular payments but those will shrink with every company default and stop altogether once 3 of the portfolio has been wiped out through defaults   during the financial crisis synthetic cdos based on standardized indexes like europe suffered losses as traders expected defaults to pick up investors who held on though have since done great says mr. champion   investors who agreed to insure against a rise in defaults for 10 years on the equity tranche of the europe index in march 2008 have made roughly 10 a year according to an analysis of data from markit that ’s despite defaults from two companies in the index italian lender monte dei di and portugal telecom international finance   in contrast investors who sold insurance on tailored cdos packed with riskier credits such as icelandic banks or insurers would have been on the hook for losses   synthetic cdos have evolved since the crisis bankers say for instance most are shorter dated running up to around two to three years rather than seven to 10 years some banks will only slice and dice standardized cds indexes that trade frequently in the market rather than craft tailored baskets of credits   there are also fewer banks involved in arranging these trades those active include bnp paribas sa citigroup inc. goldman sachs group inc. j.p. morgan chase amp co. and   regulations have forced banks to set aside more capital against these transactions and use less leverage that has encouraged banks to parcel out the risk to clients rather than keeping it on their own books   there is a lot more regulation and scrutiny and a lot less leverage said mr.   mr. champion says he only trades tranches based on standardized cds indexes which he says are easier to buy and sell than more tailored products currently he sees value in selling default protection on super senior tranches   mr. champion said he has to lay down only around $ 1 million in upfront margin costs on a $ 100 million trade of this kind   the cost of leverage in the derivatives space is very low he said   any expectations of default rates picking up could inflict losses on synthetic cdos though at the moment analysts forecast they should decline still the memory of how the market behaved in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis is likely to keep many investors on the sidelines   if you ’re the person responsible for buying the synthetic cdo that suddenly goes wrong your career risk is bigger than if you ’d bought a plain vanilla bond that goes wrong it has a bad name said a portfolio manager at start up hedge fund impact who until recently credit for one of sweden ’s public pension funds

this answer is about the usa each time you sell a security a stock or a bond or some other asset you are expected to pay tax on the net gain it does n't matter whether you use a broker or mutual fund to make the sale you still owe the tax net capital gain is defined this way gross sale prices less broker fees for selling + cost of buying the asset the cost of buying the asset is called the basis price   you or your broker needs to keep track of the basis price for each share this is easy when you 're just getting started investing it stays easy if you 're careful about your record keeping   you owe the capital gains tax whenever you sell an asset whether or not you reinvest the proceeds in something else if your capital gains are modest you can pay all the taxes at the end of the year if they are larger for example if they exceed your wage earnings you should pay quarterly estimated tax the tax authorities ding you for a penalty if you wait to pay or six figure tax bills without paying quarterly estimates   you pay net capital gains tax if one asset loses money and another makes money you pay on your gains minus your losses if you have more losses than gains in a particular year you can carry forward up to $ 3,000 i think you ca n't carry forward tens of thousands in capital losses   long term and short term gains are treated separately irs schedule b has places to plug in all those numbers and the tax programs turbo etc do too dividend payments are also taxable when they are paid those are n't capital gains they go on schedule d along with interest payments the same is true for a mutual fund if the fund has ford shares in it and ford pays $ per share in march that 's a dividend payment if the fund managers decide to sell ford and buy tesla in june   the selling of ford shares will be a cap gains taxable event for you   the good news the mutual fund managers send you a statement sometime in february or march of each year telling what you should put on your tax forms   this is great they add it all up for you they give you a nice consolidated tax statement covering everything dividends their buying and selling activity on your behalf and any selling they did when you withdrew money from the fund for any purpose    some investment accounts like 401(k accounts are tax free you do n't pay any tax on those accounts capital gains dividends interest until you withdraw the money to live on after you retire then that money is taxed as if it were wage income if you want an easy and fairly reliable way to invest and do n't want to do a lot of tax form scrambling choose a couple of different mutual funds put money into them and leave it there they 'll send you consolidated tax statements once a year download them into your tax program and you 're done you mentioned riding out bad times in cash   no no not a good idea that investment strategy almost guarantees you will sell when the market is going down and buy when it 's going up that 's sell low buy high it 's a loser not even warren buffett can call the top of the market and the bottom   ned johnson fidelity 's founder definitely ca n't

there are only two ways to increase your savings you are young and both of these are likely to happen you will be promoted and get raises and your loans will be paid off removing the loan payment it would seem that you need only to wait a year or so and there will a lot more than $ 87 left over each month and your savings will grow almost without any action from you but somehow that is not what happens in real life as people get older they need more than they did before larger home more expensive things etc and they never manage to get around to saving so it 's great that you are wondering how to do it but you are not truly making it a priority you mention that you also pay spend for friends the internet play joy cloth gifts book etc and this entirely optional spending is the difference between such precision and 90 of your salary in other words it is 17 18 or more than your rent think about that for a moment every month you spend more than your rent on friends play joy books and good old etc if you were to cut that in half you could save 8 or 9 of your salary maybe after your next raise you can get that up to 10 how can you cut that optional fun stuff in half well i do n't know because i do n't know what it is and i suspect you do n't either so track it for a month or two are you getting takeout food or coffee every day are you always the one who pays when you go out with friends do you eat in restaurants a lot do you always wear the latest buy $ 500 shoes pay people to do your nails or dye your hair buy a new phone every year have the top end phone plan top end cable plan you have to know where that worth of money goes every month then you can figure out how to send some of it to savings instead   in some ways you are in a hard generation your parents did n't need to save for their retirement because they had you and they know you will send money home for them but you probably do n't expect the same from the children you do n't have yet so you have to save for yourself this is a challenge if you were saving the money you send your parents you 'd be fine yet you do n't want to reduce what you send they need it still people have faced bigger challenges and overcome them start by understanding where your fun money is going then look at how to send some aim for half of that to savings instead you wo n't regret it

few people actually buy bmw 's most are leased because if you 're the type of person who wants to drive a bmw you 're going want a new one regularly   here 's the lifecycle of a bmw or other luxury car by the time you hit ten years you have a rapidly depreciating asset because the average joe does n't really want an old bmw and hassles that come with it or any luxury car that said there are great bargains in this space i used to buy 5 6 year old when they were n't cool for like $ 7 9k and resell them a year later for about $ 1,500 less that i bought them for lower than a civic you need to have patience though because maintenance is always an expensive pain in the rear with luxury cars

when i bought the house i had my lawyer educate me about everything on the forms that seemed at all unclear since this was my first time thru the process on of the pieces of advice that he gave was that title insurance had almost no value in this state unless you had reason to believe the title might be defective but wanted to buy the property anyway in fact i did get it anyway as an impulse purchase but i 'm fully aware that it was a bad bet especially since i had the savings to be able to self insure which is always the better answer if you can afford to risk the worst case scenario also ask the seller whether they bought title insurance often it is transferrable at least once

the second choice is a normal payment just made early this guards you against forgetting to make the payment later and incurring late payment fees which in this kind of loan are added to the balance and themselves accrue compounded interest the first option is an extra payment applied entirely to the principal that lets you avoid years of accrued interest on that portion of the loan and reduces the loan 's actual cost i think the extra payment is a better investment

this is something better asking a licensed professional ea cpa licensed in the us who 's also familiar with your home country tax law and the tax treaty your home country has with the us assuming no tax treaty and adverse tax consequences at home you can have this scenario the last step is critical unless there 's a tax treaty not every country allows foreign tax credit tax treaties usually have a provision to avoid double taxation and you may end up paying both the us tax and local tax on the same money if there 's a tax treaty step 4 is most likely guaranteed step 4 may not work in some places that would not consider the penalty as tax again check it with an accountant proficient with the local law step 3 depends on your country some countries ignore foreign deferred compensation rules and consider the 401k amounts income to you when it was deposited the us treats foreign tax deferred accounts this way i believe that is also the case in india so you should check locally in this case you have probably paid taxes or were exempt on this amount when you earned it and will not pay taxes again but then you might also not be able to claim the 10 back as credit leaving it is an option although with such an amount is hardly worth it you 'll have to check how your country deals with foreign accounts of its citizens the us for example puts an enormous reporting and tax burden on these some countries forbid them altogether this also applies to step 1

all things being equal a defined benefit pension is far better than an ira or a 401(k   think about it this way let 's say you can have a guaranteed $ 100 a month or the chance at $ 100 a month   which is better    now obviously your tolerance for risk is the difference but this is the beauty of a defined benefit plan your employer is picking up the risk   assuming that the pool of investments is about the same which unless if their funds are tremendously under performing they are the question is who takes the risk you or them especially if you are moving into a new position having a defined benefit plan is like having a risk free asset in your portfolio   it increases your safety   the only reason to roll this over into a 401(k or ira is if your expected value risk payout is better   a worked example if half the time you would earn more than $ 100 and half the time less then you could imagine the two as being equally good only if you really love risk would you take that chance   in reality only half the investments out there will beat the average and as such you actually have less than a 50/50 shot of beating a db unless if there are really low returns to it   more likely i suspect you are over estimating your ability to get a higher return

you are right that even if you do not receive a 1099-misc you still need to report all income to the irs   report the $ 40 on schedule c or schedule c ez   since your net profit was less than $ 400 you do not need to file schedule se   from the irs web site self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer

there 's several approaches to the stock market the first thing you need to do is decide which you 're going to take the first is the case of the standard investor saving money for retirement or some other long term goal he already has a job he 's not really interested in another job he does n't want to spend thousands of hours doing research he should buy mutual funds or similar instruments to build diversified holdings all over the world he 's going to have is money invested for years at a time he wo n't earn spectacular amazing awesome returns but he 'll earn solid returns there will be a few years when he loses money but he 'll recover it just by waiting the second is the case of the day trader he attempts to understand ultra short term movements in stock prices due to news rumors and other things which stem from quirks of the market and the people who trade in it he buys a stock and when it 's up a fraction of a percent half an hour later sells it this is very risky requires a lot of attention and a good amount of money to work with and you can lose a lot of money too the modern day trader also needs to compete with the high frequency trading desks of wall street firms with super optimized computer networks located a block away from the exchange so that they can make orders faster than the guy two blocks away i do n't recommend this approach at all the third case is the guy who wants to beat the market he 's got long term aspirations and vision but he does a lot more research into individual companies figures out which are worth buying and which are not and invests accordingly this is how warren buffett made it big you can make it work but it 's like starting a business it 's a ton of work requires a good amount of money to get going and you still risk losing lots of it   the fourth case is the guy who mostly invests in broad market indexes like 1 but has a little money set aside for the stocks he 's researched and likes enough to invest in like 3 he 's not going to make money like warren buffett but he may get a little bit of an edge on the rest of the market if he does n't and ends up losing money there instead the rest of his stocks are still chugging along the last and way is to treat it all like magic buying things without understanding them or a clear plan of what you 're going to do with them you risk losing all your money you also risk having it stagnate good to see you want to avoid it

ideally stock price reflects the value of the company the dividends it is expected to pay and what people expect the future value of the company to be only one of those maybe one and a half is related to current   sales and not always directly short term motion of a stock is even less directly linked since it also reflects previous expectations a company can announce disappointing sales and see its stock go up if the previous price was based on expecting   worse news

a credit default swap is a derivative a financial contract with a value dependent upon another asset a cds in essence is exactly what it sounds like a swap upon default the typical arrangement is that a holder of non risk free credit enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to pay the counterparty a portion of the income received from the non risk free credit in exchange for being able to force the counterparty to deliver risk free credit if the non risk free credit defaults banks use this mechanism to reduce the risk of the loans they produce while packaging them to be resold to investors   banks will typically buy on mortgages and corporate bonds paying part of the income from interest payments received to have the right to force counterparties typically hedge funds and insurance companies to swap national treasuries upon the event that the mortgages or corporates default   the banks receive less income yet are able to take on more inventory to sell to investors so that more loans can be made to borrowers households and corporations hedge funds typically take on more complex arrangements while insurance companies sell because they are usually overflowing with risk free assets yet are starved for income

two factors that positively your credit score are the number of open accounts you have in good standing and the average age of the accounts the more accounts you have in good standing the more likely you seem to pay back what you borrow from new creditors the older the average age of the accounts the more you seem like an experienced borrower who has had many years of successful credit activity closing them would lower the total number of accounts in good standing you have and would also likely lower the average account age unless you 've recently opened them to simplify the number of cards you have pick the one or two you would consider cancelling worst rewards benefits highest yearly fee etc and just do n't keep them in your wallet anymore you do n't have to worry about paying them off every month because you do n't buy anything with them and you still get the credit score benefits of having the accounts open

the best answer is i think also the simplest   a bank is an entity which performs maturity transformation   conversely any entity that performs maturity transformation is acting as a bank regardless of whether it is called one or is regulated as one   and an entity which does not perform maturity transformation is n't really a bank   maturity transformation is the process by which a bank accepts short term deposits and makes long term loans   the benefit to society is fairly obvious we collectively like being able to take out mortgages but we also like having our money in a checking account and available on demand   banks allow this to happen although property bubbles and similar make it clear that this is n't without cost   note   central banks are a completely different kettle of fish

in the uk at least dealers definitely want you to take finance they get benefits from the bank which are not for doing this these benefits translate directly to increased commission and internal rewards for the individual salesman it 's conceivable that the salesman will be less inclined to put himself out for you in any way by your deal as much as you 'd like if he 's not going to get incentives out of it indeed since he 's taking a hit on his commission from you paying in cash it 's in his best interests to perhaps be with you during price negotiation so will the salesman be frustrated with you if you choose to pay in cash yes absolutely though this may manifest in different ways in some cases the dealer will offer to pay off the finance for you allowing you to pay directly in cash while the dealer still gets the bank referral reward so that everyone wins this is a behind the scenes secret in the industry which is not made public for obvious reasons it 's arguably on fraud if the salesman likes you and trusts you then you may be able to get such an arrangement if this does not seem likely to occur i would not go out of my way to disclose that i am planning to pay with cash that being said you 'll usually be asked very early on whether you are seeking to pay cash or credit the salesman wants to know for the reasons outlined above and there is little use lying about it when you 're shortly going to have to come clean anyway

immediately move your roth ira out of edward jones and into a discount broker like scottrade ameritrade fidelity vanguard schwab or e trade   edward jones will be charging you a large fraction of your money probably at least 1 explicitly and maybe another 1 in hidden ish fees like the 12b-1   do n't give away several percent of your savings every year when you can have an account for free   places like edward jones are appropriate only for people who are unwilling to learn about personal finance and happy to pay dearly as a result   move your money by contacting the new broker then requesting that they get your money out of edward jones   they will be happy to do so the right way   do n't try and get the money out yourself continue to contribute to your roth as long as your tax bracket is low   saving on taxes is a critically important part of being financially wise   you can spend your contributions not gains out of your roth for any reason without penalty if you want need to   when your tax bracket is higher look at traditional ira 's instead to minimize your current tax burden   for more accessible ways of saving open a regular non tax advantaged brokerage account invest in diversified and low cost funds   look at the expense ratios and minimize your portfolio 's total expense   higher fee funds generally do not earn the money they take from you avoid all funds that have a nonzero 12b-1 fee generally speaking your best bet is buying index funds from fidelity vanguard schwab or their close competitors   or buying cheap etf 's    any discount brokerage will allow you to do this in both your roth and regular accounts   remember the reason you buy funds is to get instant diversification not because you are willing to gamble that your mutual funds will outperform the market   head to the bogleheads forum for more specific advice about 3 fund portfolios and similar suggested investment strategies like the lazy portfolios   the folks in the forums there like to give specific advice that 's not appropriate here if you use a non tax advantaged account for investing buy and sell in a tax smart way   at the end of the year sell your poor performing stocks or funds and use the loss as a tax write off   then rebalance back to a good portfolio   or if your tax bracket is very low sell the winners and lock in the gains at low tax rates   try to hold things more than a year so you are taxed at the long term capital gains rate rather than the short term only when you have several million dollars then look at making individual investments rather than funds   in a non tax advantaged account owning the assets directly will help you write off losses against your taxes   but either way it takes several million dollars to make the transactions costs of maintaining a portfolio lower than the fees a cheap mutual index fund will charge

first of all i have to recognize up front that my spending personality is frugal i do n't recreational shop and i save a lot of my total income building a budget and sticking to it is difficult especially for people who are closer to living paycheck to paycheck than i. theoretically it should be easy to stick to a budget by overestimating expenses but for many people planning to spend more than necessary is n't a luxury available that said i have a system that works for me maybe it can work for you this system lets me see how much i have to spend and close to optimally arranges assets as you can see this system relies on some pretty strong upfront planning and adherence to the plan and what you might not realize is that you can deviate from the plan in two ways by spending variations and by timing variations credit should really help with a lot of the timing variations it takes a series of expenses and translates them into one lump payment every month   as for spending variations like spending 20 dollars for lunch when you only budgeted 5 it turns out this technique helps a lot some academic work suggests that spending with plastic is more likely to blow your budget than cash unless you make detailed plans but it sounds like your main problem is knowing whether you can afford to splurge and the future minimum balance of your checking account can be your splurge number

stock splits are typically done to increase the liquidity of stock merely by converting every stock of the company into multiple stocks of lower face value for example if the initial face value of the stock was $ 10 and the stock got split 10:1 the new face value of the stock would be $ 1 each this has a proportional effect on the market value of the stock also if the stock was trading at $ 50 after the split the stock should ideally adjust to $ 5 this is to ensure that despite the stock split the market capitalization of the company should remain the same number of shares stock price = market capitalization = constant

gt well they 've created what $ in the last few years   i agree with you technically but they control both the quantity and the quantity times velocity of money so they are also responsible for the lack of cashflow    the big thing i think you 're referring to is that they did this weird maneuver where they temporarily injected money into the banks basically so they could say they were solvent without actually being solvent because the were temporary the money never moved and was simply deposited at the fed if like adam smith you do n't consider money to really exist unless it moves they did not create effective money as you point out critically they did not create cashflow which is the appropriate macro definition of money the corresponding macro variable for this is ngdp   but actually the fed also controls ngdp as ben bernanke says every time the fomc makes its report they just choose not to increase it because they think that monetary policy is sufficiently i would agree with you that the present level of cashflow is inadequate but if the fed fixes it at the present level nothing will increase it this is called the critique was raising the issue to argue contra keynes that the multiplier on fiscal policy is 0 if you google it you can probably find someone to defend it better than me in any event this means it 's not very surprising that private spending and investment does n't lift ngdp nothing but the fed can lift ngdp because it can not create new cashflow on its own which it could under free banking this would be the advantage of free banking the market must now move to a new equilibrium ngdp level while it is saddled with a large number of contracts from before 2008 that were negotiated with respect to a higher expected ngdp level this deleveraging process is responsible for the present slump and the you describe

regardless of how long the mortgage has left the return you get on prepayments is identical to the mortgage rate what happens on your tax return is a different matter it 's easier to get a decent financial calculator the ti ba-35 is my favorite than to construct spreadsheets which may or may not contain equation errors when i duplicate john 's numbers $ 100 k mortgage 4 rate i get a 60 mo remaining balance of and with $ 50 extra $ a diff of $ $ return on the $ 3000 $ over 5yrs is $ over an average $ 1500 put in = 4.2   of course the simple math of just averaging the payment creates that .2 error a 60 payment $ 50 returning $ produces k with all due respect there 's nothing for me about time value of money calculations that can be counter intuitive while i like playing with spreadsheets the first thing i do is run a few scenarios and double check using the calculator your updated sheet is now at a time of money calculation should not have rounding errors that larger it 's larger than my back of envelope calculation   if you do n't need the money and would buy a cd at the rate of your mortgage then pay early nothing wrong with that

you can make estimated tax payments on form 1040-es   most people who make such payments need to do it quarterly because the typical reasons for making estimated payments is something like self employment income that a person will get throughout the year   if you have a one time event like a single large sale of stock however there 's nothing wrong with doing it just one quarter out of the year when it comes time to file your taxes part of the calculate is whether you were timely quarter by quarter not just for the entire year so if you do have a big one time event mid year do n't wait until the end of the year to file an estimated payment   of course if the event is at the end of the year then you can make it a 4th quarter estimated payment

you should also consider what the cost of the put is especially if the strike price is set at the current price vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put and the expiration date   also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility there are a good number of situations where you may come out behind if the stock stays the same price you are out the premium you paid for the put if the stock price rises less than the premium you are out the difference between the two if the stock price falls less than the premium you are out the difference between the two in order to be in the money when writing a protective put the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put and you must sell or hold and write off the expense of the put or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower   than the premium you paid and you must sell via the exercising the option and you 've protected yourself from a loss presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers   and since selling is required in both cases if you 've held the stock less than a year then pay on any profits at short term rates taxed as regular income and if the price went down you ca n't claim any loss unless strike price was below your buy price and would still need to pay if you had a net gain and you likely ca n't deduct the price you paid for the put

what big picture   if you can not tell the massive drain on an organization simply by looking you are blind   how do companies make money   income producers   who are the income producers   there are three classes people who assemble a product people who charge billable hours and people who make sales of more product and/or hours   that 's it   those are the only people who make money     if you make a product you may absolutely require a packaging and shipping department to bring your product to market but those people will not ever make you more product to sell or bring in more sales so you run that department as lean as you can   how lean that is depends entirely on how you feel about business personally i think it 's just as important to be able to enjoy the job as it is to make money but that 's neither here nor there likewise maintenance likewise it likewise accounting marketing although they 'll never admit it qc legal etc etc etc   the only function of management is to organize operations and deal with problems   the old c plan organize direct staff and falls entirely into organizing or dealing with problems   management is there to empower people to do their jobs allow them to not deal with crap that is not their through proper organization and problem resolution     just like shipping and maintenance and it you run your management staff as lean as possible while still accomplishing the goals of 1 organization to empower employees to do their jobs and 2 problem resolution   that 's it once you get that done you do n't need any more managers ever until you 're not able to keep up with   so what 's the purpose of middle management   they deal with fundamental problems but they have no authority to resolve them   you are paying an entire class of employee to pass the buck up to higher and wait hoping that a decision will eventually come back down   sometimes they are necessary to accomplish the goals of the organization ie during growth periods   but they are always a drain and would always be better off replaced by experienced and motivated senior line employees with the authority to make reasonable decisions on the spot

i do n't understand the worker mentality of accepting to be part of pension plans the downside risk to you is ridiculously high you 're basically making an investment that the next 30 years of corporate management and the company as a whole are going to be good pension plans are among the first to go employees that retired 20 30 years ago add no current value to the company unless you consider that current employees are motivated by the idea of a pension or working for a company that takes care of its employees   also part of the reason pension funds are blowing up is that the risk free return rate is less than 1 i do n't know who to blame or thank for that but with government bonds now trading at negative yields in real and sometimes even absolute terms see swiss yields what else are you supposed to do

401(k does n't have a return rate because 401(k is not a type of investment it is a vehicle for investment with certain tax treatments just like your money that 's not in a 401(k you can invest it in either the bank a cd stocks mutual funds bonds etc you can similarly depending on the options given to you by your 401(k plan invest the money in the 401(k in a cash account buy stocks mutual funds etc your return is dependent on how you invest your money not whether it 's in a 401(k or not whether it 's in a roth or traditional 401(k simply affects when and how it gets taxed it is true that most 401(k plans offer little variety in types of investments you can choose however this is not a big deal as chances are that in a few years you will leave your company at which point you are able to rollover the 401(k into an ira at which point you will have many many options for how to invest it to make a valid comparison you should be comparing the same type of investment in both cases that means you should assume the same return for both the money outside the 401(k and the money inside the 401(k and only consider the taxes and penalties if you plan to withdraw early

i 'll answer this question why do intraday traders close their position at then end of day while most gains can be done overnight buy just before the market close and sell just after it opens is this observation true for other companies or is it specific to apple intraday traders often trade shares of a company using intraday leverage provided by their firm for every $ 5000 dollars they actually have they may be trading with $ 100,000 leverage as an example since a stock can also decrease in value substantially while the markets are closed intraday traders are not allowed to keep their highly leveraged positions opened probabilities fail in a random walk scenario and only one failure can bankrupt you and the firm

when you itemize your deductions you get to deduct all the state income tax that was taken out of your paycheck last year not how much was owed but how much was withheld if you deducted this last year then you need to add in any amount that you received in state income tax refunds last year to your taxes this year to make up for the fact that you ended up deducting more state income tax than was really due to the state   if you took the standard deduction last year instead of itemizing then you did n't deduct your state income tax withholding last year and you do n't need to claim your refund as income this year also if you itemized but chose to take the state sales tax deduction instead of the state income tax deduction you also do n't need to add in the refund as income   for whatever reason illinois decided that you do n't get a it might be that the amount of the refund was too small to warrant the paperwork it might be that they screwed up but if you deducted your state income tax withholding on last year 's tax return then you need to add the state tax refund you got last year on line 10 of this year 's 1040 whether or not the state issued you a form or not   take a look at the line 10 instructions   starting on page 22 of the 1040 instructions to see if you have any unusual situations covered there that you did n't mention here for example if you received a refund check for multiple years last year then check your tax return from last year to verify that you deducted your state income tax withholding on schedule a. if you did then this year add the refund you got from the state to line 10 of this year 's 1040

i would recommend that you establish a landlord tenant relationship instead of joint ownership ie 100 ownership stake for one of you vs 0 for the other it is much cleaner and simpler   basically one of you can propose a monthly rent amount and the other one can chose to be either renter or landlord alternatively you can both write down a secret rental price offer assuming you are the landlord then pick the landlord who wrote down the smaller rental price   if neither of you can afford the down payment then you can consider the renter 's contribution an unsecured loan at an agreed interest rate and payment schedule if you must have both names on the financing then i would recommend you sell the property or refinance under a single name as quickly as possible when the relationship ends if not before pay the renter back any remaining balance on the loan and leave the landlord with the resulting equity or debt   in any case if you expect the unsecured loan to outlive your relationship then you are either buying a house you ca n't afford or partnering on it with someone you should n't

wealthsimple lists their prices as follows those are the fees you pay over and above what you pay for the underlying etfs management fees but why not just invest in the etfs yourself the canadian couch potato website shows some sample portfolios the etf option has an average management expense ratio very similar to that of the etfs used by wealthsimple but without the additional management fee rebalance once or twice a year and you cut your fees from approximately if investing mid six figures to 0.17 for very little work is it worth it to you well that depends on how much you have to invest and how much effort you are willing to put in wealthsimple is n't particularly unreasonable with their fees but the fees do look a bit high once you are in to the six figures of investing on the other hand i often recommend tangerine 's mutual funds to my friends who are looking at investing for retirement those mutual funds last time i checked cost that 's about twice what wealthsimple is charging but they are easy to understand and easy to invest in a good choice for my friends looking to invest $ 1,000 $ 50,000 in my opinion so and understanding this is just my personal opinion i think wealthsimple fits in a niche where tangerine mutual funds carry too high a cost for you but you do n't want to do all the management yourself even if this is just an hour or so of work a couple of times a year i wish they were cheaper but their pricing makes sense for a lot of people in my opinion do they make sense for you if you are looking at investing less than $ 10,000 i 'd stick with an option like tangerine only because that 's an easier option if investing more than $ 100,000 or $ 200,000 i think you are paying a bit much for what they offer but many people pay much much much more for their investments

made after the calendar year are not usually a problem this is because while contributions made in jan and feb can be counted towards the previous year they do not have to be this appears to be what has happened in your case if you had an rrsp limit of $ 18,000 for 2015 and in jan 2016 you contributed $ 22,000 to your rrsp then it is perfectly legal to claim $ 18,000 of that in 2015 and $ 4000 in 2016 the extra $ 4000 is never counted against your 2015 limit and so is not an overcontribution if your 2016 limit is going to be less than $ 4000 then you will eventually have an overcontribution problem in 2016 and if you think that 's likely you should sort this out now but for most people that 's pretty unlikely

while i agree with ben a lot i feel like his answer is really poor here you do not call a number to give your credit card information out for a refund   that is ridiculous   just from his answer he has had 5 cases of fraud lately you should know that you should n't follow this advice i personally do n't ever give my credit card number over the phone unless it is the very very very last resort   it is not just about money and safety but it is about time   every time that you give your number out over the phone there is a chance that the employee on the other end by either scam or legitimate business will use or sell your info   so you need to determine if the time saved by doing a transaction over the phone is worth hours days of your time if your card has a fraud issue   and note that fraud sometimes is easily negated but if done smartly can be hard to prove via a quick call or email to card company what should you do tell company that you will simply get the refund through your credit card company and if we go back to time element   you fill out form on card website   card company goes back to vendor and says why are you asking for card numbers via email   card company either cancels vendor contract or more likely helps them understand the technology available so they do n't have to do this   therefore that quick form that you filled out will now keep this company from bugging you again   by going through their archaic systems you are enabling their behavior

yeah they should have given it to you i worked at a best buy it was policy but managers were telling employees to not give discounts so much unless customers were getting warranties it is amazing how much they care about warranties every morning they announce what place they are in the country for each section of the store and the sections that did bad the managers and assistants look at them with hate as if they should have done much better and the ones that did great by selling the most warranties and especially their most expensive warranties gets by everyone with a round of applause before all of this too they do a with a shout best buy my best buy

with me and my wife coming from different countries and us both living in a non native country we have very little clue where we will eventually settle down the answer depends on where you reside currently tax rules and ability to move funds as well as where you plan to settle down and the tax rules there from what i understand once you eventually retire and take an annuity from your pension you are then taxed on it as income anyway yes and no for example if you move from us to india stay in india for 7 years you then move your retirement funds from us to india the entire amount would be taxable in india but would this freedom would come with significant costs in terms of savings at retirement the cost would be hard to predict it depends on the tax treatments in the respective countries on the retirement kitty   it also depends on whether the country you are staying in will allow complete withdrawal and transfer of retirement funds without penalty

those government workers in greece were just off a corrupt system that was enabled by the blind pursuit of yield and the moral hazard of bailout expectations they were way overpaid to do nothing but collect bribes and drink coffee all day good greece is a poor agricultural country with some tourism and some shipping and needs to go back to living within its means nobody is going to starve and high unemployment was always the norm there until a few years ago i lived there before the euro and they managed just fine despite high interest rates and inflation    japan has had lost decades because its banks like those in the west now are practicing extend and pretend so there has n't been a proper flush of the system the piigs should just flat out default and get it over with rather than slowly default while giving up sovereignty    even germany would be better off if the piigs defaulted since it is german taxpayers and savers who are going to pay for these bailouts let the banks fail meaning let their equityholders and bondholders take losses the depositors will be fine the resulting lower asset prices will tempt risk capital back into the system and life will go on bailouts just throw good money after bad and prop up corrupt banks and politicians   edit let me clarify about depositors making out fine the banks equityholders and bondholders take losses before depositors who are insured anyway in most cases in europe as in the us the write downs are not large enough to eat through this cushion before threatening depositors creditors were rewarded with higher interest for lending to these irresponsible banks so they should take the hit rather than get made whole at taxpayer and saver inflation expense

to determine how much you can contribute to a regular and roth ira you have to calculate your compensation what is compensation   generally compensation is what you earn from    working for a summary of what compensation does and does not include    see table 1 1 compensation includes all of the items discussed next    even if you have more than one salaries etc wages    salaries tips professional fees bonuses and other amounts you    receive for ing personal services are compensation the irs    treats as compensation any amount properly shown in box 1 wages    tips other compensation of form w-2 wage and tax statement    provided that amount is reduced by any amount properly shown in box 11    nonqualified plans scholarship and fellowship payments are    for ira purposes only if shown in box 1 of form    w-2 it a also includes commissions self employment income and alimony an non taxable combat pay for most people it is what i in box 1 of the w-2 for the example in the question if the sum of box 1 's equals $ that is the maximum you can contribute to all your iras regular and roth the funds can come from anywhere it is not related to your net check the money can be from savings gifts parents grandparents the irs does n't care about the source of the funds only that you do n't over contribute of course the calculation is more complex if the person is married and if they have access to a retirement account

yes you will need to deposit the funds into your hsa then withdraw them to reimburse yourself for the expenses the tax deduction comes when you contribute deposit to your hsa   if you do not deposit the money there you will not be able to claim the deduction   your hsa provider reports the amount of your contributions to the irs so the amount you say you contribute to your hsa on your tax return has to match what your hsa provider reports when you deposit the money to your hsa you need to explicitly tell your provider that the contribution is for tax year 2014   the reason is that you want to make sure that they report the amount of your 2014 contributions to the irs correctly after you 've deposited the amount into your hsa you can withdraw it to reimburse yourself for an eligible medical expense   in order to be eligible it needs to be an expense that was incurred while you had the hsa in place   if you had your hsa account in place before you paid the expense no problem   but if you set up the hsa account after you paid for the expense you might be out of luck the distribution withdrawal will be a part of tax year 2015 and you 'll see this amount included as part of the gross distributions on your 1099-sa form next year when i first set up my hsa i did n't have any extra money to fund the hsa so i handled it just like you are talking about   i would wait until i had a medical bill then deposit the amount i needed into my hsa and withdraw it back out to pay the bill

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

putting debt out long means to borrow a sum of money paid back over a longer period of time than you could reasonably pay it back it should be important to note that this advice only applies for fixed rate loans meaning your rate ca n't change for the life of the loan without you explicitly changing it   the logic is that if you can borrow money when interest rates are really low there is a good chance you can find an investment that has a return higher than the interest rate on the loan it also means that when if interest rates go up in the future a simple savings account may even have a greater return than your loans interest the advice suggests to borrow over a long period so you are paying less interest per payment and gives you time to find a proper investment without having to pay too much interest during that time

assuming you are executing your order on a registered exchange by a registered broker your order will be filled at the best bid price available   this is because brokers are legally obliged to get the best price available for example if the market is showing a bid of 49.99 and an offer of and you submit an order to offer 1000 shares at 5.00 your order will be filled at 49.99   this is assuming the existing bids are for enough shares to fill all of the 1000 shares being offered   if the share you are offering lacks the necessary liquidity to fill the order i.e. the 49.99 bid is for less than 1000 shares and the level two bids are not enough to fill the remaining shares then the order would be posted in the market as an offer to sell the balance 1000 shares filled at 49.99 and those filled at level two bids at 5.00    i 'm pretty sure that the scenario you are describing would be described as market manipulation and it would be against the law

i had a similar situation a while ago and here 's what i learned what are our options here to ensure that this company ca n't to take our money again via ach close existing account and create a new one that has different account number yes as a temporary solution keep balance in the account so that their request for $ ca n't be fulfilled however would our bank incur any fees because of insufficient funds each time the other company tries to charge us again bad idea you may incur penalties for returned payment or the bank may honor the payment and charge you overdraft fees provide to our bank the service termination notice that proves that we    are not in business with the other company anymore and effectively    block them however termination notice has only our signature bank does n't care ach withdrawal is akin to a check the assumption is that the other side has entitlement you can put stop payment once its processed and try to reverse it claiming fraud but the end result will be 1 you 'll end up getting a new account set up while they try to recover the money this is one of the reasons i 'm reluctant allowing standing ach authorizations any more generally the american banking system is very much geared against the consumers and in many ways is very retarded in a more advanced countries which is almost any other country than the us the standing withdrawal authorization goes through your bank and can be revoked

the general answer to any is it worth it insurance question is no because the insurance company is making a profit on the insurance to decide if you want the insurance you need to figure out how much you can afford to pay if something happens how much they cover and how badly you want to transfer your risk to them   if you wo n't have trouble coming up with the $ 4000 deductible should you need to then do n't get this extra insurance   i did not mean to imply that insurance is always a bad idea or that insurance companies are cheating their customers please let me explain further   when you buy any product from a business that business is making a profit and there is nothing wrong with that at all they are providing a service and should be compensated for their efforts   insurance companies also provide a service but unlike other types of businesses their product is monetary you pay them money now and they might pay you money later if they pay you more money then you spent you came out ahead and if you spend more money then they give you it was a loss for you   in order for the insurance company to make a profit they need to bring in more money than they pay out in fact they need to bring in a lot more money then they pay out because in addition to their profit they have all the overhead of running a business   as a result on average you will come out behind when you purchase insurance this means that when you are on the fence about whether or not to purchase any insurance product the default choice should be no   on average you are financially better off without insurance   now that does n't mean you should never buy insurance as mentioned by commenter insurance companies spread risk across all of their customers if i am in a situation where i have a risk of financial ruin in a certain circumstance i can eliminate that risk by purchasing insurance for example i have term life insurance because if i were to pass away it would be financially catastrophic for my family i 'm hoping that the insurance company makes 100 profit on that deal i also continue to buy expensive health insurance because an unexpected medical event would be financially devastating however i always decline the extended warranty when i buy a $ 300 appliance because i do n't have any trouble coming up with another $ 300 in the unlikely event that it breaks and i would rather keep the money than contribute to the profits of an insurance company unnecessarily   in my original answer above i pointed out how you would determine whether or not to purchase this particular insurance product this product pays out a bunch of relatively small amounts for certain events up to a limit of $ 4000 would this $ 4000 be hard for you to come up with if you needed to if so get the insurance but if you are like me and have an emergency fund in place to handle things like this then you are financially better off declining this policy

well it all kind of depends    the realtor is your pro and you should communicate further with him   is this a neighborhood on the decline   is there a good reason to make such a low offer   are you totally off base when you think 85 k is fair and if so why   is he just working his tail off for you a great thing one thing that is a key to this negotiation is financing   what does your financing status look like   a reasonable cash offer with no contingencies and a quick close might be less than   a person with strong financing can get a better discount then a person that is questionable it could be that the realtor is testing the waters to find the bottom price   the home selling season is closed typically the summer and the home has been on the market for a bit   offering 70 k might mean a counter at 82 k so you can work on an offer between 80 and 82    to me it sounds like this guy is working for you   you should thank him   it is pretty hard to find a realtor that is willing to negotiate his pay down in order to save you money    also he can answer the closing cost question better than us as he is more familiar with your particular market

some 401k plans allow you to make supplemental post tax contributions basically once you hit the pre tax contribution limit in 2014 you are then allowed to contribute funds on a post tax basis because of this timing they are sometimes called spillover contributions usually this option is advertised as a way of continuing to get company match even if you accidentally hit the pre tax limit   but if you actually pay attention to your finances it is instead a handy way to put away additional tax advantaged money   that said you would only want to use this option if you already maxed out your pre tax and roth options since you do n't get the traditional tax break on contributions or the roth tax break on the earnings however when you leave the company you can transfer the post tax money directly into a roth ira when you transfer the pre tax money match and earnings into a traditional ira

large and well known companies are typically a good starting point that does n't mean that they are the best or even above average good but at least they do n't cheat you and run with your money a core point is someone you pay not the company whose investment he sell you although the latter seems cheaper on first glance it is n't if you pay him his interest is to do good work for you if they pay him his interest is to sell you the product with the highest payment for him that does not imply that they are all that way it 's just a risk there are many good advisers that live from commissions and still do n't recommend you bad investments depending on the amounts you could also read up a bit and open an account with a online investment company it is but i think the cost for an adviser only starts to become worth it if you are deep into 5 digits of money

if you think of it in terms of trying to get an annual return on your investment over the long haul you can do a simple net present value analysis to decide your buy price   if you 're playing conservative with the investments and taking safety over returns you will still have some kind of expectation of that return will be   paying slightly more will drag down your returns perhaps less than what you want to get   if you really want to get your desired x% then stick to your guns and do n't go down the slippery slope of reaching   if 1 off is n't bad then 2 off is n't all that bad and maybe 3 is ok too for the right situation etc   got ta have rules and stick to them   you never know what opportunities will be around tomorrow   the possible drops in value should be built into your return expectations

the concept of a social contract is absolute a constitution defines the how of a state the social contract addresses the question why a state even exists and what justifies its existence and i say it again the only justification for the existence of a state is the protection of your rights and freedoms from others   capitalism is based on the exchange of goods and services based on mutual agreement and respect for each other 's property its driving force is competition   it is an invisible force that has been there since the very beginning every other system can be defined as a restriction to capitalism   we agree on that you can work because the state ensures your safety and the protection of your rights that 's the social contract again   police courts and military might be on the list of those necessary services however mandatory public healthcare is not   preventing a monopoly is not about wealth redistribution the driving force behind all the benefits of capitalism is competition once you have a monopoly the whole thing turns sideways in that area you need to introduce a few market regulations and a handful of guidelines for competition but redistribution of wealth wo n't stop its formation

inflation is an increase in the money supply   increases in consumer prices follow from inflation   it 's not the same as inflation some inflation is necessary for a growing economy   if your gross national product is only $ 1,000 then you can get away with having less money than if your gross national product is $ 1 trillion inflation beyond this though is used to allow governments to live beyond their means   if there is more money chasing the same amount of goods prices will rise   there is truth in what says about this kind of inflation   it 's theft governments like inflation because it allows them to pay off their debts with cheaper money

this is of course a perfectly normal thing to happen people trade up to a bigger house every day when you 've found a bigger house you want to move to and a buyer for your existing one you arrange closing dates for both i.e. the date on which the sale actually happens usually you make them very close either on the same day or with an overlap of a few weeks you use the equity i.e. the difference between the house value and the mortgage in the old house as the down payment on the new house you ca n't of course use the part of the old house that is mortgaged if the day you buy the new and sell the old is the same your banks and lawyers do everything for you on that day if there is an overlap then you need something called bridge financing to cover the period when you own two houses banks are used to doing this and it 's not really that expensive when you take into account all the other costs of moving house talk to them for details as a side note it is generally not to be worth buying a house if you only intended to live there one or two years the costs involved in the process of buying selling and moving usually outweigh any gains in house value you may find yourself with a higher down payment if you rent for a year or two and save up a down payment for your bigger house instead

b already answered the first question i want to respond to the second and third i have heard the term the equity on your home is like a bank what does that mean i suppose i could borrow using the equity in my home as collateral yes you can borrow against the equity in your home what you should keep in mind is that you can only borrow against the amount that you 've paid on your house for example if you 've paid $ 100,000 against your house you can then borrow $ 100,000 assuming the value has n't changed the argument that this is a good deal misses the obvious alternative if you did n't spend that $ 100,000 on a house then you 'd still have it and would n't need to take out a loan at all of course equity still has value and you should consider it when doing the cost benefit analysis but make sure to compare your equity to savings you could have from renting are there any other general benefits that would drive me from paying $ 800 in rent to owning a house economically as you 'll notice from my remarks this is extremely situational it might be good to come up with a spreadsheet for your situation taking all of the costs into account and see if you end up better or worse also there 's nothing wrong with buying a house for non economic reasons if that 's what you want just make sure you 're aware of the real cost before you do it

i ca n't answer the question if you should or should n't get a credit card after all you seem to manage fine without one which is good i started using credit cards when i lived in the uk as the consumer protection you get from a credit card there tends to be better than from a debit card i 'd also treat it as a debit or charge card ie pay it off in full every month that way because you 're not carrying a balance the high interest rate does n't matter and you avoid the trap of digging yourself deeper into the hole each month cashback or other perks offered by a credit card can be worth it but a make sure that they 're worth more than the yearly fee and b that they 're perks you 're actually using for that reason cashback tends to work best i 'd get a visa or mastercard they seem to be the ones that pretty much everybody accepts amex can have better perks but tends to be more expensive and is n't accepted everywhere especially not outside the us but in the end do you really need one if you 're managing fine without one

my equities portfolio breaks down like this i 'm 26 years old so it is quite aggressive additionally i have a portfolio of direct real estate investments i have made over the past 4 years   i invested very aggressively into real estate due to the financial crisis as a result of my aggressive investing strong growth in real estate my overall asset breakdown is quite out of balance real estate ~20 equities i will be bringing this into a more sensible balance over the next few years as i unwind some of my real estate investments reinvest the proceeds into other asset classes as for the alternative asset groups you mentioned i looked quite seriously at peer to peer lending a few years back lending club however interest rates were quite low i felt that real estate was a better asset class to be in at the time    furthermore i was borrowing heavily to fund real estate purchases at the time and i felt it did n't make much sense to be lending cash borrowing at the same time   i needed every dime i could get a hold of     i will give it another look once rates come back up i 've away from investing in things like actively managed mutual funds hedge funds etc not because i do n't think good managers can get superior returns rather in my humble opinion if they do get above average returns then they simply charge higher management fees to reflect their good performance hope this helps

it 's hard to answer without knowing all of the details i.e. what was your salary for each of the options but i think you probably made a good choice 1099 would have required you to pay self employment tax but also would have allowed you to deduct business expenses w2 with benefits likely would have been beneficial if you needed healthcare since group plans can be cheaper than individual plans and healthcare payments are n't taxed but if you do n't use the healthcare that would have been a waste w2 no benefits assuming your salary here falls between the 1099 and the w2 with benefits it seems like a good compromise for your situation

i know i 'm late to the party but a couple of as a recent bitcoin advocate i may be out of place in this subreddit as i come from a primarily technological background not a financial one    gt is not a currency it 's a store of value because it is not widely accepted as tender by most people   bitcoin is not a currency yet but because it does not have widespread adoption like other revolutionary technologies there is an inflection bitcoin adoption price where adoption goes from hardly anyone to almost everyone very quickly example   gt;even as a store of value it 's not very good it 's volatile and the fact that there is a limited supply of bitcoin is not a good thing sure in the short run it results in speculation that drives up the price of a coin and makes it all the rage among gamblers but i do n't think anyone can explain how if used on a larger scale would n't lead to deflation in the price of goods   to me this is basic supply and demand and it would in theory become less volatile and more stable following mass adoption bitcoin has virtually no inflation and i agree that this could lead to the deflation of goods but only insofar as that valuation is determined in bitcoin for example milk is still $ 2 but as the value of bitcoin fluctuates i may pay .001 btc or btc for that milk it 's important to remember we 're dealing with a digital asset in an increasingly more world a point of sale device like we use for credit cards could certainly tackle that conversion in the future    gt;also at the end of the day fiat currencies are based on trust and accountability of the government how does bitcoin or any other online currency solve that problem there 's no accountability and it effectively acts as as an anti currency fueled by mistrust in the establishment   this is the best part of bitcoin understanding the incentives if you follow that supply and demand logic then it is in the best interest of everyone who uses bitcoin that the bitcoin software and the system itself be reliable and secure the software is open source so anyone can see how it works and where its flaws and weaknesses are and it is still standing strong after 8 years the biggest weakness so far has been in software updates and changes to the core protocol without any central structure i.e. accountability it can be slow to reach a democratic consensus is such a way that does n't split the blockchain or the network this has led to some of the recent extreme volatility    bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies have tremendous potential to disrupt existing financial institutions the private blockchains by banks are at this point just watch?v = = at some point these institutions will realize that they ca n't create their own facebook they need to find ways to become part of the new facebook market

changes in graduated income tax rates do n't necessarily drive how you should allocate money to a traditional vs roth account true for both ira or 401k what does drive this decision is what your income tax rate is now compared to what you believe your rate will be when you retire so if you expect the tax rate change to still be in effect when you retire it does n't matter if the change is a tax increase or decrease your previous allocation could likely remain the same this means that if congress passed the change effective immediately it would be too late for you to make a meaningful adjustment but if congress passes the change effective next year then most likely your tax rate will decrease for next year meaning you are probably better off switching all roth allocations to traditional and then switching them back to whatever allocations you have now for next year the reverse would be true if you knew about an upcoming tax increase in which case you would load up roth this year and then switch back to whatever you had for next year that being said regarding after the fact considerations i suppose it would be fair to say that if the country is accustomed to a higher tax rate and then rates are dropped if spending is not cut to make up for it then rates would likely have to go up again in the future to make up the difference if you believe that will happen then roths would become a little more attractive since rates would be lower than what you expect them to be when you retire as a side note if you ever had reason to believe that congress was going to move away from the graduated income tax structure all bets are off for example if the income tax was replaced with a tax on spending such as the then in the interim period roths would become worthless and you 'd want to switch to until the change went into effect and then once in effect both roths and would be pointless

your impression about banks and bankers is very wrong   wall street banks can and often do lose in transactions   in fact banks go bankrupt and/or require massive bailouts to survive because they sometimes lose a ton of money   the business of investment banking often involves bearing risk for customers which by definition means they lose some of the time   generally the risks they take on individual transactions are not large enough to bring the whole bank down but sometimes they are   banking is a job like any other except that it has more risk than most anyway to your point how do underwriters make money on shares that fall in value before the sale   on the commission   the issuing company will normally pay the investment bank a percentage of the funds raised in the offering regardless of the price   of course it 's possible for the bank to still lose money if their contract stipulates a minimum price and they are not able to meet it   in that case the bank may lose on that offering contradicting your preconceived notion by the way one other question implicit in your post why was the secondary offering considered bad news   if the ceo and other insiders have private information that indicates that the stock is overvalued then doing a secondary offering at the inflated price will greatly enrich them   because this happens some times investors are wary about secondary offerings   this makes companies that would otherwise do a secondary offering shy away from it even if shares are not overpriced   therefore if a company is doing a secondary offering the market is likely to worry that the stock is overvalued even at a reduced price

as noted in 's comment buried in the comments debate on the other answer and all credit for this answer should be due to him a significant issue with the scheme as originally in the question up to £ 11 k pa is that there is actually a cap on the maintenance part for over 60s on page 28 of this student finance how you 're assessed and paid document it says if you 're 60 or over on the first day of the first academic year of    your course you can apply for a maintenance loan of up to £    depending on your household income your loan will be reduced by £ 1    for every £ of household income over £ 25,000 up to £ if    your household income is more than this you wo n't get any maintenance    loan i 'd consider that to make this route considerably less attractive and maybe that 's the intention of the rule   although i might not think that was so true if i was actually on the uk 's state pension of £ 6 k a year and desperate   however i was originally thinking more in terms of comparing the accumulated free money over the three years with the uk 's average and woefully inadequate pension pot of £ 50 k rather than with income i 'll leave those who found the idea of exploiting government incentives so outrageous to ponder the at least as troubling ethics of discriminating against people based on their age especially when that government apparently likes the idea of older people retraining just to complicate things i note that one of the possible criteria for applying for a special support grant an alternative to a maintenance loan is being over 60   that 's a grant not a loan and does n't have to be repaid but abusing that would seem even to me to be on a par with faking disability to get benefits or similar

stephen 's answer is the 100 correct one made with the common economics assumption that people are rational a company that never has paid dividends is still worth something to people because of its potential to start paying dividends later and it is often better to grow now and payoff later however the actual answer is much more because people are not rational and the stock market is no longer about investing in companies or earning dividends most of the value of a stock is for the same reason that gold stamps coins and bitcoins and australian houses are worth anything that is because enough people say it is worth something*. even stocks that pay dividends very few people buy it for dividends they buy it because they believe someone else will be willing to buy it for slightly more shortly after different traders have different timeframes ranging from seconds to months houses and stock are of course partially valuable due to the fundamentals but the major reason they are purchased is just to resell at a profit

your friend probably can not deposit the check to your u.s. bank account u.s. banks that i 've worked with will not accept a deposit from someone who is not an owner of the account i do n't know why not if some stranger wants to make unauthorized deposits to my account why should i object but that 's the common rule   you could endorse the check your friend could then deposit it to his own account or cash it and then transfer the money to you in a variety of ways   but i think it would be easier to just deposit the check in your account wherever it is you live most banks have no problem with depositing a foreign check there may be a fairly long delay before you can get access to the money while the check clears through the system   i do n't know exactly what you mean by a prize check but assuming that this is taxable income yes i assume the u.s. government would want their hard earned share of your money these days you can pay u.s. taxes on line if you have a credit card if you have not already paid u.s. taxes for the year you should make an estimated payment i.e. you ca n't wait until april 15 of the next year you have to pay most or all of the taxes you will owe in the calendar year you earned it

chase ’s tellers do not have the authority to close an account that ’s a bit of bullshit yes a teller themselves do not have the authority to close an account but if you are the owner of the account and you state to the teller that you would like to withdraw all of your money into a cashier ’s check so as to close the account they can not refuse you since they fed you this nonsense they might play some delaying tactics like calling a manager and having them talk to you tough the window and such but just stand your ground and state you would like to close the account and withdraw all funds now if they were extra slimy and if you were to withdraw all funds but they let the zero balance float for a bit so they could claim a fee on you bullshit once again you should take any notice of fees coupled with a dated receipt showing the date you withdrew funds go to the branch and complain to the manager right away state clearly you will not pay any fees and you would like written verification that your account is closed also and this goes without saying and is implied above but be sure to keep copies of all if your receipts and transactions if they state they want to hold onto something demand they make a copy and for your own safety sanity keep your own backup copies somewhere safe at home all of that said i have seen modern consumer bankers really act like a bunch of in the past decade or so but generally this has still been an exception to the rule the reality is if you do not want to have your money in their bank it ’s in their best interest to let go of you as soon as possible especially if you have a small amount of money such as $ 1,500 at stake remember your rights as a consumer remember it ’s your money and remember and remind them that you can report them if they deny you reasonable access to your funds

i do n't know why your comment got downvoted because it 's perfectly sensible my only issue with extending the sol is what basis to use when determining what the statute should be i 'm sure there is or at least was a perfectly logical reason for setting it at 5 years i do n't have the idea of what the basis was mind you but i 'm sure there was one that being said extending the statute for future crimes solely because the prosecutors let it run out this time strikes me as being on shaky footing

fwiw i 've got a printed invoice that was included in a shipment of books that i received in july 2013 in the right side side panel at the bottom and in fine print it reads   inc.    410 avenue    north seattle wa    gst registration number no tps    etc if i view the same order online at the on screen version does not have that detail   interestingly at the bottom of the online invoice page it says please note this is not a vat invoice that probably should 've said gst hst for canada and not vat which is presumably for the united kingdom   so it would appear that amazon may only print their gst hst details on the shipped invoice printout which made me wonder did you purchase something that was fulfilled electronically i.e. no physical shipment to you e.g. a kindle book an app or a service like cloud drive if no physical invoice shipped means one does n't get the required gst details then there 's still a canadian tax requirement amazon is n't fulfilling on such invoices though not as broad an issue as you suspected on the other hand if you did get a physical invoice and your comment confirmed you did then what you were seeking was most likely printed on that version just as mine was at the moment i 'm not sure why amazon would n't also include the gst number on electronic versions of invoices whether received by email or viewed on the web site but if i find out more i 'll update my answer later

yes and no   almost everybody wants to own their own business and they would gladly piss away an investor 's money trying to make it happen it 's not just funds that are required i 'm sure we both know some people that should not start a business of their own no matter how it 's financed   one of the big barriers to starting a business is regulation we all want products that are safe to use and produced responsibly but if the regulations are such that only a handful of the largest companies are capable of compliance then those companies can be assured they will never have any credible competition regulation is a very careful balancing act   but your question was n't what stops new businesses new businesses from forming you asked what creates more business owners   a lot of that is actually cultural to be a business owner you have to have a lot of specific personality traits that most people do n't have you have to be motivated to work hard passionate about what you want to do organized enough to approach it consistently analytical enough to create a solid business plan that makes sense and rational enough to know when to quit if it 's not working finally and this is a big one you have to be able to sell that passion to investors prospective customers and your first employees the best widget in the world wo n't sell if it 's being marketed by someone who does n't know how to market things   what we need to do is find a way to provide consulting and resources to people who are developing those skills

you need to know loans are not free and they are not a way to solve budget issues if you are having problems with making your income last over your expenses you do not need to add another expense in the form of a loan what you really need to do is create a budget track and understand your expenses and then decide if you should focus on raising   your net income level or cutting down expenses keep up with your budget   you can reduce the frequency but you need to track your spending really for the rest of you life   it is just a good habit like personal hygiene once you understand your money via your budget you can start to save money into an emergency fund that will cover you during the times of i say it very plainly as if it is super easy but it requires will power and the foresight to understand that if you do n't manage your money nobody else will   being sane with your money is one of the most important things you can do now to improve your future improvement has an excellent first step with budgeting   allocate money to be spent for the next month from money made during    the previous month this will build a cushion into your budget and    alleviate the fear that the op mentioned

first you need to understand the difference in discussing types of investments and types of accounts certificate of deposits cds money market accounts mutual funds and stocks are all examples of types of investments 401(k ira roth ira and taxable accounts are all examples of types of accounts in general those are separate decisions to make   you can invest in any type of investment inside any type of account   so your question really has two different parts    tax advantaged retirement accounts vs. standard taxable accounts fdic insured cds vs. at risk investments such as stock mutual funds retirement accounts are special accounts allowed by the federal government that allow you to delay or in some cases completely avoid paying taxes on your investment   the trade off for these accounts is that in general you can not access any of the money that you put into these accounts until you get to retirement age without paying a steep penalty   these accounts exist to encourage citizens to save for their own retirement   examples of retirement accounts include 401(k and iras standard taxable accounts have no tax advantages but no restrictions either   you can put money in and take money out whenever you like   however anything that your investment earns is taxable each year inside any of these accounts you can invest in fdic insured bank accounts such as savings accounts or cds or you can invest in any number of non insured investments including money market accounts bonds mutual funds stocks precious metals etc something you need to understand about investing in general is that your potential returns are directly related to the amount of risk that you take on   investing in an insured investment which is guaranteed by the government to never lose its value will result in the lowest potential investment returns that you can get interest bearing savings accounts are currently paying less than 1 interest   a cd will get you a slightly higher interest rate in exchange for you agreeing not to withdraw your money for a period of time however it takes a long time for your investments to grow with these investments   if you are earning 1 it takes 72 years for your investment to double if you are willing to take some risk you can earn much more with your investments   bonds are often considered quite safe with a bond you loan money to a government or corporation and they pay you back with interest   the risk comes from the possibility that the government or corporation wo n't pay you back so it is important to choose a bond from an entity that you trust stocks are shares in for profit companies   your potential investment gain is unlimited but it is risky as stocks can go down in value and companies can close   however it is important to note that if you take the largest 500 stocks together s&p 500 the average value has consistently gone up over the long term   in the last 35 years this average value has gone up about 11   at this rate your investment would double in less than 7 years to avoid the risk of picking a losing stock you can invest in a mutual fund which is a collection of stocks bonds or other investments   the idea is that you can with one investment invest in many stocks essentially earning the average performance of all the stocks   there is still risk as the market can be down as a whole but you are insulated from any one stock being bad because you are diversified if you are investing for something in the long term future such as retirement stock mutual funds provide a good rate of return at an low level of risk in my opinion

traditional insurance agent guy here   there is no right answer in my opinion because your individual needs can not be generalized      there are a variety of factors that influence the price charged to you including but not limited to your past claims history geographic location credit profile and the carrier 's book of business itself   this is just a small sampling in reality their pricing calculations may be far more complicated   the point is there is no one size fits all carrier    my agency works with 15 different carriers   sometimes we can offer the best combination of coverage and cost to a prospective client that beats their existing coverage other times we are nowhere close to being competitive    the most important thing you can do is find a person site company you can trust and one that does not take advantage of you   insurance policies are complex and getting the best deal may oftentimes mean lessening coverage without realizing it   so i would recommend using whatever service channel online phone local agent that 's most convenient and for you and otherwise shop around once every year or two to make sure you 're still getting the most for your money

for a job doing that kind of stuff what is preferred is 4 year undergrad at ivy league school + 2 year mba at ivy league school and then several more years of experience which you can sort of get by interning while in school this will of course saddle you with debt which is counterintuitive to your plans basically the easy way up is percentage based compensation without knowing the right people you will get a piss poor salary regardless of what you do in the beginning so portfolio managers earn money by percentage based fees and can manage millions and billions real estate agents can earn money by percentage based commissions if they close a property and other business venture owners can do the same thing the problem with how to trade books is that they are outdated by the time they are published so you should just stick with literature that teaches a fundamental knowledge of the products you want to trade make money from ultimately regardless of how you get earn your initial capital you will still need to be an individual investor to grow your own capital this has nothing to do with being a portfolio manager even highly paid individuals on wall street are in debt to lavish expenditures and have zero capital for their own investments hope this helps you really need to be thinking in a certain way to just quickly deduce good ideas from bad ideas

the first 3 are the same as owning stock in a company would be measured in shares and would constitute some percentage of the overall shares outstanding if there are 100 shares in the company in total then owning 80 shares is owning 80 is the same as owning 80 of the common stock this would be the typical ownership case though there can also be restricted stock as something to note here convertible debt would likely carry interest charges as well as the choice at the end of becoming stock in the company in this case until the conversion is done the stock is n't issued and thus is n't counted taking the above example one could have a note that could be worth 10 shares but until the conversion is done the debt is still debt some convertible debt could carry options or warrants for the underlying stock as there was the berkshire convertible notes years ago that carried a negative interest rate that was studied in the negative coupon bond if you want an example here options would have the right but not the obligation to buy the stock where there are incentive stock options to research this in more depth in this case one could choose to not exercise the option and thus no stock changes hands this is where some companies will experience dilution of ownership as employees and management may be given options that put more shares out to the public issuing debt would n't change the ownership and is n't direct ownership unless the company goes through a restructuring where the creditors become the new stock holders in the case of a chapter 11 situation in the us note that this is n't really investing in a small business as much as it is making a loan to the company that will be paid back in cash if the company runs into problems then the creditor could try to pursue the assets of the company to be repaid

first it is worth noting the two sided nature of the contracts long one currency short a second make leverage in currencies over a diverse set of clients generally less of a problem   in equities since most margin investors are long equities making it more likely that large margin calls will all be made at the same time also it 's worth noting that high frequency traders often highly levered make up a large portion of all volume in all liquid markets in equity markets for instance   would you call that grossly artificial   what is that volume number really telling us anyway in that case the major players holding long term positions in the fx markets are large banks non investment arm central banks and corporations and unlike equity markets which can nearly slow to a trickle currency markets need to keep trading just for many of those corporations banks to do business   this kind of depth allows these brokers to even consider offering leverage   i 'm not suggesting that it is a good idea for these brokers but the liquidity in currency markets is much deeper than their costumers

your first home can be up to £ 450,000 today but that figure is unlikely to stay the same over 40 years the government would need to raise it in line with inflation otherwise in 40 years you wo n't be able to buy quite so much with it if inflation averages 2 over your 40 year investment period say £ 450,000 would buy you roughly what £ 200,000 would today higher rates of inflation will reduce your purchasing power even faster you pay stamp duty on a house for a house worth £ 450,000 that would be around £ 12,500 there are also estate agent 's fees typically 1 2 of the purchase price although you might be able to do better and legal fees if you sell quickly you 'd only be able to access the balance of the money less all those taxes and fees that 's quite a bit of your bonus lost so why did you tie your money up in a lisa for all those years instead of investing in the stock market directly one other thing to note is that you buy a lisa from your post tax income you pay into a pension using your pre tax income so if you 're investing for your retirement then a pension will start with a 20 bonus if you 're a lower rate taxpayer and a whopping 40 bonus if you 're a higher rate taxpayer if you 're a higher rate taxpayer a pension is much better value

as the option approaches expiry the delta will approach zero or one depending on whether you 're in or out of the money this might be easiest to if you look at the option value as a function of the stock price and then realise that the delta is the slope of that curve now as we get closer to expiry time value fades away and we get closer and closer to the intrinsic value which looks like this hockey stick as you see close to expiry if you 're out of the money you have nothing with delta zero while if you 're in the money you have a forward with delta one

not to mention people only shop at walmart because they have to    whether it 's small budgets or quite literally no other choices in town most people do n't like walmart but shop there anyway it has a bad reputation for many things they often have lower quality versions of the same products available elsewhere because they bully suppliers into lowering prices they also steal products to be marketed under their great value brand they bleed local economies by underpaying employees and offering no benefits and they are seen as the low class option compared to other stores like target   if there was another option people would take it as soon as amazon the shipping system walmart will be a thing of the past sam 's club might still have a shot though costco seems to be edging them out too

how would you respond to these cases limited card options if someone has a bad credit record the cards available may only be those with an annual fee   not everyone will have your credit record and thus access to the cards you have some annual fees may be waived in some cases thus someone may have a card with a fee that could be waived if enough transactions are done on the card   thus if someone gives enough business to the credit card company they will waive the fee on the point of the rewards if the card is from a specific retailer there could be a 10 discount for using that card and if the person purchases more than a couple thousand dollars worth from that store this is a savings of $ 200 from the retail prices compared to what would happen in other cases that more than offsets the annual fee   if someone likes to be a handyman and visits home depot often there may be programs to give rewards in this case credit cards can be useful for doing on line purchases flight reservations rental cars and a few other purchases that to with cash or debit can be difficult if not close to impossible some airline cards have a fee but presumably the perks provide a benefit that outweigh that fee over the year i 'm thinking of the citibank cards tied to american airlines first year free then an $ 85 fee

they believe that it reduces the risk that revenue canada will deem you to be an employee and make them pay a whole pile of tax ei cpp and so on that should have been paid if you had been hired as an employee it 's my recollection that the employer gets dinged for both the employee and employer share of those withholdings and generally the employer 's share is larger than yours so they really want to prevent it there 's a revenue canada publication about whether you 're an employee or not there 's nothing on it about being incorporated but still employers feel more protected when their contracts are incorporated   we did work as a sole proprietorship at the very beginning so that we could deduct our losses against employment income earned earlier in the year before we started the business you can find clients who will take you on we incorporated once the losses were over with basically we had bought the equipment and office supplies we needed to get started it 's a simple and relatively inexpensive thing to do and gives clients a sense of protection it wo n't protect you from your own poor decisions since you 'll be a director of the firm

the way i see it corporation tax is not fundamentally different from vat they are both a tax on revenue minus expenses just what those expenses are is different i think the main advantage of corporation tax is that it allows capital expenditure to be spread over several years although as i said this makes it more complicated and i believe that there are some capital allowances for vat as well   one advantage of vat is that sales in one country are taxed in that country before the money can be sent abroad it seems simple and fair to split the tax burden between jurisdictions according to how many sales were made in each

i would say similar rules apply in the us   if you have a net loss from rental property you certainly can claim that loss against your personal income there are various rules around this though that make it a bit less clear cut   if you are a real estate professional which means you spend at least 750 hours per year working on your rental properties or related activities then all losses are deductible against any other ordinary income you have if you are n't a real estate professional then your rental income is considered a passive activity and losses you can count against regular income are limited to $ 25,000 per year with a carry forward provision and begin to phase out entirely if your income is between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000 so the law here is structured to allow most small time investors to take rental real estate losses against their ordinary income but the income phase out provision is designed to prevent the wealthy from using rental property losses to avoid taxation

will the proportion of my payments towards interest eventually go down   yes today would be a good day to do a web search for amortization schedule you will quickly learn how to compute precisely how much of each payment goes to interest and how much goes to principal given different payment choices would it be wiser to spend more each month on loan payments that depends on your goals and resources which we know nothing about if you have extra money you could spend it on debt reduction or you could spend it on an investment that pays more money in growth or dividends than the interest you 'd save or you could decide that the longer you have that loan sure the more interest you 'll pay but inflation will make future money less valuable basically by taking out a loan you have chosen to gamble that the thing you bought with the loaned money will be worth the cost of the interest payments in the future adjusted for inflation the bank on the other hand is gambling that you 're good for the debt and that they can make a reasonable profit off it if you have more money to gamble with which bet is the wisest one is really up to you would it be smarter to try to pay off one loan before the other if you want to pay off a loan early then always choose the loan with the higher interest rate should i start making bi weekly payments instead of monthly that 's roughly equivalent to paying off the principal by one additional payment a year there are two reasons to do so   the first is that the total interest will be lower and the loan will be paid off faster you can work out exactly how much with your new found skill at amortization computation    the second is the simple convenience of knowing that your budget for each pay period is the same   that convenience is worth something is it worth the amount extra you 'll be paying every year again this is for you to decide work out how much extra you 're paying per year and how much you 're saving in the long run and compare that against the benefit

got it i can definitely see how it can come across that way especially with all of these big tech companies lining up against the proposal my understanding is that a lot of that is more driven by their size than anything else the media focuses on the impacts to amazon and facebook because they 're huge companies and it 's easier to get information on them   but when it comes to who would get hurt the most by removing nn it 's actually small businesses and startups that would suffer the most in a world without net neutrality isps would be able to provide access to web services at different speeds for example if you are a comcast customer if comcast has a deal with amazon prime they can make it so that your access to competing services like netflix and hulu are moving so slow that it will be hard to use anything other than amazon prime video   now if that happens it will be annoying for companies like facebook netflix google etc to have to pay extra for internet users to be able to use them but they could do it they have the money the people who would struggle are people who own smaller businesses and smaller websites when they 're just starting out they wo n't have the money to pay the isps to let people access them and as a result they could be essentially locked out of many marketplaces this is the argument made by people who say that removing net neutrality will stifle small business removing the regulation would create this built in structural advantage for large established businesses and leave smaller businesses locked out

if the $ 9000 was deposited in february 2016 then it must be declared on your 2015 taxes not 2016 you never have a choice about when to declare a contribution the only choice you have is when to claim it as a deduction and it 's very rarely a good idea to delay claiming it you may want to take a look at your notice of assessment from tax year 2015 to see if the cra noticed the error and adjusted your return for you the text portion would usually mention any such adjustments if you can not find your it can be accessed by logging in to cra 's my account service if your 2015 rrsp contribution amount was not already adjusted for you then this service is also a good way to request a change to your 2015 return   though most people do n't realize it you technically gain your contribution room based on the previous year 's income on january 1st it 's just that you usually do n't know your exact income until you get your t4 this means that on jan 1 2016 you received that $ 6000 room and thus despite being wrong about which tax year the $ 9000 is declared you are still right about being over by $ 3000 you are allowed a little wiggle room on your limit but only $ 2000 so you 'll be charged 1 per month for every dollar in excess of $ 2000 over on january 1 2017 you would have received more contribution room based on your 2016 income and so as of then you are no longer over your limit that should mean that your penalty applies for 11 months for a total of $ 110 you can try calling the cra to see if they will waive or reduce your penalty on the grounds that you were unaware of your employer 's deposit best of luck to answer your final question yes that 3 k over contribution will now basically just be reducing your available contribution room for 2017 think of it as having room left between february 2016 and jan 2017 and then more room was added in january making that a positive number so you do n't need to withdraw or do anything further to fix things other than paying your penalty or getting it waived

i think the answer to this question depends on how much you trust yourself most people are wonderful at deceiving themselves i 'd personally not trust myself i 'll use 's points for the pitfalls some people get into you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights   this is actually the risk i 've seen many people do they 'll blow their money in one semester under the assumption that they 'll just earn more in summer and keep it for expenses or the future another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit no credit in the usa is actually a good standing many sensible banks or credit unions will happily give people with no credit a loan this makes intuitive sense if you think about it imagine two people with the same income one owes money regularly to multiple sources and the other has no debt obligations which one are you loaning money to simplifying things a lot great credit is best followed by no credit then good credit and then bad credit the advantage of great credit over no credit is simply that some institutions in some sectors do n't have the policies in place to process no credit people no credit people plan to not apply for credit often for self explanatory reasons so this is a point

gt it is myth that companies can get a monopoly and raise prices by themselves they require government to do it   the only thing required is that a government exist to enforce private property rights once that is in place then a company with sufficient funding can buy ownership of a vital natural resource once this has been accomplished then there is little that any competitor can do to break this monopoly

and where does that spending by the government usually end up right back into the economy putting that tax money into the hands of the wealthy means they will do what they do best hoard it if you have an economy that 's built on a certain amount of spending by the government then cut that off because you decrease the government 's cash flow then you have to have an equal response in terms of spending kansas showed that most wealthy people do not spend the money they get to keep from lower taxes that in turn causes a strain on the economy and you end up with both fiscal woes at the state level and economic woes for businesses and individuals that 's what happened in kansas and that 's what will happen at the federal level if these tax cuts are enacted this is fine for the wealthy they win in this scenario but they are the only ones who do instead the tax cuts should be focused on the lower and middle classes who will actually go out and spend that money but as written these tax cuts disproportionately favor the wealthy who will not spend to help individuals and small businesses

firstly playing the lottery is not investing it is gambling the odds in gambling are always against you and with the house   secondly no one would ever give you a payout of 3 to 1 when the odds are 50:50 unless they were looking to give away money even when you place your chips on either red or black on a roulette table your payout if you are correct is 100 double your money however the odds of winning are less than 50 there are 18 18 blacks and 2 greens 0 and 00 even if you place your chips on one single number your payout will be but your odds of winning are the odds are always with the house if you want to play the lotto use some money you do n't need and expect to lose have some fun and enjoy yourself if you get any small winnings gambling should be looked at as a source of entertainment not a source of investing if you take gambling more serious than this then you might have a problem

i am lucky enough to have chosen a flexible mortgage that allows me to change payment amounts at certain very lenient intervals to a minimum amount   so when i was laid off the first thing i did was call my bank to lower my payments to a level that allowed me some breathing room at my new lower income   if and when my family 's income increases i 'll re adjust my payments to a higher amount    but if you 're concerned about the what in this economy i 'd definitely choose a mortgage that allows for flexibility so that you do n't lose your house if you do n't have to particularly if your situation is temporary

it 's not possible to determine whether you can expect a refund or whether you are claiming the right number of exemptions from the information given    if your wife were not working and you did not do independent contracting then the answer would be much simpler   however in this case we must also factor in how much your contracting brings in since you must pay income tax on that as well as medicare and probably social security whether you are filing jointly or separately and your wife 's income from her business    there are also other factors such as whether you 'll be claiming certain child care expenses and certain tax credits which may phase out depending on your income    if you can accurately estimate your total household income for the year and separate that into income from wages contracting and your wife 's business as well as your expenses for things like state and local income and property taxes then you can make a very reasonable estimate about your total tax burden including the self employment taxes on your non wage income and then determine whether you are having enough tax withheld from your paycheck   some people may find that they should have additional tax withheld to compensate for these expenses see irs w-4 line 6

its almost always better to pay off loans sooner rather than later    being debt free is amazingly    however in your case i 'd be reluctant to make significant headway on a loan repayment program   here 's why the best investment you can make right now is in yourself   completing your education should be the top priority   the next would be to meet the requirements of a job after received after school is complete   so what i would do is estimate the amount of money it would take to complete school   add to that an estimate of an amount to move to a new city and setup a household    that amount should be held in reserve   anything above that can used to pay down loans once you complete school and get settled into a job you can then take that money and also throw it at your loans

as has already been mentioned measure change measure   stopping power drain in the items you mentioned is going to save you very little electricity or money there are much larger power users in your home that can be tackled first if you have a fridge freezer and electric water heater on time of use billing shifting their energy usage to off peak hours can yield significant monetary savings i have put my water heater on a timer that turns the thing on 3 hours before i get up and shower and turns off just before shower time i get more than enough hot water for showers and the heater is n't maintaining a tank of hot water during the day or night when i do n't need it same can be done with your fridge and freezer set the fridge a little colder and run it off peak and your food will stay cold frozen during the day   note that while putting the water heater on a timer may get you both money and electricity doing the same for the fridge and freezer will only get you financial savings as you time shift your electric usage i was able to get a 20 saving on my electric bill by time shifting my water heater and fridge your mileage may vary

the obvious disadvantage of paying loans off more slowly is that you will pay a lot more in total interest which means less savings and less disposable income on the long term unless you are doing something with the money which produces more income than the interest costs you this is very much penny wise pound foolish if you are n't making money by paying that money all you can do is loose money at the slowest rate you can afford you do that by paying off the loan as quickly as you can afford to do so it 's up to you to look seriously at your finances and decide what your real needs are how you 're going to meet them and how much you can afford beyond that while still paying off the loans as quickly as possible now will cost you much more than you expect layer due to the compounding you will have missed out on really   see the questions about how to start saving investing for answers that discuss how to prioritize your money there are some steps you should be taking asap if you have n't already done so

i like muro questions no i do n't think they do   because for me as a personal finance investor type just trying to save for retirement they mean nothing if i can not tell what the basic business model of a company is and how that business model is profitable and makes money then that is a no buy for me   if i do understand it they i can do some more looking into the stock and company and see if i want to purchase i buy index funds that are indexes of industries and companies i can understand   i let a fund manager worry about the details but i get myself in the right ballpark and i use a simple logic test to get there not the word of a rating agency if belong in the system as a whole i could not really say   i could not possibly do the level of accounting research and other investigation that rating agencies do so even if the business model is sound i might lose an investment because the company is not an ethical one   again that is the job of my fund manager to determine   furthermore and i mitigate that risk by buying indexes instead of individual stock

irs pub 521 has all the information you need expenses reimbursed if you are reimbursed for your expenses and you    use the cash method of accounting you can deduct your expenses either    in the year you paid them or in the year you received the    reimbursement if you use the cash method of accounting you can    choose to deduct the expenses in the year you are reimbursed even    though you paid the expenses in a different year see choosing when to    deduct next if you deduct your expenses and you receive the    reimbursement in a later year you must include the reimbursement in    your income on form 1040 line 21 this is not unusual anybody who moves near the end of the year can have this problem the 39 week time test also can be an issue that span over 2 tax years i would take the deduction for the expenses as soon a i could and then count the income in the later year if they pay me back if they do so before april 15th then i would put them on the same tax form to make things easier

summary the corporation pays tax on dividends it receives and gets a tax refund at the same rate when it pays dividends out according to the corporate tax rates for 2015 are according to page 3 the federal and provincial tax rates shown in the tables apply to investment income    earned by a other than capital gains and dividends received from canadian    corporations the rates that apply to capital gains are one half of the rates shown in    the tables dividends received from canadian corporations are deductible in computing    regular part i tax but may be subject to part iv tax calculated at a rate of 33 1/3 if i understand that correctly this means that a corporation in quebec pays on investment income other than capital gains and dividends on capital gains and on dividends i 'm marking this answer as community wiki so anyone can correct these numbers if they are incorrect update according to page 22 the tax rate on taxable dividends received from certain canadian corporations is 33 1/3 further this is refunded to the corporation through the refundable dividend tax on hand mechanism at a rate of $ 1 for every $ 3 of taxable dividends paid my interpretation is as follows if the corporation receives $ 100 of dividends from another company it pays $ tax if that corporation then pays out $ 100 of dividends at a later time it receives a tax refund of $ meaning the original tax gets refunded note the first line is for the 2015 tax year while the second link is for the 2014 tax year the numbers might be a little different but the tax refund process remains the same

the only fair thing to do is to let each of you pay their own loans that way your brother will probably get out of debt faster and starts saving or investing assuming equal down payments while you 'll be stuck with your loan for a while longer if you want to minimize the interests you have to pay you could simply borrow money from your brother that way he 'll contribute towards your loans and you will know exactly how much you owe him your brother may lend you money interest free or you could agree on an interest rate which is lower than what you pay on your loans which will somewhat compensate your brother and still be beneficial to you it still wo n't be fair though because your brother might be able to invest his extra money with better interest rate and lending money to you would prevent that

there are two solid years of gen ed classes you can take i do recommend taking them first for lots of reasons your major specific classes will mostly be upper level and you will benefit from taking classes in a similar order as their class codes indicate they are meant to be taken 100 's first then 200 's so on at least roughly you are n't going to get to any finance classes for a while anyway as i can pretty much guarantee you are going to need macro and micro econ and two accounting classes before you can even take a basic finance class so do n't worry so much about your major right now

i asked this question in another sub but i thought i might also get answers here    i was just wondering how pension funds or investment firms calculate the interest that they give to their members or clients in the us or whichever country you are from    i ask this because i have a gut feeling that the national pension fund in my country does it the wrong way and is basically cheating people so i wanted to make a comparison with other countries forgive me if i 'm wrong and there 's nothing to worry about    ok so what they do is collect money in a given financial year which starts in july and ends in june let 's say they collect 100 million in 2010 11 they then invest this 100 million in the year july 2011 june 2012 after deducting admin costs and all that interest for this 2010 11 money is declared on october 1st 2012    that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong    they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems    someone help me understand if i 'm wrong   thanks

i have looked at the conditions of a car rental company and i believe it provides the answers upon pick up of your vehicle you must present a valid credit card    used to make the booking and which must be in the name if    you do not have a valid credit card we will accept your debit card    when you pick up your vehicle however as we can not reserve credit to    cover the potential damage or costs you will need to take    and a fuel tank of fuel at the start of the rental we will    refund the value of the unused fuel at the end of the rental unless    otherwise agreed with you visa mastercard and american express    are accepted credit card or third party insurance important in case of damage we    will charge you the incurred amount up to the excess you will then    need to reclaim this amount from the provider of the credit card or    third party insurer we strongly recommend that you fully read and    understand the terms and conditions of any cover provided by your    chosen provider before you decline any of our optional services    without our should you damage the vehicle during your    rental period we will charge you the corresponding amount up to the    excess regardless of whether you can subsequently reclaim this amount    from the provider of the credit card or the third party insurer in    the event you would like to dispute any of the above mentioned charges    you should send your request by mail or email to the location    state on your rental agreement from that we can conclude that it 's likely that disputes with customers in case of damage cost a lot to car rental companies and for the 2 above reasons demanding a credit card may alleviate it
