thanks for the extra info on the property tax so it sounds like it 's going to be $ 1500 for a $ 150k house i 'm sure even if it 's sold for $ 150 the state might still value it at $ 15k and you 'll end up with $ 150 in property taxes which is basically nothing

as others have pointed out the value of apple 's stock and the nasdaq are most likely highly correlated for a number of reasons not least among them the fact that apple is part of the nasdaq however because numerous factors affect the entire market or at least a significant subset of it it makes sense to develop a strategy to remove all of these factors without resorting to use of an index using an index to remove the effect of these factors might be a good idea but you run the risk of potentially introducing other factors that affect the index but not apple i do n't know what those would be but it 's a valid theoretical concern   in your question you said you wanted to subtract them from each other and only see an apple curve moving around a horizontal line the basic strategy i plan to use is similar but even simpler instead of apple 's stock price we can plot the difference between its stock price on business day t and business day which gives us this graph which is essentially what you 're looking for   while this is only the it should give you a basic idea of one procedure that 's used extensively to do just what you 're asking i do n't know of a website that will automatically give you such a metric but you could download the price data and use excel stata etc to analyze this   the reasoning behind this methodology builds heavily on time series econometrics which for the sake of simplicity i wo n't go into in great detail but i 'll provide a brief explanation to satisfy the curious in simple econometrics most time series are by a mathematical process comprised of several components in the simplest case the equations for a time series containing one or more of the above components are of the form that taking the first difference the procedure i used above will leave only the random component however if you want to pursue this rigorously you would first perform a set of tests to determine if these components exist and if is the best procedure to remove those that are present once you 've reduced the series to its random component you can use that component to examine how the process underlying the stock price has changed over the years in my example i highlighted steve jobs death on the chart because it 's one factor that may have led to the increased standard deviation volatility of apple 's stock price although charts are somewhat subjective it appears that the volatility was already increasing before his death which could reflect other factors or the increasing expectation that he would n't be running the company in the near future for whatever reason my discussion of time series and the definitions of various components relies heavily on walter 's text applied econometric time series if you 're interested simple mathematical representations and a few relevant graphs are found on pages 1 3 another related procedure would be to take the logarithm of the of the current day 's price and the previous day 's price in apple 's case doing so yields this graph   this reduces the overall magnitude of the values and allows you to see potential outliers more clearly this produces a similar effect to the difference taken above because the log of a is the same as the difference of the logs the significant drop depicted during the year 2000 occurred between september 28th and september 29th where the stock price dropped from to apart from the general environment of the dot com bubble bursting i 'm not sure why this occurred another excellent resource for time series econometrics is james hamilton 's book time series analysis it 's considered a classic in the field of econometrics although similar to book it 's fairly advanced for most investors   i used stata to generate the graphs above with data from yahoo finance there are a couple of nuances in this code related to how i defined the time series and the presence of weekends but they do n't affect the overall concept for a robust analysis i would make a few quick tweaks that would make the graphs less appealing without more work but would allow for more accurate econometrics

step one contact the collection agency tell them that they have the wrong person and the same name is just a coincidence i would not give them my correct social security number birth date or other identifying information this could be a total scam for the purpose of getting you to give them such personal identifying information so they can perform an identity theft even if it is a legitimate debt collection agency if they are and/or incompetent they may enter your identifying information into their records oh you say your social security number is n't 123 45 but 56 thank you let me update our records now sir i see that the social security number in our records matches your social security number step two if they do n't back off contact a lawyer collection agencies work by call it intimidation or moral persuasion depending on your viewpoint years after my wife left me she went bankrupt a collection agency called me demanding payment of her debts before the bankruptcy went through i noticed two things about this one we were divorced and i had no responsibility for her debts somehow they tracked down my new address and phone number a place where she had never even lived why should i pay her debts i had no legal obligation nor did i see any moral obligation two their pitch was that she i should pay off this debt before the bankruptcy was final why would anyone do that the whole point of declaring bankruptcy is so you do n't have to pay these debts they were hoping to her into paying even though she would n't be legally obligated to pay if you do n't owe the money of course there 's no reason why you should pay it if they continue to pursue you for somebody else 's debt in the u.s. you can sue them for harassment there are all sorts of legal limits on what collection agencies are allowed to do actually even if they do back off it might be worth contacting a lawyer i suspect that asking your employer to garnish your wages without a court order without even proof that you are responsible for this debt is a tort that you could sue them for

allowances are calculated as your total deductions divided by the tax year 's personal exemptions as mentioned above it is a multiplier for 2015 the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $ 12,600 and each of you gets 1 personal exemption $ 4,000 in 2015 that 's a total of $ 12,600 + or $ divide this by the personal exemption and you get roughly 5 allowances now say your employer offers health insurance and a 401(k plan your total health insurance or cafeteria contributions are $ 2,000 for the year and your total 401(k plan contributions are $ 6,000 for the year this would give an additional $ 2,000 + $ 6,000 = $ 8,000 divided by $ 4,000 = 2 allowances thus you would file with 7 allowances note that tax credits are not included in the allowance calculation that is because they do not affect your taxable income but rather directly reduce your taxes due

unfortunately not even if the credit card balance is positive i.e. customer has overpaid the credit card account you can not withdraw cash for free as any cash withdrawal is subject to interest even if repaid in full at the end of the month the clarity credit card is one of the best cards for overseas spending as its load free no fees for purchases abroad and it gives near perfect exchange rates if your balance is positive you start at £ 0 then fund that credit card account from your bank account £ 500 you can then spend on your credit card and when your next bill is due at the end of the month they will use that extra £ 500 sitting in your account first and ask for the remainder from you i.e.     scenario 2 it is better in my opinion to set up a direct debit to always clear out the full amount on your credit card that way you have cash in your bank account for emergencies getting £ 500 back from a credit card will take a few days to process as opposed to having the ability to withdraw cash from the 24/7 and once the direct debit is paid automatically at the end of the month there are no fees voila your credit card is almost like a debit card spend on it when you like it gets paid automatically no hassle no worries this approach does take a careful mindset though as you need to know your credit limits and also you need to ensure your bank account has enough to pay off the direct debit at the end of the month otherwise those darn fees will get you and hurt your credit rating for cash spending you will want to either take cash with you check online here for best rates get the money well in advance to avoid fees also in some countries the exchange rate is better there than in the uk google will help you here if you do nt like the idea of carrying large sums of cash with you can use a prepaid card like which is one of the better ones out there the other well known ones are fairfx and travelex cash passport

in finance a lot say corporate tax is the original sin   corporate taxes make debt financing more attractive so every company 's debt ratio is much higher than it would be if there were no corporate tax which makes them more vulnerable to shocks in cashflow and at higher risk of default in a downturn   a slight downturn can snowball into a larger one because companies are so heavily debt financed they end up unable to service their debt and end up in worse situations than if they were more equity financed subsequently banks become much more important in the economy because everyone is more leveraged and more company value is tied up in bank debt balances   of course the voting public does n't generally want to lower the corporate tax rate because the general population believes this is how they get their pound of flesh out of corporate america however that is rarely the case

we played as kids when it was the most popular blog baseball the small and big kids dream game in the world way ahead of soccer and basketball was still a poor third we played it in the school yard using a tennis ball and became the highlight of every school boy ’s day   we knew and followed the basic rules of the game although we did not use or we played barefoot because we went to school barefoot we were children and we had the time of our life   the rules of baseball are not really that complicated almost anyone who can run swing a bat or throw a ball can join the fun later on we kids found out that there was such a thing as which was for girls but using a bigger ball that was thrown from the hip level instead of overhead   watching real baseball and games during athletic meets gave us a better understanding and appreciation of the game how we would have wanted to have all the uniform gears and field to play with but all we could afford was an old tennis ball and a homemade 2 in x 3 in lumber for a bat and bases made of stones or wood scraps   baseball as officially required has the following rules   1 basic features of the baseball game and field dimensions   baseball is played on a diamond shaped field with the base corner designated as the home base a player with a bat or a batter tries to hit the ball as far away from any of the opposing fielding team in order to reach all three bases and finally make it back to the home base if a player makes it to a base or two after he bats he must wait for his own team mates to hit the ball and give him the opening to move on around the bases   strategy and team play are important in maximizing the team ’s chance to score sometimes a team may sacrifice a batter just for a player to steal a base or score a run one point can spell the difference between winning and losing and such brilliant plays come in handy   2 team composition   each team has 9 players to fill up the following positions in the field when the opposing team is on the bat first base second base third base short stop right left and substitute players may also be included   3 regulations   the team on the bat is given three attempts to hit the ball thrown by a within the boundaries of the baseball field marked by the two lines made by the base first base and the home base third base a missed ball is called a strike and three strikes puts batter out of the field a team that gets three outs gets to field next while the other team bats   4 playing the ball   a flying ball that falls outside of the field boundaries is called a foul ball and gives a batter another chance to hit are unlimited a ball that is hit and falls inside the two lines is either caught in the air to put the batter out or if it rolls on the ground must be retrieved and often thrown to the first base player who will tag the batter with the ball to put him out failing to tag the batter who steps on or touches the base puts the batter safe on first base or wherever the batter may be as other move on around the diamond   a player who makes it safely back to home base scores a point if it is a meaning the ball is hit out of the filed or steals straight home if the defending team the ball two points are gained while a single point is given to a player who eventually goes round all the bases through one or more   5 other game features   when a team is struck out it take the field and lets the other team bat and attempt to score a foul ball which is caught will also count as an out multiple outs can be made such as when bases are loaded all three bases have and the batter on the plate hits a good ball and makes it to first base and the ball is retrieved and thrown back before the player running to second base reaches it then to home base before the player on third base scores a run and finally to third base to tag the player running to it three outs in one play   it is during such fast plays when the ball changes hands so rapidly and players are for bases that the excitement runs high it is cause for celebration for the scoring team and a big for the other who must probably feel like they were hit on the head with a bat several times for losing the big opportunity to score big and ending up with nothing   6 who wins   the team that makes the most runs after nine or rounds wins the game sometimes though the game will stop at the top of the 9th or before the other team is supposed to go to final bat if that team is already ahead in points as the lagging team will not be able to catch up anyway   some of the most memorable games end at the bottom of the when a team tries to catch up we might have heard of the familiar radio voice saying it ’s the bottom of the and bases are full and the new york are behind by four and has the bat the count is two strikes and three balls the winds up and throws the ball swings hard and the ball flies out of the stadium for a and a win or something to that effect   that imagined scene a dream every child and adult lover of baseball hopes to accomplish once in a lifetime you want to see and hear the whole stadium explode with people jumping and shouting as you take your sweet time running through the bases smiling waving your cap and finally kissing the home base   when a great player makes a good play everybody wins in baseball you have to be the eternal child to enjoy it and there are so many people out there who still enjoy it to this day

afternoon /u    gt it is not right to force people to buy any product or service period   i think i understand why you feel this way but i disagree   taxation is forcing someone to purchase products and services provided by the government that he may or may not want   it is not ideal but just as a family would fall apart without demands on it 's members a country will do the same   government can not exist if your position is applied across the board and we are all better off with government   gt this mandate is just one of the terrible things about obamacare   nobody likes the mandate just like nobody likes taxes but both are required to keep their systems functioning   pointing to the mandate as bad is n't going to change my mind on obamacare any more than pointing to taxes is going to convince me to support dissolving government   you will need to show me that what we get for the mandate is n't worthwhile   gt obama effectively gave people the option to get insurance after they get sick without consequence of higher prices    obama did not give people this option   this is precisely the scenario the obamacare mandate prevented because you were forced to get insurance before you got sick   by saying he wo n't enforce the mandate president trump is giving people this option and you are absolutely correct on how that will play out   gt i am not a bad person i 'm not greedy either   of course not   you put a lot of time into your answer just to explain your position to some guy on the internet   i appreciate that   gt running water in your home central air life saving surgery drugs and physical therapy being able to turn on and off electricity with a switch make a pot of coffee right at your kitchen counter top the government did not of this people did   government is instrumental in providing all of this   think about it   gt running water in your home   that is water you and your state have a right to collect because of agreements handled by the federal bureau of   it was collected and stored in public which exist because of dams built by public works projects   your municipality then and the water and pumps it to your house in public facilities and treats the resultant sewage   gt central air   people used to install air conditioners with which are responsible for the hole in the wiki   it was n't until the epa called attention to the problem and the government outlawed the in the 80 's that things changed   in addition is an energy heavy technology but the energy grid does n't have to do rolling because the government mandates minimum insulation on homes and efficiency standards     gt life saving surgery drugs and physical therapy   the us governments funds a little less than half the drug check us government share basic research funding falls we also know these items improve peoples lives because the fda and have demanded clinical trials to prove new treatments are safe and effective   do n't forget that government institutions like the and cdc have pushed and outbreak responses to effectively nasty diseases like and   gt being able to turn on and off electricity with a switch   electricity has been recognized as a public wiki and those companies are strongly regulated   the transmission lines that bring power to your house are required to be open so one power company does not have a monopoly on supplying your house power   are air is no longer with because of the epa and the doe monitors and regulates nuclear waste   gt make a pot of coffee right at your kitchen counter top   coffee is imported from south american or african countries thanks to us trade agreements and is safe because of the fda   your coffee maker was probably made in china but does n't burn your house down because the manufacturer is required to follow regulations from the and if there is a problem you can do something about it thanks to the ftc and/or court system   gt and if the government can get the hell out of our way we can continue to improve the quality of life like we have been for hundreds of years now in this country   the quality of life in the us has been improving in the us for hundreds of years because of government   a capitalistic market is important too but free market principles exist today in somalia but their lives still suck   the reason is that they are missing a strong central government to fill in the gaps keep the playing field somewhat fair and yes make a few demands of its citizens in exchange   i hope you 're having a great weekend

for the specific example you gave a cd with a 0.05 rate of return i 'd shop around some more that 's a very low rate of return a more realistic one would be 0.5 depending on the terms as has been mentioned cds are good when you need to preserve your capital what might be a situation for that they are great for emergency funds which you should always have a reasonable amount of cash in i have a set up 3 cds with 12 month terms each carrying about 30 of my emergency savings the remaining 10 i keep in a standard savings account for quick access dealing with a short term emergency the 3 are spaced about 4 months apart so that i 'm always within 4 months of having one come to term they have a 3 month penalty if i withdraw early but based on the fact that i have never had to touch more than 10 of my emergency savings i 'm perfectly okay with that what about more long term savings well it depends on what your timeframe is for using the money if it 's more than 10 years and you are willing to risk losing some of it then by all means invest in a higher risk higher reward investment if it 's only a few years maybe a bond fund is something that would be better and if you really need to preserve the money then a cd can be great too

my friend harry sit wrote an excellent article no tax advantage in rsu   the punchline is this the day the rsus vested it 's pretty much you got $ xxx in taxable income and then bought the stock at the price at that moment the clock for long term gain starts the same as if i bought the stock that day   historical side note in the insane days of the dotcom bubble people found they got rsus vested and worth say $ 1m. crash the shares are worth $ 100k. the $ 1 m was ordinary income the basis was $ 1 m and the $ 900 k loss could offset cap gains not ordinary income above $ let me be clear the tax bill was $ but the poor taxpayer had $ 100 k in stock to sell to pay that bill this is the origin of the sell the day it vests advice   the shares you own will be long term for capital gain a year after vesting after the year be sure to sell those particular shares and you 're all set no different than anyone selling the lt shares of stock when owning multiple lots but do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog if you feel it 's time to sell you can easily lose the tax savings while watching the stock fall waiting for the clock to tick to one year

i do not know anything about retail investing in india since i am in the us however there are a couple of general things to keep in mind about gold that should be largely independent of country first gold is not an investment aside from a few industrial uses it has no productive value it is at best a hedge against inflation since many people feel more comfortable with what they consider real money that is not subject to what seems to be arbitrary creation by central banks second buying tiny amounts of gold as coin or bullion from a retail dealer will always involve a fairly significant spread from the commodity spot price the spot price only applies to large transactions retail dealers have costs of doing business that necessitate these fees in order for them to make a profit you must also consider the costs of storing your gold in a way that mitigates the risk of theft the comment by is on this point it appeared while i was typing this answer you might find this planet money piece on the process costs and risks of buying gold bullion in the us if you feel that you must own gold as an inflation hedge and it is possible for residents of india you would be best off with some kind of gold fund that tracks the price of bullion

i 'm going to guess that you found this because of a stock screener   this company went through a reverse split on june 30 so every 20 shares outstanding became a single share   where before you had 20 shares worth $ 100 you now have 1 share worth $ 100 the value of the company does n't change because of a split   this company was never trading for $ 30 + per share   reverse splits are typical of a company trading on an exchange that has a minimum share price requirement   while reverse splits do n't change the value of the company just the number of shares outstanding and the price per share no healthy company performs a reverse split   reverse splits are generally a massive signal to jump ship the company seems to be trading for $ 1 right now why the value fell from a pre split $ 1.65 $ to $ 1 is anyone 's guess how the company ever got to $ 1.65 is also anyone 's guess but looking at the most recent 10-q there are numerous causes for concern   note 2 capital stock on march 6 2017 the company issued as compensation for services provided a total of common shares with a fair value of $ to a third party the fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the otc pink sheets on the grant date this indicates a share price of $ $ as of just to reinforce that the google price chart does n't show the true past but a past adjusted for the split results of operations the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 for the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 total revenues were $ 0 and $ 0 respectively and net losses from operations were $ and $ respectively the net losses were attributable to costs attributable to operating as a public company in particular common stock with a valuation of $ that was issued to an investor relations firm in the first quarter of 2017 going concern as of march 31 2017 there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business we have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception in addition we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business as a result of these and other factors our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern     liquidity and capital resources we had no cash as of the date of march 31 2017 additionally since there is no balance sheet in the last 10-q another bad sign the last annual report 10-k has this balance sheet so the company so why did the stock value plummet it 's guess but there is no shortage of ways to justify it    in fact it 's reasonable to ask how is this company still worth $ 3 mm $ 1 3 mm shares outstanding

you could buy some call options on the usd inr that way if the dollar goes up you 'll make the difference and if the dollar goes down then you 'll lose the premium you paid   i found some details on usd inr options here looks like the furthest out you can go is 3 months note they 're european style options so they can only be exercised on the expiration date as opposed to american style which can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date alternatively you could buy into some futures contracts for the usd inr those go out to 12 months with futures if the dollar goes up you get the difference if the dollar goes down you pay the difference   i 'd say if you were going to do something like this stick with the options since the most you could lose there is the premium you put up for the option contracts with futures if it suddenly moved against you you could find yourself with huge losses note that playing in the futures and options markets are an easy way to get burned it 's not for the faint of heart

can it be so that these low interest rates cause investors to take greater risk to get a decent return   with interest rates being as low as they are there is little to no risk in banking especially after dodd frank risk is just a fancy word for will i make money in the long future no one knows what the actual risk is unless you can see into the future but there are ways to mitigate it so arguably the best way to make money is the stock market not in banking   there is a great misallocation of resources which at some point will show itself and cause tremendous losses even maybe cause a new financial crisis a financial crisis is backed on a believed to be strong investment that goes belly up   tremendous losses is a rather grand term with no merit banks are not purposely keeping interest rates low to cause a financial crisis   as the central banks have kept interest rates extremely low for a decade even negative this affects how much we save and borrow the biggest point here is to know one thing bonds bonds affect all things from municipalities construction to pensions if interest rates increased currently the current rate of bonds would drop vastly and actually cause a financial crisis in the u.s. due to millions of older persons relying on bonds as sources of income

wikipedia has a nice list of currencies that use cents and currencies that use 1/100th division that is not called cent cent means 100 in latin and french and probably all the roman family of languages so if the currency is divided by 100 it will likely to be called cent or something similar in the local language the list of currencies on the same page where it is not the case is significantly shorter and includes countries with relatively ancient currency units that were invented before the introduction of the decimal system even though now they are in fact decimal they still kept the old names like the british pence or the russian the point is that dollar and cent are not directly related many currencies that are not called dollar are using cents as well euro among others it just means 1/100th and it is safe to assume that most if not all of the modern currencies are divided into 1/100th

however if you are employed by a company that exists in a tax haven and your services are provided to an employer by that tax haven company it is the tax haven company that gets paid not you under various schemes that company need not pay you at all for example it may make you a loan which is not taxed ie you do n't pay tax on a loan just as you do n't pay tax on the money lent you by a mortgage company you are bound by the terms of the loan agreement to repay that loan at a rate that the company finds acceptable indeed the company may find eventually that it is simply convenient to write off the loan as unrecoverable if the owners officers of he company write off your loans how much tax will you have paid on the money you have had as    loans the taxman can of course state that this was simply set up to avoid tax which is illegal so you should have a balancing scheme to show that that the loans were taken to supplement income just as one might take a bank loan mortgage not replace it entirely as a tax scam hiring tax counsel to provide this adequate proof to hmrc has a price   frequently this kind of loophole exists because the number of people using it were sufficiently low not to warrant policing if the policing costs more than the tax recovered then it is more efficient to ignore it or because at some stage the scheme has been perfectly legal as in the old trust recommended by the government a few decades ago when gordon brown set out a 75 tax rate for his possibly ideological reasons rather than financially based those who had these accounts he encountered opposition from who were going to be caught up paying high tax bills for what was retrospective taxation so there was a built in loophole to allow the funds to be returned without undue penalty   if you think that is morally wrong consider what the response would be if a future was to declare all the work of the devil and claim that retrospective tax would need to be paid on all isa transactions over the last few tot up all the dividends and capital gains made on an isa in any year and pay 40 tax on all of them even if that took the isa into negative territory because the value today was yet this has been as a way of filling in the hole in the budget on the grounds that anyone with an isa can be represented as rich to a selected party of voters

i agree that cutting spending is generally a bad idea in a bad economy however we can not sustain deficit spending forever our government has been spending money it does n't have for decades now that we need spending to boost the economy we 've started to run out of ammunition years of stupid spending have caught up with us in the midst of a major depression it 's bad but reality   so many people including many people here on reddit have ideas that our debt gdp ratio is n't a problem many people have pointed out that other countries have survived with much higher gdp ratios than ours that is true but we ca n't make that comparison based on that one variable those countries seemed to be on the brink of a major economic expansion as they conquered market shares in the global economy or developed new industries as their economies started booming they were able to pay down their debts people argue that when our economy improves we can do the same   the problem is that after spending $ 5 trillion we are still in a terribly stagnant economy after three years of recovery how long do they think it is going to take before the recovery kicks in it 's inevitable that sooner or later we need to cut debts even if we do see a sudden economic rebound the amount of debt it would take to get there would be extreme at this rate that would require major cuts in spending which would send us right back where we started   some people say that paying the debt is similar to paying down a mortgage by those standards we are doing fine and it is more than affordable that is a bad argument for one thing the revenue we generate in taxes is coming from economic growth developed by that spending if you cut one you cut the other the way our economy is working right now in order to generate more revenue to pay down the debt we need to take on more debt also unlike a mortgage we are at the mercy of the financial markets when investors decide that we have too much debt the rates will rise or they stop buying altogether then we have to rely on the federal reserve to finance it which can cause serious inflation if we lose our reserve status anyone who thinks this is n't possible is sadly delusional then we are basically going to end up like greece because we would n't be able to pay off our debts to foreign investors with our printing press   it 's also important to note that america has a very big advantage it does n't really deserve we have the world reserve currency people say that we deserve to have that because our economy is stronger that is circular logic because so much of our economic strength is due to the fact we had the reserve currency in the first place where would we be without it would we still be the strongest economy in the world i think that 's an impossible question to answer because we have had it and given a free pass for so long that we do n't know what life would be like we can sit and europe for not doing as well as us but the truth is we have a huge advantage so it 's not a valid comparison also we may be doing better for now but if our sovereign debt bubble bursts either due to the loss of world reserve currency status or otherwise we wo n't be any better off   i do n't believe in austerity in a depression but this unsustainable deficit spending seems equally reckless i think we need a more strategic plan that rests somewhere in the middle ground cutting spending on wasteful projects and that money into areas that are going to have a high return on investment in the form of gdp growth obama 's roads do n't qualify otherwise if we keep wasting money we will someday reach the point where deficit spending is no longer an option and we have to cut it regardless of how stagnant the economy is that would be really bad and we need to change gears before we reach that tipping point    to answer your question i think the people you speak of are wrong but not stupid they certainly have good points the problem is that everyone looks at it as an either or situation rather than seeing a continuum where the real answer may lie somewhere in the middle

all bank fees were included in the service tax for example check bounce issue of duplicate statement fees charged for remittance etc however as quite a few banks structured the remittance business to show less charges and cover the difference in the fx rate involved the govt has the service tax and one needs to pay rs 120 for an amount of rs 100,000   there is no way to avoid service tax on remittance if you are using a remittance service

this is a common occurrence i know people who moved and then only remember the next spring during tax season that they never filed a new state version of a w-4 which means for 3 or 4 months in the new year money is sent to the wrong state capital and way too much was sent the previous year in the spring of 2016 you should have filed a non resident tax form with michigan on that form you would specify your total income numbers your michigan income numbers and your other state income numbers with michigan + other equal to total that should have resulted in getting all the state taxes that were sent to michigan returned   it is possible that the online software is unable to complete the non resident tax form not all forms and situations can be addressed by the software so you may need to fill out paper forms you should be able to find what you need on the state of michigan website for 2015 taxes a quick read shows that you will probably need the michigan 1040 schedule 1 and schedule nr you may run into an issue if your license car registration voter registration and other documentation point to you being a resident for the part of the year you earned that income that means you will have to submit form statement to determine state of domicile you want to do this soon because there are deadlines that limit how far back you can files taxes the state may also get tax information from the irs and could decide that all your income from 2015 should have applied to them so they will be sending you a tax bill plus penalties for failure to file

i was being a bit facetious but in general the public accounting profession   should be dedicated to the public good any scope restrictions placed on the auditors while performing the engagement should immediately be reported by the staff to accounting management basically any shady acts of the client should be noted in the work papers and reported there 's a whole bunch of rules to tell an audit staff accountant when to go above their own seniors management if there is collusion or fraud    scope restrictions ie hey you ca n't go in the warehouse to count inventory depending on the severity could qualify the audit report disclaimer of an opinion or withdrawal from the engagement therefore it 's the auditors responsibility to refuse to provide a false audit report to the public or otherwise users of the financial statements they should never act in the manner most profitable for the firm when faced with an ethical dilemma    then there 's practicality and most audit partners will do anything it takes to keep their largest clients on the same coin those clients want a clean bill of reference for their creditors long standing relationships are most vulnerable to letting things slide in favor of the client    there are thousands of companies and even ones publicly traded the government would have to grow exponentially to actually audit all of these companies that 'll never happen they have no idea where their own money goes as long as the revenues cover the expenditures

i debated whether to put this in an answer or a comment because i 'm not sure that this can be answered without a lot more information which actually would then probably make it a candidate for closing as too localized at the very least we would need to know where which jurisdiction she is located in so speaking in a generic way the options available as i see them are contact the mortgage companies and explain she ca n't continue to make payments they will likely foreclose on the properties and if she still ends up owing money after that if you are in the us this also depends on whether you are in a non recourse state then she could be declared bankrupt this is rather the nuclear option and definitely not something to be undertaken lightly but would at least wipe the slate clean and give her some degree of certainty about her situation look very carefully at the portfolio of properties and get some proper valuations done on them depending on where she is located this may be free also do a careful analysis of the property sales and rental markets to see whether property prices rental rates are going up or down then decide on an individual basis whether each property is better kept or sold you may be able to get discounts on fees if you sell multiple properties in one transaction this option would require some cold hard analysis and decision making without letting yourselves get emotionally invested in the situation difficult i know depending on how long she has had the properties for and how she came to own them it might be an option to pursue action against whoever advised her to acquire them clearly a large portfolio of decaying rental properties is not a suitable investment for a relatively elderly lady and if she only came by them relatively recently on advice from an investment consultant or similar you might have some there   another option could she live in one of the properties herself to reduce costs if she owns her own home as well then she could sell that live in the one of the rentals and use the money saved to finance the sale of the other rentals aside from these thoughts one final piece of advice do n't get your own finances tangled up in hers so do n't take out a mortgage against your own property for example obviously if you have the leeway to help her out of your budget then that is great but i would restrict that to doing things like paying for grocery shopping or whatever if she is heading for bankruptcy or other financial difficulties it wo n't help if you are too

i would say generally the answer is no    there might be some short term relief to people in certain situations but generally speaking you sign a contract to borrow money and you are responsible to pay   this is why home loans offer better terms then auto loans and auto loans better than credit cards or things like furniture   the better terms offer less risk to the lender because there are assets that can be repossessed   homes retain values better than autos autos better than furniture and credit cards are not secured at all people are not as helpless as your question suggests   sure a person might lose their high paying job but could they still make a mortgage payment if they worked really hard at it   this might mean taking several part time jobs   now if a person buys a home that has a very large mortgage payment this might not be possible   however wise people do n't buy every bit of house they can afford    people should also be wise about the kinds of mortgages they use to buy a home   many people lost their homes due to missing a payment on their interest only loan   penalty rates and fees jacked up their payment that was way beyond their means   if they had a fixed rate loan the chance to catch up would have not been impossible perhaps an injury might prevent a person from working   this is why long term disability insurance is a must for most people   you can buy quite a bit of coverage for not very much money typical us households have quite a bit of debt   car payments phone payments and either a mortgage or rent and of course credit cards   if income is drastically reduced making all of those payments becomes next to impossible   which one gets paid first   just this last week i attempted to help a client in just this situation   they foolishly chose to pay the credit card first and were going to pay the house payment last if there was anything left over   there was n't and they are risking eviction renters      people finding themselves in crisis generally do a poor job of paying the most important things first   basic food first housing and utilities second etc   let the credit card slip if need be no matter how often one is threatened by creditors   they do this to maintain their credit score how foolish i feel like you have a sense of associated with debt   it is there and real despite many people noticing it   there is also the fact that compounding interest is working against you and with your labor you are enriching the bank   this is a great reason to have the goal of living a debt free life   i can tell you it is quite

the crazy thing about this is that $ 30 million in annual salary and compensation really is n't the end of the story for rich guys   i worked for a reit a few years back and the guy that founded that reit made a few million in salary a year   i thought the number seemed a bit low for his lifestyle   he had many properties in the us for his own personal use around 6 8 big homes   he also had a garage that was insane   he had over 25 very expensive cars   my co workers would say nick is out his garage when he drove one to work every day for a month without driving the same vehicle twice in one month   it turns out he owned 30 million shares of stock that paid him $ 1.00 per share per year   so while his annual compensation was only a few million per year his dividend income was many many times that   think about that next time you see a ceo 's annual income and you think that it really is n't as much as you expect

pre edit pete mentioned that he feels real estate agents would a like you to buy as much house as you afford and b would love to show you three houses and have you choose one   as a real estate agent myself i believe his warnings were understated as with any industry there are good and bad people agents are paid to move houses if the median us home is under $ 200 k and commissions average say 5 the $ 10,000 to be gained is split between the buyer brokerage and selling agent the $ 5000 to each is then shared with the house so this sale would net me $ 2500 gross move one a week and the income is great one per month not so much tire will waste an agent 's time for a potential decision to wait another year and continue renting their obligation is to tell you the truth but not to offer financial advice   remember the mortgage crisis it seems the banks and brokers are n't watching out for you either they will tell you what they 'll lend you but not what you can afford these numbers are worlds apart   i strongly recommend a 20 downpayment the fha pmi calculator shows that a 90 ltv i.e. a 10 downpayment for a $ 100 k house will cost you $ in pmi think about this for the $ 10,000 that you did n't put down you are paying an extra $ 1200 each year this is on top of the interest so even at 5 that last $ 10,000 is costing nearly 17 if you ca n't raise that $ 10 k or whatever 10 is on that house in cheaper funds you should hold off using the 401(k loan for this purpose is appropriate yet emotionally charged as if suck loans are written by the devil himself   buy the biggest house you can no i have a better idea buy the smallest place you can tolerate i have a living room in addition to family room that has been used 3 times in 20 years a dining room we actually use twice per year when your house is 50 too big you pay 50 more property tax more utility bills and more maintenance closing costs commission etc is n't cheap but the lifetime cost of living in a too big house is a money pit

without reading the source from your description it seems that the author believes that this particular company was undervalued in the marketplace it seems that investors were blinded by a small dividend without considering the actual value of the company they were owners of remember that a shareholder has the right to their proportion of the company 's net value and that amount will be distributed both a in the form of dividends and b on liquidation of the company   theoretically eps is an indication of how much value an investor 's single share has increased by in the year of course this is not accurate because accounting income does not directly correlate with company value increase but it is a good indicator this means in this example that each share had a return of $ 10 of which the investors only received $ 1 the remainder sat in the company for further investment considering that liquidation may never happen particularly within the time frame that a particular investor wants to hold a share some investors may undervalue share return that does not come in the form of a dividend this may or may not be legitimate because if the company reinvests its profits in poorer performing projects the investors would have been better off getting the dividend immediately however some value does need to be given to the non dividend ownership of the company it seems the author believes that investors failing to consider value of the non dividend part of the corporation 's shares in question led to an of the company 's shares in the market

this person could buy another car at any moment without any money problems so i do n't really see any point in insuring especially with such a ridiculously high price compared to the extremely low risk convenience   if you self insure then an accident means that you have to make arrangements to get the car fixed evaluated etc   if you buy insurance your insurer would prefer to do all that   they argue with the mechanic over prices the lawyer over liability etc    and of course rich people need more liability insurance than other people not less   so part of that $ 1400 is probably money that your friend would have to pay regardless

depends what kind of expenses you intend to use this money for if you plan to buy housing in the future eg you 're saving a deposit then you need to ensure that the value does n't deteriorate relative to the value of the housing you are likely to buy so you could buy a residential reit or buy some investment property if you expect to use this money for food then you should buy suitable assets eg wheat futures etc link the current asset to the future expense and you will be fine if you buy gold then you are making a bet that gold will retain its value compared to the thing you want to purchase in future it does n't matter what the price of gold does in $ us

gt if i come to your house with a gun and hand and say you made this much money this year therefore you owe me this much because i need healthcare food ect   okay so your argument is that taxes are illegitimate because they pay for services for others obviously i disagree because in your example your money is only paying for services for other people however the reality is that we the minute we are born we benefit from living in a civilized society with services and infrastructure that was created by those who have paid taxes in the past    your example is faulty because it assumes you receive no benefit from the taxes that the government demands of you    gt yes government made it happen that does n't mean that it would have never happened with out it   possible but we will never know i think we agree that gps does provide a valuable service and it was created by government this being one of thousands of examples of government innovation that has improved everyones lives and provided the foundation for more innovation on the commercial market    it is possible that it would come to be in some form without government investment through taxes but we know it did become reality through government through taxes    gt i would say that the us military has gone way overboard with the amount of technological spend    i would agree to an extent i would like to see investment in other areas but that is what our elected leaders currently find of value    gt from what i 've seen the 2017 request is $ 12.5 billion for total tech spend for the military   i am not sure where that number is coming from i know at one point by itself spent over $ 1 t in r&amp;d on the problem i know that funds a couple billion dollars worth of r&amp;d by itself too then you have groups like doe which do a lot of r&amp;d on defense projects as well i think that number might be off    drone technology was another example that you used how much do you think the amazon delivery drone service was influenced by dod r&amp;d into drones i have a buddy that i served with who worked at after he got out who now works at amazon    gt bernie sanders bit   sorry i think it may have got cut i was going to ask what part of his tax plan would have added to your personal taxes

looking at the numbers quickly   if he makes this amount for the entire year single no kids no investment income standard deduction only his taxable income will be about $ 110,000   that puts him in the 28 tax bracket   his federal tax would be   $ plus 28 of the amount over $ which comes out to about $ in tax liability   his federal withholding is $ for the year so with absolutely no deductions whatsoever he will be getting a tax refund of about $ 2200 i 'm not very familiar with the california tax return but it is entirely possible that he would get a decent sized refund from the state as well   this means that his tax refund could be about the size of an extra paycheck   he may want to consider increasing his allowances which would make his paychecks bigger and his tax refund smaller that having been said taxes are high no doubt about it   remember that when you are in the voting booth   here is how i got the taxable income number for the year

an investment portfolio is typically divided into three components all three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or etfs a 401(k will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one look at the prospectus for the expense ratio if it 's over 1 you 're definitely paying too much if it 's over 0.5 you 're probably paying too much if it 's less than 0.1 you have a really good deal us stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement or get close to spending the money on something else if it 's not invested for retirement international stocks are riskier than us stocks but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the us stocks bonds or fixed income investments are generally very safe but have limited opportunities for returns they tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly when you 've got a while to invest you should be looking at riskier investments when you do n't you should be looking for safer investments a quick and rough rule of thumb is that your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds so if you 're 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so you should have about 50 in bonds roughly   people whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there because they already are at risk if it performs badly for instance if you work in the technology sector loading up on tech stocks is extra risky if there 's a big bust you 're not just out of a job your portfolio is dead as well more exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio while many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them

the form is required because you are working it is kept by the employer as proof that you have the proper documents to work if the government was to inspect their records they can be fined if they do n't have those document in fact they have to keep them for several years after your employment is done a w-4 form is a federal tax form there also was probably a state version of the form   when you completed the w-4 it is used by your employer to determine how much in taxes need to be withheld employers do n't know your tax situation even though you are on work study you still could have made enough money over the summer to pay taxes but if this is your only job and you will not make enough money to have to pay taxes you can fill out the form as exempt that means that last year you did n't make enough money to have to pay taxes and you do n't expect to make enough to have to pay taxes this year if you are exempt no federal income tax will be withheld they might still withhold for social security and medicare the state w-4 can also be used to be exempt from state taxes if they withhold any income taxes you have to file one of the 1040 tax forms to get that income tax money back you will have to do so for the state income tax withholding   a note about social security and medicare if you have an on campus job at the campus you attend during the school year they do n't withhold money for social security and medicare that law applies to students on work study jobs and on non work study jobs for single dependents the federal threshold where you must file is > you must file a return if any of the following apply your gross income was more than the larger a. $ 1,000 or b. your earned income up to $ plus $ 350

here 's an article on it that might help one of the tricky things is that you probably have the value of the vested shares and withheld taxes already on your w-2 this confuses everyone including the irs they sent me one of those audits by mail one year where the issue was they wanted to double count stock compensation that was on both 1099-b and w-2 a quick letter explaining this and they were happy the general idea is that when you first irrevocably own the stock it vests then that 's income because you 're receiving something of value so this goes on a w-2 and is taxed as income not capital gains conceptually you 've just spent however many dollars in income to buy stock so that 's your basis on the stock for tax paid if your employer withheld taxes it should be included in your w-2 in that case you would not separately list it elsewhere

black scholes is close enough for american options since there are n't usually reasons to exercise early so the ability to do so does n't matter which is good since it 's tough to model mathematically i 've read early exercise would usually be caused by a weird mispricing for some technical market action reason where the theoretical option valuations are messed up if you sell a call that 's far in the money and do n't get any time value after the spread for example you probably sold the call to an who 's just going to exercise it but unusual stuff like this does n't change the big picture much

after the deal which is expected to close by early next year burger king and tim horton said their newly combined company would have about $ 23 billion in sales and more than 18,000 locations the corporate headquarters will be in canada but burger king will still be operated out of miami   so it can be considered an inversion     do you understand how companies avoid taxes in these deals   the us taxes all your revenue at 35 and then gives you credit for foreign taxes paid   in many other countries they just tax you for domestic revenue not world wide    so previously burger king had to pay 35 tax on all revenue world wide and then got back credits for taxes paid in say canada or england    now they will pay 35 only on us income and the foreign tax in those countries it operates which can be much less than 35

what he said was   term returns show fat tails in their distribution   this means that in the short run rare events in the stock market like huge up and downswings happen much more often than you would expect given the circumstances   term returns converge towards a gaussian distribution    this means that long term changes in stock prices show about the level of swings you would expect to see   gt;the authors think there 's a connection between this and the long memory of i.e. that the of absolute volatilities also has a fat tail   auto correlation is the idea that an event is closely related or depends upon a previous event   it should n't be a surprise that prices can depend on previous prices   contrast this with a coin toss   each time you toss the coin the result is independent of any previous result   normally you would use an estimate of auto correlation to test the randomness of your time series   unless you have good reason to do otherwise you use the standard normal or gaussian distribution to do so   some previous study or perhaps this one may have found that the distribution of their auto correlation estimates for volatility change in prices   is not normally distributed but rather that extreme values happen more often than would be expected fat tail   these guys find a correlation between the short term return fat tails the normally   distributed long term returns and a previous finding that the auto correlation of volatility may have fat tails and they think that these things could be more than simply coincidence

unless your brokerage will sell you fractional shares the most obvious difference without us knowing the actual identify of the companies is that with the $ 260 one you will have 3 shares plus you will have $ 220 minus commission left over that you wanted to invest but were n't able to simply because of the mechanics of long division you could put that $ 220 into one of the cheaper stocks but now the multiple commissions will start to eat your returns my personal opinion is you should go for a low cost index mutual fund or etf and wait to pick individual stocks until you have more than $ 1000 to work with and even then probably still go with the low cost index fund

there are several reasons to pay for data instead of using yahoo finance although these reasons do n't necessarily apply to you if you 're only planning to use the data for personal use   yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period you can opt to use the yahoo query language which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the csv files although the rate limit is higher for you may still run into it an api that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds   although the reliability varies throughout the site yahoo finance is n't considered the most reliable of sources you ca n't beat free of course but at least for research purposes the center for research in security prices crsp at and wharton is considered the gold standard on the commercial side data providers like bloomberg reuters also enjoy widespread popularity although both the output from and yahoo 's current csv output are fairly standard they wo n't necessarily remain that way a commercial api is basically a contract with the data provider that they wo n't change the format without significant prior notice but it 's reasonable to assume that if yahoo wanted to they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications a change in yahoo 's format would likely break many sites or applications too but their terms of use do state that yahoo may change suspend or any aspect of the yahoo finance modules at any time including the availability of any yahoo finance modules yahoo may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the yahoo finance modules or the yahoo web site without notice or liability if you 're designing a commercial application a paid provider will probably provide technical support for their api   according to yahoo finance 's license terms you ca n't use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their badges whatever those are see here in this post a yahoo employee states the finance tos is fairly specific redistribution of data is only    allowed if you are using the badges the team has created otherwise you can use or whatever method to obtain data for    personal use the license itself states that you may not sell lease or the yahoo finance modules or access    or derive income from the use or provision of the yahoo    finance modules whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or    otherwise without yahoo 's prior express written permission in short for personal use yahoo finance is more than adequate for research or commercial purposes a data provider is a better option furthermore many commercial applications require more data than yahoo provides e.g. tick by tick data for equities derivatives futures data on mergers etc which a paid data source will likely provide yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements i ca n't find any examples at the moment but i had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10 k 's that he had come across i 've always assumed this is because the data were manually entered although i would assume edgar has some method for automatic retrieval if you want data that are guaranteed to be accurate or at least have a support contract associated with them so you know who to bother if it is n't you 'll need to pay for it

the examples you provide in the question are completely irrelevant it does n't matter where the brokerage is or where is the company you own stocks in for a fairly standard case of an non resident alien international student living full time in the us your capital gains are us sourced let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally    has its source in the united states if the alien has a tax home in the    united states the key factor in determining if an individual is a    u.s. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether    the alien 's tax home has shifted to the united states if an alien    does not have a tax home in the united states then the alien ’s u.s.    source capital gains would be treated as foreign source and thus    nontaxable in general under the tax home rules a person who is away or who    intends to be away from his tax home for longer than 1 year has    shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new    location see chapter 1 of publication 463 travel entertainment    gift and car expenses i 'll assume you 've read this and just want an explanation on what it means what it means is that if you move to the us for a significant period of time expected length of 1 year or more your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the us and the capital gains are sourced to the us from the start of your move for example you are a foreign and your 4-year assignment started in may. year end you 're not us tax resident exempt but you 've stayed in the us for more than 183 days and since your assignment is longer than 1 year your tax home is now in the us you 'll pay the 30 flat tax another example you 're a foreign airline pilot coming to the us every other day flying the airline aircraft you end up staying in the us 184 days but your tax home has n't shifted nor you 're a us tax resident you do n't pay the flat tax keep in mind that tax treaties may alter the situation since in many cases they also cover the capital gains situation for non residents

suppose that the fixed overhead costs of delivering a service not related to the actual volume of sales are $ 50 million per year suppose the variable costs on top are $ 100 per customer per year suppose further that 1 of the population buys the service in the us 3.2 million people buy the service and it costs $ 116 per person to deliver it $ 100 plus $ 50 million divided by 3.2 million in australia 230,000 people buy it and it costs $ per person per year to deliver it $ 100 plus $ 50 million divided by 230,000 the larger your market the cheaper everything is and australia is a very small market compared with the usa the eu china or india

according to the new york attorney general 's tenants rights guide landlords regardless of the number of units in the building    must treat the deposits as trust funds belonging to their tenants and they may not co mingle deposits with their own money landlords of buildings with six or more apartments must    put all security deposits in new york bank accounts earning    interest at the prevailing rate each tenant must be informed    in writing of the bank ’s name and address and the amount of    the deposit so you have to keep it separate you ca n't spend it and if you own more than six units you have to put it in a bank account   the guide goes on to explain that the interest should be paid to the tenant

what decision are you trying to make   are you interested day trading stocks to make it rich or are you looking at your investment options and trying to decide between an actively managed mutual fund and an etf if the former then precise statistics are hard to come by but i believe that 99 of day traders would do better investing in an etf if the latter then there are lots of studies that show that most actively managed funds do worse than index funds so with most actively managed funds you are paying higher fees for worse performance   here is a quote from the bogleheads guide to investing index funds outperform approximately 80 percent of all actively    managed funds over long periods of time they do so for one simple    reason rock bottom costs in a random market we do n't know what    future returns will be however we do know that an investor who keeps    his or her costs low will earn a higher return than one who does not    that 's the 's edge many people believe that your best option for investing is a diverse portfolio of etfs like this   this is what i do

the economics of it say that you need to win 30 of the homes you pass in order to break even   google has only entered markets where there is already a cable incumbent plus the phone company probably offers service although their market share is surely smaller so there are 2 solid providers and 1 marginal provider at least   for a 4th provider to come in they could really only hope to break even and that would be very difficult considering the marketing clout of the competitors   at that point you 're talking a generic product and you can really only compete on price and possibly better service   competing on price is a fools errand in this case as the competitors will match your prices until you go broke   look at how comcast and twc miraculously boost speeds in cities when google shows up    for a different example look at the airline industry and what has happened when a low cost competitor brings service to a city that has an airline fortress hub   the big airline will double capacity on the route and match every price until they break the upstart   the day literally the new airline folds they cut service and raise prices

you are asking about what happens when an etf mutual fund company goes bankrupt if you were asking about a bank account you would be asking about fdic coverage   investment funds are different the closest thing to fdic protection is provided by   securities investors protection corporation sipc sipc was created under the securities investor protection act as a    non profit membership corporation sipc oversees the liquidation of    member broker dealers that close when the broker dealer is bankrupt or    in financial trouble and customer assets are missing in a    liquidation under the securities investor protection act sipc and the    court appointed trustee work to return securities and cash    as quickly as possible within limits sipc the return of    missing customer property by protecting each customer up to $ 500,000    for securities and cash including a $ 250,000 limit for cash only sipc is an important part of the overall system of investor protection    in the united states while a number of federal and state securities    agencies and self regulatory organizations deal with cases of    investment fraud sipc 's focus is both different and narrow restoring    customer cash and securities left in the hands of bankrupt or    otherwise financially troubled brokerage firms sipc was not chartered by congress to combat fraud although created    under a federal law sipc is not an agency or establishment of the    united states government and it has no authority to investigate or    regulate its member broker dealers it is important to understand that    sipc is not the securities world equivalent of the federal deposit    insurance corporation fdic which insures depositors of insured    banks

in a very basic sense you can only issue a dividend from profits which in practice is usually the businesses retained profits as a new company you will not have any retained profits and therefore technically no profits   in practice though many companies issue interim dividends before the year end however you are best taking professional advice as to whether you are in a position to do this if the company pays out dividends in the first year and then makes a loss you will have been deemed to make an illegal distribution the dividend can then actually be treated as loan rather than a distribution but there are potential tax implications there    see guidance here on illegal dividends a chartered accountant will be able to advise you accordingly

a mortgage backed security or mbs is the security   it 's not an entity it 's essentially a contract   as an investment they function more or less the same way a bond does there is nothing wrong with the concept behind a mortgage backed security   functionally securities like these allows banks and other institutions to lend to high risk borrowers   you package small slices of a wide range of risk from a large number of mortgages and the investor receive something similar to the average of the rates being charged   essentially from a big pool of mortgages of varying risk you will create a different big pool of bonds that can be sold to investors based on some sort of expected return   for a frame of reference on a much smaller scale look at peer to peer lending sites like lendingclub and prosper   the idea is lots of people of varying risk profiles make requests for loans of varying amounts   you bring your $ 2,500 and invest $ 25 in to 100 different loans   this way even if a few default you will still eek out a profit   it also allows you to include riskier borrowers without materially impacting your expected return

as a personal advice its best avoided to take a loan for a vacation having said that it would also depend on the amount of loan that one is planning to take and the duration for repaying the loan and the rate of interest    one has to also consider if you borrow when you are paying the loan back is that money out of something else that was budgeted say paying this loan means that you ca n't save enough for the downpayment for your house you plan to buy next year or will mean less contributions to retirement savings if so then its definately advisable to forego the vacation travel you can still take the holiday and enjoy at home doing something else that of meaning

i would not be concerned about the impact to your credit rating   you already have an excellent credit score and the temporary change to your utilization will have minimal impact to your score if you really need to make this $ 2500 purchase and you have the money in the bank to pay for it i would not recommend borrowing this money   only put it on the credit card if you plan on paying it off in full without paying interest let me ask you this why do you want to keep this $ 2500 in the bank   it certainly is n't earning you anything significant   my guess is that you 'd like to keep it there for an emergency   well is this $ 2500 purchase an emergency   if it is necessary then spend the money   if not then save up the money until you have enough to make the purchase   it does n't make sense to keep money for an emergency in the bank but then when one comes up to leave the money in the bank and pay interest on your emergency purchase if you make this emergency purchase and another emergency comes up you can always if necessary borrow the money at that time   it does n't make sense to borrow money before you need it that having been said i would encourage you to build up your emergency fund so that you have enough money in there to handle things like this without completely depleting your savings account   3 to 6 months of expenses is the general recommendation for your emergency fund   then if something unplanned comes up you 'll have the money in the bank without having to borrow and pay interest

they do n't actually though in some time frames s&p 500 growth out performs s&p 500 it often lags this is because growth does n't refer to what happens to your account but rather the type of stock in the index roughly speaking it 's the half of the s&p with the best earnings growth   that would be great except it 's not looking for is to see if that growth is worth buying a stock with a 20 growth rate is a great buy at a p e of 15 but a terrible buy at p 50   that leads to what jb king was talking about there 's also the s&p 500 value which is roughly the cheapest stocks relative to earnings value does tend to beat the broad index over the long haul because there 's nothing like getting a good deal note a stock can be in both the growth and value categories this holds true with other indexes as well like the 2000 all that said you 're not going to see a huge difference between s&p 500 and s&p 500 growth i believe this is because the s&p 500 itself leans a bit to the side    ps with vanguard is tracking the s&p 500 growth index which is actually a thing and not vanguard itself filtering stocks

i 'm of your position    i reckon that people who put crazy long hours into a business that fails are lacking some intangible qualities of entrepreneurship   there are people you can just tell they do n't have what it takes they 're putting in loads of commitment or loads of money into an idea that just is n't right or they spend money in the wrong ways you know how all these internet companies spent money on champagne and $ 1000 chairs during the dot com bubble i 've seen the small scale version of that as people rent expensive offices when i 'm thinking why are n't you just working from home    as a small time entrepreneur i 'm obviously biased but if you 've got what it takes so i think there is an element of here and you work hard then you will succeed to some greater or lesser extent   i mean i know electricians and builders that have started their own contracting or supplies businesses they 're not rich by the standard of but they have a bloody nice house and a bloody nice car in the driveway and they probably take an afternoon a week off to play golf they 're doing better than most of the other guys they worked with as electricians or builders 20 years ago and i do n't see that they 're really doing anything too clever or sophisticated    also the classic figure of 9/10 businesses failed failed here is a very dramatic word implying that the entrepreneur lost his or her shirt often it 's not a case that the business lost them money they pissed away thousands on rent or wages or misplaced marketing but more that it made a bit of money but not enough so they moved on to something else that something else might be regular employment for some people but there are plenty of entrepreneurs perhaps some of the greatest and most famous ones who have gone on from one failure to a much bigger success

it took me a very longtime to learn that i no longer need to live like a starving student and even now i live like a well off student and that 's ok my needs and tastes are mostly simple there 's no reason to spend just for the sake of spending but if you want something and really can afford it after setting aside savings for retirement and emergency funds and basic operating capital go for it it may help to pick out a specific thing you want or want to replace my rules used to say that i was always allowed to spend money on books music and needed tools then i convinced myself that shelves are tools for storing other things and that furniture is shelving for people and that art if it really speaks to me is akin   to books and that a decent instrument is a tool and that my time has value so sometimes it 's less expensive in real term to throw money at a problem rather than scheduling my life around it one step at a time with all the steps making sense i will still spend entirely too long over minor purchases at times but that 's about convincing myself that i like the choice i 'm making not about the price   per se meanwhile saving means you can buy things later without having to borrow the semi student routine and waiting until i was ready to buy is why i had the value of a house in my investments when i was ready to buy one and is why i 'm almost at my target number for retirement well before my planned retirement date one other thought if you 're comfortable buying gifts for others but do n't tend to spend on yourself you are n't a miser just frugal

the finance functions in spreadsheet software will calculate this for you   the basic functions are for rate payment pv present value fv future value and nper the number of periods   the single calculation faces a couple issues dealing with inflation and with a changing deposit if you plan to save for 30 years and today are saving $ 500/mo for example in ten years i hope the deposits have risen as well i suggest you use a spreadsheet a full sheet to let you adjust for this   last there 's a strange effect that happens precision without accuracy see the results for 30 40 years of compounding today 's deposit given a return of 6 7 up to 10 or so your forecast will be as weak as the variable with the greatest range and there 's more than one return inflation percent you 'll increase deposits all unknown and really unknowable   the best advice i can offer is to save till it hurts plan for the return to be at the lower end of the range and every so often re evaluate where you stand better to turn 40 and see you are on track to retire early than to plan on too high a return and at 60 realize you missed it badly   as far as the spreadsheet goes this is for the google sheets   type this into a cell = it represents 1 interest per month a payment deposit of $ 100 a starting value of $ 0 a goal of $ 1000 and interest added at month end for whatever reason a starting balance must be entered as a negative number for example = will return the number of months to get you from $ 500 to $ 1000 with a $ 100/mo deposit and return someone smarter than i chris comes to mind can explain why the starting balance needs to be entered this way but it does show the correct result as confirmed by my ti ba-35 financial calculator which does n't need $ 500 to be negative

when you do this you might be involved in online banking fraud and you will be both perpetrator and victim hacking some online banking users is easy there is a flourishing black market where any wannabe hacker can buy a banking then the hacker just has to some random computers with said virus through email spam drive by downloads exploiting a browser vulnerability upload it concealed as other software on a piracy website etc etc   and it will trick the user into sending money to accounts they do n't want to send money to   however what 's not so easy for the hacker is holding on to the money because sooner or later the victim will notice in case of online banking fraud the bank is usually legally required to pay back the money the customer lost banks will usually reverse the transaction when the customer reports that they were hacked so what do the criminals do they hire some gullible fools out for easy money as mules the job they offer we send money to your private account you send it to another account we specify minus your commission what happens next   so the actual victim in this scheme is the

sitting for the exam wo n't really make you stand out   if it was a choice between vs. and taking cfa l1 i suppose i would take the latter   but if it was a choice between cfa l1 and w/ internship or some experience i would choose the latter   so in other words it wo n't really open doors but it certainly wo n't hurt   only take it if it is what you want to do not to stand out   also most places care more about the letters cfa than actually taking the exam and they know you need 4 years qualifying work experience   so they do n't really care if you have taken it now or a year from now cause you wo n't be able to use those letters for four years anyway   anyway good luck on your job search

see also the question how many stocks i can exercise per stock warrant and my comments there clearly at the prices you quote it does not seem sensible to exercise your warrants at the moment since you can still by units 1 stock + 1/3 warrant and bare stock at below the $ 11.50 it would cost you to exercise your warrant   so when would exercising a warrant become a sensible thing to do obviously if the price of the bare stock which you say is currently $ were to sufficiently exceed $ 11.50 then it would clearly be worth exercising a warrant and immediately selling the stock you receive sufficiently exceed to account for any dealing costs in selling the newly acquired stock however looking more closely $ 11.50 is n't the correct cut off price consider three of the units you bought at $ each for $ you received three shares of stock and one warrant for an additional $ 11.50 $ in total you can have a total of four shares of stock at the equivalent of $ each so if the price of the bare stock rises above $ then it could become sensible to exercise one warrant and sell four shares of stock again allowing a margin for the cost of selling the stock the trading price of the original unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant should n't i believe directly affect your decision to exercise warrants although it would be a factor in deciding whether to resell the units you 've already got as you say if they are now trading at $ then having bought them at $ you would make a profit if sold unless i 'm missing something or the figures you quote are incorrect the current price of the unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant $ seems overpriced compared to the price of the bare stock $ reversing the above calculation if bare stock is trading at $ then four shares would cost $ deducting the $ 11.50 cost of exercising this would value three combined units at $ or $ each which is considerably below the market price you quote one reason the unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant is trading at $ instead of $ could be that the market believes the price of the bare share currently $ will eventually move towards or above $ 11.50 if that happens the option of exercising warrants at $ 11.50 becomes more and more attractive the premium presumably reflects this potential future benefit finally surely i am misunderstand the stock ipo 's intent presumably the main intent of social capital was to raise as much money as possible through this ipo to fund their future activities the positive view is that they expect this future activity to be profitable and therefore the price of ordinary stock to go up at least as far as ideally way beyond the $ 11.50 exercise price and the offering of warrants will be seen as a thank you to those investors who took the risk of taking part in the ipo a completely cynical view would be that they do n't really care what happens to the stock price but that offering free stuff or what looks like free stuff will simply attract more punters to the ipo in reality the truth is probably somewhere between those two extremes

if you receive a 1099-misc from youtube that tells you what they stated to the irs and leads into most tax preparation software guided interviews or wizards as a topic for you to enter   whether or not you have a 1099-misc this discussion from the irs is pertinent to your question you could probably elect to report the income as a royalty on your copyrighted work of art on schedule e but see this note in most cases you report royalties in part i of schedule e form 1040 however if you are in business as a self employed writer inventor artist etc report your income and expenses on schedule c or schedule c ez form 1040 whether reporting on schedule e or c is more correct or better for your specific circumstances is beyond the advice you should take from strangers on the internet based on a general question however know that there are potentially several paths for you    note that this is revenue from a business so if you paid for equipment or services that are 100 dedicated to your pc upgraded broadband video editing software vehicle miles to a shoot props etc then these are a combination of depreciable capital investments and expenses you can report against the income reducing the taxes you may owe   if the equipment services are used for business and personal use there are further guidelines from the irs as to estimating the split these apply whether you report on sch e sch c or sch c ez     quote self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer fees received for babysitting and lawn cutting are all examples of taxable income even if each client paid less than $ 600 for the year someone who repairs computers in his or her spare time needs to report all monies earned as self employment income even if no one person paid more than $ 600 for repairs

a credit card is basically a revolving loan in which you 're allowed to borrow up to a certain amount the limit and any time you borrow you pay interest   if you were to borrow $ 100 to pay for something via a credit card you 'd have a $ 100 balance on the card if you then pay $ 70 cash to the card there would be $ 30 remaining   that $ 30 balance could accrue interest the timing of that interest charge could vary the 20 you 've quoted is almost certainly apr of which the a stands for annual so that 20 would be an annual rate   it makes the most sense mind you to keep a minimal balance on a credit card as the interest rate is higher than most other loans

yes you 've got it right   the change in price is less meaningful as the instrument is further from the price of the underlying   as the delta moves less the gamma is much less gamma is to delta as acceleration is to speed   speed is movement relative to x and acceleration is rate of change in speed   delta is movement relative to s and gamma is the rate of change in delta delta changes quickly when it is around the money which is another way of saying gamma is higher   delta is the change of the option price relative to the change in stock price   if the strike price is near the market price then the odds of being in or out of the money could appear to be changing very quickly even going back and forth repeatedly gamma is the rate of change of the delta so these sudden in pricing are by definition the gamma   this is to some extent a little mundane and even obvious   but it 's a useful heuristic for analyzing prices and movement as well as for focusing analyst attention on different pricing aspects you 've got it right   if delta is constant zero speed for the change in price then gamma is zero zero acceleration

why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable the yield will rise when instability increases because the risk of default increases   if the case of greece the instability of government finances resulted in a 50 haircut for bond holders in 2011   in other words bond holders suffered a 50 write down in the nominal value of their bonds   this means that holding these bonds until maturity will mean they will only receive half of the original nominal value of the bond and that is assuming no further write downs occur why does selling a bond drive up the yield significant selling of bonds means that sellers are worried about future prospects   sellers will outnumber buyers so sellers will have to reduce their offer price in order to attract new buyers so if you think greece is not going to default as it 's highly likely a country would completely default would n't it make sense to hold onto the bonds if you think that it is highly unlikely that greece will default and the prices and yields are attractive then greek bonds may look like an attractive investment however keep in mind the fate of bond holders in 2011   they were attracted to greek bonds by the price and yield but they suffered a 50 haircut

i would say you can file your taxes on your own but you will probably want the advice of an accountant if you need any supplies or tools for the side business that might be tax deductible iirc you do n't have to tell your current employer for tax reasons just check that your contract does n't state you ca n't have a side job or business but i believe you 'll have to tell hmrc at the end of the year you 'll have to file a tax return and at that point in time you 'll have to pay the tax on the additional earnings these will be taxed at your highest tax rate and you might end up in a higher tax bracket too i 'd put about 40 away for tax that will put you on the safe side in case you end up in the high tax bracket if not you 'll have a bit of money going spare after paying your taxes

in your case i think you are doing just fine   index funds by their nature have lower transaction costs and fewer taxable events than actively managed funds good work    index funds do not preclude the generation of dividends and by their nature they probably generate slightly more than actively managed funds    you could take capital gain or dividend or both distributions rather than reinvest them if paying the taxes are a hardship   otherwise look at the taxes you pay as your contributions to these funds   it stinks but this is why 401k ira were rather revolutionary when they were formed   it was a really good deal to not have people 's capital gains eaten by taxes when they occurred   now its old hat but it was pretty darn cool at the time should you prefer rather than vfiax   we ca n't really make the call on that one   which one will perform better after taxes   its anyone 's guess it is kind of a good problem to have

while it 's definitely possible and likely that a diversified portfolio generates higher returns than the s&p 500 that 's not the main reason why you diversify diversification reduces risk   modern portfolio theory suggests that you should maximize return while reducing risk instead of blindly chasing the highest returns think about it this way say the average return is 11 for large cap us stocks the s&p 500 and it 's 10 for a diversified portfolio say 6 8 asset classes the large cap only portfolio has a 10 chance of losing 30 in a given year while the diversified portfolio has a 1 chance of losing 30 in a year for the vast majority of investors it 's worth the 1 annual gap in expected return to greatly reduce their risk exposure of course i just made those numbers up read what finance professors have written for the data and proof but modern portfolio theory is believed by a lot of investors and other finance experts there are a ton of studies and therefore data on mpt including many that contradict it

as long as you are disciplined about it you can certainly have your emergency fund and other savings funds in one account   multiple accounts may incur added costs since you may not have the minimum balances to avoid the fees   some banks provide tools or account features to help track separate buckets of funds within one account one important principle for an emergency fund is liquidity   those funds should be easily accessible ideally without withdrawal penalties or transaction costs   for this reason certificates of deposit cd or money market funds should be avoided for this purpose another important principle for any savings fund is capital preservation safety   that money should not be held in risky assets   depending on the purpose of the fund you may consider other options beyond just a savings account   for example you may consider placing funds for a house in early on before you are actually looking for the house   as you get closer to having enough for a down payment you would shift that money into a savings account   one drawback of such an approach is the extra management that this requires on your part a spreadsheet is a simple way to track these funds though that requires more manual management and discipline to do that tracking   it also requires some knowledge of spreadsheets but it provides you with flexibility so you can create a process that works well for you   any accounting software should allow you to do this in some fashion with hopefully less effort than maintaining a spreadsheet though you may have to do things in a certain way that may be awkward in some cases those are the basic principles that come to mind   i am sure others can provide more specific suggestions like banks which allow you track buckets of funds or accounting software that can help you track the funds

your question is a bit odd in that you are mixing long term fundamental analysis signals which are generally meant to work on longer time frames with medium term trading where these fundamental signals are mostly irrelevant   generally you would buy and hold on a fundamental signal and ride the short term fluctuations if you believe you have done good analysis if you would like to trade on the 2 6 month time scale you would need a signal that works on that sort of time scale   some people believe that technical analysis can give you those kind of signals but there are many many many different technical signals and how you would trade using them is highly dependent on which one you believe works some people do mix fundamental and technical signals but that can be very complicated   learning a good amount about technical analysis could get you started   i will note though that studies of non professionals continuously show that the more frequently people trade the more on they underperform on average in the long term when compared with people that buy and hold an aside on technical analysis michael 's comment is generally correct though not well explained   say bob found a technical signal that works and he believes that a stock that costs $ 10 dollars should be $ 11   he buys it and makes money two months later when the rest of the market figures out the right price is $ 11 and he sells at that price   this works a bunch of times and he now publishes how the signal works on stack exchange to show everyone how awesome he is   next time bob 's signal finds a different stock at $ 10 that should be $ 11 but anna just wrote a computer program that checks that signal bob published faster than he ever could   the computer program buys as much as it can in milliseconds until the price is $ 11   bob goes to buy but now it is too late the price is already $ 11 and he ca n't make any money eventually people learn to anticipate adjust for this signal and even anna 's algorithms do n't even work anymore and the hunt for new signals starts again

i agree that high volatility just means the underlying stock price fluctuates more and it does not imply if the stock is going up or down but a high volatility in the price of an underlying also means that there is a higher chance that the underlying price could reach extreme prices albeit in either direction however if you purchased a call option then if the underlying price reached an extremely high value then you will be rewarded but if the underlying price reached an extremely low value you wo n't lose any more than the initial premium that you paid there is no additional risk on your side it 's capped to the premium that you paid for the call option it 's this asymmetric outcome heads i win tails i do n't lose combined with high volatility that means that call options will increase in value when the underlying price becomes more volatile if the optionality was n't there then the price would n't be related to the volatility of the underlying but that would be called a future or a forward

according to what little information is available currently this fund is most akin to an actively managed exchange traded fund rather than an investment trust an investment trust is an actively managed closed end fund that is tradeable on the stock market   closed end means that there are a fixed number of shares available for trading so if you wish to buy or sell shares in a closed end fund you need to find someone willing to sell or buy shares   actively managed means that the assets are selected by the fund managers in the belief that they will perform well   this is in contrast to a passively managed fund which simply tracks an underlying index    the closed end nature of investment trusts means that the share price is not well correlated to the value of the underlying assets   indeed almost all uk investment trusts trade at a significant discount to their net asset value   this reflects their historic poor performance and relatively weak liquidity   of course there are some exceptions to this examples of open end funds are unit trust us = mutual funds and etfs exchange traded funds   they are open end funds in the sense that the number of shares units available will change according to demand   most importantly the price of a share unit will be strongly correlated to the net asset value of the underlying portfolio   in general for an open end fund if the net asset value of the fund is x and there are y shares units outstanding then the price of a share unit will be x y.   historic data shows that passively managed funds index trackers always outperform actively managed funds in the long term   one of the big issues with actively managed funds is they have relatively high management fees   the peoples trust will be charging about 1 with a promise that this should come down over time   compare this to a fee of 0.05 on a large major market index tracking etf   further the 1 headline fee being touted by peoples trust is a somewhat misleading since they are paying their employees bonuses with shares in the fund   this will cause dilution of the net asset value per share and can be read as addition management fees by proxy   since competent fund managers will demand high incomes bonus shares could easily double the management fees depending on the size of the fund in summary history has shown that the promises of active fund managers rarely if ever come to fruition personally i would not consider this to be an attractive investment and would look more towards a passively managed major market index etf with low management fees

inflation can be a misleading indicator partly because it is not measured as a function of the change in prices of everything in the economy just the basket of goods deemed essential the other problem is that several things operate on it the supply of money   the total quantity of goods being exchanged and the supply of credit because the supply of goods divides as more stuff is available prices drop it 's not possible to know purely from the price level if prices are rising because there 's an actual shortage say a crop failure or simply monetary expansion at this point it also helps to know that the total money supply of the usa as measured by total quantity of money in bank deposits doubles every 10 years and has done that consistently since the 1970 's   usa total bank deposits so i would say simon moore manages to be right for the wrong reasons despite low inflation cash holdings are being proportionally devalued as the money supply increases most of the increase is going into the stock market however since shares are n't included in the measures of inflation then it does n't influence the inflation rate still if you look at the quantity of shares your money will buy now as opposed to 5 years ago it 's clear that the value of your money has dropped substantially   the in the pack is the influence of the credit supply on the price level

you bring up good points but the balance of power works both ways    investment banks need ratings in order to push through with fixed income issuance if rating agencies refuse to rate a product and it has happened i know we are shocked investors will be far less likely to participate and will demand substantially higher rates of return

furthermore the trust fund the article talks about does n't really exist they just owns treasury bills which as we all know are obligations of the u.s. government   so in order to exhaust the trust fund you have to expect the u.s. treasury to repay the in full which we can debate about whether that is a fair assumption or not

i would ask your hr or benefits department to be certain but here 's how i read that without any specific knowledge of the situation what is right to receive the rsu consideration company a was bought by company b.   you had unvested restricted stock units in a which is now gone   b is saying that you now have the right to receive consideration equivalent to the value of those rsus in a. since b is private there 's no publicly traded stock so it will likely be in cash but read the rest of the paperwork or talk to hr to be certain    for example if you had 100 rsus vesting next year and the price of stock in a was $ 50 when the company was bought those rsus would be worth $ 5,000   b is give you the right to consideration for those rsus hopefully for somewhere around $ 5,000   that consideration is unvested meaning you must stay employed until the vesting period in order to claim that right if you are fired without cause i.e. laid off you will receive those unvested claims as compensation    i assume the same will be applicable if employee leaves the company   probably not   in any situation if you voluntarily leave a company any unvested stock rsus options etc are forfeited

well yes but you should also begin to understand the sectoral component of real estate as a market too in that there can be commercial property   industrial property and retail property each of which is capable of having slightly tho usually similar of course different returns yields and risks   whereas you are saving to buy and enter into the residential property market which is different again and valuation principles are often out of here because buying a home although exposing your asset base to real estate risk is nt usually considered an investment as it is often made on emotional grounds not strict investment criteria

you can sign over the check of course however you 'll probably need to deal with 1099 issued to you personally instead of the corporation later on you 'll have to add it to your tax return as income and negative income on the same line line 21 of your 1040 and attach a statement explaining that the income was reported to you and will be reported on the corp form 1120 another option is to return the check to the payer and ask them to reissue in the correct name next time make sure to provide the properly filled w9 to your payers with the details of the corporation not your own details

i think you came up with a worthy masters phd research project it is a great question this is in australia so it is difficult for me to have complete perspective   however i can speak about the us of a. to your first point relatively few people inherit their wealth   according to a brief web search about 38 of billionaires and 20 of millionaires inherited their wealth   the rest are self made again in the us income mobility is very common   some act like high level earners are just born that way but studies have shown that a great deal of income mobility exists   i personally know people that have grown up without indoor plumbing and extremely poor but now earn in the top 5 of wage earners    quid 's points are valid   for example a starbucks new i phone and a brake job on your car are somewhat catastrophic if your income is 50k year hurts if your income is 100 k and an inconvenience if you make 250k year   these situations are normal and happen regularly   the first person may have to take a pay day loan to pay for these items the second credit card interest the third probably has the money in the bank   all of this the effect of an emergency on one 's net worth     to me there is also a chicken and egg effect in wealth building and income   how does one build wealth   by investing wisely planning ahead budgeting delaying gratification finding opportunities etc   now if you take those same skills to your workplace is n't it likely you will receive more responsibility promotions and raises   i believe so   and this too the effect on one 's net worth   if investing helps you to earn more then you will have more to invest to me one of the untold stories of this graph is not just investing but first building a stable financial base   having a sufficient emergency fund having enough and the right kind of insurance keeping loans to a minimum   without doing those things first investments might need to be withdrawn often at an inopportune time for emergency purposes thanks for asking this

i think that history shows that it 's rarely necessary for violence to lead to social reform there 's always been a of war between the upper class and the middle lower classes the term working class was a way to unify middle and lower classes against the wealthy idle class unfortunately the wealthy were able to convince many white collar middle class people that they were upper middle class and that the upper middle class shares values and goals with the elite if you look at the numbers this could n't be more wrong   by any standard i am a very fortunate person i have a six figure income and some assets however the truly elite in the us enjoy household wealth and income that dwarf what i make i pay a much higher percentage of my income to taxes than a person with inherited wealth does why is the system this way it 's effectively a barrier no matter how hard we work or how well we do we ca n't break through to the upper class instead of a meritocracy we have an aristocracy this is the great lie at the center of american politics today   the have the many of the best and brightest convinced that we 're part of the club when we 're really not and never can be they 've turned us against the blue collar workers and the poor when we should all be together they 've convinced many that people like the current administration trying to create more upward mobility are anti american when it 's really the aristocracy that violates democratic values of equality and   however we can vote for leaders who might do better we can peacefully assemble think ows we can go on reddit and share our political and economic opinions because of these freedoms we can safely say violence is a remote last resort   nothing is inevitable economic growth is really just people finding ways to interact and deliver value to one another and fortune favors the bold i 'll stay optimistic and keep making money as well as trying to help my community i 'll bet dollars to donuts change can and will happen   just because enough people will get sick of the of the world all the wealth and we 'll find a political solution   tl;dr martin king we 'll work it out like with our words

a lot of people do this for example in my area nice townhouses go for about $ 400 k so if you have $ 80,000 you can buy one and rent it here are the typical numbers so you would make $ 350 per month or $ per year on $ 80,000 in capital or about 5 profit what can go wrong 1 the property does not rent and sits vacant you must come up with $ 2100 in mortgage payments taxes and insurance every month without fail or default 2 unexpected expenses a new furnaces costs over $ 5,000 a new roof costs $ 7,000 a new appliance costs $ 600 to $ 2000 depending on how upscale your property is i just had a toilet fixed for a leaky it cost me $ 200 as you can see maintenance expenses can quickly get a lot higher than the $ 50 shown above and not only that if you fix things as cheaply as possible as most landlords do not only does that decrease the of the property but it causes stuff to break sooner 3 deadbeats some people will rent your property and then not pay you now you have a property with no income you are spending $ 2100 per month to pay for it and you are facing steep attorney fees to get the deadbeats evicted they can fight you in court for months 4 damage wear and tear whenever a tenant turns over there is always a lot of broken or worn stuff that has to be fixed holes in the wall need to be busted locks broken windows non working toilets stains on the carpet stuck doors ripped screens leaky showers broken tiles painting exterior trim painting walls painting fences etc you can spend thousands every time a tenant changes other caveats banks are much more strict about loaning to non home owners you usually have to have reserve income so if you have little or no income or you are stretched already it will be difficult to get commercial loans for example lets say your take home pay is $ 7,000 and you have no mortgage at all you rent then it is fine the bank will loan you the money but lets say you only have $ 5,000 in take home pay and you have an $ 1,800 mortgage on your own home in that case it is very unlikely a bank will allow you to assume a 2nd mortgage on a rental property the more you try to borrow the more reserve income the bank will require this tends to set a limit on how much you can leverage

from the comments it sounds like you have a technical background so i 'm going to suggest you think of this as a technical problem it 's an optimization problem where the variable you 're trying to optimize for is total interest paid over the lifetime of the loans step 1 is making sure you 're using the credit available to you most efficiently if there 's room in the credit limit for card 1 to move more of your debt there then definitely move your balances from the higher interest cards however be careful some cards will have different interest rates for balance transfers or cash advances and definitely do n't move any principal from card 3 until the 0 interest rate expires pursuing a bank loan as part of step 1 is valid as well you could start with the bank you use for your checking account today credit unions can be a good source of lower interest loans as well ensure that you fully understand the terms and interest rates particularly if they change just be careful about applying for them too many can affect your credit rating negatively you also mention in the comments that you 're paying her mortgage i do n't know how the ownership is set up there but either refinancing or taking out a home equity loan can be a way to consolidate debt the interest rate on a home loan will almost assuredly be less than on your higher rate cards especially taking the tax deduction into account step 2 is paying down the debt efficiently the rule here is simple pay the minimum payment on all cards except for the one with the highest interest rate any money you have above the minimum payments should go into paying down the principal on that one in your case that 's card 2   good luck

# 146441
written with some mild snark but no insult intended because financial stuff can be ridiculously confusing looked at another way you 're basically asking if the biblical parable of the talents can be implemented as a business model   you as the investor wish to be the master with the entity doing the investing playing the part of the servant since the law prohibits actual servitude as described in the model must substitute a contractual and loss sharing scheme ok based on what you 've proposed and by way of example let 's say you invested a thousand dollars you give the investment service your money at the end of a year they give you back    your capital $ 1000   plus 1/2 of any profits   or   less 1/2 of any losses so let 's say the worst happens and they lose all of it according to your proposal they have to cover 1/2 of the loss you end up with $ 500 but they end up with less than nothing they will be in a deficit situation because all the expense was theirs they do n't just fail to make a profit they go in the hole it does n't matter what percentages you use regardless of how the loss is shared you 've only guaranteed you ca n't lose all your money the company can given a large enough investment or enough market fluctuation a big shared loss could shut down a smaller firm to summarize    you want a service that charges you nothing    does all the work of managing and investing your capital   takes on part of the risk you would normally bear   on top of their usual risk and liability   agrees to do so solely for a percentage of any return where higher returns will likely involve a higher degree of risk   and that guarantees after just 1 year you 'll get x% of your capital back no matter what win or lose   even if the market crashes and all your capital and theirs is wiped out um to be serious briefly what you 're proposing is if nothing else inherently unfair and i believe you intended it as a mutually beneficial scenario but the real world imbalance in risk and reward prevents it being so any financial service that would accept those terms along with the extra degree of risk would be fiscally irresponsible from a business standpoint it 's an untenable model and no company would build on it it would be tantamount to corporate suicide the requirement that a service promise to give you back x% of your money no matter how great the loss makes your proposal impossible you need to think about how much all this costs realistically as well what kind of returns you can actually expect and that more risk for higher return is exactly what a service could not take a chance on if it had to share investors losses besides it 's not really sharing now is it they will always lose more than you always end up in a negative situation unable even to recoup costs circumstances beyond their control could result in a drop in the value that not only wipes out any profit but requires them to pay you for work performed and expenses incurred on your behalf   why would they let double dip like that yeah we all prefer getting something for nothing but you want valuable services and for them to pay you money for the privilege of providing them i totally agree that would be fantastic but in this world even free does n't come cheap anymore and getting back to costs   without consistent income the service would have nowhere to work and no resources to work with no office computer phone electricity internet insurance payroll licensing training maintenance security lobbying etc etc etc why do people always forget overhead there 's a reason these services operate the way they do even the best are working with fairly slim margins in a volatile sector they 're not into 1-year gambles unlikely to cover their cost of doing business or having to pay for a negative return out of their own pocket look if you 're the biblical master asking your servant to manage things overhead is built in you 're taking all the risk as well you 're paying for all three servants food home clothing etc plus you had to buy the servants themselves so its reasonable that you reap the reward of their labor you paid for it and you did n't even punish the servant who buried your money in a hole the two good servants may have done the legwork but you took on the burden of everything else in your proposed service however contrary to the servant 's usual role the servant i.e. the company would be assuming a portion of your risk on top of their own yet without any guarantee of profit income or even coverage of costs they 're also subject to regulations fees liability legal stuff etc that you 're not against most of which you are and held harmless if they agree to cover a share of your loss it exposes to greater liability and more related risk it robs them of resources they need to   invest in their own business while at the same time forcing them to do all the work as a result your model does n't give such a service a fighting chance getting it off the ground and lasting past the first year payouts would require more luck than skill   they 'd be better off heading to vegas and the blackjack table where the only overhead is a cheap flight and room where the odds and rules do n't change overnight and they at least get free drinks if none of the equivalents satisfies then the biblical parable appears to describe your only option for obtaining exactly what you want move to a country where slavery is legal and buy an investor   cheers c

is investing in a roth retirement account only better if you will be in a higher     tax bracket in retirement if you are pushing up against the contribution limits a roth account may allow you to save more money in tax advantaged accounts in your example you are putting $ 100 pre tax in a traditional account vs $ 85 post tax in a roth account but if there are limits and the limits are the same for traditional or roth accounts as they currently are for us 401(k accounts you can effectively put more into a roth account where the limit applies to the post tax amount than a traditional account where the limit applies to the pre tax amount if so is there any case in which a traditional retirement account is better than a roth account it is smart to have some money in a traditional account because the first amount of money you earn or withdraw each year up to the standard deduction is taxed at 0 which is probably less than your current rate and the next bit of money is taxed at only 10 which may also be less than your current marginal rate of course things may change by the time you retire but it is probably safe to assume that we will still have some kind of progressive income tax structure

i believe that article provides some good reasons though it may be a bit light on technical details and there are likely other reasons a company would do it so if they can finance for less then they would lose to taxes by bringing the money home and they do not take on too much debt this will likely work just fine and increase share holder value hopefully someone else can provide some other reasonable scenarios the bottom line is that it does not matter how they finance the share buybacks and/or dividend payments as long as they do not shoot themselves in the foot while doing it

there is a basic difference between saving for voluntary retirement i.e. choosing to do things other than work even though you could still work and the need to save for later in life in general regardless of how much you like your job a time will eventually come when you are no longer able to work and you will need an alternate source of income to live from at that point this is also the time when most people generally have the highest medical bills as well and may need other services such as long term nursing home care so even if you plan to work as long as possible a retirement fund is an excellent way to plan for these needs as it is tax advantaged and many companies offer matching contributions i would simply recommend that you see retirement accounts as a good way to accomplish your goals you do n't have to use them to create a typical retirement once you 've taken advantages of the match and tax subsidies you may also wish to consider saving for an annuity fees can be high so you will need to do your homework generally you want to wait and buy an immediate annuity but this is another way to turn savings into guaranteed income once you need to stop working best of luck

as asked previous in the week there is a big difference between budgeting and expense tracking   using software like gnucash allows one to track their spending    a budget is a plan the tracking is what actually happened i do not track expenses although i do budget   for me hitting financial goals is good enough of a track without investing the time and energy into tracking every penny   one could easily criticize my method as how can you have a good plan without continuous feedback for me it is an example of the 80/20 principle   if i put in 20 effort into making and sticking to a budget i will obtain 80 of the financial success that a person who 100 effort into budgeting and tracking   a person with the same income and life events who budgets and tracks will likely be more successful that i however not overwhelmingly so   for me time is better spent on other endeavors   you seem to have this attitude as well but those that do track have it as part of their path to financial success and probably view us as somewhat foolish     this is another example how personal finance is more about behavior than math

no you may not deduct the charitable contributions of your children the nest covers this in detail the irs only allows you to deduct charitable contributions that you personally funded whether the contribution was made in your name or in someone else 's if your child or dependent makes a donation to a charity you are not allowed to claim it as a tax deduction this is true even if your dependent does not claim the contribution on his own tax return because he opts for the standard deduction rather than itemizing or claims exemption now had you constructed the transaction differently it 's possible you could 've made the contribution in your child 's name and thus claimed the deduction   allowance is technically a gift and if she agrees to forgo allowance in exchange for you making a contribution well the irs ca n't really complain though they might try if it were a large amount contributions in the name of someone else but funded by yourself are deductible can deduct contributions you make in someone else ’s name so if you donated a certain amount of money to xyz charity in your child ’s name for example you would be able to deduct this amount on your taxes as long as the deduction requirements are met you will need to keep accurate records of the payment along with the receipt from the organization to prove you financed the donation

companies with existing borrowings where borrowings are on variable interest rates or in the case with fixed interest rates companies that get new borrowings would pay less interest on these borrowings so their cost will go down and profits up making them more attractive to investors   so in general lower interest rates will make the share market a more attractive investment than some alternatives as investors are willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns this will usually result in the stock market rising as it is currently in the us edit the case for rising interest rates a central bank 's purpose when raising interest rates is to slow down an economy that is booming as interest rates rise consumers will tighten up their spending and companies will thus have less revenue on top of higher costs for maintaining existing borrowing with variable rates or new borrowing with fixed rates if rates are higher companies may also defer new borrowings to expand their business this will eventually lead to lower profits and lower valuation for these companies another thing that happens is that as banks start increasing interest for saving accounts investors will look for safety where they can get a higher return than before without the risk of the stock market   with lowering profits and valuations and investor 's money flowing out of shares and into the money market so will company share prices drop although this may lag a bit with the share market still booming due to greed but once the boom stops for the crash

a good measurement would be to compare to index 's basically a good way to measure your self would be to ask if i put my money somewhere else how much better or worse would i have done mutual funds and hedge funds use the sp500 as a bench mark some funds actually wave their fee if they do not outperform the sp or only take a fee on the portion that has outperformed the sp500 in today 's economy i do nt know how to expect such a return the economy is not a good benchmark on what to expect from the stock market for example in 2009 by certain standards the economy was worse then today but in 2009 the market rallied a great deal so your returns should have reflected that you can use the sp500 as a quick reference to compare your returns this is also considered the standard for a quick comparison the way you compare your performance is also dependent on how you invest your money if you are outperforming the sp500 you are doing well many mutual funds do not outperform the sp500 edit additional info here is an article with more comprehensive information on how to gauge your performance in the article is a link to a free tool from morning star use the right benchmark to accurately measure investment performance

from a purely analytical standpoint assuming you are investing your roth ira contributions in broad market securities such as the spdr s&p 500 etf which tracks the s&p 500 the broader market has historically had more upward movement than downward and therefore a dollar invested today will have a greater expected value than a dollar invested tomorrow   so from this perspective it is better to max out your roth on the first day of the contribution year and immediately invest in broad market or at least well diversified securities that being said opportunity costs must also be taken into account every dollar you use to fund your roth ira is a dollar that is no longer available to be invested elsewhere hence a lost opportunity   with this in mind if you are currently eligible for a 401k in which your employer matches some portion of your contributions it is generally advised that you contribute to the 401k up to the employer match   for example if your employer matches 75 of contributions up to 3.5 of your gross salary then it is advisable that you first contribute this 3.5 to your 401k before even considering contributing to a roth ira   the reasoning behind this is two fold first the employer match can be considered as a guaranteed return on investment so for example for an employer that matches 75 for every dollar you contribute you already have earned a 75 return up to the employer 's limit   secondly 401k contributions have tax implications not only is the money contributed to the 401k pre tax i.e. contributions are not taxed it also reduces your taxable income so the marginal tax benefit of these contributions must also be taken into account   keep in mind that in the usual circumstances 401k disbursements are taxable finally many financial advisors will also suggest establishing an emergency fund which is money that you will not use unless you suffer an emergency that has an impact on your normal income loss of job medical emergency etc   these funds are often kept in highly liquid accounts savings accounts money market funds etc so they can be accessed immediately when you run into one of life 's little surprises   generally it is advised that an emergency fund between $ is established asap and over time the emergency fund should be increased until it has reached a value equivalent to the sum of 8 months worth of expenses   if funding an ira is preventing you from working towards such an emergency fund then you may want to consider waiting on maxing out the ira before you have that ef established of course it goes without saying that credit card balances with aprs other than 0.00 or similar should be paid off before an ira is funded since while you can only hope to match the market at best between 10 15 a year in your ira investments paying down credit card balances is an instant return of whatever the apr is which usually tends to be between a 15 30 apr in a nutshell assuming you are maxing out your 401k if applicable have an emergency fund established are not carrying any high apr credit card balances and are able to do so historical price movements in the markets suggest that funding your roth ira upfront and investing these funds immediately in a broadly diversified portfolio will yield a higher expected return than funding the account periodically throughout the year using dollar cost averaging or similar strategies   if this is not the case take some time to consider the opportunity costs you are incurring from not fully contributing to your 401k carrying high credit card balances or not having a sufficient emergency fund established this is not financial advice specific to any individual and your mileage may vary   consider consulting a certified financial planner certified public accountant etc before making any major financial decisions

it depends on whether you want a career as a fund analyst or if you want to be an trader a fund manager will have many constraints that a private investor does n’t have as they are managing other people ’s money   if they do invest their own money as well they usually would invest it differently from how they invest the fund 's money many would just get someone else to invest their money for them just as a surgeon would get another surgeon to operate on a family member my suggestion to you is to find a job you like doing and build up your savings whilst you are building up your savings read some books you said you do n’t know much about the financial markets then learn about them get yourself a working knowledge about both fundamental and technical analysis work out which method of analysis if not both suits you best and you would like to know more about as you read you will get a better idea if you prefer to be a long term investor or a short term trader or somewhere in between or a combination of various methods now you will start to get an idea of what type of books and areas of analysis you would like to concentrate on once you have a better idea of what you would like to do and have gained some knowledge then you can develop your investment trading plan and start paper trading once you are happy with you plan and your paper trading you can start trading with a small account balance not more than $ 10,000 and preferably under $ 5,000 no matter how well you did with paper trading you will always do worse with real money at first due to your emotions being in it now so always start off small if you want to become good at something it takes time and a lot of hard work you ca n’t go from knowing nothing to making a million dollars per year without putting in the hard yards first

more possible considerations with other properties   maybe properties that rent for $ 972 have more amenities than this one parking laundry yard etc or are in better repair   or maybe the $ 972 property is a block closer to campus and thus commands 30 higher rent that can happen   condition of property   you know nothing about this until you see it   it could be in such bad shape that you ca n't legally rent it until you spend a lot of money fixing it   or it may just be run down or outdated still but not as attractive to renters leading to lower rent and/or longer vacancy periods   do you accept that or spend a lot of money to renovate collecting the rent   tenants do n't necessarily always pay their rent on time or at all   if a tenant quits paying you incur significant expenses to evict them and then find a new tenant and all the while you collect no rent there could be a tenant in place paying a much lower rent   rent control or a long lease may prevent you from raising it   if you are able to raise it and the tenant does n't want to pay see above maintenance and more maintenance   college students could be hard on the property one good could easily cause more damage than their security deposits will cover being near a university does n't guarantee you an easy time renting it   it suggests the demand is high but maybe the supply is even higher   renting to college students has additional issues   they are less likely to have incomes large enough to satisfy you that they can pay the rent   are you willing to deal with   if a student quits paying are you willing to try to collect from their cosigning parents in another state   and you 'll probably have many tenants roommates living in the house   they will come and go separately and unexpectedly complicating your leasing arrangements   and you may well get drawn in to disputes between them

gt home solar does n't need to completely replace grid power a 70 reduction in demand would be sufficient to reduce generation requirements to only existing hydro wind nuclear plants   that is exactly where the problem is when your home solar and battery is out of power then your grid without traditional backup is out of power as well so in the end you need your grid to supply power in the 30 of time when your renewable plus some storage has none at the same time all household equipped like yours are out of power as well so either the grid power company has conventional backup or huge storage of course the cost of these must be levied over the 30 of time they are used not economically attractive   so you expect as a household to be able to just get energy from the grid power company when it is necessary for you as a backup are you ready to pay the triple rate during that time

the loan to value ratio ltv ratio is a lending risk assessment ratio that financial institutions and others lenders examine before approving a mortgage it sounds like your lender has a 60 requirement remember the home is the collateral for the loan   if you stop making payments they can take the house back from you   that number is less than 100 to accommodate changing market prices the cost of foreclosure repairing and reselling the home   they may be a safety factor built in depending on the home 's location    if you want to buy a $ 1.8 million dollar home you will have to come up with 40 down payment   that down payment is what reduces the risk for the lender   so no there is no way to cheat that think about the transaction from the view of the lender    note in some areas you can still get a loan if you do n't have the required down payment   you just have to pay a monthly mortgage insurance   it 's expensive but that works for many home buyers   a separate insurance company offers a policy that helps protect the lender when there is n't enough deposit paid update   er no   keep it simple   the bank will only loan you money if it has collateral for the loan they 've built in a hefty safety margin to protect them in case you quit paying them your monthly payments   if you want to spend the money on something else that would work as long as you provide collateral to protect the lender   you mention borrowing money for some other purpose then buying a home   that would be fine but you will have to come up with some collateral that protect the lender if you wanted to buy a new business the bank would first ask for an appraisal of the value of the assets of the business   that could be applied to the collateral safety net for the lender   if you wanted to buy a business that had little appraisal value then the bank would require more collateral from you in other forms   say you wanted to borrow the money for an expensive operation or cosmetic surgery in that case there is no collateral value in the operation you ca n't sell anything from the surgery to anybody to recover costs the money is spent and gone   before the bank would loan you any money for such a surgery they would require you to provide upfront collateral   in this case if you were to borrow $ 60,000 for surgery the bank would require $ 100,000 worth of collateral to protect their interest in the loan you borrow money then you pay it back at a regular interval at an agreed upon rate and schedule   same thing for borrowing money for the stock market or a winning horse at the horse race   a lender will require a hard asset as collateral before making you a loan    yes i know you have a good tip on a winning horse and you are bound to double your money but that 's not the way it works from a lender 's point of view     it sounds like you are trying to game the system by playing on words   i will say quit using the 40 to 60 phrase   that is just confusing   the bank 's loan to value is reported as a single number in this case 60   for every $ 6000 you want to borrow you have to provide an asset worth $ 10,000 as a safety guarantee for the loan if you want to borrow money for the purchase of a home you will need to meet that 60 safety requirement   if you want to borrow $ 1,000,000 cash for something besides a home then you will have to provide something with a retail value of $ as equity i think the best way for you to answer your own question is for you to pretend to be the banker then examine the proposal from the banker 's viewpoint will the banker have enough collateral for whatever it is you are asking to borrow if you do n't yet have that equity and you need a loan for something besides a home you can always save your money until you do have enough equity   comment one i thought that most lenders had a 75 or 80 loan to value ratio the 60 number seems pretty low   that could indicate you may be a high risk borrower or possibly that lender is not the best for you   have you tried other lenders   it 's definitely worth shopping around for different lenders    comment two i will say it almost sounds like you are n't being entirely honest with us here   no way someone with a monthly income who can afford a $ 1.8 million home would be asking questions like this   i get that english probably is n't your first language but still   the other thing is if you are truly buying a $ 1.8 million dollar home your real estate agent would be helping you find a lender that will work with you   they would be highly motivated to see this sale happen    all of your questions could be answered in ten minutes with a visit to your local bank or any bank for that matter   when you add up the costs and taxes and insurance on a 30 fixed loan you 'd have a monthly mortgage payment of nearly $ 10,500 a month or more   can you really afford that on your monthly income

considering i 'm putting 30 down and having my father cosign is there    any chance i would be turned down for a loan on a $ 100k car according to bankrate the average credit score needed to buy a new car is 714 but they also show average interest rates at for new car loans to people with credit scores in the 660 range high income certainly helps offset credit score to some extent   not every bank dealership does things the same way being self employed you 'd most likely be required to show 2 years of tax returns and they 'd use those as a basis for your income rather than whatever you have made recently if using a co signer their income matters another key factor is debt to income ratio if too much of someone 's income is already spoken for by other debts a lender will shy away so yes there 's a chance given all the information we do n't know and the variability with lender policies that you could be turned down for a car loan how should i go about this if you 're set on pursuing the car loan just go talk to some lenders you 'll want to shop around for a good rate anyway so no need to speculate just go find out include the dealership as a potential financing option they can have great rates personally i 'd get a much cheaper car your insurance premium on a 100k car will be quite high due to your age you might be rightly confident in your earning potential but nothing is guaranteed situations can change wildly in short order a new car is not a good investment or a value retaining asset so why bother going into debt for one if you do n't have to if you buy something in cash now you could upgrade in a few years without financing if your earning prediction holds and would save quite a bit in car insurance and interest over the years between

he 's misunderstanding buffett 's argument which is that all forms of investment compete and so when interest rates give you guaranteed low returns it makes sense for stocks to give you average low returns   that implies high prices for current stocks because your return on equities is the price tomorrow over the price today   buffett would likely agree with him that this implies slow growth in the future though he may not want to say so for competitive reasons   historical p e norms are a more wrong metric because they do n't capture any fundamental change that might have happened in the economy   what 's likely going on is a surplus of capital as business becomes more efficient i.e. generates more revenue with fewer workers that excess cash flow becomes investable capital but as it becomes more efficient i.e. less of that revenue filters down to workers in the form of wages that they can spend on consumer goods the amount of productive uses where that capital can be effectively deployed in income generating activities declines   more capital + fewer investable opportunities = higher supply + lower demand = the price of securities for the few areas of the economy that are doing well increases   this is why you see insane valuations for tech companies   if we do get a major economic crash it will likely come from a style financial crisis where all the money gets concentrated within emerging new industries focused on new technology who ca n't sell their products because nobody else has any money   we 're on the path to that already but it will likely take a decade or two to play out there 's still a lot of money left in the old economy which can be extracted   also these style of financial crises usually are accompanied by war and a breakdown of the established political order and so all bets are off anyway

do not reinvent the wheel historical data about stock market returns and standard deviations suffer from number of issues such as past filling and mostly survivorship bias that the current answers do not consider at all i suggest to read the paper a century of global stock markets by uc and william yale here william bernstein comments the results here notice that rebalancing is sometimes a good option but not always his non obvious finding where the low sd did not favour from rebalancing   look at the final page of the paper   geometric returns represent returns to a buy and hold strategy and the arithmetic averages give equal weight to each observation interval where you can find your asked historical effect of rebalancing on return and standard deviation the paper nicely summarizes the results to this table   the results in the table are from the interval 1996 it is not that long time but even longer term data has its own drawbacks the starting year is interesting choice because it is around the times of social economical changes and depressing moments historical context can be realized from books such as grapes of short summary here although fiction to some extent it has some to the history the authors have had to ignore some years because of different reasons such as political unrest and wars   instead of into marketed spam as suggested by one reply i would look into this search here look at the number of references and the related papers to judge their value   p.s i encourage people to attack my open question here hope we can solve it

your desire to travel before starting work is smart and something you should do there are very few opportunities in life where you will have a chunk of time to do such travelling having said that your life plans may or may not pan out the way you expect ideally you 'd take the 0 apr for 18 months and max it out a 3 balance transfer bt fee breaks out to 1.5 apr but due in 1.5 years that 's a very good loan rate if you can pay it before the apr changes say you take 6 months to travel when you return you have one year to pay off your credit card bill calculate how much you will borrow and how much your monthly payments will be $ 1,500 across 12 months is $ 125 can you add that as a monthly expense what will your life circumstances be when you return from travel do you know what your income will be do you know what your expected expenses will be how much padding will you have for emergencies

the thing you need to keep in mind is that if you take on debt you need to have a plan to pay it off and execute on it   you also need to understand what your carrying cost is what you will pay in finance charges every month   there are times when you need to take on debt in order to be a productive person   for example in many places in the us you need a car in order to have a job   it 's ludicrous for someone to assert that you should n't take on any debt in order to get a reliable vehicle   that does n't mean you go out and lease the car that you can get on your income in this case i 'd say it 's a bit of a grey area   could you live in an apartment for a while   perhaps   many people would have a hard time living like that and it could affect your ability to perform at work   i would argue that buying a decent mattress to sleep on falls under the same category as getting a car so that you can work   you do n't want to be missing work because your back is in from sleeping on the floor or a worn out mattress as far as the rest of it goes it really depends on how fast you can pay it off   if you are looking at more than a few months 6 tops to pay off the purchase in full you should reassess   realize that the interest you are paying is increasing the cost of the furniture and act accordingly   as mentioned you can often get 0 financing for a limited period   understand that if you do n't pay off the entire balance in that period you will normally be retroactively charged interest on the entire starting amount and that interest rate will likely be quite high the problem with credit is when you start using it and continually growing the balance   it 's easy to keep saying that you will start paying it off later and the next thing you know you are buried   it 's not a big one time purchase by itself that normally gets people into trouble it 's continual spending beyond their means month after month

blockchain technology does not seem to be the point in their startup which usually should be when there is an ico a lot of the things that they say blockchain could enable them to do could be done with a database they have a pretty experienced team in real estate though it looks like they are using the ico simply as an easy method of raising capital than having an innovative use of the blockchain token

the yen is the source of carry it means whichever savvy people with means who want to borrow money to invest on a leveraged basis anywhere in the world come running to borrow in yen why because 1 japan is an advanced economy whose currency is freely convertible to many many currencies countries who are happy to convert yen back and forth 2 japanese interest rates are low lower than in the west b c of their earlier deflationary crises due to too much debt and due to west requiring yen to be too strong after the plaza accords so it 's cheap to borrow there   so a lot of investment around the world has in origin come from borrowing in japan   as long as that investment is on the loan to japan remains outstanding but the investor earns the carry the rate of difference between the cost of borrowing in yen and earning the return from whatever investment it is    when scary things happen like war disaster etc the big money bags investors pull their money out of their investments and put it in their banks   this means they sell their investments wherever they are convert some of that money back into buy yen to return their yen loans yen goes up

my answer is n't a full one but that 's because i think the answer depends on at minimum the country your broker is in the type of order you place limit market algo etc and the size of your order for example i can tell from watching live rates on regular lot limit orders i place with my uk based broker that they hold limit orders internally until they see a crossing rate on the exchange my requested stock is trading on then they submit a limit order to that exchange   i only get filled from that one exchange and this happens noticeably after i see my limit price print and my fills are always better than my limit price whereas with my us based broker i can see my regular limit order in the order book depth of book data prior to any fills   i will routinely be notified of a fill before i see the limit price print   and my fills come from any number of us exchanges nyse arca bats etc even for the same stock i should point out that the nbbo rule in the us under sec regulation probably causes more complications in handling of market and limit orders than you 're likely to find in most countries

if you have someplace to put the money which you think will yield significantly better returns by all means sell and buy that on the other hand if you think this stock is likely to recover its value you might want to hold it or even buy more as a contrarian investment buy low sell high as much as possible and diversify you need to make a judgement call about the odds we can point out the implications but in the end whether to sell buy hold or hedge is your decision this also suggests you need to sit down and draw up a strategy over every decision is not productive if you have a plan you make this sort of decision before you ever put money into the stock in the first place

as a rental this is not an ideal set of numbers you manage to show a $ 255 gain but $ 275 is from payment to principal so from the start you 're out $   this ignores the $ 170 k down payment which has an opportunity cost however you calculate it you can assign the same rate as the mortgage and it 's nearly $ 10k yr or the rate you feel your choice of stock market or alternate investment would rise either way you ca n't ignore this money   your mortgage rate is n't fixed a 1 rise and it would jump to $ $ ideally a rental property is cash positive without counting principal paydown or even the tax refund it 's a risky proposition to buy and count on everything going right i did n't mean to scare you off with 1 but you should research the costs of repair and maintenance last year my heat ac system needed replacement us$ 10k. this year it 's time to paint and replace rotting trim $ 7000   in the us we have property tax that can range from 1 2 of the house value if you do n't have this tax that 's great just please confirm this

if you 're referring to times when they pay nothing or receive a refund at the end of the year it 's because they 're paying taxes throughout the year at the end of the year the accountants find that they paid exactly what they needed to or more so they do n't have to pay anything or get money back on their yearly forms   i do n't think there 's a us corporation paying almost zero tax in the us
