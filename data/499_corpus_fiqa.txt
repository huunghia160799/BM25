my husband used this device at work in an organization club that collects dues for fundraisers the fundraisers are only for the club so i think that is not business at all they have no business tax i d etc and they use it for personal reasons when collecting money via cc 's if this helps you
# 346444
what i should have done in the first place was just ask them   from their customer support team thanks for writing in and for your interest in square it is perfectly acceptable to use square for personal business such as a yard sale you do not need to have a registered business to take advantage of square and the ability to accept credit cards just please note that it is against our terms of service to process prepaid cards gift cards or your own credit card using your own square account additionally you may not use square as a money transfer system for every payment processed through square you must provide a legitimate good or service please let me know if you have any additional concerns
# 482332
yes from their tos by creating a square account you confirm that you are either a legal resident of the united states a united states citizen or a business entity

the shift to trading at the close began in 2008 traders did not want to be caught off guard by surprise news and there was a lot of volatility during the financial crisis so they would close their position in the evening that s how it began there are two reasons why it sticks around first there has been an increase usage of index funds or passive funds these funds tend to update their positions at the end of the day from the wsj another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments such as index funds these funds aim to mimic an index like the s&p 500 by owning the shares that comprise it index funds do n’t trade as often as active investors but when they do it is typically near the market close traders say that is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate the second reason is simply that volume attracts volume as a result of what s mentioned above you have a shift to end of day trading and the to that is that there is a liquidity shortage from 10 am to 3 pm thus if you want to buy or sell a stock but there are few buyers or sellers around you will significant move the price when you enter your order obviously this does not affect retail traders but imagine hedge funds entering or closing a billion dollar position it can make a huge impact on price and one way to mitigate that is to wait until there are more market participants to take the other end of your trade just as at the end of the day so this is a self reinforcing trend that has begun in the markets and will likely stick around

gt you 're right about the accuracy of axioms being important though if you can disprove an you can disprove the theory that 's why the fewer axioms taken and the simpler those axioms are the stronger the resultant argument becomes   that is true philosophical argument and is however quite a bit removed from the original point of this discussion your point which i several times over the course of this thread is that lowering taxes will lead to increased growth compensating for the revenue deficit you are basing this on the laffer curve which states that there is a particular taxation point where the total collected taxes are maximized the curve itself seems fairly common sense at a first glance but are we to the right of the curve several papers have argued that we are on the science article science article   additionally the curve itself is doubtful as it has not been observed in a real world setting austerity measures almost wrecked european economies in the early part of this decade while the kansas experiment was a utter bust    gt we can make certain simple assumptions about human nature such as that all else being equal people will chose to take actions that aligns with their wants needs over ones that do not   and this is an incomplete statement people will take actions in a boundary of possibility that boundary is much higher for somebody whose wealth puts them at 99.9 of the scale rather than being at 20 and taking the point further the wants needs are also very different for somebody at different social given that there is no evidence and rather there is a wealth of contradictory evidence that giving a tax cut to the highest income earners would boost the economy   your assumptions and axioms are wrong and a simple introductory economics course courses of macroeconomics course introduction economics macroeconomics 2x will solve your misconceptions   beyond mathematical mastery the true mark of a rational scientific person is a willingness to accept mistakes and be humble about it i see neither in you on the contrary when presented with evidence you raise straw man arguments eg the validity of vs empirical observations obfuscate facts and changing of goalposts when presented with economic reason i see pride in not knowing modern economic advancements you see that as a mark of intelligence but that is idiocy that belongs on /r

this decision depends upon a few things i will list a 1 what is your perception about financial markets in your time span of investments 2 what kind of returns are you expecting 3 how much liquidity do you have to take care of your daily monthly expenses your perception about financial markets is weak for the near future do not invest all your money in a mutual fund at 1 time because if the market falls drastically chances are that your fund will also lose a lot of money and the nav will go down on the other hand if you think it is strong go ahead and invest all at one time 2 if you are expecting very high returns in a short time frame then sip might not be a very good option as you are only investing a portion of your money so if the market goes higher then you will make money only on what you have invested till date and also buy into the fund in the upcoming month at a higher rate so you will get less units   3 if you put all your money into a mutual fund will you have enough money to take care of your daily needs and emergencies the worst thing about an investment is putting in all what you have and then being forced to sell in a bear market at a lower rate because you really require the money other option is taking a personal 16 and taking care of your daily needs but that would not make sense either as the average return that you can expect from a mutual fund in india is 12 13 to 1 if you have money to spare and think the market is going to go higher a mutual fund is a better option 2 if you have the money to spare and think that the market is going to fall don't do is always better to be even than lose 3 if you do n't have the money and do n't know about markets but want to be part of it then you can invest in an sip because the advantages of this are if the market goes high you make money on what you 've put it and if the market falls you get to buy more units of the fund for a cheaper price eventually you can expect to make a return of 14 15 on these but again investments are subject to market risk please watch the funds average return over the last 10 years and their portfolio holdings all the best i am assuming you are talking about equity funds

inherent or intrinsic value aside from the term 's use with regards to options markets   every time i tell someone i 've invested in bitcoin they tell me that it is silly because there is no inherent or intrinsic value in bitcoin   but what is the intrinsic value of paper with a federal seal on it what is the intrinsic value of a component that could be but does n't have to be used in computer parts gold    my favorite question of all to show the silliness of intrinsic value is to ask what is the intrinsic value of water    to someone and dying of thirst in a desert i 'm quite certain that faced with death they 'd be willing to part with an for the water if anything to simply survive   on the other hand what is the value of water to someone drowning i would think it actually has a quite negative value and they 'd be more than happy to see the water gone even going so far as to part with an   to make an argument that water has an intrinsic value is to say that the word value is n't subjective when it very clearly is in both cases where water is needed and not wanted one would feasibly be willing to pay a very extreme cost the removal of an in order to both have or be rid of water   all this said it would appear that intrinsic value means i 'm trying to make an objective point about a subjective value even if you were to try to make the case that water had some sort of baseline or average value with regards to supporting mankind and that this was intrinsic it would additionally be irrelevant because the definition of supporting mankind is subjective do we just use just enough water to keep men and women alive across the world without regards to health do we count children as half men do we count a non active 50 year old female 's water needs as highly as an active 16 year old male 's what about with regards to evaporation and we do n't know the weather or climate changes in store so in case of famine should we consider enough water to last 3 days 3 weeks or 3 years   no i 'm afraid the only way to really consider what is the value of water is to drop this silly notion of intrinsic value and realize that water is worth merely what someone is willing to pay for it and so my argument would go is bitcoin

my mother worked for one of the major american car rental companies she talked about this topic with me and my answer will summarize the talk does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser there is much more to the price equation a premium rental car company one that only rents fairly new nice cars has a certain image to maintain to protect their perceived value a new ist car also besides the point of the image of the general company commands a better rental price many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars because people renting these cars often them this is a bad argument you 've read if former rental cars are in bad shape the price will reflect that if they are priced the same for the same miles ridden they have equivalent wear and tear in other words the relative price of the car determines whether rental cars are more heavily worn not random people 's opinions on the internet people on the internet are mostly wrong irony intended from the single company i have as reference i also do n't see that as relevant there are company and governmental regulations to keep maintenance up i clean my car once a year change the oil twice replace my every eighteen months and so forth the maintenance cycles required for rental cars may and this is just speculation negate the gradual extra degradation that drivers may have on rental cars

yes but at the root of it is the consumer complaining that these trusted sources are not adhering to principles of journalistic integrity while they are desperately trying to survive thrive and adapt to a completely shifting paradigm where competition is lowering the bar and the same consumers are unwilling to step up and reward journalistic integrity this is what happens essentially we get what we pay for    we can lay blame on the media organizations as much as we care to but the reality is we ’ve reached a point where most people like to be given talking points and sound bites that their point of view rather than actually try to obtain facts and form their own opinions the truth is rarely in the bite size pieces our society today   trust in the media is at an all time low for no other reason than we allowed it to happen and rewarded the media for going down that path we ’ve created a system that does not reward what we say we want from media rather rewards the actions that show we want the complete opposite    if i may inquire how many people reading this pay any premium for good journalism i will be the first to sadly admit i do not   obviously this means i am also part of the problem despite making an effort to look at news from all sides i am just a guilty as most to reinforcing the same system that has destroyed journalistic integrity

tax advantaged accounts mean you pay less tax you fundamentally pay less tax on iras and 401ks than other accounts that 's their benefit you keep more money at the expense of the government it makes sense for the government to limit it if you do n't understand why you pay less tax you must consider the time value of money the principal now is the same value of money as the principal + earnings later with iras and 401ks you only pay income tax once with roth iras and 401ks you pay tax on the entire amount of money once when you earn it with pre tax traditional iras and 401ks you pay tax on the entire amount of money once when withdraw it however with outside accounts you have to pay tax more than once you pay once when you earn it and pay tax again on the earnings later earnings that grew from money that was already taxed which when considering time value means that the earnings have already been taxed but is taxed again for things like savings in a bank it 's even worse interest which grew from money already taxed is taxed every year which means some money you pay tax on n times if you have it in there n years if you do n't understand the above you can see with an example we start with $ 1000 pre tax wages and for simplicity will assume a flat 25 income tax rate and a growth rate of 10 per year and get the cash assume it 's a qualified withdrawal in 10 years

beware of surrender charges also surrender charges many annuities    will impose a surrender charge if the annuity is cashed in before a    specific period of time that period may run anywhere from 1 to 12    years a typical surrender charge is one that starts at 7 in the    first year of the contract and declines by 1 per year thereafter    until it reaches zero the charge is made against the value of the    investment when the annuity is and its purpose other    than simply to make money for the insurance company is to discourage    a short term investment by the purchaser for that reason an annuity    should always be considered a long term investment in the typical    fixed annuity though this charge will not apply provided no more    than 10 of the investment is withdrawn per year source if you 've held it for 10 years as you claim you may not owe any or much in surrender charges but you definitely want to know what the situation is before you make a move

stock b could be considered to be more risky because it seems to be more volatile sharp rises on large volume increases can easily be followed by sharp drops or by further rises in the start of a new uptrend   however if both a and b are trading on low volume in general they can both be more on the risky side due to having relatively low liquidity especially if you buy a large order compared to the average daily volume but just looking at the criteria you have included in your question is not enough to determine which stock is riskier than the other and you should look at this criteria in combination with other indicators and information about each stock to obtain a more complete picture

someone posted a very insightful article on reddit a while back that basically explained the whole cable pricing model and why a la carte would n't work or would be so prohibitively expensive that nobody would go for it    iirc the breakdown was that basically a few super popular channels and live sports in the standard $ 100/mo package helped subsidize the rest of the less popular channels       most of the niche channels probably could n't exist in an a la carte environment unless they were ridiculously cheap and if they were ridiculously cheap they would n't be able to generate enough revenue to stay afloat    also how would the pricing work   could i subscribe to amc for 1 hour a week to watch mad men   or would i be locked into subscribing for a minimum of a day week month       imho what makes more sense is to allow people to subscribe to individual shows like rss feeds

some builders if given the first chance to deal with the problem instead of being presented with a bill after the fact will fix the problem at no charge to the homeowner   good faith matters my house was built by such a builder   if i have a problem that i am competent enough to diagnose and fix i fix it myself at my cost   if i have a problem that that i can not diagnose and fix myself but that i think the builder or his subcontractor is competent enough to diagnose and/or fix i contact the builder or subcontractor directly   i am willing to pay for the diagnosis and/or fix especially if it is an aging or wear and tear issue or the logical consequence of a cost saving measure that i voluntarily chose when the house was being designed if the problem is a plumbing problem i contact my preferred plumber for a diagnosis and/or repair   i pay for my preferred plumber 's work   on two occasions my preferred plumber was unable to fix the problem   both problems turned out to be installation or testing errors related to work done specifically for building inspections   in both cases i paid for my preferred plumber 's diagnosis and the builder and/or his subcontractor fixed the problem at no additional cost to me the diagnosis and repair work that you describe seems like a similar situation to me   in fact i had my builder 's subcontractor replace a few prematurely damaged shingles on my roof   this repair prevented a roof leak   i noticed the problem while trimming a tree back from the roof   the shingles were damaged because the building permit implied that the tree could not be trimmed back   i 'm spotting a pattern with these problems in my opinion the alleged problem with the roof pitch seems like a design flaw that should have been obvious at the time you chose the house design   i expect that any corrections of this design flaw will need to come out of your budget   in the absence of further details i doubt that either the builder or the homeowners insurance company is responsible for it some builders make a point of minimizing the warranty work they pay for regardless of its effect on the builder 's reputation   i do not know which kind of builder you have the lawyer has probably told you whether the relevant statutes of limitations have lapsed   the statutes of limitations vary from state to state and vary depending on the alleged tort   starting a lawsuit is likely to further damage your relationship with your builder homeowners insurance companies now share the number of claims that have been made historically at each property address   most insurance companies now use this cumulative number of claims when setting rates even if the were made against a different insurance company or by a different homeowner   i do not know whether any insurance companies ignore claims older than a certain number of years or ignore the first claim

i would agree with the other answers about it being a bad idea to invest in stocks in the short term however do consider also long term repairs for example you should be prepared to a repair happening in 20 years in addition to repairs happening in a couple of months so if it is at all possible for you to save a bit more put 2 of the construction cost of a typical new house just a house not the land the house is standing on aside every year into a long term repair fund and invest it into stocks i would recommend a low cost index fund or passive etf instead of manually picking stocks when you have a long term repair that requires large amounts of money but will be good for decades to come you will take some money out of the long term repair fund where i live houses cost about 4000 eur per square meter but most of that is the land and building permit cost the actual construction cost is about 2500 eur per square meter so i would put away 50 eur per square meter every year so for example for a relatively small 50 square meter apartment that would mean 2500 eur per year there are quite many repairs that are long term repairs for example in apartment buildings plumbing needs to be every 40 years or so given such a long time period it makes sense to invest the money into stocks so my recommendation would be to have two repair funds short term repairs and long term repairs only the long term repair fund should be invested into stocks

yes not doing so would be like turning down a raise the best advice in almost every situation is to at least contribute up to the amount that the company will match so you get the full benefit one thing to clarify that you might not be understanding the vesting period is only for the money the company matches not your own investment even if you leave the company before the account is vested or fully vested you can transfer to a 401k at your new employer or roll over into an ira or take as taxable income and pay a penalty if it is an early withdrawal all your contributions together with any investment gains or losses that have occurred ditto whatever part of your employer match that has vested by the time you leave often the employer matching contributions are invested in the   same funds in the same proportions that you have chosen for your own contributions and thus will have incurred the same gains or losses as your own contributions but   what you are entitled to take with you is the part that has vested also you mention that it is unlikely that you will stay the entire 5 years however if you plan to at least stay a couple of years it makes sense to get the 20 40 etc of the match that you vest during your stay again it 's free money

thing is it 's not exceptions we 're talking about it 's the rule this 1 million average is skewed due to top 4 5 students who go on and become top executives and earn hundreds of billions of dollars in their lifetimes while 90 of the rest do not justify the investment in their overpriced education 90 are not the exception they are the rule    plus the examples i gave are based on rough calculations and anyone can play with their specific numbers even then it 's already hard to see how huge you must reach to pay for your investment you can look at university sites for hard data for mba average starting salary goes from 140 k before to k after at one university i looked to apply for these 9 k are nice   esp for a 1 year of income forgone but then again 80 k tuition is also not something you come across easy most likely you need to calculate interest as well on those + living expenses books    the mind boggling thing for me is that people going into universities do it just automatically just because that 's what they think they should do they do n't even do a back of the envelope calculation if it 's worth it that 's what more surprising and worrying for me to be honest

it 's actually quite simple you 're actually confusing two concept which are taking a short position and short selling itself basically when taking a short position is by believing that the stock is going to drop and you sell it you can or not buy it back later depending on the believe it grows again or not so basically you did n't make any profit with the drop in the price 's value but you did n't lose money either   ok but what if you believe the market or specific company is going to drop and you want to profit on it while it 's dropping you ca n't do this by buying stock because you would be going long right so back to the basics to obtain any type of profit i need to buy low and sell high right this is natural for use in long positions well now knowing that you can sell high at the current moment and buy low in the future what do you do you ca n't sell what you do n't have so acquire it ask someone to lend it to you for some time and sell it so selling high check   now buying low you promised the person you would return him his stock as it 's intangible he wo n't even notice it 's a different unit so you buy low and return the lender his stock thus you bought low and sold high meaning having a profit so technically short selling is a type of short position if you have multiple portfolios and lend yourself i.e. maintaining a long term long position while making some money with a short term short term strategy you 're actually short selling with your own stock this happens often in hedge funds where multiple strategies are used and to the transaction costs and borrowing fees they have algorithms that clear match long and short coming in from different traders algorithms etc keep in mind that you while have a opportunities risk associated   so basically yes you need to always borrow a product to be able to short sell it what can happen is that you lend yourself but this only makes sense if

you are correct it 's using accounting to accomplish different goals first relevant costs should be considered when making the decision to buy internally rather than externally second by adding the possibility for a cost centre to turn a profit even if it is only an accounting trick means that interest are better aligned profit motive and all third you are right that on the consolidated group level there is no real profit it can give a better picture of actual economic performance though

it depends on when you can get the money not when you know that you won or when you choose to take the ticket in   if you can present your ticket this year and get paid this year the taxes are due this year whether or not you actually choose to claim the prize this year   if you can not receive payment until next year then taxes will be due next year   this is constructive receipt which applies to most individual tax situations this assumes that you chose to receive a lump sum   if you get installments then your taxes would be due as the installments are available but the constructive receipt still applies

and i 'm mad that everyone 's mad stop being mad d   but seriously chill out there are legitimate reasons to keep money in your checking account and it is not a moronic move a more moronic move would be to have no money available on hand in the event of an emergency like if your own a house and your boiler breaks or if you get in an accident and have to shell out money for medical bills or if you want to save up so you can pay your larger loans off in full so you do n't accrue interest on them e.g. college loans

here is a page that seems to have specific advice on the matter   this site speculates that even though the private loan industry does not have to settle and the private student loans like federal loans can not be discharged with a bankruptcy they sometimes will anyway    if she could file bankruptcy to erase the private student loan debt    she owes to sallie mae she would but because of a 2005 reform law    private student loans can not be discharged in bankruptcy except in    extremely rare cases   the advice that works for you is the same advice with negotiating any debt   get it in writing that the amount will constitute payment in full   be sure that the written agreement makes some mention of how they will report it on your credit   you are going to take a credit hit if you settle but time will heal that the best plan is to pay but if you ca n't and you can honestly prove you ca n't the debt collection company would be foolish to not take a settlement   they can wait around forever and sue you add penalties and fees but if you can not pay you can not pay    i am going to guess because you are dealing with a debt collector they are less vested in collecting the full amount   so get that settlement offer in writing   and do n't be too much of a hard core negotiator   the power is all on their side   you will likely have to appeal to the greed of the collection company to succeed   hope they would rather have $ .50 today than $ 1.25 tomorrow

it used to be quite easy for students to get credit cards when i was in college in the early 1980s credit card companies set up tables in the student center and offered low limit cards along with free t shirts on an almost daily schedule the credit card act of 2009 made this much more difficult for banks if you have a bank or credit union account the first thing i would do is talk to them about getting a card some banks offer a visa student card specifically for college students my daughter was able to get one when she turned 18 just before starting college the credit limit is very low $ 200 for increasing each year until the limit is $ 500 during senior year after graduation it converts to a regular visa account with a limit that depends on post graduation income and the now established 4 years of credit history the visa web site has a list of banks offering this type of card now i will give you the same unsolicited advice i gave my daughter and the same advice i think most others here would give you for building credit this kind of card is excellent but you should still use it very sparingly and pay off the balance every month make it a hard rule to never pay interest on a credit card bill i told her to charge perhaps one or two purchases totaling no more than $ each month and pay them off as soon as the statement arrives this is much easier if you have a deposit account at the same bank since you will be able to pay the bill instantly on line have your employer direct deposit your paychecks into that bank account if at all possible

great response thanks i 'll do my best to answer your questions   1 i 'm a genuine believer that everything from calculus to charisma can be taught to most people some people do n't have the intelligence to ever learn calculus for example and some people will only ever be average at it but most people can at least improve in most areas through education    the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach some of the things i listed i implicitly learned in grad school e.g. when doing research i learned how to filter out inaccurate information when writing research papers i learned how to organize information i learned theories of motivation because i was in an org program but i never learned how to apply them especially in a classroom setting i had to figure that out myself but yes i do believe it 's something that can be learned    2 i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job as you mentioned there are some generic skills students learn in college that can be applied to their work however i 'm thinking of communication and social skills although i 'm probably biased since those are the two topics i teach college it seems to me is more about learning how to follow directions figure things out for yourself and work effectively in groups than any particular subject matter and i think those skills do transfer well to the workplace    3 i 100 agree with this we 're pressured to pass students and inflate grades character issues including being disorganized being dishonest or just being rude are diagnosed as psychological disorders and we have to accommodate students with these disabilities to be clear i 100 believe in psychological disorders and i 100 support accommodating students with these i just think they are these days     totally agree with your last paragraph

all governments need to do is figure   out how to monitor regulate and tax whenever btc or any crypto is converted into dollars or merchandise   the public ledger does n't have names associated with it but it does have public keys which can be used to determine what other transactions have taken place that might not have been reported and how much crypto is in that wallet   i agree with there could be a dark side to crypto that we 're not paying attention to because we 're all so excited about the money we 're making but it 's only money if we can spend it and that 's where it starts to get concerning   every transaction recorded is a bean counters wet dream

disclaimer my answer is based on us tax law but i assume australian situation would be similar the irs would not be likely to believe your statement that i would n't have gone to the country if it was n't for the conference   a two week vacation with a two day conference in there certainly looks like you threw in the conference in order to deduct vacation expenses   at the very least you would need a good reason why this conference is necessary to your business if you can give that reason it would then depend on the specifics of australian law   the vacation is clearly not just incidental to the trip the registration for the conference is always as a business expense

for the first part of your question refer to related question   why do some online stores not ask for the code on the back of my credit card the other case of airport ticket machines requires the physical presence of card the assumption is that if you had the card before and after the transaction it was you who used it for transaction as the amounts are small its really easy by anyone merchant banks to write this off the only way to misuse would be if you lost the card and someone used it also these ticket machines would have built in feature where by you can not buy more than x tickets for the day ensuring max loss on a stolen card is limited to a small amount

it 's not necessary to convert it back for the changes to affect value     lets say you have a euro account with 1000 euro and a gbp account with gbp the accounts are equal in value given current exchange rates   you could exchange either account for usd     if you exchange the euro account for usd and say the euro gets stronger against the pound and dollar and subsequently the pound and dollar are weaker against the euro then if you would've kept the 1000 euro it would now be worth more than gbp and more than usd and you would've been better off exchanging the gbp account for usd   barring some economic event exchange rates between well established currencies do n't radically change over a few weeks trip so i would n't really worry about it one way or the other

i 've been an manager at a new car dealership for over ten years and i can tell you this with absolute certainty your deal is final there is no legal obligation for you whatsoever i see this post is a few weeks old so i am sure by now you already know this to be true but for future reference in case someone in a similar situation comes across this thread they too will know this is a completely different situation to the ones referenced earlier in the comments on being called by the dealer to return the vehicle due to the bank not buying the loan that only pertains to customers who finance the dealer is protected there because on isolated occasions which the dealer hates as much as the customer trust me you are approved on contingency that the financing bank will approve your loan that is an educated guess the finance manager makes based on credit history and past experience with the bank which he is usually correct on however there are times especially late afternoon on fridays when banks are preparing to close for the weekend the loan officer may not be able to approve you before closing time in which case the dealer allows you to take the vehicle home until business is back up and running the following monday he does this mostly to give you sense of ownership so you do n't go down the street to the next dealership and go home in one of their vehicles   however there are those few instances for whatever reason the bank decides your credit just is n't strong enough for the rate agreed upon so the dealer will try everything he can to either change to a different lender or sell the loan at a higher rate which he has to get you to agree upon if neither of those two things work he will request that you return the car between the time you sign and the moment a lender agrees to purchase your contract the dealer is the lien holder and has legal rights to repossession in all 50 states not to mention you will sign a contingency contract before leaving that states you are not yet the owner of the car probably not in so many simple words though but it will certainly be in there before they let you take a car before the contract is signed   now as far as the situation of the op you purchased your car for cash all documents signed the car is yours plain and simple it does n't matter what state you are in if he 's cashed the check whatever the buyer and seller both signed all documents stating a free and clear transaction your business is done in the eyes of the law most likely the salesman or finance manager who signed paperwork with you noticed the error and was hoping to recoup the losses from a young novice buyer   regardless of the situation it is extremely unprofessional and clearly shows that this person is very inexperienced and reflects poorly on management as well for not doing a better job of training their employees when i started out i found myself in somewhat similar situations both times i offered to pay the difference of my mistake or deduct it from my part of the sale the general manager did n't take me up on my offer he just told me we all make mistakes and to just learn from it had i been so unprofessional to call the customer and try to renegotiate terms i would have without a doubt been fired on the spot

let me add a few thoughts that have not been mentioned so far in the other answers   note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use not for renting out there 's a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 year 's cold rents it is considered rather expensive i do n't know how localized this rule of thumb is but i know it for germany which is apparently the op 's country too there are obviously differences between buying a house flat for yourself and in order to rent it out as others have said maintenance is a major factor for house owners and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs which is closely related to financial risk exposure e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your day time job   this plays a crucial role for landlords i know they 're all small scale landlords and most of them do put in substantial work themselves i know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case i also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that nice kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants do n't move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance    my personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment i.e. not for immediate or future personal use i 'd say that the exact circumstances are very important if you are based in a region where the buying to rental price ratio is favorable you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house then why not if this is not the case some other form of investing in real estate may be better on the other hand investing in further real estate where you live in your own house means increased lump risk you miss diversification into regions where the value of real estate may develop very differently   there is one important psychological point that may play a role with the observed relation between being rich and being landlord first of all remember that the median wealth without pensions for germany is about 51 k€ and someone owning a morgage free 150 k€ flat and nothing else is somewhere in the 7th of wealth to put it the other way round the question whether to invest 150 k€ into becoming a landlord is of practical relevance only for rich in terms of wealth people also asking this question is typically only relevant for people who already own the home they live in as buying for personal use will typically have a better return than buying in order to rent but already people who buy for personal use are on average wealthier or at least on the track to become more wealthy in case of fresh home owners than people who rent this is attributed to personal characteristics and the fact that the downpayment of the mortgage enforces saving behaviour which is typically kept up once the house is paid and is anyways found to be more pronounced than for non house owners in contrast many people who decide never to buy a home fall short of their initial savings investment plans e.g. putting the 150 k€ into an etf for the next 21 years and in the end spend considerably more money and this group of people rarely invests into directly becoming a landlord   assuming that you can read german here 's a relevant newspaper article and a related press release

vesting as you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price   actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option   your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares the other have conditions attached the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future   when the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares dividends arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners i.e. the shareholders by selling goods and/or services at a profit   how does that money actually get to the shareholders   there are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one   periodically potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend   every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held so for example in 4 years or so after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company   if the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive $ 20,000   depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this those are the basic concepts as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur but that 's hopefully enough to get you started

my answer is with respect to the united states i have no idea about india 's regulatory environment you are opening yourself up to massive liabilities and problems if you deposit their money in your account i managed investment accounts as a private investment advisor for years those with less than 15 clients were not required to register until dodd frank changed the rules thus you would have to register as an advisor probably needing to take the series 65 exam or qualifying some other way e.g. getting your cfp cfa etc i used a discount broker dealer scottrade as the custodian here 's how it works each client 's account was their own account and i had a master account that allowed me to bill their accounts and manage them   they signed paperwork making me the advisor on their account   i had very little accounting to handle aside from tracking basis for taxed accounts if you take custody of the money you 'll have regulatory obligations there are always lots of stories in the financial advisor trade publications about advisors who go to jail for screwing their clients the most common factor they took custody of the assets i understand why you want a single account you want to ensure that each client gets the same results right does each client want the same results   certainly the tax situation for each is different yes   perhaps one has gains and wants to take losses in one year and the other does n't if their accounts are managed separately one can take losses while the other realizes gains to offset other losses financial advisors offer these kinds of accounts as separately managed accounts the advisors on these kinds of accounts are mutual funds managers and they try to match a target portfolio but they can do things like realize gains or losses for clients if their tax situation would prefer it you certainly ca n't let them put retirement accounts into your single account unless the irs has you on their list of acceptable custodians i suggest that you familiarize yourself thoroughly with the regulatory environment that you want to operate under then after examining the pros and cons you should decide which route you want to take   i think the most direct and feasible route is to pass the series 65 register as an investment advisor and find a custodian who will let you manage the assets as the advisor on the account real estate is another matter you should talk to an attorney not some random guy on the internet even if he has an mba and a bs in real estate which i do this is very much a state law thing

you need a brokerage account to invest in etfs there are many different kinds of etfs not just one and that usually means having some amount already deposited with them into the cash account in your name once the brokerage account is established you can send whatever money from each paycheck to the brokerage and tell them to invest it in the etf of your choice there are no restrictions as to how much money you can send if you send them a check if you want the money to be withheld from your paycheck then of course the limit is the amount of the take home pay and whether your employer offers such a service will affect the issue if you are wanting to invest in etfs through your employer 's 401(k plan or 403(b plan there are lots of other considerations

there are many factors    most gas stations price their gas based on what it will cost them to replace it   so when their supplier raises the price that it charges the station the station typically raises its prices   the suppliers tend to have their own rates   the business needs to make a profit so the business sets the price where it feels it will make the most money some stations buy bargain gas   many people say they find this gas to be just fine   personally some stations gas seems to make my cars run much worse   i can say that my mileage can vary by as much as 4 miles to the gallon based on where i get my gas   so i pay more to go to those stations that consistently have provided me good gasoline   however higher prices do not necessarily mean better gas   we have a bp just down the street that seems to have bad gas while one about a half a mile away that i prefer because i have never had a bad tank of gas   both are priced about the same also some have special tax zones   these are local taxes levied based on the location   we have 4 different zones here in il 150k pop   that does not take into account the smaller cities around us

what 's the present value of using the payment plan in all common sense the present value of a loan is the value that you can pay in the present to avoid taking a loan which in this case is the lump sum payment of $   that rather the question is a trick providing irrelevant information about the stock market however if some strange interpretation is required which ignores the lump sum and wants to know how much you need in the present to pay the loan while being able to make 8 on the stock market that can be done i will initially assume that since the lender 's apr works out about 9.6 per month that the 8 from the stock market is also per month but will also calculate for 8 annual effective and an 8 annual nominal rate the calculation if you have $ x in hand present value and it is exactly enough to take the loan while investing in the stock market the value in successive months is $ x plus the market return less the loan payment   in the third month the loan is paid down so the balance is zero i.e. so the present value of using the payment plan while investing is $ you would need $ to cover the loan while investing which is more than the $ lump sum payment requires   therefore it would be advisable to make the lump sum payment because it is less expensive if you have $ in hand it would be best to pay the lump sum and invest the remaining $ in the stock market   otherwise you invest $ initially pay the loan and end up with $ 0 in three months one might ask what rate of return would the stock market need to yield to make it worth taking the loan the apr proposed by the loan can be calculated    the present value of a loan is equal to the sum of the payments discounted to present value   i.e. with   by induction   so by comparing the $ lump sum payment with $ 997 over 3 x monthly instalments the interest rate implied by the loan can be found solving for r if you could obtain per month on the stock market the $ x cash in hand required would be calculated by this is equal to the lump sum payment so the calculated interest is comparable to the stock market rate of return   if you could gain more than per month on the stock market it would be better to invest and take the loan recurrence form solving the recurrence form shows the calculation is equivalent to the loan formula e.g. becomes + 1 = 1 + y p where = pv where in the final month = 0 i.e. when m = 3 compare with the earlier loan formula s = d d 1 + r they are exactly equivalent which is quite interesting because it was n't immediately obvious to me that what the lender charges is the mirror opposite of what you gain by investing the present value can be now be calculated using the formula still assuming the 8 stock market return is per month if the stock market yield is 8 per annum effective rate and if it is given as a nominal annual yield 8 compounded monthly

they use an amortization table like can be found here   the is not that complex   where    a = payment amount per period     p = initial principal loan amount    r = interest rate per period    n = total number of payments or periods you will need to add 50 to   the a to account for the payment fee amount though

you can ask the client to pay you through the llc in that case you should invoice them from the llc and have them pay the invoice if they pay you personally you can always make a capital contribution to the llc and use that money to buy equipment the tax implications for a single person llc providing professional services are the same for you either way income is income whether it 's from your llc or an employer it 's different for the employer if they are giving you a w2 vs a 1099 so it does n't matter much for you if the llc is buying equipment make sure you get enough revenue through the llc to at least offset those expenses

the main reason as far as i can see is that the dividends are payments with which the shareholders may do what they want capital that the company has no use for does not make a significant positive return on investment as you pointed out yes the company could accrue interest but that is not going to make the company large sums of cash while the company may be great at making shoes maybe even the best in the world does n't mean they are good investors sure they could dabble at using their capital to invest in other equities but they do n't because they just want to focus on making shoes if the dividend goes to the investors they can do what they wish be it reinvest in the company or invest elsewhere other companies that may make good use of the capital and create significant returns on it are one such example that is the rational answer beyond that one of the main reasons is that people like the feeling of receiving dividends it might not be the answer you are looking for but many people prefer companies that pay dividends for no rational reason over companies which grow their asset value

to expand on @joetaxpayer 's answer the devil is actually in the fine print all   the credit card checks that i have ever received in the mail explicitly says that the checks can not be used to pay off   or pay down the balance on any other credit card issued by the same bank whether the card is branded with the bank logo or is branded with a department store or airline logo etc the checks can be used to pay utilities or even taxes without paying the service fee that is charged for using a credit card for such payments the payee is paid the face amount of the check in contrast to charges on a credit card from a merchant who gets to collect only about of the amount on the   charge slip generally speaking balance transfer offers are a bad deal regardless    of whether you pay only the minimum amount due each month or whether    you pay each month 's statement balance in full by the due date or    anything in between the rest of this answer is an explanation in support of the above assertion feel free to tl;dr it if you like if you make only the minimum payment due each month and some parts of the balance that you are carrying has different interest rates applicable than other parts then your payment can be applied to any part of the balance at the bank 's discretion it need hardly be said that the bank invariably chooses to apply it to pay off the lowest rate portion by law card act of 2009 anything above the minimum payment due must be applied to pay off the highest rate part and then the next highest rate part etc but minimum payment or less is at the bank 's discretion as an illustration suppose that you are not using your credit cards any more and are paying down the balances due by making the minimum payment due each month suppose also that you have a balance of $ 1000 carrying 12 apr on card a and pay off the entire balance of $ 500 on card b transferring the amount at 0 apr to card a for which you are billed a 2 fee your next minimum payment   will be likely be $ 35 computed as $ 10 interest on $ 1000 + $ 10 transfer fee + $ 15 1 of balance of $ 1500 if you make only the minimum payment due that payment will go towards paying off the $ 500 and so for next month your balance will be $ 1500 of which $ will be charged 1 interest and $ will be charged 0 interest   in the months   that follow the balance on which you owe 1 interest per month will grow and the 0 balance will shrink   you have to pay more than the minimum amount due to reduce the amount that you owe in this example in the absence of the balance transfer the minimum payment would have been $ 20 = $ 10 interest on $ 1000 at 1 per month + $ 10 1 of balance and would have left you with $ 990 due for next month   to be at the same point with the balance transfer offer you would need to pay $ 30 more than the minimum payment of $ 35 due this extra $ 30 will pay off the interest and transfer fee $ 20 and the rest will be applied to the $ 1000 balance to reduce it to $ 990 there would be no balance transfer fee in future months and so the extra that you need to pay will be a little bit smaller etc if you avoid paying interest charges on credit cards by never taking any cash advances and by paying off the monthly balance   consisting only of purchases made within the past month in full by the due date then the only way to avoid paying interest on the purchases made during the month of the balance transfer offer is to pay off that month 's statement in full including the balance just transferred over and the balance transfer fee by the due date   so depending on when in the billing cycle the transfer occurs you are getting a loan of the balance transfer amount for 25 to 55 days and being charged 2 or 3 for the privilege if you are getting offers of 2 balance transfer fees instead of 3 you are probably among those who pay their balances in full each month and the bank is trying to tempt you into doing a balance transfer by offering a lower fee it is unlikely that they will make a no transfer fee offer they would prefer laughing all the way to themselves by collecting a 2 transfer fee from you and possibly interest too if you fail to read the fine print than having you decline such offers at 3 as being too expensive can you make a balance transfer offer work in your favor sure   do n't make any purchases on the card in the month of the balance transfer or during the entire time that the 0 apr is being offered in the month of the transfer pay the minimum balance due plus the balance transfer fee in succeeding months pay the minimum balance due typically 1 of the balance owed each month all of it will go to reducing the 0 apr balance because that is the only amount owing just before the 0 apr expires anywhere from 6 to 24 months pay off the remaining balance in full   but remember that you are losing the use of this card for this whole period of time put it away in a locked trunk in the attic because using the card to make a purchase will mean paying interest on charges from the day they post something that might be totally alien to you

usually i think that 's overstating the case   you can get a bargain especially if the place is in not so great condition but not every foreclosure will be a good deal even if it is priced well below its most recently appraised value as the buyer it 's your responsibility to determine whether it 's priced well or not and to decide whether you 're willing and able to repair its deficiencies after you buy it the same 's true when purchasing any house foreclosures just make it more likely that there are problems and hopefully wind up being priced to allow for them i do n't know of a single website which lists all foreclosures some of the home listing websites do have a show me foreclosure listings filter and i 'm sure that the better tools available to real estate agents can select these but if that 's the direction you 're interested in going you should be looking at distressed properties generally not just foreclosures you may get a better deal in the long run by going for the one that has been mechanically maintained but is just plain ugly rather than the one with a pretty skin whose heating system has n't been serviced for the last decade do your homework shop around do n't fall in love with any one house all the same rules apply at this end of the spectrum just as strongly as they do in the mid or upper ranges perhaps more so happy hunting

for a non etf mutual fund you can only buy shares of the mutual fund from the mutual fund itself at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day and can only shares back to the mutual fund again at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day there is no open market in the sense that you can not put in a bid to buy say 100 shares of vfinx at $ per share through a brokerage and if there is a seller willing to sell 100 shares of vfinx to you at $ then the sale is and you are now the proud owner of 100 shares of vfinx the only buyer or seller of vfinx is the mutual find itself and you tell it that you want to buy 100 shares of vfinx and please take the money out of my checking account if this order is entered before the markets close at 4 pm the mutual fund determines its share price as of the end of the day opens a new account for you and puts 100 shares of vfinx in it or adds 100 shares of vfinx to your already existing pile of shares and takes the purchase price out of your checking account via an ach transfer similarly for redeeming selling shares of vfinx that you own and these are held in an account at the mutual fund itself not by your brokerage you tell the mutual fund to that you wish to redeem 100 shares and please send the proceeds to my bank account and the mutual fund does this at the end of the day and the money appears in your bank account via ach transfer two or three days later   generally these transactions do not need to be for round lots of multiples of 100 shares for efficiency most mutual fund will gladly sell you fractional shares down to a of a share in contrast shares of an exchange traded fund etf are just like stock shares in that they can be bought and sold on the open market and your broker will charge you fees for buying and selling them selling fractional shares on the open market is generally not possible and trading in round lots is less expensive also trades occur at all times of the stock exchange day not just at the end of the day as with non etf funds and the price can fluctuate during the day too many non etf mutual funds have an etf equivalent voo is the symbol for vanguard 's s&p 500 index etf while vfinx is the non etf version of the same index fund   read more about the differences between etfs and mutual funds for example here

dan 's link he deleted his answer btw is fine it showed the components of the score fico offers   each input has data behind it a bell curve of the behaviors and risk of the person behind it for example we 've discussed utilization many time here the ideal utilization is not 0 but 1 19 this does not mean paying interest or carrying charges from month to month   say i had just one card with a $ 10 k limit i 'd want to be sure i never ran a bill above $ 2000 if i did i 'd see a slight drop in my score and next month it would go back to normal in my case i have enough available credit that going over 20 is rare and if it happened i 'd pay the bill down before the bill was issued just make a mid cycle payment   fico decided that those who go over 20 have a higher risk of default and it gets higher as it goes up same with every aspect of the score 's components   you are comparing us to non us use in the us it seems far more common to use our cards in my family 's case we use very little cash and run most of our spending through our cards   as far as the david is concerned one should separate those who carry a balance from those who pay in full the pay in full users are better off for their habits and responsible card use in the us it 's not easy to rent a car or book a hotel with no card cards offer a cash rebate that adds up fast and purchase protection from fraudulent vendors they also offer extended warranty coverage   the david and others claim that studies prove those using cards spend 10 15 more than cash buyers this is a proven fact from scientific studies only they do n't exist the best i 've seen proves that college kids given a $ 20 bill spend more carefully than those given a $ 20 credit card this does n't extrapolate to a family budget and never will but that quote has a way of being repeated as fact yes it 's non sense thank you for reading and quoting my blog i recognize the quote   the report also shows accounts that have gone to collection an electric bill is n't a regularly reported item it 's assumed your lights are on but if you stop paying the bill and they send your account to a collection agency you 'll see it hit your report   in response to the comment below journal of experimental psychology applied article titled monopoly money the effect of payment coupling and form on spending behavior runs 13 pages but on the first page offers do consumers spend differently when using one payment mode relative to another mode for example do consumers spend more when they receive $ 50 in the form of a gift card than in the form of cash if indeed they do then why this research addresses these issues   $ 50 a $ 50 gift card is a nuisance i try to use it up within hours of getting one as i stated above the behavior of a person with such a card does n't scale to a many thousand per month budget such articles in my opinion are nonsense proving nothing   unfortunately this is a bit of a tangent to the original question and if i put up a stand alone is it a fact that people spend more if using a card than cash the question would result in being closed as one that 's seeking opinions not facts

tl dr   yes the david popularized the debt snowball the method of paying low balance first   it 's purely psychological the reward or sense of accomplishment is a motivator to keep pushing to the next card   there 's also the good feeling of following one you believe to be wise the david is very charismatic and speaks in a no nonsense my way or the highway voice history is riddled with religious leaders who offer advice which is followed without question   the good feeling in theory leads to a greater success rate and really it 's easier to follow a plan that comes at a cost than to follow one that your guru takes issue with   in the end when i produce a spreadsheet showing the cost difference say $ 1000 over a 3 year period the response is that it 's worth the $ 1000 to actually succeed my sole purpose is to simply point out the cost difference between the two methods $ 100 go with the one that makes you feel good $ 2000 just think about it first   if it 's not clear my issue is less with the fact that the low balance method is inferior and more with its proponents wishing to obfuscate the fact that the high interest method is not only valid but has some savings built in when a woman called into the david 's radio show and said her friend recommended the high rate first method he dismissed it and told her that low balance was the only way to go   the rest of this answer is tangent to the real issue answered above   the battle reminds me of how people brag about getting a tax refund with all due respect to the tax software people the goal should be minimizing one 's tax bill getting a high refund means you all year and lent uncle sam money at zero and yet you feel good about getting $ 3000 back in april disclosure when my father in law passed away i took over my mother in law 's finances her ira rmd and taxes first year i converted some money to roth and we had a $ 100 tax bill face on mom since then i have schwab hold too much federal tax and we always get about $ 100 back this makes her happy and i 'll ignore the 27 cents lost interest   1 i need to acknowledge that there are cases where the taxpayer has had zero dollars withheld yet receives a tax refund the earned income tax credit eitc produces a refundable benefit i.e. a payment that 's not conditional on tax due obviously those who benefit from this are not whom i am talking about   also in response to a comment below the opportunity cost is not the rate the bank would have paid you on the money had you held on to it it 's the 18 card you should be paying off that $ 3000 refund likely cost over $ 400 in the interest paid over the prior year

first there are not necessarily two accounts involved   usually the receiving party can take the check to the bank on which it is drawn and receive cash   in this case there is only one bank it can look to see that the account on which the check is drawn has sufficient funds and make an essentially irrevocable decision to pay the bearer   essentially irrevocable precisely because the bearer did not necessarily have to present account information the more usual case is that the receiving party deposits the check into an account at their own bank   the receiving party 's bank then directly or indirectly in the us via the federal reserve presents the check to the paying party 's bank   at that point if the there are insufficient funds the check bounces and the receiving party 's account will be debited   the receiving party 's bank knows that account number because in this case the receiving party is a customer of the bank   this is why funds from check deposits are typically not available for immediate withdrawal

it 's a little unusual but i do n't think the financial terms are completely unreasonable on their face what you describe is similar to an interest only loan where you make payments that only cover the interest due each month and the entire principal is due as a single balloon payment on a specified date in this case the date on which the condo is sold   your monthly payment of $ 500 on a principal of $ 115 k is equivalent to an annual interest rate of which at least is not completely usurious   with a traditional mortgage you might pay a rate as low as 3 if you had sufficient income and excellent credit but i do n't know from what you 've said whether that 's the case   did you make the current arrangement because you were unable to get a loan from a bank the main difference here is that instead of the balloon payment being a fixed $ 115 k it 's 75 of the gross proceeds of the sale   if the condo eventually sells for $ 155 k that would be $ so that 's slightly advantageous to them assuming that gross proceeds means before deducting commissions for either the buyers or sellers realtors or any other costs of the sale and thus slightly to you   if the condo appreciates in value that 's more of a win for them and more of a relative loss for you   but it 's also possible that the value of the condo goes down in which case this arrangement is better for you than a fixed balloon payment   so this deal does prevent you from getting a larger share of any gains in the value of the property but it also helps insulate you from any losses   that 's important to keep in mind there 's also the issue of needing their consent to sell   that 's potentially problematic usually in a joint ownership scheme either owner has the right to demand to be bought out or to force a sale   i guess it depends on whether you think your parents would be likely to consent under reasonable circumstances or to insist on holding the property against your best interests it 's true that you are n't building equity with this arrangement and if you thought you were you are mistaken or misled   but let 's compare it with other options if you would qualify for a traditional 30-year fixed mortgage at 3 your monthly payment would be slightly lower $ and you would be building some equity because your payments would reduce the principal as well as paying the interest   but a 30-year loan builds equity very slowly at first after 7 years you 'd have only about $ 20,000 in principal paid down if we assume that 5.2 represents the interest rate you 'd otherwise pay based on your creditworthiness then your monthly payment would be $   so compared to that you have an extra $ 130 per month that you can save or invest in whatever you want you 're not forced to invest it in your house note that in either case you 'd still be paying the condo fees property taxes insurance and maintenance yourself   so we might as well eliminate those from consideration    it might be a good idea to find out what other options you would have perhaps try to get an interest rate quote on a traditional mortgage from a bank based on your income and credit history   then you can decide what to do taking into account your financial situation how much of a monthly payment could you afford your relationship with your parents are they likely to be reasonable about renegotiating   do they in general tend to respect your wishes   would it harm your relationship if you tried to get out of the deal and how important is that to you to what extent do you actually want to pay for equity in this property do you really believe it 's a good investment and have evidence to support that    your options include try to renegotiate the terms of the loan from your parents try to refinance the loan by getting a loan from a bank and paying off some agreed upon amount of principal to your parents try to force the sale of the condo and move to another house financing it some other way consult a lawyer as to whether your agreement with your parents is legally enforceable   for instance do they have a lien on the property

i 'm absolutely a in economics and i wish to understand how things work around finance this is a pretty loaded question to understand finance you need the basics of economics in almost every economics school in the country you first study microeconomics and then economics so we 'll start with micro one of if not the most popular books is principles of microeconomics by this book covers the fundamentals of micro econ opportunity supply demand consumer choice production costs basic game theory and allocation of resources in a clear and effective manner it 's designed for the novice and very easy to read    like 's other book principles of macroeconomics is also top notch there is some overlap in key areas i.e. opportunity cost supply demand curves elasticity taxation because they are fundamental to economics and the overlap will always be there but from there the book goes into key macro concepts like gdp cpi employment monetary and fiscal policy and inflation an excellent intro primer indeed    now that you have the fundamentals down it 's time to learn about finance the best resource in my opinion is financial markets by robert shiller on open yale courses i 've personally taken prof shiller 's class last semester and the man is brilliant the lectures cover every single aspect of finance and can turn the complete novice into a fairly experienced finance student the first lecture also covers all the math required so you do n't get lost at any point be warned however that the course is very deep we used fabozzi 's textbook foundations of financial markets and institutions which is over 600 pages deep and we were required to know essentially all of it watch the videos and follow the readings and you 'll be a finance soon financial markets on open yale   and that 's your to what you want there are other economics books and it 's true that the first few chapters of both books are largely the same but that 's because any economics course always covers the basics first if you want to look at other books krugman has written some good books as well be sure to read reviews because some books are meant for year econ students so you do n't want to get a too advanced book at the novice level we 're interested in understanding the basic concepts so we can master fabozzi as for finance books fabozzi teaches you all the fundamentals of financial markets so you 've got a powerful foundation from there you can expand to more niche books such as books on investing or on monetary policy or whatever you want best of luck

what percent of my salary should i save is tightly coupled with its companion what size nest egg should my husband and i have and by what age interestingly mr 's answer 10 is the number that plugs into the equation that i reference jay 's 25x rule is part of this we start with the assumption that one 's required income at retirement will be 80 of their pre retirement income that 's high by some observations low by others a quick look at the expenses that go away in retirement the above can total 35 40 it would be great if it ended there but there are costs that go up the above extra spending is tough to nail down after all you knew what you spent and what 's going away but the new items crapshoot for non native speakers this refers to a game with dice meaning a random event again referencing mr 's answer financial planners whom you could pay to give you a very accurate number i 'm going to disagree with that consider when retirement is 30 years away you do n't know much if i can offer an analogy i once had the pleasure of hearing jim the played by tom in apollo 13 give a speech he said that for the first 99 of the trip to the moon they simply aimed ahead of their target never directly at the moon in this manner i suggest that with so many variables accuracy is impossible it 's a moving target start young take the 10 offered and keep saving every few years stop and see if you are on target if not bump the number a bit   better to turn 50 and find that after a good decade you 've reached your number and can drop your savings to a minimum perhaps just to capture a 401(k match than to turn 50 and realize you 've and need to bump to an unsustainable level imagine planning ahead in 1999 you 've seen 2 great decades of returns and even realizing that could n't continue you plan for a below average 7 this would double your 1999 balance in 10 years instead you saw zero return for a decade in sum when each variable has an accuracy of + you are not going to combine them all and get a number with even 10 accuracy as if were wrong but the pro would tell you 11 is right for you this is as absurd as packaging up a bunch of c rated debt and thinking that enough of this paper would yield a final product that was aaa

the only way to know the specific explanation in your situation is to ask your employer different companies do it differently and they will have their reasons for that difference i 've asked but why is it that way enough times to feel confident in telling you it 's rarely an arbitrary decision   in the case of your employer 's policy i can think of a number of reasons why they would limit match earnings per paycheck vesting in a sense much as stock options have vesting requirements where you have to work for a certain amount of time to receive the options this policy works as a sort of vesting mechanism for your employer matching funds without it you could rapidly accumulate your full annual match amount in a few pay periods at the beginning of the year and then immediately leave for employment elsewhere you gain 100 of the annual match for only 1 2 months of work while the employees who remain there all year work 12 months to gain the same 100 dollar cost averaging by purchasing the same investment vehicle at different prices over time you can reduce the impact of volatility on your earnings for the same reason that 401k plans usually restrict you to a limited selection of mutual funds namely the implicit assumption is that you probably have little to no clue about investing they also do other strategic things to encourage employees to invest at least somewhat wisely by their matching fund out over time they encourage you to space your contributions over time and they thereby indirectly force you to practice a sensible strategy of dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging seen from another angle mutual funds are the trucks of the investment super highway they carry a lot of cargo but they are difficult to start stop or steer quickly for the same reasons that dca is smart for you it 's also smart for a fund the money is easier to manage and invest according to the goals of the fund if the investments trickle in over time and there are no sudden radical changes imagine if every employer that does matching allowed the full maximum match to be earned on the first paycheck of the year the mutual funds in 401ks would get big balloons of money in january followed by a drastically lower investment for the rest of the year and that would create volatility plan administration fees your employer has to pay the company managing the 401k for their services it is likely that their agreement with the management company requires them to pay on a monthly basis so it potentially makes things convenient for the accounting people on both ends if there 's a steady monthly flow of money in and out whether this point is at all relevant is very much dependent on how your company 's agreement is structured and how well the folks handling payroll and accounting understand it the bottom line your employer let us hope makes profits and they pay expenses and companies for a variety of financial reasons prefer to spread their profits and expenses as evenly over the year as they can there are a lot of ways they achieve this for example a seasonal business might offer an annual payment plan to spread their seasonal revenue over the year likewise the matching funds they are paying to you the employees are coming out of their bottom line and the company would rather not have the majority of those funds being disbursed in a single quarter they want a nice even distribution so once again it them to create a 401k system that supports that objective to sum up ultimately those 401k matching funds are a carrot and that carrot you the employee into behaving in a way that is good for your employer good for your investment management company and good for your own investment success unless you are one of the rare birds who can outperform a dollar cost averaged investment in a low cost index fund there 's very little to at about this arrangement if you are that rare bird then your investment earning power likely outstrips the value of your annual matching monies significantly in which case it is n't even worth thinking about

yes you can trade your properties go to the county recorder 's office to find out the exact procedure deeds generally have specific language to use and you must describe the property accurately in the deed if you want to do the transfer yourself you will need to make sure you have the language correct also you might want to do a title search to make sure that there are no claims against the property your brother is trading you such as by a lender who might have loaned money to him with the property as collateral 3 yes the normal way in the us is quitclaim deeds 4 a quitclaim deed only lists the money or other consideration that changes hands 5 since it is a trade for equal value there are no taxes 6 no normally a lawyer is only needed if you are dealing with a stranger and the transaction is complex as long as you follow the procedures of the clerk 's office correctly there should be no need for a lawyer in fact a lawyer might be undesirable because they could slow things down also since this is a non standard trade a lawyer actually has a higher chance of screwing something up because they will not give it long thought the way you would also they will use and mail instead of actually going to the office another source of error which you can avoid by doing the process correctly ie visiting the office lawyers do n't like getting out of their chairs and this causes them to make a lot of mistakes

you do n't say what the time remaining on the current mortgage is nor the expense of the refi   there are a number of traps when doing the math say you have 10 years left on a 6 mortgage $ 200 k balance i offer you a 4 30 year no cost at all a good intentioned person would do some math as follows please look at this carefully 6 vs 4 but you 're out of pocket far more on the 4 loan which is better the problem is that the comparison is n't apples to apples what did i do i took the remaining term and new rate you see so long as there are no prepayment penalties this is the math to calculate the savings here about $ that $ is how you judge if the cost is worth it or the break even time $ 2000 well 10 months then you are ahead   if you disclose the time remaining i am happy to edit the answer to reflect your numbers i 'm just sharing the correct process for analysis   disclosure i recently did my last refi to a 15yr fixed 3.5 the bank let the heloc stay it 's 2.5 and rarely used

it boils down to this   who or what would you want to take care of financially if you were to die tomorrow that 's why you need life insurance i 'm pretty sure that your creditors would line up to receive payment from the life insurance check so that 's part of figuring out how much coverage you should have the life insurance premiums are another monthly payment of course but every day there is a small chance that you could die   insuring against that small chance vs. paying down your debt faster is a decision that needs to be made and you or your brother are the ones that will make it

the most important number on your credit card statement is not your available credit the number you should be focusing on is your account balance   before the refund you had a balance of $ 0 that means that you did not owe the bank anything   you then got a $ 400 refund this put your account balance at + $ 400 sometimes shown on your statement as $ 400 cr   this means that you have a credit of $ 400 or the bank owes you $ 400   if you now spend $ 400 at a store your balance will go back to $ 0

a re financing or re fi is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one this can be done for several reasons usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment debt consolidation taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller higher interest loans that rack up like credit card debt medical bills etc is a form of refinancing but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage as in your example to answer your questions most of the money comes from a new bank that bank understands up front that this is a re fi and not new debt the homeowner is n't asking for any additional money but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt therefore the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal even then a re fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get at least on terms he 'd be willing to take first off if the homeowner owes more than the home 's worth a re fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan the bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy a new house is a huge ding on your credit score trust me or the market and the homeowner 's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner the homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest however the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years or ever to answer the question of why a bank would do this there are several reasons the bank offering the re fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage this new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan if you 've ever seen a mortgage summary statement the interest paid over the life of a 30-year loan can easily equal the principal and often it 's more like twice or three times the original amount borrowed that 's attractive to rival banks   it 's in your current bank 's best interest to try to keep your business if they know you are shopping for a re fi even if that means offering you better terms on your existing loan often the bank is itself on the hook to its own investors for the money they lent you and if you pay off early without any penalty they no longer have your interest payments to cover their own and they usually ca n't pay off early bonds which are shares of corporate debt do n't really work that way the better option is to keep those scheduled payments coming to them even if they lose a little off the top often if a homeowner is working with their current bank for a lower payment no new loan is created but the terms of the current loan are this is called a loan modification especially when the government is requiring the bank to sit down at the bargaining table or in some cases a streamlining if the bank and borrower are meeting in more circumstances without the government forcing either one to be there historically the idea of giving a homeowner a break on their contractual obligations would be comical to the bank in recent times though the threat of foreclosure the bank 's primary weapon does n't have the same teeth it used to someone facing 30 years of budget busting payments on a house that will never again be worth what he paid for it would look at foreclosure and even bankruptcy as the better option as it 's theoretically all over and done with in only 7 10 years with the government having a vested interest in keeping people in their homes making whatever payments they can to keep some measure of confidence in the entire financial system loan modifications have become much more common and the banks are usually as they 've found very quickly that they 're not getting anywhere near the purchase price for these toxic assets sometimes a re fi actually results in a higher apr but it 's still a better deal for the homeowner because the loan does n't have other associated costs lumped in such as mortgage insurance money the guarantor wants in return for underwriting the loan which is in turn required by the fdic to protect the bank in case you default the homeowner pays less the bank gets more everyone 's happy including the guarantor they do n't really want to be underwriting a loan that requires pmi in the first place as it 's a significant risk the u.s. government is spending a lot of money and putting a lot of pressure on fdic insured institutions including virtually all mortgage lenders to cut the average joe a break banks get tax breaks when they do loan modifications the fed 's buying at risk bond packages backed by distressed mortgages and where the homeowner has n't walked away completely they 're negotiating mortgage mods directly all of this can result in the homeowner facing a lienholder that is willing to work with them if they 've held up their end of the contract to date

credit cards come with an interest free grace period of ~25 days as long as you pay your balance in full every month in other words charges made in january will appear on a bill cut on jan 31 and due around the 25th of february if paid in full by there 's no interest it is a very good idea to get in the habit of paying off your entire balance every month for this very reason do n't buy anything you ca n't afford to pay for at the end of the month when the credit card bill is due you 'll avoid interest charges build good habits and improve your credit score by just paying the minimum amount due you 'll be charged interest from the moment of purchase and the grace period on new purchases goes away credit card companies make the minimum amount due relatively low as a way to encourage you to pay more and more in interest every month do n't fall for it look for a credit card with zero annual fee sure rewards are nice but it 's more important to avoid fees keep the interest rate low and get in the habit of paying in full every month in which case the interest rate wo n't matter your bank or credit union is a good place to start looking

so some time goes by and people start catching onto this system of credit worthiness and farmers and fishermen and so on start to realize that they can get better value for their ious by demonstrating credibility people with reputations or dubious prospects may not be able to issue money or might only be able to do so at very high interest e.g. a new farmer with no track record might have to promise me twice as many potatoes in exchange for a deer due to the risk that i might never see any potatoes at all    this obviously gets very messy fast as different and potato certificates have different values depending on whether they were issued by bob or jane and everyone has to keep track of and evaluate whose future apples are worth what    some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on    everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   now we have something that looks a lot like a modern monetary system the town can set up audit committees or whatever but the idea is that there is some central authority basically tasked with issuing money and regulating the supply of that money according to the estimated size of ongoing and future economic activity future crop yields    if they issue too much money we get inflation where more apple certificates are issued than apples grown and each apple note ends up being worth only three quarters of an apple come harvest time if they issue too little currency economic activity is needlessly restricted the farmers are not able to hire enough workers to maximize crop yields and so on the hunter starts hunting less because his deer meat is going bad since nobody has money to buy it and so on    at this point you may be asking why the hell go through all this complexity just to trade apples for deer and shoes is n't this more trouble than it 's worth    the answer is because this is a vastly more efficient system than pure barter i as a hunter no longer need to trade a physical deer for a bushel of apples to carry over to the shoemaker in order to get shoes you as an apple farmer can hire workers before the crop is harvested and therefore can grow more and your workers can eat year round instead of just getting a huge pile of apples at harvest time to try and trade for for whatever they will need for the rest of the year    so back to money   the thing to remember is that all throughout from the initial trade to this central banking system all of this money is it is ious except instead of being an iou that says will give one bushel of apples to the bearer of this bond in october it says anyone in town will give you anything worth one bushel of apples in trade   the money is not an actual thing that you can eat or wear or build a house with it 's an iou that is redeemable anywhere for anything from anyone it is a promise to pay equivalent value at some time in the future except the holder of the money can call on anybody at all to fulfill that they do n't have to go back to the original    this is where it starts getting interesting and where we can start to answer your question   for the sake of simplicity let 's stop calling these notes apple certificates and pretend that the village has decided to call them loddars    so now you 're still growing apples but instead of trading them for deer and shoes you trade them for loddars so far so good    once again you want some meat except harvest time has n't come yet so you do n't have any loddars to buy meat with you call me up cellphones have been invented in this newly efficient economy hey otherwiseyep any chance you could kill me a deer and i 'll give you ten loddars for it at harvest time   i say jeez i 'd love to but i really need all the cash i can get for every deer right now my kid is out growing shoes like crazy tell you what if you can write me a promise to pay twelve loddars in october i can give that to the shoe maker you about the interest rate but agree    did a lightbulb just go off you and i have once again created money*. twelve loddars now exist in the town economy that have not been printed by the central bank counting all the money trading hands in the village there are now a all the loddars that have ever been printed plus b twelve more that you have promised to produce    this is important to understand i just spent money on shoes which you spent on deer meat that has never been it 's obviously not any of the banknotes that have already been issued but it 's definitely real money because i traded it for new shoes and you traded it for a dead deer    once you and i and others start to catch on that this is possible that we can spend money that we do n't have and that has n't even been printed yet it is entirely possible for a situation to arise where the total amount of money changing hand in the village vastly exceeds the number of loddars that have actually been printed and this can happen without fraud or inflation or anything like that and can be perfectly legitimate    now what happens if another wildfire hits your orchard those twelve loddars are destroyed they are gone the shoe maker is twelve loddars poorer without spending it and without anyone else getting twelve loddars richer    the money that bought your deer and my shoes has simply vanished from the economy as though it never existed despite the fact that it bought stuff with genuine economic utility and value

banks are in it to make money but they 're expected to provide a social good which powers our economy secure money storage bank accounts and cashless transactions credit debit cards   and the government does not subsidize this   in fact banks are being squeezed prudent customers dislike paying the proper cost of their account 's maintenance say a $ fee for a credit card or $ for a checking account they want it free   meanwhile government is pretty aggressive about preventing fine print trickery that would let them recover costs other ways   however there is n't much sympathy for consumers who make trivial mistakes whether they be technical overdraft late fee or money management mistakes like doing balance transfers or getting fooled by promotional interest rates   so that 's where banks are able to make their money when people are imprudent   the upshot is that it 's hard for a bank to make money on a prudent careful customer those end up getting subsidized by the less careful customers who pay fees and buy high margin products like balance transfers   and this has created a perverse incentive banks make more money when they actively encourage customers to be imprudent   here the 0 interest is to make you about running up a balance or doing balance transfers at a barely mentioned fee of 3 5 they know most americans do n't have $ 500 in the bank and you wo n't be able to promptly pay it off right before the 0 rate ends   or you 'll forget   and this works that 's why they do it    by law you already get 0 interest on purchases when you pay the card in full every month   so if that 's your goal you already have it   in theory the banks collect about 1.5 from every transaction you do and certainly in your mind 's eye you 'd think that would be enough to get by without charging interest   that does n't work though   the problem is such a no interest card would attract people who carry large balances   that would have two negative impacts first the bank would have to spend money and second the bank would have huge exposure to credit card defaults    the thing to remember is the banks are not nice guys and are not here to serve   you   they 're here to use you to make money and they 're not beneath encouraging you to do things that are actually bad for you caveat emptor

the most common use of non deductible traditional ira contributions these days as joetaxpayer mentioned is as an intermediate step in a backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira and then immediately convert it to a roth ira which if you had no previous pre tax money in traditional or other iras is a tax free process that achieves the same result as a regular roth ira contribution except that there are no income limits this is something you should consider since you are unable to directly contribute to a roth ira due to income limits also i want to note that your comparison is only true assuming you are holding tax efficient assets ones where you get taxed once at the end when you take it out if you are holding tax inefficient assets like an interest bearing cd or bond or a stock that regularly produces dividends in a taxable account you would be taxed many times on that earnings and that would be much worse than with the non deductible traditional ira where you would only be taxed once at the end when you take it out

companies theoretically have an infinite number of equity units at their disposal   issuance must be approved according to its founding contracts if an equity is trading on an open market then the price of each unit issued in lieu of cash compensation is known   even if an equity does n't trade openly bidders can be solicited for a possible price or an appraisal   this can be a risky route for the potentially compensated market are frequently generally approximately equal to the sales of a company   salaries and wages are frequently generally two thirds of sales it is indeed expensive for the average company to compensate with equity thus so few do usually restricting equity compensation to executives and exceptional laborers   besides they frequently have enough cash to pay for compensation avoiding transaction costs for companies in growth industries such as technology or medicine their situations are usually reversed cash constrained yet equity abundant because of large investment and dearly priced equities   for a company trading at a market capitalization multiplied by forty times the revenue compensating with equity is inexpensive

edited in response to joetaxpayer 's comment and op tim 's additional question to add to and clarify a little what littleadv has said and to answer   op tim 's next question as far as the irs is concerned you have at most one individual retirement account of each type traditional roth though the money in each ira can be invested with as many different custodians brokerages banks etc and different investments as you like thus the maximum $ 5000 $ 6000 for older folks that you can contribute each year can be split up and invested any which way you like and when in later years you take a required minimum distribution rmd from a traditional ira you can get the money by selling just one of the investments or from several investments all that the irs cares is that the total amount that is distributed to you is at least as large as the rmd an important corollary is that   the balance in your ira is the    sum total of the value of all the investments that various custodians are holding    for you in ira accounts there is no loss in an ira until every penny has been withdrawn from every investment in your ira and   distributed to you thus making your ira balance zero   as long as you have a positive balance there is no loss everything has to come out after the last distribution from your roth ira the one that your entire roth ira no matter where it is invested and reduces your roth ira balance see definition   above to zero total up all the amounts that you have received as   distributions from your roth ira if this is less   than the total amount of money you contributed to your roth ira   this includes rollovers from a traditional ira or roth 401k   etc but not the earnings within the roth ira that you re invested inside the roth ira you have a loss that can be deducted on schedule a as a miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2 agi limit this 2 is not a cap in the sense that no more than 2 of your agi can be deducted in this category   but rather a threshold you can only deduct whatever part of your total miscellaneous deductions exceeds   2 of your agi not many people have miscellaneous deductions whose total exceeds 2 of their agi and so they end up not being able to deduct anything in this category if you ever made nondeductible contributions to your   traditional ira because you were ineligible to make a   deductible contribution income too high pension plan   coverage at work etc then the sum of all these contributions is your basis in your   traditional ira note that your deductible contributions if any are not part of the basis   the above rules apply to   your basis in your traditional ira as well   after the last distribution from your traditional ira the one that   all your traditional ira accounts and reduces your traditional ira balance to zero total up all the distributions that you received do n't forget to include the nontaxable part of each distribution that represents a return of the basis if the sum total is less than your basis you have a loss that can be deducted on schedule a as a miscellaneous   deduction subject to the 2 agi threshold you can only deposit cash into an ira and take a distribution in cash from an ira now as joetaxpayer points out if your ira owns stock you can take a distribution by having the   shares transferred from your ira account in your brokerage to your personal account in the brokerage   however the amount of the distribution as reported by the brokerage to the irs is the value of the shares transferred as of the time of the transfer more generally   the fair market value of the property that is transferred out of the ira and this is the amount you report on your income   tax return any capital gain or loss on those shares remains inside the ira because your basis in your personal account in the   shares that came out of the ira is the amount of the distribution   if you sell these shares at a later date you will have a taxable gain or loss depending on whether you sold the shares for more or less than your basis in effect the share transfer transaction is as if you sold the shares in the ira took the proceeds as a cash distribution and immediately bought the same shares in your personal account but you saved the transaction fees for the sale and the purchase and avoided paying the   difference between the buying and selling price of the shares as well as any changes in these in the microseconds that would have elapsed between the execution of the sell shares in ira account distribute cash to tim and buy shares in personal account transactions   of course your broker will likely charge a fee for transferring ownership of the shares from your ira to you   but the important point is that any capital gain or loss within the ira can not be used to offset a gain or loss in your taxable accounts   what happens inside the ira stays inside the ira

the advantages of the tfsa are   this makes them great for who did n't do any saving yet for whom when they drawdown rrsps will have a big impact on taxes and government related income it also makes them great for i will save up for that car my downpayment the kids fees next year when the money would come out of an rrsp at the same or even a higher tax rate and would not have time to compound for long this may apply to you and finally it makes them great for highly paid people who just do n't know what the heck to do with all the money that is piling up and have no intention of ever using any of it while they 're working but have filled up their rrsps my are using them because they pay essentially no taxes now so are waiting to use their rrsp room later if you have money that you are saving for something other than retirement put it in a tfsa if you 've maxed the rrsp and still have money left over put it in an tfsa if you have children consider an resp first because of the bonus money but do n't think tfsa first unless it 's for saving like towards a car or renovation

the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent maynard keynes the stocks could stagnate and trade in a thin range or decline in value you assume that your stocks will offer you any positive return for every month over 24 months just one month of negative returns puts you underwater that s what s wrong with it   even if you identified any stock that has been up every month for a consecutive 24 months in the past there is nothing that says it will be so in the future and a broad market selloff will effect both indexes as well as individual stocks   literally any adverse macroeconomic event in the next two years will put you underwater on your loan no matter how much research you do on individual stocks

pay off your highest interest debt first credit card car maybe even mortgage pay minimums on all else student loans are typically low interest so pay off anything else first but double check your rate of course   even if you have no other debt you may still want to hang on to your savings instead of paying down your student loans if getting rid of your savings causes you to accrue debt for example if you have a low income and no savings you may accrue credit card debt high interest or you may want to buy a car with cash instead of getting a loan even if this is not an issue consider what you can do with your savings that others who lack them can not do you can put it into mutual funds which may offer higher rate of return albeit with risk than your student loan interest or you may pay a down payment on a home the very low interest rates of student loans are to a person with savings essentially a source of cheap money that does n't need to be justified to a bank you can use it as seed money to start a business as funds for travel for living expenses while in the peace corps or whatever else but if you pay down that principal you bind yourself in short pay down your student loans when there is no better use for the money

cfd providers typically offer cfds to investors using either the direct market access dma model or the market maker mm model direct market access the dma model gives you access to trade the underlying instrument on the relevant exchange from which the cfd is then derived all cfd transactions under the dma model have corresponding trades in the underlying instrument under the dma model providers typically charge their clients commission based on the notional contract value of the cfd market maker the mm model uses the price of the underlying instrument to derive the price of the cfd that is offered trading under the mm model does not necessarily mean that your cfd will be reflected by a corresponding trade in the underlying instrument under the mm model each cfd transaction creates a direct financial exposure for the provider which may or may not be hedged in the underlying instrument where the financial exposure is not hedged the market risk may increase for the market maker the mm model enables the provider to offer cfds against synthetic assets even if there is little liquidity in the underlying instrument which can result in a wider range of products on offer than with the dma model volatility and illiquidity in the underlying instrument can affect the pricing of mm cfds   the mm model can charge its clients commission based on the notional contract value or it can incorporate costs and fees in the dealing spread which represents the difference in price at which the issuer is prepared to buy and sell the cfd what do i use and why i have traded with both dma and mm models and prefer the mm the big advantage with mm is that they will provide a market even when the underlying is very illiquid and only might have a few trades each day   regarding the spread of the mm to the spread of the underlying i have found the mm to be practically in line with the underlying spread about 95 of the time the other 5 it may have been slightly wider than the spread of the underlying by usually 1c or 2c most mms aim to give you the best spread they can because they want to keep your business if they gave too wide a spread compared to the underlying it would n't be long before they had no customers

as suggested above i am not questioning the validity of the study by and di i do n't doubt that there is some discount to the risk premium demanded in the market for the debt of systemically important banks    what i am is that this is a subsidy by the us government this is a subsidy by bond investors not the us government additionally it is based on the assessment of risk by those investors as there is no explicit guarantee by the us government see lehman brothers and bear stearns there is no transfer of wealth by the us government and therefore there is no active subsidy

this happened to my review i had reviewed a new business and created a yelp account for that reason   i also reviewed maybe 10 other businesses in two days so i was n't a one and done account   my account was flagged and my first review was put as filtered   in retrospect it makes sense   they want to keep reviews up from consistent yelp users who review alot of businesses   i think if yelp sees a new account it flags the first business that person reviews until its established that person is a regular yelp user   i would guess this happens alot on yelp   someone says review my business but make sure you review a few others too so you look like a real user   the algorithms they have try to catch people like i was   people who create an account to review one company and then do 10 reviews in a one week span only to never log in   these are n't really good reviews in the grand scheme of things   for me i kept using yelp and consistently reviewing more businesses   my review was a few weeks ago now that i have 40 or so reviews and add a few each week

the following is based on my experian credit scoring feedback and experience here in the uk over many years   and for further information i currently hold a credit score of 999 the highest possible with 6 credit cards   now i 'm assuming that while there may be some differences in particulars in your case due to the difference in locality nevertheless the below should hopefully provide some broad guidelines and reasonable conclusion in your situation having a large number of active credit accounts may be seen as a negative   however having a large number of settled accounts should on the contrary have a positive effect on your score   as you keep your accounts mostly settled i think having another card will not be to your detriment and should in time be beneficial a large total credit balance outstanding may count against you   but see the next point    having your total outstanding debt on all credit accounts be a smaller proportion of your total available credit counts in your favour   this means having more cards for the same amount of credit in use is net net in your favour   it also has the effect of making even larger outstanding credit balances as in point 2 to be a lower percentage of your total available credit and consequently will indicate lower risk to lenders    it appears from my experience the higher the highest credit limit on a single card you are issued and are managing responsibly e.g. either paid off or used responsibly the better needless to say any late payments count against you   the best thing to do then is to set up a direct debit for the minimum amount to be paid like clockwork every month   lenders really like consistent payers new credit accounts initially will count against you for a while   but as the accounts age and are managed responsibly or settled they will eventually count in your favour and increase your score making many credit applications in a short space of time may count against you as you may be seen to be credit reliant   conclusion on balance i would say get the other card   your credit score might be slightly lower for a couple of months but eventually it will be to your benefit as per the above     having another card also means more flexibility and more more options if you do end up with a credit balance that you want to finance and pay off over a period as cheaply as possible    in the uk the credit card companies are falling over themselves trying to offer one interest free or 0 balance transfer offers   of course they 're not truly 0 since you typically have to pay a transfer fee of a couple of percent still this can be quite cheap credit much much cheaper than the headline apr rates actually associated with the cards   the catch is that any additional spending on such cards are paid off first and attract interest at the normal rate until paid off   usually also if you miss a payment the interest rate reverts to the normal rate   but these pitfalls are easily avoided pay by direct debit and do n't use card you 've got a special deal on for day to day expenses so having more cards available is then very useful because you then have choice   you can roll expensive debts to the cheapest lender at your disposal for as long as they 'll offer and then simply not use that card for any purchases while paying off the balance as cheaply as possible meanwhile using another card for day to day expenses

there are two reasons leases are generally a worse deal than buying first inherent in the lease is the concept of trading in the car at the end of the lease term as we all know cars depreciate the most in the first year or two by repeatedly leasing cars on short time frames you own the vehicles during those most expensive years of course there 's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing when buying be it via cash or loan but leasing builds in a schedule and encourages you to stick to it second it is easier for the dealer salesperson to hide things from the consumer in a lease contract most salespeople will try to get a car purchaser to focus on the monthly payment or they 'll four box the purchaser but even then there 's only 4 numbers and most consumers have a rough idea what they are and what they mean but in a lease the numbers in question are renamed and price becomes capitalized cost interest rate becomes money factor and is divided by 2400 making it look really small and not easily without a calculator or pencil and paper down payment becomes a capitalized cost reduction there 's a new concept residual value neither of those reasons change when interest rate is lower

since you mention bounced checks in the beginning of your piece it 's worth mentioning that bounced checks can land you in prison depending on various circumstances    in this case it 's because you 're committing a fraud namely offering someone a piece of paper and claiming it 's worth $ 500 or whatever when it 's really worthless because you do n't have the funds   simply owing a debt is not considered criminal but payment that is not actually valid is considered defrauding the person you are trying to pay this check fraud information site discusses the different penalties in each state as this is primarily covered by laws at the state level   it is never until you have repaid the check of course it is in most states a < = 1 year in jail though some states do make it a felony for larger amounts or repeat violations   these penalties are also typically at the judge 's discretion and in many cases you are only fined some states have a minimum dollar amount for it to be a criminal offense most seem to be around $ 500 or so though there is quite a lot of variability some real world examples of this include former nba player walker and former nfl player porter

i just decided to start using gnucash today and i was also stuck in this position for around an hour before i figured out what to do exactly the answer by pointed me partially on the right track so this answer is intended to help people waste less time in the future   note all numbers have been redacted for privacy issues but i hope the images are sufficient to allow you to understand what is going on upon successfully importing your transactions you should be able to see your transactions in the checking account and savings account plus additional accounts you have imported the imbalance account gbp in my case will be negative of whatever you have imported this is due to the double entry accounting system that gnucash uses     now you will have to open your savings account    note that except for a few transactions most of them are going to imbalance these are marked out with the red    what you have to do now is to click on them individually and sort them into the correct account unfortunately i do not understand why they did this you can not move multiple transactions at once see also this thread fortunately you only have to do this once   this is what your account should look like after it is complete    after this is done you should not have to move any more accounts since you can directly enter the transactions in the transfer box at this point your accounts tab should look like this   question solved

you can do the roth ira but i think your income is too high to take a deduction on the traditional ira   by the way this is the 2015 tax table   you look like you are in the 28 bracket a good place to be but i 'd be putting more money pre tax in the 401(k and consider converting in years that your rate may be lower it 's easy to get married buy a house and that same income puts you in the 15 bracket   the truth is no one can project 5 years out let alone 40 and a mix like you have is as good an approach as any even if i 'd lean more pretax remember your $ match is on the pretax side so you are close to 50/50 as is

given that you have your emergency fund and no other high interest rate debts credit cards etc you will want to put down at least enough to not have to pay private mortgage insurance pmi   pmi is solely to protect the lender if you default   it has no benefit to you   it generally means that you will need at least 20 down   after that its a personal decision depending on what else you are going to do with the money   if you are the type to spend money frivolously if you have it it might make sense to put as much down as you can   if you think that you can invest the money and over the long term make more than the historically low mortgage interest rates it might make sense to invest    one thing to keep in mind is that money that you put into the down payment is relatively illiquid meaning that it is hard to turn back into cash   if you have large expenses in the future like health problems or college for the kids it might be better to have the money in something easier to turn into cash

you 'll need to read carefully the german laws on tax residency in many european and other tax laws the loss of residency due to absence is conditioned on acquiring residency elsewhere but in general it is possible to use treaties and statuses so that you end up not being resident anywhere but it does n't mean that the income is no longer taxed generally every country taxes income sourced to it unless an exclusion applies so if you can no longer apply the treaty due to not being a resident you 'll need to look for general exclusions in the tax law i do n't know how germany taxes scholarships under the general rules you 'll have to check it it is possible that they 're not taxed many people try to raise the argument of i 'm not a resident to avoid income taxes altogether on earnings on their work this would not work but with a special kind of income like scholarship which may be exempt under the law it may keep in mind that the treaty has who is or was immediately before visiting a contracting state a resident of the other contracting state language in some relevant cases so you may still apply it in the us even if no longer resident in germany

this is copying my own answer to another question but this is definitely relevant for you a bid is an offer to buy something on an order book so for example you may post an offer to buy one share at $ 5 an ask is an offer to sell something on an order book at a set price for example you may post an offer to sell shares at $ 6 a trade happens when there are bids asks that overlap each other or are at the same price so there is always a spread of at least one of the smallest currency unit the exchange allows betting that the price of an asset will go down traditionally by borrowing some of that asset and then selling it hoping to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference minus interest going long as you may have guessed is the opposite of going short instead of betting that the price will go down you buy shares in the hope that the price will go up so let 's say as per your example you borrow 100 shares of company x expecting the price of them to go down you take your shares to the market and sell them you make a market sell order a market ask this matches against a bid and you receive a price of $ 5 per share now let 's pretend that you change your mind and you think the price is going to go up you instantly regret your decision in order to pay back the shares you now need to buy back your shares as $ 6 which is the price off the ask offers on the order book similarly the same is true in the reverse if you are going long because of this spread you have lost money you sold at a low price and bought at a high price meaning it costs you more money to repay your borrowed shares so when you are shorting you need the spread to be as tight as possible

typically in gnucash account balances that exist at the beginning of the time you 're keeping records for are balanced by entries in an equity account equity opening balances which is part of the default set of accounts created for you this account is really just a placeholder so that everything balances and that 's perfectly normal so just enter equity opening balances as the other entry when entering the first opening balance transaction in your liability account for the loan if you have not already created the liability account then just use the opening balance tab of the new account window to enter the initial balance as you create the account   disclaimer i have no formal knowledge of accounting i just use gnucash and read the users mailing list

how long you need to keep tax records will depend on jurisdiction in general if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends it may create audit problems down the road ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts and you discard those receipts next year then you wo n't be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years generally how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments in your case us based the irs has straight forward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records period of limitations that apply to income tax returns keep records for 3 years if situations 4 5 and 6 below do not apply to you keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid whichever is later note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that for example you may be in a position to discover that you would like to a prior tax return because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you if you would have been eligible to in that period but no longer have documentation you are out of luck

if you open an account you sign a contract of which you get a copy that ultimately proves that the account exists as for the money in an account double entry accounting makes it more or less impossible for that to be simply wrong an account balance is not just a number it 's a sum of transactions each of which has a corresponding entry in another account where the money came from or went to what is possible but extremely rare given the effort banks go to in order to ensure the correctness of their systems is for transactions to get lost or stuck because they often have multiple stages or to have a wrong source or target or amount if a transaction gets lost it 's the same as if it never happened the money is still in the sender 's account and you have to convince them to send it to you if a transaction got stuck i.e. money was sent but did not arrive the sender can request their bank to investigate what happened and fix the problem if an erroneous transaction shows up on your account you can do the same double entry accounting ensures that this is always possible

in the end you your dad and your brother should come to an agreement so there 's no surprises or expectations but here 's my opinion if you can afford to make the additions now i would offer to pay fully for the addition with the understanding that the additional value that it generates is yours   that keeps everything in your name and should be fair since you pay for the expense and someday reap the benefit if you ca n't afford to make the additions now i see two options have your brother buy your father 's house giving you half of the proceeds and use those proceeds to make the addition as above or split the cost of the addition and have some sort of contract drawn up promising to reimburse him with the amount of the reimbursement very clear like xxx dollars plus accrued interest at y% annually as a condition to selling the house    one other part you did n't mention is any compensation you get for keeping your father at your house   what compensation if any you get is not as important as making sure that the three of you all agree on what is fair    in any case clear honest communication and full agreement is key there is a very real risk that when your father 's estate is settled that there will be disputes over what the agreement was and who it entitled to what   having everything in writing may sound cold but it keeps everyone on the same page

if the billing cycle is 2 to 3 months it would mean banks have to give credit for a longer period and it makes the entire business less profitable as well as more risky compared to the monthly billing cycle for example the current monthly billing cycle with a date say of 14th means if you swipe your card on 1st day one would effectively get a credit for 30 + 14 around 44 days if you swipe on last day one would get a credit for 14 days on an average 22 days of credit if we make this 3 months the credit period would increase on an average 90 + 52 days from a risk point of view on monthly cycle if there is non payment its flagged much earlier compared to a 3 months cycle on offering different dates shop around in the older times the cycles were different however with individuals having several cards and trying to optimize every purchase to maximize credit period quite a few banks have streamlined it to monthly cycle shop around and some banks should be able to offer you different dates

i used to work for one of the three ratings agencies awhile ago first there are lots of different ratings the bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance so senior debentures fixed income and general obligations e.g. tax free muni bonds respectively ratings agencies are not paid by the investment banks they are paid by the corporations   or state that is issuing debt the investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market   for mortgage backed securities collateralized debt cdo clo 's all of which are fancy structured securitizations well that is a different matter those   transactions are the ones where there is an close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies and those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems   ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what was their traditional business corporate and municipal bond ratings as far as i know    what said was 100 correct s&amp;p 's fees were paid by investors the people who were purchasing the bonds until about 50 years ago around the same time that hill purchased s&amp;p in 1966 they from that model and started charging the bond issuers for ratings i do n't know if that decision was driven by hill or not though   one more thing not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers one of the 10 's a designation given by the is jones their revenue comes from the investors bond purchasers not the companies issuing bonds unlike the moody 's business model so there is an alternative which i consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair   edit what mentions is also totally accurate the part about roubini who is a professor at or columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high sort is consistent with my impression as for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by roubini yes i guess it would but i do n't know if the government would do that it would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different less conflicted payment incentive model   keep in mind too that many of the provisions of dodd frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities this is the scary part though there is n't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies not at the moment as far as i can tell eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative but that has n't happened yet which is better not requiring ratings at all or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings which a false sense of confidence i do n't know

what do i mean by infrastructure well if you 're doing algorithmic trading you have to have something monitoring data and making decisions on its own presumably how do you set that up there are many ways and some are better than others   first is a problem of scale if you 're a newbie starting out with some small set of equity tick data perhaps just trades for instance you can whip together something that can handle that pretty easily check out though that 's your messaging rates you have to deal with once you go full data feeds direct from all the exchanges million messages events per second that 's a lot and if you fall behind you lose your lunch   building a robust system that allows you to easily backtest and deploy strategies is crucial as well the speed at which you 're able to conduct the backtest matters a lot doing that rapidly and accurately is not easy for a broad market data handling algo design and now clearly for very specific things you can design one that 'll handle stuff better for that one corner case but this is for general algo trading optimally you have some sort of setup where you have a   feed handlers -&gt tickerplant -&gt mkt data subscribers cep -&gt order management system -&gt broker    in this setup you have feed handlers that are taking the raw exchange feeds and pushing them to a consolidated tickerplant where cep subscribers can come through and sub to the data they want perhaps i just want es futures on one and only want to arb and on another you do nt want each cep subscriber getting your full feed for all tickers all the time its a waste so more or less each independent strategy is its own subscriber to the tickerplant taking whatever data it wants and only that data could be give me all the trades and quotes for all nasdaq stocks but not book depth for instance   your cep does whatever maths it has to do to figure out trading decisions and when it does it sends it to your order management system which does your risk checks etc do you have enough money to place this trade do you already have a position in this are you trading against yourself million other things your knows how to talk to your broker directly to the exchange depending on your setup assuming all your risk checks pass off the order goes to the exchange and it deals with the fill etc   now as far as speed is concerned try to do all of this at 6.5 million events second it 's hard some cep subscribers will run faster than others some are slower some need to keep a full book to work while some work on just trades your depending on if you re using only market data sources may need to keep its own book to place orders on behalf of your subscribers if they lack information about various markets think all the twitter trading bots these days for instance etc   if you look back at the above setup as well you 'll notice some interesting things tickerplant -&gt cep subscriber portion can stay the same for live trading or backtesting this is huge the only thing that changes here for backtesting is that if you 're trying to backtest you can take historical data query it out of your hopefully column store database and push it into your tickerplant rather than having it come from a live feed through the feed handler your tickerplant and cep subscriber will never know the difference so you can use the same exact code for backtesting as you can for live on the other end you obviously ca nt send historical orders to your live broker so you need to code a simulated that does the backtest simulation another huge piece of software to code that is hard to do well but for backtesting your setup is staying largely the same except those two end pieces this means that testing deploying can be pretty rapid and uses the same code base for live and historical which helps you eliminate bugs and have to code everything twice   backtesting design historical mkt data db -&gt tickerplant -&gt mkt data subscribers cep -&gt order management system simulator   these are just a few of the many problems that you hit when trying to dev good infra there are like a million more point was simply it 's complicated and c++ is a good i use a wide variety of languages depending on exactly what s going on and how fast the code needs to be with a proper tickerplant design you re using some protocol so a subscriber can be coded in any language check out that s an excellent piece of software to use to make a tickerplant out of think they even have a design for one in the docs if i recall with that your cep subscribers can be in any language perhaps pure c if you need the speed perhaps .net or java if you do nt check out for a java implement of a cep subscriber for the c port of that i believe but i use c c++ c python r x86 for a few very minor things and a or two i ca n't mention here

you did n't specify where in the world you account is scotiabank operates in many countries however for large amounts where there is a currency conversion involved you are almost guaranteed to be better off going to a specialist currency broker or payments firm rather than using a direct method with your bank such as a wire transfer based on my assumption that your account is in canada one provider who i have personally used with success in transferwise but the best place to compare where is the best venue for you is in the off chance that this is an account with scotiabank in the united states any domestic payment method such as a domestic wire transfer should do the job perfectly well the fees do n't matter for larger amounts as they are a single fee versus a percentage fee like you see with currency conversions

according to the fair credit reporting act any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to a person which it has reason to believe intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and    involving the extension of credit to or review or collection of an account of the consumer see section the usual interpretation of this that i 've heard is that a debt collection agency that owns or has been assigned a debt can make hard pulls on your credit report without your consent this link seems to support that and references the same part of the act among others according to the fair credit reporting act any business can access your credit history without your permission provided the business has a valid permissible purpose the fcra notes that one such permissible purpose is to review your credit information in connection with the collection of a debt thus if you owe money to a debt collector the debt collector has the legal right to pull and review your credit report if they have n't been assigned the debt or own it outright i believe you have a legal right to dispute it consult a lawyer if this is actually a situation you face   once use for this is if the debt collection agency has trouble locating you since your credit report normally contains current and past addresses this is one way to locate you

there are a few factors at work here supply and demand being the main one the office for national statistics has some good information supply has historically struggled to compete with demand in the uk and this situation has been since the 1980s when margaret thatcher was prime minister   she set up a variety of schemes to encourage people to own their own home such as tax relief and since then home ownership in the uk has increased dramatically the then conservative government also set up the right to buy scheme in 1980 that allowed council tenants to purchase their council houses at a discounted rate   the effect of this was to increase the number of home owners whilst reducing the amount of housing available for councils to rent to new tenants   anecdotal evidence i ca n't find a documented source to back this up suggests that councils did not build sufficient new homes to replace those purchased by their ex tenants the population of the uk has also increased by around 10 million since 1980 around 20 and this has pushed up demand for housing   house building in the uk has not kept pace with these factors that has led to a shortage of supply that has pushed up prices there 's another factor at play here as well   if you go back to the 1970s around 53 of women would go out to work but in 2013 this figure increased to 67 as it became more common for households to have double incomes   this extra supply of cash also pushed up house prices your question regards a debt based monetary system is not entirely clear but there are limitations put onto how much money people can borrow that are potentially limiting how much house prices can rise by   today most lenders are more conservative in how much they will lend but this was n't the case in the mid 2000s when house prices rose very quickly    lenders are more cautious today after the crash of the late 2000s but things are to relax again and they are starting to lend more which could in turn lead to further house price rises in line with what was seen in the 2000s recessions have with house prices falling back or at least being stable   in the 1980s house prices from 1980 to 1988 but then fell back a little as the recession hit before starting to rise again in 1997   this rise was sustained until 2008 during which time prices again   based on this you could assume prices will again as we come out of the recession as long as this is sustained for 8 years or so however as the potential for more households to become double income is reduced high female employment already and wages are unlikely to raise that quickly this may not be realistic unless the mortgage lenders become extremely lax to the point of reckless to answer your other question about the affordability of housing this will be based on the level of wages in the uk and how strict or lax the lenders are also taking into effect the availability of housing for purchase   if wages rise house prices will rise if lenders are willing to lend more money house prices will rise and if demand continues to supply prices will rise none of the major uk political parties are likely to solve the problems of population growth and not enough houses being built so it is likely prices will rise but you could argue that they are not far off a peak based on current wages and lenders attitudes   if the uk economy continues to recover from the recession it is possible they will fuel another housing boom by lending ever increasing salary multiples as happened in the 2000s unless there is government intervention ie regulation of the lenders

i noticed the buy sell board table   where did you notice this generally for a pair of currencies there is unit associated along with direction the unit is generally constant these are only revised when there is large devaluation of a particular currency buying php for myr selling myr so in this case the unit of php is 100 so bank is buying 100 php from you you are selling php and will give you myr   if you now want to buy 100 php so the bank is selling you you have to pay myr   so you loose myr why are they selling it way beyond the exchange rate why is this as explained above they are not its still within the range the quote on internet are average price this means before going back to philippines i can buy a lot of peso that i can buy and exchange it for higher price right generally an individual can not make money by buying in one currency and selling in other there are specialist who try and find arbitrage between multiple pair of currencies and make money out of it its a continuous process if they start making profit the market will react and put pressure on a pair and the prices would move to remove the arbitrage

you need to track all of your expenses first all of your assets and liabilities and set financial goals for example you need to know your average monthly expenses and exactly what percentages interest each loan charges and you need to know what to save for your children retirement large purchases etc then you create an emergency fund keep between 4 to 6 months worth of your monthly expenses in a savings account that you can readily access base the size of your emergency fund on your expenses rather than your salary this also means its size changes over time for example it must increase once you have children you then pay off your loans starting with the loan charging the highest interest you do this because e.g. paying off $ x of a 7 loan is equivalent to investing $ x and getting a guaranteed 7 return the stock market does generally does not provide guarantees starting with the highest interest first is mathematically the most rewarding strategy in the long run it is not a clear whether you should pay off all loans as fast as possible particularly those with low interest rates and the mortgage you need to read up on the subject in order to make an informed decision this would be too personal advice for us to give after you 've created that emergency fund and paid of all high interest loans you can consider investing in vessels that achieve your set financial goals for example since you are thinking of having children within five years you might wish to save for college education that implies immediately that you should pick an investment vessels that is available after 20 year or so and does not carry too much risk e.g. perhaps bonds or deposits these are a few basic advices and i would recommend to look further on the internet and perhaps read a book on the topic of personal finance

the equation is the same one used for mortgage amortization   you first want to calculate the pv present value for a stream of $ 50 k payments over 20 years at rate   then that value is the fv future value that you want to save for and you are looking to solve the payment stream needed to create that future value good luck achieving the 10 return and in knowing your mortality down to the exact year unless this is a homework assignment which need not reflect real life   edit as indicated above the first step is to get that value in 20 years   the image is the user friendly entry screen for the pv calculation it walks you though the need to enter rate as per period therefore i enter as the rate the payment you desire is $ 50k yr and since it 's a payment it 's a negative number the equation in excel that results is = and the sum calculated is $ next you wish to know the payments to make to arrive at this number   in this case you start at zero pv with a known fv calculated above and known rate this solves for the payment needed to get this number $ the excel equation is = most people have access to excel or a public domain spreadsheet application e.g. if you are often needing to perform such calculations a business finance calculator is recommended ti used to make a model ba-35 finance calculator no longer in production still on ebay used   one more these equations whether in excel or a calculator are geared toward per period interest i.e. when you state 10 they assume a monthly with that said you required a 20 year deposit period and 20 year withdrawal period we know you wish to take out $ per month the equation to calculate deposit required becomes   ha exact same answer far less work to be clear this works only because you required 240 deposits to produce 240 withdrawals in the future

i do not and did not support the usa in afghanistan syria and iraq    when it comes to iraq i only refer to the 2001 events i do support the usa actions in the gulf war versus iraq in the 1990 totally justified and a good necessary work in the 1990s   i will add the usa and only the usa is 100 responsible for the mess we have now in syria and iraq instead of supporting the in those countries countries that do not understand democracy and are not ready for democracy the usa actively worked to topple their reasonable leaders in a failed attempt to do arab spring and nation building   same thing with iran instead of supporting the of iran a great and person carter created the mess we have with iran today   we are so lucky that egypt managed to kick out the democratically elected crazy religious guy and replace it with a good a    as for palestine i have no doubt that you are totally clueless about the this just like your misguided support for n.korea   let 's start with n.korea i think that usa should stay out of it and only explain that if ever japan or korea get attacked by n.korea then n.korea will be wiped out from the face of the earth the usa should let the neighboring countries of china russia and india check the map handle n.korea and those countries know how to handle any from n.korea very very well we should stay out of this business   bill clinton is 100 responsible for why n.korea have nuclear weapons with that stupid nuclear agreement he did with them and even giving them nuclear reactors obama will be 100 responsible for iran having nuclear weapons soon   back to palestine a short real true and verifiable historical summary there was never ever a country or nation of palestine the only reason we hear about palestine and palestinians today is because in 1967 israel liberated the local arabs from a 1948 occupation by egypt and jordan of land given to them by the un for which israel agreed to if the 1967 events never happened you would not hear today about palestine and palestinians true or false   so israel never wanted to be a greater israel to rule over millions of additional arabs as part of its democracy or occupation more arabs than jews israel is not that dumb true or false   the blockade is actually by egypt and israel check the map egypt has a border with gaza true or false   the local arabs can have a palestine for themselves already in 1948 if they agreed to the un partition plan or 1967 after they were liberated by israel israel has only one condition in 1948 and in 1967 for a palestine that palestine needs to be a nice neighbor to israel they do n't want to be nice so no palestine until they grow up true or false

i am not going to discuss legality because with family members you are able to give a lot of guidance and assistance without running into legal issues   the biggest problem is that when they transfer the funds to you and you invest the money all the tax rates and tax limits are determined by your situation plus you have more investments than you should have so you hit those limits and brackets quicker for example in the united states a person can put $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 into a ira or roth ira each year if you combine the funds for three with your funds then you are giving up three quarters of the amount that you can invest in that type of account the decision regarding roth or not depends on age and income level but now their decision is related to what is best based on your situation the ability to even deduct ira deposits would be based on your situation of course for taxable accounts the tax rate is determined by your income not theirs if they want you to have the ability to make investment decisions for them then power of attorney is the way to go the money is deposited in their name and all the rules and tax rates are determined by their situation you make sure they have all the information they need to login and review the accounts but you make the all the moves within and between accounts

i am not trying to attribute the current economic climate and the decisions that stem from that with raising tax rates   i simply think that a higher tax rate for the wealthy will further slow the recovery i also think that the issue of tax rates is being used to divert the attention of the people from that which is actually killing us the national debt that is thanks to trillion dollar deficits the tax hikes are used to a fight between red and blue without getting to the crux of the matter    the reality is that at most the government might be able to raise taxes that would generate 200 or 300 billion dollars more in yearly revenue over the short term over the long term these taxes will drive capital off shore and into investments that shelter it from taxes at the same time that the debt continues to increase at over 1 trillion per year anyway   the debate should be this do we want to cut federal spending by 40 now or do we want to cause an economic and monetary collapse by continuing along with deficits that are 10 of gdp

exchange a has 100 shares of a stock at $ 10 the next 100 shares cost $ 10.01 exchange b has the same pricing structure   a fund manager wants to buy 200 shares of the stock and decides that buying 100 shares at $ 10 from each exchange will be cheaper than staying in one exchange and paying $ 10.01 for the second half of his order   the manager places two separate orders let 's say the first order reaches exchange a and the trade executes at $ 10 traders algorithms on exchange b see this happen and adjust their price up to $ 10.01 accordingly now when the manager 's order reaches exchange b there will no longer be any shares trading at $ 10   some people say that this is front running but if the manager only wanted 100 shares the price would have still shifted some say this creates a more efficient market with tighter spreads due to the decreased risk to the market maker but it also means the aggregate bid ask offers across multiple exchanges are not necessarily accurate creating a false liquidity you can decide for yourself whether or not this is a good thing

the money from the employer is counted as income for you and should be included in the numbers on your w-2   you also have tuition you paid that is an educational expense that would generally be a tax credit if you qualify for those educational tax credits if the money from the employer was counted as income you can use also claim tuition expenses if the money was n't included as income you then ca n't claim the tuition as an educational expense my experience has been that expenses such as books have not been covered but could be paid for with the money from a 529 money to cover mandatory fees such as lab fees and a fee that all students must pay can be counted as tuition expenses regarding customized books those are much harder to prove if you were to count that particular book as a tuition expenses and were audited you would have to show them the book to prove it most books are n't mandatory also if you do want to claim the books as an expense remember to account for the money that is returned if any are sold back to the bookstore at the end of the term

suing is a legitimate option as well as screening your calls but here 's another idea which has personally worked and relates to the collections i did for awhile   talk with the collector   outstanding debt gets sold many times and each time a new collector gets their hands on an account they do their due diligence which means calling every single number multiple times   collectors a looking for consumers who actively evade collections calls for years my recommendation is to use logic and explain the situation   give your first name and describe when you received the phone number and then ask a simple question   when in the last 3 1/2 years have you or any collector had a successful hit from this number   they 'll respond never in 3 1/2 years   the collector notes the account for themselves and future collectors   debt collectors are about about making money not wasting time and they do review all notes pertaining to an account   will it work   maybe not but hopefully it will stop the calls with a short conversation   good luck

um read what i said more closely i said it was n't perfect for the long run but obstructing and causing it to fail is very different from fixing it does he want to fix it based on his actions it does n't seem like it literally the only thing keeping me alive right now is the fact that insurance companies ca n't exclude you or charge higher due to pre existing conditions the only way that works is if everyone has insurance high risk pools are not an option these supposed republican traitors understand that literally killing off god knows how many americans just do trump can say he won is ridiculous i 'm not a huge fan of the aca either i want socialized medicine for all why burden businesses to pay for insurance you want business growth and to foster entrepreneurial growth reduce the risk of literally dying from cancer by offering socialized medicine i am very lucky to be in a situation where i can work for a startup and not have to worry about my healthcare for now now to answer your questions is he for a national health care system i do n't know it 's impossible to know exactly what trump wants he is purposely elusive and only comes out to bash things when it makes him look good you never know exactly where he stands so he can always spin the table and said oh i never said that if he had legislation he wanted to push forward why does n't he work with congress to define it and push t forward no matter how fucked up congress is there 's nothing stopping trump from creating and proposing legislation for discussion but he had n't done that why we can speculate all day but i think at core if it he has a psychic imbalance i think mental illness is the wrong connotation but his spirit is sick and until he is he will continue to damage the people of america and the fact that he has such a massive following indicates that there is a spiritual and emotional illness spreading like wildfire through this country i fear that we will never be a court filled with compassion civility and reason that might not be what the majority wants and that 's fine too i 'm thankful to be very high income and in tech so i can gtfo when the time is right anyway i do n't think this post will have changed your mind but maybe it will get some others out there to who are on the fence to reconsider their world view

the first red flag here is that an appraisal was not performed on an as is basis and if it could not be done you should be told why getting an appraisal on an after improvement basis only makes sense if you are proposing to perform such improvements and want that factored in as a basis of the loan it seems very bizarre to me that a mortgage lender would do this without any explanation at all the only way this makes sense is if the lender is only offering you a loan with specific underwriting guidelines on house quality common with for instance va loans and how they require the roof be of a certain maximum age among dozens of other requirements and many loan products have their own standards this should have been disclosed to you during the process but one can certainly never assume anyone will do their job properly or it may have only mentioned in some small print as part of pounds of paper products you may have been offered or made to sign already the bank criteria is reasonable to the extent that generally mortgage companies are allowed to set underwriting criteria about the current condition of the house it does n't need to be reasonable to you personally or any of us it 's to protect lender profits by their risk models your plans and preferences do n't even factor in to their guidelines not all criteria are on a a sliding scale so it does n't necessarily matter how well you meet their other standards you are of course correct that paying for thousands of dollars in improvements on a house you do n't own is lunacy and the fact that this was suggested may on it 's own suggest you should cut your losses now and seek out a different lender   given the lender being the only reason to stick with it seems to be the sunk cost of the appraisal you 've already paid for i 'd suggest you specifically ask them why they did not perform an as is appraisal and listen to the answer if you can get one you can try to contact the appraiser directly as well with this question and ask if you can have the appraisal strictly as is without having a new appraisal they might be helpful they might not as for taking the appraisal with you to a new bank you might be able to do this or you might not it is strictly up to each lender to set criteria for appraisals they accept but i 've certainly known of people re using an appraisal done sufficiently recently in this way it 's a possibility that you will need to write off the $ 800 as an education expense but it 's certainly worth trying to see if you can salvage it and take it with you you 'll just have to ask each potential lender as i 've heard it go both ways it 's not a crazy or super rare request lenders backing out based on appraisal results should be absolutely normal to anyone in the finance business to do this you can just state plainly the situation you paid for an appraisal and the previous lender fell through and so you would like to know if they would be able to accept that and provide you with a loan without having to buy a whole new appraisal this would also be a good time to talk about condition requirements in that you want a loan on an as is basic for a house that is but needs cosmetic repair and you plan to do this in cash on your own time after the purchase closes some lenders will be happy to do this at below ltv and some absolutely do not want to make this type of loan because the house is n't in perfect condition and that 's just what their lending criteria is right now   based on description alone i do n't think you really should need to go into alternate plans like buy cash and then get a home equity loan to get cash out special rehab packages etc so i 'd encourage you to try a more straight forward option of a different lender as well as trying to get a straight answer on their odd choice of appraisal order that you paid for before trying anything more exotic or totally changing your purchase finance plans

technically anyone who advises how you should spend or proportion your money is a financial adviser   a person that does it for money is a financial advisor difference in spelling financial advisors are people that basically build manage or advise on your portfolio   they have a little more institutional knowledge on how where to invest given your goals since they do it on a daily basis they may know a little more than you since they deal with many different assets stocks etfs mutual funds bonds insurances home health life reits options futures leaps etc there is risk in everything you do which is why what they propose is generally according to the risk level you want to assume   since you 're younger your risk level could be a little higher as you approach retirement your risk level will be lower   risk level should be associated with how likely you 're able to your assets if you lose it all as well as your likelihood to enjoy the fruits from your investments financial advisors are great however be careful about them   some are payed on commissions which are given money for investing in packages that they support   basically they could get paid $ $ for putting you in a losing situation   also be careful because some announce that they are fee based these advisers often receive fees as well as commissions   basically associate the term commission with conflict of interest so you want a fee only advisor which is n't persuaded to steer you wrong another thing worth noting is that some trading companies like e*trade has financial services that may be free depending how much money you have with them   generally $ 50 k is on the lower end to get a financial advisors   there has been corruption in the past where financial advisors are only given a limited number of accounts to manage that means they took the lower valued ones and basically ran them into the ground so they could get newer ones from the lot that were hopefully worth more the larger their portfolio the more $ $ they could make higher fees or more commissions and less work less accounts to have to deal with that 's subjective since the spread of the wealth was accross many markets

having worked in insurance i can give you a few pointers firstly state that you may have to complain insurers hate complaints because they really complicate matters are loads of work and must be tracked i would advise not actually escalating it to a complaint until later as this may cause a delay as the actual process is quite convoluted mentioning the possibility of complaint sometimes makes people a bit more active try and resolve the issue and if you are n't getting anywhere then make a complaint maintain a friendly polite if you get angry and aggressive you 'll not likely get far remember that the people on the end of the phone are both human and more knowledgeable about insurance than you you want them on your side not against you make notes if you can record calls if you are recording calls you will likely legally need to give them the option of not being recorded so make sure you mention that you 're recording each individual call as soon as you start speaking to the handler   refer to your notes and make sure you carry out actions you say you will if you spend a few days sending something you said you 'd email over that day and you then chase them a few days after that they may not have had the document through their workflow yet it also urgency if you 're acting promptly and suggests that you do n't really care if you 're taking your time   get names this is an important step as this gives the handler someone to talk to who may be familiar with your case you may end up speaking to the same people more than once so try and build a rapport if you do i like this guy may lead to a bit more effort being put in and a potentially better outcome in my experience can be a bit slow to respond to things so you 'll likely have to chase them up if you chase them up and say i called on x date discussing y with z and z said they would do a b and c. has this been done yet it looks better than saying i called about a week ago and spoke to one of your colleagues who said he 'd do something for me he 's not done it what 's going on as to a plan of action i would split this into two points mis sold policy and definition of commuting mis sold policy if they truly gave your wife two options then they messed up the standard 3 offered by are social domestic and pleasure and and business use other companies sometimes roll commuting into as standard on the comparison sites however there are usually the three separate options and if you used one to set the policy up and clicked only then you may be in trouble   social domestic and pleasure only does not include commuting whilst it is your responsibility to thoroughly check any documentation that comes through it could be argued that if given two options between business use and then a reasonable person could be considered to assume that definition of did include commuting therefore they need to prove to you that there were three options offered and that your wife specifically excluded commuting if they ca n't then you should be able to argue that only two were offered and that commuting could have reasonably been assumed to be included use that term reasonable person btw it 's used in a lot of internal literature at least at the insurer i worked at not commuting firstly clarify their definition of commuting if your wife was on her way to work afterwards then they may well consider she was commuting for instance at present i drive from my house to my son 's then to my wife 's work and finally to mine my commute could be argued to be 1 minute my workplace is probably a minutes drive from my wife 's but i ca n't park in her car park but if i were to have an accident between my house and my son 's ~15 mins drive the insurers would probably consider that commuting   if she was not on her way to work afterwards and assuming your wife arranged her visit via text or whatsapp fb messenger or similar you should easily be able to show that your wife had driven from a friends house to the if she was on a holiday day or was not working on that day then that 's also something you should be able to prove either with proof of her working pattern or proof of her holiday if she does n't have a job at all then again that 's something that 's provable proof reigns king in claims so if you can prove certain key facts then you should be on to a winner

the new york times offer a remarkably detailed buy vs rent calculator   you enter from all of this it advises the break even rent when monetarily it 's equal   i 'd suggest you keep a few things in mind when using such a tool logic common sense and a nobel prize winner named robert shiller all indicate that housing will follow inflation over the long term short term even 20 years the graphs will hint at something else but the real long term the cost of housing ca n't exceed inflation   the other major point i 'd add is that i see you wrote we rent a nice house most often people are looking to buy what they feel they ca n't easily rent whether it 's the yard room number or sizes etc this also leads to the purchase of too big a house you can find that you can afford the extra bedroom family room in addition to living room etc and then buy a house 50 bigger than what you need or planned on in my opinion getting the smallest house you can imagine living in no bigger than what you live in now and plan to get on a faster than 30 year repayment even with transaction costs in 10 years you 'll have saved enough to make the bump up to a larger house if you wish

second mortgages were also a popular way for home buyers without a down payment to borrow 100 of the money but avoid certain extra fees if they borrowed all the money from a single lender for example to borrow $ 100,000 on a house would incur something called pmi private mortgage insurance   so to borrow $ 100,000 to buy my house my payment might be $ 800/month but i would have an additional $ 100/month of pmi to pay   these numbers are totally made up and not based in math in any way so instead of that borrows might get a first mortgage for $ 80,000 so they do n't have to pay the pmi and get a second mortgage for the difference   this can be beneficial if the second mortgage payment is less than the pmi for borrowing 100 as far as i know they are n't as easy to get these days like any loan you need to be qualified and i think 100 financing is probably harder to come by   the negative connotation is no worse than any other loan   i am personally against borrowing money but if you had big medical expenses major home repairs or some other emergency i could see it justified   probably not for a big vacation or for new car though

as the college education is very costly i want to send usd 25,000 to him as a gift what is the procedure and what indian and american tax laws are involved this transaction will be treated as gift as per indian law you can transfer unlimited amount to your close relative son in law grandchildren daughter etc in us the gift tax is on donor as you are no us citizen you are not bound by this as your son in law grandchildren are us citizens there is no tax to them your son in law may still need to declare this in form or such relevant returns under the liberalized remittance scheme refer q3 you can transfer upto usd 250,000 per year there maybe some forms that you need to fill ask your bank if the amount is more than usd 25,000 a ca certificate along with 15ca 15cb need to be filled essentially the ca that taxes on the funds being transferred have already been paid to govt of india can i send money to him directly or to his father who is submitting tax returns in usa this does not make any difference in india someone else may answer this question if it makes a difference in us

you can and definitely should withdraw any part of the contribution that will put you over the contribution limit   you can and should if you need to withdraw to repay any medical payments you made from outside the account   you can but should avoid at all costs withdraw distribute from the hsa for non medical reasons here 's the irs publication which covers this   here 's the bit about distributions that covers what you 're trying to do you can receive tax free distributions from your hsa to pay or be reimbursed for qualified medical expenses you incur after you establish the hsa if you receive distributions for other reasons the amount you withdraw will be subject to income tax and may be subject to an additional 20 tax you do n’t have to make distributions from your hsa each year   it is better to pay from your checking and reimburse than to over fund the hsa   best route forward is to reduce your contributions for the rest of the year especially if continuing them will cause excess contributions   another nasty gotcha excess contributions      you will have excess contributions if the contributions to your hsa for the year are greater than the limits discussed earlier excess contributions are n’t deductible excess contributions made by your employer are included in your gross income if the excess contribution is n’t included in box 1 of form w-2 you must report the excess as other income on your tax return generally you must pay a 6 excise tax on excess contributions see form 5329 additional taxes on qualified plans including iras and other tax favored accounts to figure the excise tax the excise tax applies to each tax year the excess contribution remains in the account   you may withdraw some or all of the excess contributions and avoid paying the excise tax on the amount withdrawn if you meet the following conditions   withdraw the excess contributions by the due date including extensions of your tax return for the year the contributions were made withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in other income on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings if you will not be over your maximum contribution let the contribution ride   make sure your hsa balance is divided between cash stock fund bond fund   much like your 401k   because the part that you do n't spend on medical expenses this year can be spent in future years medical expenses and if you have anything left when you retire you can spend it on whatever you want   and the funds including growth are not taxed until you distribute them bottom line   if the funds will not cause excess contribution leave them in   otherwise take them out as soon as possible

$ 33 k $ payment is but is that right you 're also stretching out the remaining loan back to 30 years   now if the bank just let you do the stretch you 'd owe $ 95 k 4.75 360 mo pmt = $ this would be a neutral move same rate you now have $ 128 k 360 pmt = $ 737 so to my thinking the delta is $ 33 k x rate 360 pmt = $ and the rate is if you have enough equity to refi you have enough to take that in a heloc and pay it off aggressively why give up the great rate the $ you will pay the heloc off in 22 years even at 6 my heloc is 2.5 i 'd use any raise or bonus to hack away at it   i tried to spell out my thought process on the math if any savvy reader you all are i know wants to look at this and offer a better method i 'm open minded there 's a fallacy that comes with refinancing certainly money appears in the payment stream as a result of extending the term somewhere that needs to be accounted for else a higher rate at a longer term appears favorable so my approach is to normalize the numbers one way or another here producing that first step of calculating the payment on the extended term an interim step that 's a mental process only that loan is hypothetical   comments welcome

one thing to keep in mind when calculating p e on an index is that the e earnings can be very close to zero   for example if you had a stock trading at $ 100 and the earnings per share was $ .01 this would result in a p e of 10,000 which would dominate the p e you calculate for the index   of course negative earnings also skew results one way to get around this would be to calculate the average price of the index and the earnings per share of the index separately and then divide the average price of the index by the average earnings per share of the index different sources calculate these numbers in different ways   some throw out negative p es or earnings per share and some do n't   some calculate the price and earnings per share separate and some do n't etc you 'll need to understand how they are calculating the number in order to compare it to of individual companies

this is a complicated subject because professional traders do n't rely on brokers for stock quotes   they have access to market data using level ii terminals which show them all of the prices buy and sell for a given stock    every publicly traded stock at least in the u.s. relies on firms called market makers   market makers are the ones who ultimately actually buy and sell the shares of companies making their money on the difference between what they bought the stock at and what they can sell it for   sometimes those margins can be in hundreds of a cent per share but if you trade enough shares well it adds up the most widely traded stocks apple microsoft bp etc may have hundreds of market makers who are willing to handle share trades   each market maker sets their own price on what they 'll pay the bid to buy someone 's stock who wants to sell and what they 'll sell the ask that share for to someone who wants to buy it    when a market maker wants to be competitive he may price his bid ask pretty aggressively because automated trading systems are designed to seek out the best bid ask prices for their trade   as such you might get a huge chunk of market makers in a popular stock to all set their prices almost identically to one another   other market makers who are n't as enthusiastic will set less competitive prices so they do n't get much maybe no business   in any case what you see when you pull up a stock quote is called the best bid ask price   in other words you 're seeing the highest price a market maker will pay to buy that stock and the lowest price that a market maker will sell that stock   you may get a best bid from one market maker and a best ask from a different one   in any case consumers must be given best bid ask prices market makers actually control the prices of shares   they can see what 's out there in terms of what people want to buy or sell and they modify their prices accordingly   if they see a bunch of sell orders coming into the system they 'll start dropping prices and if people are in a buying mood then they 'll raise prices market makers can actually ignore requests for trades whether buy or sell if they choose to and sometimes they do which is why a limit order a request to buy sell a stock at a specific price regardless of its current actual price that someone places may go unfilled and die at the end of the trading session   no market maker is willing to fill the order nowadays these systems are largely automated so they operate according to complex rules defined by their owners   very few trades actually involve human intervention because people ca n't digest the information at a fast enough pace to keep up with automated platforms so that 's the basics of how share prices work   i hope this answered your question without being too confusing good luck

my entrepreneurship prof said that in most cases if you really believe in your product idea and it is differentiated from what exists already you can afford to have someone steal your idea and try to make a go of it because you should still be able to do a much better job of it than they can and their heart is nt in it the way yours is    i think ultimately it really depends on the product though you definitely do n't want to try going 2nd to market against someone with superior resources unless you can 100 beat their version of the product by a good margin either on price or quality and hopefully both and you can scale up quickly

to me it depends on things like your net worth debt and how other assets are invested    currently you have 25 k invested in the company you work for    if you have 100 k in student loans are a renter and 12 k in your 401 k then i would recommend exercising almost all of your options   in that case you have a much to large part of your world wrapped up in your company if you have 250 k in your 401 k own a home and have an emergency fund with no debt then you are fine with letting it ride   you can afford to absorb a loss of 25 k without wrecking your net worth more than likely you are somewhere in between just statistics speaking there   so why not exercise some of them now with the purpose of improving your financial situation   say do a 1/3 now and when they come available    when 401ks were first invented people put almost all of their money in their company stock   they lost just about everything when the company went down in value and were often a victim of layoffs the issue   this is akin to the same situation   most financial advisers recommend against putting any 401 k money to company stock or at least limiting the amount

high frequency trades are intra day the would buy a stock for 100 and sell for multiple times so if you start with 100 in your broker account you buy something it takes 2 3 days to settle you sell for it takes 2 3 days to settle you again buy something for 100 it is the net value of both buys and sells that you need to look at trading on margin accounts most brokers offer margin accounts the exact leverage ratios varies what this means is that if you start with 10 or 15 or 25 in your broker you can buy stock of 100 of course legally you wo nt own the stock unless you pay the broker balance etc

it would essentially make goods from other countries more cheaper than goods from us and it would make imports from these countries to china more expensive   the below illustration is just with 2 major currencies and is more illustrative to show the effect it does not actually mean the goods from these countries would be cheaper 1 gbp = 1.60 usd   1 eur = 1.40 usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd lets say the above are the rates for gbp eur cny the cost of a particular goods assume in international market is 2 usd this means for the cost of manufacturing this should be less than gbp 1.25 in uk less than 1.43 in euro countires less than cny in china only then export would make sense if the real cost of manufacturing is say 1.4 gbp in uk 1.5 eur in euro countires clearly they can not compete and would loose now lets say the usd has appreciated by 20 against other currencies the cny is at same rate 1 gbp = usd 1 eur = usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd now at this rate the cost of manufacturing should be less than gbp gbp less than eur in euro countires in effect this is more than the cost of manufacturing so in effect the goods from other countires have become cheaper and goods from china have become expensive similarly the imports from these countires to china would be more expensive

here are the top in my recent experience in highest first order child care by far the biggest potential cost is childcare whether this be a full time nursery child minder live in nanny au pair or just paying a baby sitter when parents need a night off this needs careful thought in london full time nursery school 6 months to 4 years old varies from 500 to 2000 per month and the amount you pay does not guarantee the quality of the care education if you have relatives nearby these costs can likely be reduced but you 'd really need to pay the relatives somehow meals bling holidays a new bathroom etc loss of earnings whether the mother goes on maternity leave or the father gives up his job to be a house husband the family income is going to be affected for a period of time you can plan for this by researching what government or company benefits the mother or father will get and for how long i suggest dividing this amount evenly across the whole period that the stay at home parent will be off rather than trying to calculate 2 months full pay 2 months half pay 2 month 's no pay because if you get into a pattern of high spending in the first two months what will happen for the next 4 months you also need to consider short notice time off work when anybody is poorly i suggest reserving some of your vacation time for unexpectedly have to look after the family time when children start daycare nursery the cross so you get some really nasty strains of and flu in the house which could cause the primary to be unable to do their caring without your help bigger car if you ca n't get a baby seat into your car because it does n't have the proper fittings or does n't have rear seats you 'll likely need to change your car there are plenty of cars that are bigger in terms of people space without being more expensive but it 'll cost to change insurances if you have health insurance e.g. us you 're going to have a proportional increase call your provider for details bear in mind that children have more illnesses and accidents than middle age parents so it could be a shock some parents take out life insurance to provide for their childrens financial future in case of the worst happening this can be around 50 usd per month but it all depends on the lump sum you 're insuring for equipment as a new parent you think you need an incredible amount of equipment such as changing station cot basket carry chair car seat travel cot feeding chair changing mat baby bath etc when you bring a new baby home you really only need a wipe clean changing mat and somewhere safe for baby to sleep you can buy anything else as you need it in fact it gives you more perspective to go shopping once you 've had the baby whatever you buy keep the receipt and do n't open it until you need it much easier to take back the e.g. portable baby bottle warmer if you did n't open it because baby is breast fed when they become bigger 2 months plus you 'll need a cot invest in an adjustable cot bed it 's a bit larger than a regular cot and the floor lowers as they get bigger so you only need one for the first 2.5 to 3 years food if baby will have formula there are baby milk formula calculators on the web in summary one box of quality formula is usd and this lasts around 4 days if fully formula fed once they 're onto food you need to factor in baby food options you can either make your own by side lining some of the adult meal and it then putting it into individual plastic containers this takes effort so not everyone has the energy alternatively you 're going to have to buy baby food in jars packets or boxes for 3 meals a day and there 'll be little snacks in between baby snacks are strangely expensive so recommend fruit budget for 5 usd per day until they 're eating a small portion of the family meal clothes a new baby really only needs vests all in one suits for warmth you can go mad buying cute outfits but they get limited use as a new baby grows really quickly if you 've a lot of family friends and you have a tradition of some kind of good luck party baby shower then you can find that you end up being given lots of things if you do n't know the sex of the baby ask people to get you a gift receipt if possible such that you do n't get blue clothes for a girl it may not bother you but its a pain when people say is a strange name for a boy just because your little girl has blue child your home this really does not have to cost a lot some people go mad putting soft corners on all the hard edges covering the electrical and generally the whole home it 's up to you but if there 's a room full of sharp poisonous things like a kitchen or utility room you might want to put a 15 usd baby gate on that room putting the or sharp things up high or stored away in the attic is a sensible move too

like joetaxpayer said i do n't know of any difference between the backdoor and a regular roth ira contribution besides the issue with existing pre tax ira money so if it is your practice to contribute at the beginning of the year good for you most people wait until the last minute then doing a backdoor seems like the safe choice some people have speculated that hypothetically the irs could use the step transaction doctrine to treat it as a single direct contribution to a roth ira which then would be disallowed and cause you a penalty until you take it out but i have never heard of this happening to anyone as for the paperwork you just need to fill out one extra form at tax time form 8606 you need to complete two parts of it one for the non deductible contribution and one for the conversion it is pretty straightforward although i 've found that it is a pain to do it in tax software another option would be for you to contribute to a roth ira now but when you discover that you 're over the limit at the end of the year re characterize it as a traditional contribution and then convert it back to roth but this way is not good because then there is a long time between the traditional contribution and the roth conversion and earnings during this time will be taxed at conversion

discounting premiums based on some past history is not unique to auto policies   other insurers will discount premiums based on past claims history they just do n't shout about it as a marketing means to attract customers   life insurance is underwritten based on your health history if you want to consider your preferred underwriting status based on your clear health history a discount based on your healthy habits you 're free to do so   all sorts of lines of insurance use all sorts of things to determine an underwriting classes   the fact that auto insurers specific discounts does not mean the same net effect is not available on other lines of coverage most states require auto rates and discounts to be filed and approved with some state regulator some regulatory bodies even require that certain discounts exist   you could likely negotiate with your business insurance underwriters about a better rate and if the underwriters saw fit they could give you a discount   auto insurers can offer discounts but are generally beholden to whatever rate sheet is on file with the applicable regulatory body for the person who downvoted here 's a link to a spreadsheet outlining one of the ca department of insurance allowable rating factor sheets related to auto insurance

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

it all has to do with risk and reward the risk is that interest rates will rise   to entice you to go with the variable they make it so it is cheaper if interest rates never rise your job is to guess whether interest rates are likely to go up or not in a first approximation you should go fixed the bank employs very smart people whose entire job is to know whether interest rates will go up or not those people chose the price difference between the two and it 's sure to favour the bank that is the risk of extra payments you 'll make on the variable is probably more than the but some people ca n't sleep at night if their payments or more realistically the interest part of their payments might double if that 's you go fixed if that 's not you understand that the actually has to be turned up a bit to get more people to go variable because of the sleeping at night feature think long and hard about your budget and what would happen if your payment jumped if you could handle it variable might be the better choice personally i have been taking variable on my mortgage for decades and now i do n't have one and never once regretted it i also my oldest child to take variable on her mortgage over this century so far if rates up they did n't tick up to the level the fixed was offered at mostly they have sat flat but if ever there was a world in which past performance does not predict future results it would be interest rate trends do your own research

i did that   what is allowed changes over time though leading up to the crisis lenders would approve at the evidence in particular my so had only been in the country a couple years and was at a sweet spot where lack of history was no longer counting against her running the numbers the mortgage was a fraction of a percent cheaper in her name than in mine   even though she used a stated income self reported not backed by job history of the household not just herself the title was in her name and would have cost money to have mine added later so we did n’t   this was in texas which is a community property state so after marriage for sure everything is ours

leads one to believe that one complaint call cost a company four million bucks   actually the title is ambiguous it merely implies that the complain call was worth $ 4 million   you chose to infer that the end result was a cost rather than a gain

i 've heard success stories but personally i was considering it and i 'm so glad i did n't i ended up hating the atmosphere left after one semester to take care of that house i rent out i 'd need to hire someone or drive each way for anything that needed my attention if you plan to stay in the area i 'd consider the housing prices the rental market considering the responsibility of maintenance your expected margin trust me it will be lower i 've never heard a landlord say he did n't encounter significant unintended expenses it 's such a unique situation it really requires more detail after all you 'd be saving rent have control over the house and who lives there but you have a whole hell of a lot of responsibility i met one guy who had basically became the house 's mom because he had a vested interest and was always cleaning up preventing or damage to the paint facing awkward social situations as they tried to chase down rent with the right people i 've seen it go very well oh one more caveat with a live in super they can provide notice of any necessary repairs instantly and from there the clock starts they can legally withhold rent until the repairs are completed and if you 're not too liquid after that down payment and the mortgage payments plus school etc this could put you between a rock and some hard ass creditors

a brief time off often 7 12 weeks is called a sabbatical what you propose is far beyond that and unless you have it well planned out you risk burning through all your savings and perhaps more   most of us are planning a retirement and have some idea of the savings needed you first need to plan this 2 3 year and then for both of you to get and start the savings again i envy anyone who can manage to do this while they are young enough to enjoy it

the definition of insurance is the transfer of risk thus you 're paying for transferring of a risk of an item property to the insurer carrier so that they bear the financial burden of a loss accident and not you you could always self insure but a lot of times insurance is cheaper since due to the law of large numbers the insurer can just charge a premium that is small percentage in comparison to the cost of self insuring

read your link thanks   the basic idea is that capitalism will work it out and that each of us will pay a security agency to handle our disputes and that rival security agencies will collaborate and negotiate with each other and that private courts will be fair to protect their brand   this some harsh realities that already exist with capitalism customers generally do not have time to purchase based on accurate information for every product for example airlines compete almost solely on price insurance companies compete on price and provide horrible sometimes fraudulent service but customers are left in the dark who is to say the insurer committed fraud if it disputes it banks operate with gross incompetence and and are left untouched by the justice system    we have already discovered that just letting corporations operate without an restrictions creates serious problems there has to be force that their worst tendencies even if that force government is imperfect    i remain confused why people think that corporations are somehow more trustworthy and efficient than government agencies or that corporations can be used to address externalities

office 365 has all of the sharing editing browser access that you would want as a consumer plus it is far more useful in an enterprise setting because of better permissions settings   what people do n't seem to realize is that microsoft does n't make their nut on consumer software   they ultimately are failing at porting really good enterprise packages to the consumer which is a totally different issue

the value will certainly fluctuate up and down but on average gain more than a savings account but so long as you have enough liquid assets for emergencies then yes it 's a perfectly good alternative to savings accounts how risky in general are index income funds how are you defining risk if you mean probability that i 'll lose it all then it 's virtually zero   if you mean how much the value can fluctuate then it 's certainly not risk free but it has less volatility that individual stocks   if you take the s&p 500 as a proxy you might expect the change in value over any given year to fluctuate between -30 like 2008 and + 40 with an average change of around 8 there will be funds that have less volatility but produce less return and funds that have more volatility but higher average returns

what is the question are you just trying to confirm that for self employed a solo 401(k is flexible and a great tool to level out your tax rates sure a w2 employee can turn on and off his 401(k deduction any time and bump the holding on each check as high as 75 in some cases so in a tight stretch i 'd save to the match but later on top off the maximum for the year to the points you listed your observation is interesting but a bit long for what you seem to be asking keep in mind there are 2 great features that you do n't mention a roth solo 401(k flavor which offers even more flexibility for variable income and loan provisions up to $ 50,000 available to borrow from the account my fellow blogger the financial buff offered an article solo 401k providers and their scope of services that did a great job addressing this

when you start at a new job here in the u.s. the default means of payment is usually a paper check most folks will quickly set up direct deposit so that their employer deposits their paycheck directly into their personal bank account the incentive to do so is that you receive your funds faster than if you deposit a paper check   even if you set up direct deposit on your first day on the job you may still receive your first paycheck as a paper check simply because the wheels of payroll processing turn slowly at some large companies a counter example is a self employed contractor perhaps a carpenter or house painter   these folks are paid by their customers homeowners and such   many larger well established now accept credit card payments from customers but smaller may be reluctant to set up a credit card merchant account to accept payment by card because of all the fees that are associated with accepting credit card payments   3 transaction fees and monthly service fees can be scary to any businessman who already has very thin profit margins   in such cases these contractors prefer to be paid by check or in cash for the simple reason that there are no fees deducted from cash payments there are a few folks here who do n't trust direct deposit or more specifically do n't trust their employer to perform the deposit correctly and on time   some feel uncomfortable giving their bank info to their employer fearing someone at the company could steal money from their account in my experience the folks who prefer a paper paycheck are often the same folks who rush to the bank on payday to redeem their paychecks for cash   they may have a bank account helps with check cashing but they prefer to carry cash i operate in a manner similar to you i use a debit card or credit card i only have one of each for nearly all transactions in daily life i use electronic payments through my bank to pay my regular bills and mortgage and i receive my paycheck by direct deposit   there have been periods where i have n't written or received paper checks for so long that i have to hunt for where i put my checkbook even though i use a debit card for most store purchases the bank account behind that debit card is actually a checking account according to the bank   again the system defaults to paper checks and you have the option of going electronic as well before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc   direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day laborer who expect to work for a different person each day or week i do n't think this is all that unique to the us   there are people in every city and country who do n't have long term employment with a single employer and therefore prefer cash or paper check over electronic payments    i 'd be willing to bet that this applies to the majority of people on the planet actually

in my opinion separating your money into separate accounts is a matter of personal preference i can only think of two main reasons why people might suggest separating your bank accounts in this way security and accounting the security reasoning might go something like this my employer has access to my bank account because he direct deposits my salary into my account   i do n't want my employer to have access to all my money so i 'll have a separate account that my employer has access to and once the salary is deposited i can move that money into my real account the fault in this reasoning is that a direct deposit setup does n't really give your employer withdrawal access to your account and your employer does n't have any reason to pull money out of your account after he has paid you   if fraud is going to happen it much more likely to happen in the account that you are doing your spending out of the other reason might be accounting   perhaps you have several bank accounts and you use the different accounts to separate your money for different purposes   for example you might have a checking account that you do most of your monthly spending out of you might have a savings account that you use to store your emergency fund and you have more savings accounts to keep track of how much you have saved toward your next car or your vacation or your christmas fund or whatever   after you get your salary deposited you can move some into your spending account and some into your various savings accounts for different purposes instead of having many bank accounts i find it easier to do my budgeting accounting on my own not relying on the bank accounts to tell me how much money i have allocated to each purpose   i only have one checking account where my income goes my own records keep track of how much money in that account is set aside for each purpose   when the checking account balance gets too large i move a chunk of it over to my one savings account which earns a little more interest than the checking account does   i can always move money back into my checking account if i need to spend it for some reason and the amount of money in each of the two accounts is not directly related to the purpose of the money in summary i do n't see a good reason for this type of general recommendation

i 'll agree that some variance in wage between city and rural makes sense the whole more restaurants are now closing because of hikes in staff wages is pretty misleading about 60 of hospitality ventures fail in the first three years and that 's across the board before any wage change discussion requiring workers to be paid more requires the employer to make adjustments to the business model this added level of operating complexity is sure to impact some folks but presenting it as a major contributing factor to increased failure rates is a stretch

how do you mean   if you have a list of targeted customers that your sales people are calling from then you would preferably use some kind dialer software in my opinion a software that do n't call for you    if you call customers that do n't want to be called again then do n't call them offering this offer many customers get approached by many sales people so they often forget who called and when if you have n't come so far that could give the customer a fair explanation of your offer a month or two and try again   have i understood your question right
