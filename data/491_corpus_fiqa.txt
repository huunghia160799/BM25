as a cpa i can say without a doubt you do not owe any federal income tax however assuming all of you income was from your business and therefore subject to self employment tax and you had no healthcare coverage you would owe $ in self employment tax     645 in healthcare penalty $ total amount you should owe assuming you have given us the right numbers $ 3,300 sounds too high

in your case i believe the answer is that you do n't owe any taxes if your deductions exceed your income there is something called the alternate minimum tax to catch rich people who claim too many deductions basically it taxes their gross income at a lower rate but allows them no deductions if they make $ or more you are not in that tax bracket

i 'm going to echo phil and say that you should add more information that being said i think it is possible for you to owe the government that much if you received a federal health insurance subsidy and live in a state that did n't expand medicaid you could have received a subsidy through out the year that you did not end up qualifying for it appears you are outside the medicaid limit of 133 of the poverty or $ if you received a subsidy of $ 275 a month from the marketplace you would have received $ 3300 worth of aid from the government that you do n't qualify for now they are expecting you to pay it back

there 's one factor the previous posters apparently missed here you say self employment tax in other words at least some of that $ 16k is from self employment   in a normal employment situation the fica tax is taken out of your paycheck it 's normally spot on and generally does n't show up on your tax return however for the self employed it 's another matter   you pay the whole 15.3 from the first dollar and this does show up on your tax return   if it 's all self employment money you would have about $ in tax from this
# 184445
no it 's not possible even if you had no deduction or credits your federal tax on $ would be $ 10 = $ +   $ 15 = $ = $ that assumes you are filing as single there must be more to the story   typo in your income numbers   also what do you mean by a self employment tax deduction maybe update your question to include a breakdown of everything you entered edit as noted in 's answer it seems that it is indeed possible in at least one case self employment taxes

it does n't generally matter and i 'm not sure if it is in fact in use by the irs other than for general statistics like this year 20 of returns were with one spouse being a they may be able to try and match the occupation and the general levels and types of income but for self employed there 's a more precise and reliable field on schedule c and for employees they do n't really need to do this since everything is reported on w2 anyway so i do n't think they even bother or give a lot of value to such a metric so yes i 'm joining the non authoritative does n't matter crowd

this is a classic correlation does not imply causation situation   there are at least three issues at play in this question if you are or day trading then the first and second issues can definitely affect your trading   a higher price higher volume stock will have smaller percentage volatility fluctuations within a very small period of time however in general and especially when holding any position for any period of time during which unknowns can become known such as netflix 's customer loss announcement it is a mistake to feel safe based on price alone when considering longer term investments even weeks or months and if you were to compare penny stocks with blue chip stocks you still might find more stability in the higher value stocks   this is a correlation alone in other words a stable reliable stock probably has a relatively high price but a high price does not mean it 's reliable as joe said the stock of any company that is exposed to significant risks can drop or rise by large amounts suddenly and it is common for blue chip stocks to move significantly in a period of months as changes in the market or the company itself manifest themselves the last thing to remember when you are looking at raw dollar amounts is to remember to look at shares outstanding   netflix has a price of $ 79 to ford 's $ 12 yet ford has a larger market cap because there are nearly 4 billion shares compared to netflix 's 52 m

as far as i can tell the direct deposit option would require you to have a us bank account which you do n't have so wire transfer is your only option unless you can ask them to try something else like one of the cheaper money transfer services around the charges for wire transfers tend to be fairly significant typically low tens of usd depending on your relationship with the payer and the nature of the payment try to get them to send it with all charges paid so you actually receive the amount you are owed and they cover the charges

the request to block the money is made by the party who sells the product based on this request the bank blocks the funds subsequently the party who sold the product makes a charge against this block just to give an easy example so in the online train booking there are multiple messages sent between the bank and something has gone wrong it looks like the message from bank sending back the block reference number to has not reached so as per bank there is a block and as per there is no block keep chasing to issue a letter so that you can send it to the bank and get the block removed typically the blocks by the bank are for a period of 30 days and if there is no charge against that block it automatically gets reversed

tax cuts do lead to economic growth and why not   more money circulating in the private economy is good for everybody   it ’s why the stock market is up big on the prospect for tax cuts   the problem is the rosy growth projections that accompany these plans   the growth will occur but the pace of growth is a big question and very hard to model   so a prudent policy proposal would be to cut spending as well while the growth   then hopefully that spending cut becomes permanent as the economy grows so the private economy grows at the expense of the state

there seems to be a gap in the internal logic of this story   gt some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on   gap   gt everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   we went from a system where the underlying product apples could actually be obtained to a system in which the underlying product apparently can not be obtained leaving only derivative if that markets of people swapping notes for other products and services   do you mean to say the enterprising person simply ended the ability to get apples and switched cold turkey to a new system in which the underlying product either does not exist or is not redeemable

ach transfers are reversible and traceable so what 's stopping them is the ease and the speed with which they would be caught when you give a check you have to provide some information to the payee so that they could cash it you ca n't withhold the bank or the account number how would they charge you so it has to be on it and if it is on it it can be put on any other fake check that is why checks come also with your signature and are always available for you to inspect when they 're cashed if you notice something out of the ordinary check you did n't give ach transfer you did n't authorize on your statement it is your responsibility to notify the bank within x period of time 60 days i think of the statement and it will be dealt with so the best way to protect yourself would be to keep an eye on your account and verify that the transactions that you see are all authorized and do it frequently keeping large amounts of cash on your checking account is never a good idea regardless also since checks are inherently unsafe try to only give checks to people you trust and use bill pay or credit cards with anyone else

it 's not usually apparent to the average consumer but there 's actually two stages to collecting a payment and two ways to undo it   the particular combination that occurs may lead to long refund times on top of any human delays like ben miller 's answer addresses when you pay with a credit card it is typically only authorized the issuing bank says i 'm setting this money aside for this transaction but no money actually changes hands   you 'll typically see this on your statement as a pending charge   only later in a process called settlement does your bank actually send money to the merchant 's bank   typically this process starts the same day that the authorization happens at close of business but it may take a few days to complete   in the case of an ecommerce transaction the merchant may not be allowed to start it until they ship whatever you ordered on the flip side a given transaction can be voided off or money can be sent back to your card   in the first case the transaction will just disappear altogether in the second it may disappear or you may see both the payment and the refund on your statement   can be as fast as an authorization but once a transaction has started settlement it ca n't be voided any more   sending money back a refund goes through the same settlement process as above and can take just as long so to specifically apply that to your question you get the sms when the transaction is authorized even though no money has yet moved   the refund money wo n't show up until several days after someone indicates that it should happen and there 's no reverse authorize operation to let you or your bank know that it 's coming

what interests me in the article is the way california seems to be quite happy to be losing people who pay taxes because the state can so easily attract new warm bodies what happens to a state when there is no incentive to retain its people    it struck a cord with me because i 've been reading about the history of mining if an industry can always bring in newer poorer people conditions for those working in that industry will never rise in mining conditions can be so bad that you can almost think of it as if the workers are expendable working conditions can be so bad that many die each year and nobody seems to care because if one group of workers gets a little management simply starts importing them from another country    you can disagree but i see a parallel with california sure one is an industry and one is a country but this is a state that seems more than the rest of the country to depend on cheap mexican labor as mexico stopped breeding people for export california begin to simply import new slave labor from or any other place that still exports people as though they were only cattle of course this makes it difficult for those who came in an earlier wave to improve quality of life in fact life gets harder and just look at what happened to the world class famous free public education in california yeah distant memory now    i also wonder if allowing california to ignore national immigration law is good for the rest of the nation what about this quote   also more than 30 of the nation ’s welfare recipients are californians even though california has just 12 of the nation ’s population   it is not surprising therefore that california is ranked number one in poverty   california has so many electoral votes that i do n't expect to see them prosecuted by the federal government like az no matter what they do the state is too big to piss off but it is becoming a cancer to the rest of the nation

as someone who 's currently shopping for some winter wheels and has the raised blood pressure to go with that i 've got a few suggestions as to what would make me pick up the phone and call your or email you if you 're advertising a vehicle keep in mind that if you 're willing to deal with the additional hassle you 'll normally get the most money for a used car if you sell it privately if it is worth the additional effort though is both a matter of judgement and if you 're willing to put up with strange people like me depending on the value of the vehicle and its rarity desirability you 're looking at newspaper ads probably wo n't get you much of a response these days craigslist and similar and last but not least ebay if you 're trying to sell something that 's easy to find because there are five at every street corner think minivan skip ebay if it 's worth below i would n't bother with places where you have to pay to advertise which leaves cl for the cheap stuff that said i 'd still stick it on cl if it 's advertised in other places heck it 's free after all the figure out what sort of money you 're asking for check the resources like and have a look at your local cl for similar vehicles out here certain types of vehicles for example sell quickly and often above even a little market research will help you come up with a good price just do n't do things like asking a massively inflated price for a vehicle because you paid $ x five years ago all this shows that you have no idea what your vehicle is worth oh and i 'd always work out what the minimum i 'd take is leave yourself some haggle room but do n't the vehicle once you know where you advertise and for how much pull together the basic facts for your vehicles and the points that would make it stand out basic facts about the car should include engine size type of transmission if it 's awd where applicable mileage color i can see on the pictures but it 's nice to include that too if you have service records recently replaced a big ticket item think transmission or similar or had a very recent service especially a big one where you had a timing belt and changed mention it do n't say the vehicle has a new engine if that was put in 100k miles ago that 's nice to mention but it 's not new if nobody 's ever smoked in it mention it if it 's got other outstanding features super low mileage summer only use etc make sure to mention it that too next if it 's got any faults that you know of especially obvious ones disclose them people like me will most likely find the leaking shock and the rust holes in the floor anyway and it makes a much better impression if you do tell us about them beforehand trying to tell someone that your banana shaped car that looks like the blue man group used it for practise is actually pristine and accident free is n't going to go down very well next pull together the paperwork make sure you 've got the title if there is a lien on the title check with the lienholder before advertising the car so you know their procedure for releasing the title any maintenance records you have manuals receipts etc if the vehicle has a salvage title try to find out why and mention it in the ad i 've just had a comedian phone me while i was driving to see his vehicle and leave a message that he did n't have a title and did n't seem to be willing to bother to get one either obviously that put me in the right frame of mind given that it was a 200 mile round trip so do n't do it if you ca n't get a title the schmuck you sold it to will have even less of a chance of getting one and given that you are in california a lot of people including myself react really badly to three years worth of back registration missing expired registrations on something i 'd expect to test drive etc essentially anything that would stop a potential cash buyer to drive it away on the spot next clean the car you know the five years of accumulated mcd and inch thick layer of dirt i 'm only partially kidding i 've seem some pretty horrible stuff recently spend the two hours it takes to clean it or pay to have it or detailed clean shiny cars sell a lot better than a rolling recycling container oh and last make the effort take some decent photos the more the shot in daylight no a black car after sunset and if there is any damage an additional photo or two showing the damage would be nice stick the on or similar and put the links in your craigslist ad so you do n't restrict yourself to the photos that you normally get on there as to payment i 'd either take cash meet the buyer at his bank where he draws out a cashiers check in front of your eyes or well cash no deeds on bridges in brooklyn or anything else be prepared to take a deposit a lot of buyers are n't willing to wander around with ten large ones in the back pocket to go look at a car and spell out exactly how long the deposit is good for i also tend to make them non refundable buyer does n't pick up the car within the negotiated timeframe you keep the deposit as damages for not being able to sell it to another cash buyer check your dmv 's website as to what exactly you need to do once you sold the car here in nevada it 's the buyer 's problem on how to move it as you keep the plates but i know in california the regular plates not personal ones iirc stay with the vehicle and i think you need to inform the dmv that you sold the vehicle i 'd also keep a record of who i sold a vehicle to name address from his drivers license license number etc just in case they run a few red lights and accumulate a few worth of parking tickets

its definitely not a stupid question the average american has absolutely no idea how this process works i know this might be annoying but i 'm answering without 100 certainty    the fed would increase the money supply by buying back government bonds this increased demand for bonds would raise their price and therefore lower the interest return that they deliver since u.s. treasury bonds are considered to be the very safest possible investment their rate is the risk free rate upon which all other rates are based so if the government buys billions of these bonds that much money ends up in the hands of whoever sold them these sellers are the large financial organizations that hold all of our money banks and large investment vehicles now since bond rates are lower they have an incentive to put that money somewhere else it goes into stocks and investment in business ventures    i 'm less certain about how this turns into inflation that consumers will recognize the short answer is that there is only a finite number of goods and services for us to buy if the amount of money increases and there are still the same number of goods and services the prices will increase slightly    your question about printing money to pay off debts is too complex for me to answer i know that the inflation dynamic does play a role it makes debts easier to pay off in the future than they seem right now however causing massive inflation to pay off debts brings a lot of other problems

dividends are one way to discriminate between companies to invest in in the best of all worlds your investment criteria is simple invest in whatever makes me the most money on the timeline i want to have it   if you just follow that one golden rule your future financial needs will be taken care of oh you 're not 100 proof positive certain which investment is best for you   good   you 're mortal   none of us magically know the best investment for us   we wing it based on what information we can glean   for instance we know that bonds tend to be safer than stocks but with a lower return so if something calls itself a bond we treat it differently than we treat a stock so what sorts of information do we have   well think of the stock market   a dividend is one way for a company to communicate with their stockholders in the best way possible their   there 's some generally agreed upon behaviors dividends have such as they do n't go down without some good reason for it like a global recession or a plan to acquire another company that is well accepted by the stockholders   if a company starts to talk in this language people expect them to behave a certain way   if they do n't the stock gets fast   a dividend itself is n't a big deal but a dividend which is n't shunned by a lot of smart investors that can be a big deal a dividend is a promise which can be broken of course to cash out some of the company 's profits to its shareholders   its probably one of the older tools out there you give investors a share of the profits is pretty tried and true   it worked for many types of companies   if you see a dividend especially one which has been reliable for many years you can presume something about the type of company they are other companies find dividend is a poor tool to accomplish their goals   that does n't mean they 're better or worse simply different   they 're approaching the problem differently   is that kind of different the kind you want in your books   maybe   companies which are n't choosing to commit a portion of their profits to shareholders are typically playing a more aggressive game   are you comfortable that you can keep up with how they 're using your money and make sure its in your interests   it can be harder in these companies where you simply hold a piece of paper and never get anything from them again

i asked a followup question on the islam site the issue with islam seems to be that exchanging money for other money is roughly speaking usury there are different opinions but it seems that in general exchanging money for something else is fine but exchanging money for other money is forbidden the of either the things or the money is not relevant though again opinions may differ it 's allowed to buy a piece of software for download even though nothing physical is ever bought speculating on currency is therefore forbidden and that 's true whether or not a pile of banknotes gets moved around at any point but that 's my interpretation of what was said on the islam site i 'm sure they would answer more detailed questions

tl;dr i think you can find a much better deal doing a refi will cost you some amount of money   however a 2.5 fee top of closing costs seems really high   you can get a quote from quicken loans pretty quick and compare their fee   also i would check with a local bank preferably one you already do business with   the 2.5 is probably their commission for originating the loan   if you are in the southeast i have had great luck with regions bank   they are large enough but also small enough   please know that i have no affiliation with either company btw the rate also seems high   doing a quick search of bank rate it seems you can get 3.25 with zero fee as of this writing   the worse deal they show is with a .75 fee much better than you were quoted if you can afford it i would also encourage you to think outside the box   a client of mine was able to obtain a home equity loan not line of credit to replace their mortgage   they went for a 7 year pay off with the loan in first position at a rate about .75 below the then current 15 year rate   the key was there was zero closing costs   it saved them quite a bit of money also look at a 10 year fixed   it might not be much more than you are paying now

recovering after a card number has been stolen is a nuisance you need to wade through determining which charges are and are n't legit update the records of anyone who legitimately has your card on file not have the card available until the replacement reaches you   etc and you may be on the hook for the first $ 50 of the loss if i remember correctly unless as mentioned the bank that plus the risk that the card could be the first step in a larger identity theft attempt and not everyone is so about the bank losing money those costs get passed on to us remember and some of us actually respect our banks or credit unions certainly cards come with some consumer protection otherwise nobody who thought about this would want to use them but it 's still worth exercising reasonable care to keep the problem from arising

all investors of equal standing get the same proportion of the net assets on bankruptcy but not all shareholders are of equal standing in general once all liabilities are covered bond holders are paid first as that type of investment is company debt then preferred stock holders are paid out and then common shareholders this is the reason why preferred stock is usually cheaper it is less risky as it has a higher claim to assets and therefore commands a lower risk premium the exact payout schedule is very corporation dependent so needs research on a per firm basis

platinum use is pretty heavily overweight in industrial areas according to the linked wikipedia article tonnes of platinum was sold in 2006 of which 130 tonnes went to vehicles emissions control devices and another tonnes to electronics gold sees substantial use as an investment as well as to hedge against economical decline and inflation with comparatively little industrial real world as some put it use that is their principal difference from an investment point of view according to wikipedia 's article on platinum during periods of economic uncertainty the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand falling below the price of gold gold prices are more stable in slow economic times as gold is considered a safe haven and gold demand is not driven by industrial uses if your investment scenario is a tanking world economy for reason of its large industrial usage i for one would not count on platinum to not fall in price of course gold may fall in price as well but since it is not primarily an industrial use commodity i would personally expect gold to do better in such a scenario

in short i suggest you take a look at your w-4 form and adjust it properly and yes you can claim your self as a dependent unless someone else is claiming you but here is a more detailed explanation of how it works how income tax works while most people tend to only think about the tax system and the internal revenue service irs as the month of april approaches it 's actually a never ending process for our purposes a good way to explain how the system works is to give an example of one american income earner we will call him joe the tax process begins when joe starts his new job he and his employer agree on his compensation which will be figured into his gross income at the end of the year one of the first things he has to do when he 's hired is fill out all of his tax forms including a w-4 form the w-4 form lists all of joe 's withholding allowance information such as his number of dependents and child care expenses the information on this form tells your employer just how much money it needs to withhold from your paycheck for federal income tax the irs says that you should check this form each year as your tax situation may change from year to year once joe is hired and given a salary he can estimate how much he will pay in taxes for the year here 's the formula at the end of each pay period joe 's company takes the withheld money along with all of withheld tax money from all of its employees and deposits the money in a federal reserve bank this is how the government maintains a steady stream of income while also drawing interest on your tax dollars toward the end of the tax year joe 's company has to send him a w-2 form in the mail this happens by january 31 this form details how much money joe made during the last year and how much federal tax was withheld from his income this information can also be found on joe 's last paycheck of the year but he 'll need to send the w-2 to the irs for processing purposes at some point between the time joe receives his w-2 and april 15 joe will have to fill out and return his taxes to one of the irs service and processing centers once the irs receives joe 's tax returns an irs employee keys in every piece of information on joe 's tax forms this information is then stored in large magnetic tape machines if joe is due a tax refund he is sent a check in the mail in the next few weeks if joe uses e file or his refund can be direct deposited into his bank account

to qualify as a woman owned business a woman or group of women must own shares worth 51 of the business if your investor was a woman the entire 5 could come from her share of the company without affecting the 51 ownership requirement could you find a woman to add as an investor if you each had your shares diluted 5 she would be down to ownership and you would be down to ownership the only way for you to get back to a 51 female ownership situation would be to give a ownership stake from your share to a wife sister mom girlfriend or any other woman who you think should benefit from this arrangement this would still put you down at 44 effectively taking the whole 5 from you but by giving some of your share to someone else it does require your partner to make some of the sacrifice while still benefiting someone you care about if you have someone you would like to give that benefit to in summary this is what it would look like

when you buy a bond you 're giving a loan to the issuer the interest rate on the bond is the interest rate on the loan usually and this is also the case with the treasury bonds the rate is fixed for the term of the loan thus if the market rate for similar loans a year later is higher the rate for the loan you gave remains the same

gt there may not be anything shameful about doing that but that scenario is indeed a business people do not shutter a profitable successful business and then go to work for someone else   not necessarily   it may very well be a planned exit not all businesses will nor should they be expected to or planned to endure into perpetuity just because the corporate charter sets no specific limit to the duration of the corporate entity does not mean that it is and certainly not that it needs to be   and a business that may be quite profitable to run even if it 's final pre closing year is less so is not necessarily a failure in fact closing an operation down while it is still slightly profitable and before it begins losing money and/or selling it 's assets off while they still have substantial investment value may in fact be the wisest move especially financially speaking which counts as anything but a failure   plus there are several industries where a temporary existence of a firm is recognized as a positive thing take films as an example a new company with a pre planned limited lifespan will often be formed to craft and produce the film and cease to exist once that task has been completed   and i think the hand wringing about restaurants is especially if ever there was is a business niche that was subject to fad amp fashion and the even nature of people 's tastes it would be the boutique segment of the restaurant industry even the ones or chains that do manage to survive often do so by dramatically changing their menus brand amp character so that a decade later they barely resemble their former selves   sure there are also other segments of the industry that are generally stable but many of them tend to be slow or no growth as well   gt;i believe a key contributor to the confusion is talking about the self employed and business owners in the same breath someone who 's self employed basically owns a job his income will always be directly proportional to the amount of time spent working and the company does not exist apart from himself    it covers an entire spectrum and the lines are rather fuzzy   yes a lot of self employed people whether configured as sole proprietorships partnerships llc 's or full corporations are by intent and probably always will be simply job replacement businesses and again there is nothing wrong with that whether they endure for a year 5 years 10 years or an entire lifetime how or why people have come to view this as somehow of less merit than someone being gainfully employed for someone else has always puzzled me   but some of those just as some of the part time or on the side businesses can take on an unexpected unplanned life of their own and grow into substantial enterprises that employ hundreds and even thousands of people over multiple decades after the fact the owners will often at least publicly claim that it was all part of the plan but in several cases where i know the founder owner personally i know from private conversation that that simply was n't the case   gt;a business owner on the other hand has processes equipment staff ip in place that generates income whether or not she gets out of bed in the morning   you are speaking of someone who has achieved a certain level of success and a certain size of operations   gt;these are different people with different goals and can not be lumped into the same demographic block   any and all blocks are going to be subjective and in a very real sense the dividing lines placed at rather arbitrary segments a particular named block will be very true from one point of view with lots of things that correlate and appear to be uniformly applicable and yet fallacious from another where there is again a whole spectrum of distinctions

let me answer by parts when a company gives dividends the share price drops by the dividend amount   not always by that exact amount for many different reasons e.g. there are transaction costs if you reinvest dividend taxes etc i have tested that empirically now if all the shareholders choose to reinvest their dividends will the share price go back up to what it was prior to the dividend that is an interesting question the final theoretical price of the company does not need to be that when a company distributes dividends its liquidity diminish there is an impact on the balance sheet of the company if all investors go to the secondary market and reinvest the dividends in the shares that does not restore the cash in the balance sheet of the company hence the theoretical real value of the company is different before the dividends of course in practice there is not such a thing as one theoretical value in reality if everybody reinvest the dividend that will put upward pressure over the price of the company and depending on the depth of the offers meaning how many orders will counterbalance the upward pressure at the moment the final price will be determined which can be higher or lower than before not necessarily equal i ask because some like spy automatically reinvest dividends so what is the effect of this reinvestment on the stock price let us see the mechanics of these purchases when a non distributing etf receives cash from the dividends of the companies it takes that cash and reinvest it in the whole basket of stocks that compose the index not just in the companies that provided the dividends the net effect of that is a small leverage effect let us say you bought one unit of spy and during the whole year the shares pay 2 of dividends that are reinvested at the end of that year it will be equivalent to having 1.02 units of spy

craig touched on it but let me expand on the point deposits by definition are withheld at your marginal rate and since you can choose roth vs traditional right till filing time you know with certainty the rate you are at each year   absent any other retirement income i.e. no pension and absent an incredibly major change to our tax code i know your starting rate zero the first $ 10 k or so per person is part of their standard deduction and exemption for a couple the next $ 18k is taxed at 10 and so on let me stop here to expand this important point this is $ for the couple and the tax on it is less than $ 1900 5 there is no 5 bracket of course it 's the first $ 20 k with zero tax and that first $ 18,000 taxed at 10 that $ takes nearly $ 1 m in pretax accounts to offer as an annual withdrawal the 15 bracket starts after this and applies to the next $ 57 k of withdrawals each year over $ 95 k in gross withdrawals of pretax money and you still are n't in the 25 bracket   this is why 100 in traditional or 100 in roth are n't either ideal i continue to offer the example i consider more optimizing using roth for income that would otherwise be taxed at 15 but going pretax when you hit 25 then at retirement you withdraw enough traditional to just stay at 10 or 15 and roth for the rest   it would be a shame to retire 100 roth and realize you paid 25 but now have no income to use up those lower brackets   oddly time value of money is n't part of my analysis it makes no difference and note the exact numbers do change a bit each year for inflation there 's a also a good chance the exemptions goes away in favor of a huge increased standard deduction

dude you are totally moving the goal posts first of all the fact that you had to crawl through my comment history and came up with a completely unrelated response rather than addressing my point is pretty pathetic and a pretty common behavior who are wrong and do n't want to admit it i do n't hate california i think it 's overrated and i think it 's overrated because what you get is n't worth what you pay that is n't being biased it 's cause and effect if it did n't cost 3x as much to live in california as anywhere else i would like it a lot more   and the math does n't work out you in your original comment said the typical salary is now that you have been proven wrong you are now claiming it 's 200k+ that is n't the math working out that 's distorting reality until it lines up with your preconceived notions   and now you are restricting nature to mountains since apparently anything that is n't red river is hills and therefore not worth anything again moving the goalposts and even if your idea of things to do in nature means i like in the mountains exclusively you would be much better off in places like utah than california   repeatedly saying i 've done the math i 've been offered a job does n't mean anything when i 've already shown you the math does n't work out and i too have been offered a 6 figure job in sf   i 'm clearly not the one that 's biased you are look if you have built up california into some mythical place so sacred that you are so clearly willing to do mental gymnastics you are demonstrating in order to make reality conform with your personal notions great but for everyone else the math as in actual math not changing the numbers around until it makes sense does nt work out

hi u   short answer yes you do have to pay taxes in israel for all your   long answer all countries within the consider you as a fiscal resident in the country where you spend over half a year in 183 days and up if you do not spend that much time in any country there are other tying measures to avoid people not being fiscal residents in any country   since you are living in israel you will have to pay all your generated income in israel following the tax regulation that is in place there i am no tax lawyer so i can not help you there   having a lot of business internationally brings other headaches with it taking for example the u.s. there is a possibility that they taxes in their payments it is unlikely though as they have a tax treaty to prevent double taxation you can ask for this money to be returned from the u.s. or other countries through each country 's internal process   another thing to take into account is that you can be taxed in other countries for any revenue you generate in said country this is especially relevant for revenue that comes from real estate the country where the real estate is will tax you in the country and you will have to deduct these taxes paid in your country israel in this case if there is no tax treaty you might possibly be paying twice   i know you said you do promotion but i have to warn you about this because i ignore what other countries tax or do not tax so been giving more info wo n't hurt   if the us is the main and/or only country you will be doing business with i strongly recommend you real the tax treaty with lots of love and patience you can find it here or here   treaty amendment   if you are from israel and prefer it in here are the treaties in your language   treaty amendment    normally most irs departments have sections with very help on these sort of matters i 'd you to take a look at yours    last what i 've explained is the normal process that applies almost all over the world but each country has their own distinctions and you need to look carefully take what i said as a starting point and do your own research or ideally try to find a tax consultant lawyer who helps you   best of luck

i do n't disagree that many times psychologists can or even present fabricated claims about human behavior only in an effort to rack in some extra money    however any close to normal person can see that there are a whole lot of people with serious issues that nobody mentions to them or they themselves are afraid to acknowledge because they do n't want to deal with all of the drama    anyway let 's see how legitimate the 25 of americans suffer from mental illness claim is     newsroom    a new national report reveals that million american adults aged 18 or older or 20 percent of this age group experienced mental illness in the past year     2   hen applied to the 2004 u.s. census residential population estimate for ages 18 and older this figure translates to million though mental disorders are widespread in the population the main burden of illness is concentrated in a much smaller proportion about 6 percent or 1 in 17 who suffer from a serious mental illness    you can find countless studies like this online    now obviously somebody is thinking about pointing out at this point that all of these studies were conducted by psychologists or only trying to validate their initial claims and ultimately for economic benefit and well if you that 's your argument then yes you are absolutely right that there is absolutely no way prove that the 25 statistic is correct    and just to be clear the term mental illness in this to the above studies is really anything from anxiety to depression to personality disorders and even more social things like compulsive lying obviously the definition is very broad and that is precisely why the is so shocking

the definition of market cap is exactly shares share price so something is wrong here it seems that the share price is expressed in pence rather pounds there 's a note at the bottom currency in gbp note the p rather than p so the share price of is actually i.e. £ however it 's not really clear just from the which figures are in pence and which are actually in pounds it seems that the market cap is in pounds but the enterprise value is in pence given that billion is about the right value in pounds whereas billion only really makes sense if expressed in pence it looks like they actually got the enterprise value wrong by a factor of 100 perhaps their calculation treated the share price as being denominated in pounds rather than pence

i was wondering why equity is reflecting ownership of the issuing entity   that is the definition of equity in this regard my understanding is that for a stock equity its issuing entity is a company firm that sells the stock equity while its receiving entity is an investor that buys the stock equity correct equity reflects ownership of the receiving entity i.e. investor incorrect equity reflects ownership by the receiving entity of the issuing entity that is when you buy stock in a company taking an equity stake in the company you buy a piece of the company   it would be rather odd for the company to own a piece of you when you buy their stock

reading stuff like this makes me want to go into the debt collection business just send letters to random people demanding money sounds like an easy way to make a living what 's your name and address just kidding if they are sending stuff to a virginia po box close the box with no forwarding address and consider it case closed if they are you personally in new hampshire the best thing to do is to sue proactively before it goes to collection new hampshire has strict anti debt collection laws basically what you do is go to small claims court and fill out a one page form sue them for $ 2000 $ 3000 or whatever is convenient do not hire a lawyer you can do this in 2 hours of your own time your grounds are 1 violation of the creditor of nh laws according to the laws the creditor has to put all kinds of specific stuff in their threat letters since they are not doing this they have violated nh read the so you know which specific items they are violating 2 extortion since you do not owe them any money demanding money from you is extortion which is both criminally and actionable you sue them for mental anguish due to extortion   the validity of your claims is irrelevant you just need to get them in court there are two possibilities a they fail to show up in this case you win and they owe you $ 3000 or whatever not only that if they later try to collect from you send a copy of the judgement to the credit bureau or collector or whatever and that is proof you owe them no money b they hire some local lawyer who appears accept the court 's offer for arbitration when you go into arbitration with the lawyer tell him you will drop the lawsuit if they send you a check for $ 500 and a hand written guarantee from him that you will never hear from his client again either way you come out ahead by the way it is absolutely guaranteed that the enemy lawyer will accept your offer in b above because the seo company is already paying him $ 5000 to show up to answer your lawsuit and the lawyer does not want to hang around all morning in court waiting for the case to be heard if he can get out of there in half an hour for only $ 500 he will do it if all you are getting is calls and the caller refuses to identify then it is definitely an illegal scam it is illegal in new hampshire to make collection calls and refuse to full identify who is calling the phone company has methods for dealing with illegal calls first you have to file a police report then you call verizon security at 1 800 or whatever your phone company is they will trace the call and identify the caller they you can make a criminal complaint in their jurisdiction unless the call is from pakistan or something

does it make sense for stocks to earn a premium indefinitely yes there is good reason to think that the stock market will make money indefinitely the stock market is the primary mechanism through which investors bear market risk which requires compensation   if you think of all the owners of firms stockholders and bondholders generally the risk premium that stocks earn stocks is the way bondholders pay equityholders to bear the risk that they do not wish to will stock prices always go up in the long run as long as companies pay out less in dividends than their profit prices will go up   that could change if we were to change our corporate culture and/or tax practices so that firms paid out more in dividends   however for the purposes of your question i think it does n't matter much whether the investor makes money as dividends or capital gains does the 5 7 guess apply only to the us market i did n't write nor read the books in question but most likely that is a global number   the us dominates the global equity market so it 's often a good proxy   however international returns taken together have no less risk and earn no less over long horizons in general   the particular examples you have pointed out are special cases that only apply to a part of the global economy and a particular time period   there are plenty of examples of stock markets and time periods that did much better than the us market to offset your examples is 5 7 a reasonable long term estimate of equity returns equity will always earn more in expectation than risk free securities will   how much more depends on major economic factors   5 7 has been a good estimate for the market risk premium for many many decades stocks should earn this plus whatever the risk free rate is   however that is just an empirical observation not a rule   it can change   some day technological progress could slow down or stop we could run out of important resources in a way that we ca n't compensate for our population permanently could stop growing aliens could invade etc   down the road it is certainly possible for expected equity returns to go down and never go back up again   this would result from a permanent global economic shift that i think would be pretty obvious   that is you would n't have to look at stock prices to know it was happening

a bank or credit card agency can deny your application for pretty much any reason that said it 's extremely unlikely they 'd do so for a secured credit card this is because the credit is secured if your sister is to get a card with say a $ 1000 limit she will have to provide $ 1000 in security this means the banks risk practically nothing that said i have found one reference that claims you need a score of above 600 to qualify for a secured credit card though this is hard to believe secured credit cards are a reasonable way of building your credit back up just about the only other way for her credit rating to improve is for her history of bad debt to fall off the credit report but that 's going to take quite some time she should be working hard to provide positive credit history to replace the old negative history assuming her credit rating is important to her it may not be it 's only important if she plans on taking on debt in the future honestly a credit rating of around 500 is so bad that i would n't even worry much about lowering it it 's already low enough as to make it all but impossible to qualify for unsecured credit or loans a single denial is unlikely to significantly affect the score except in the very short term with two bankruptcies i encourage credit counselling for your sister there are a number of good books available too credit counselling should go into detail on credit scores unsecured credit proper budgeting and all that sort of useful information

i would not be concerned about the impact to your credit rating   you already have an excellent credit score and the temporary change to your utilization will have minimal impact to your score if you really need to make this $ 2500 purchase and you have the money in the bank to pay for it i would not recommend borrowing this money   only put it on the credit card if you plan on paying it off in full without paying interest let me ask you this why do you want to keep this $ 2500 in the bank   it certainly is n't earning you anything significant   my guess is that you 'd like to keep it there for an emergency   well is this $ 2500 purchase an emergency   if it is necessary then spend the money   if not then save up the money until you have enough to make the purchase   it does n't make sense to keep money for an emergency in the bank but then when one comes up to leave the money in the bank and pay interest on your emergency purchase if you make this emergency purchase and another emergency comes up you can always if necessary borrow the money at that time   it does n't make sense to borrow money before you need it that having been said i would encourage you to build up your emergency fund so that you have enough money in there to handle things like this without completely depleting your savings account   3 to 6 months of expenses is the general recommendation for your emergency fund   then if something unplanned comes up you 'll have the money in the bank without having to borrow and pay interest

in a rational market the market caps total value of all shares of the company should be determined by the expected future profits of the company plus the book value that is the value of all assets that the company holds the share price is then calculated as market caps divided by number of shares a company worth a billion dollar could have a million shares at $ 1000 each or a billion shares at $ 1 each or anything in between   when profits drop every investor has to re think what the expected future profits of the company are if all the investors say i thought this company would make a billion profit in the next ten years but based on the drop in profits i changed my mind and i think they will only make 500 million then the share price drops on the other hand if profits dropped because of some predictable event then that drop was already priced into the share price if the profits dropped less than expected the share price might even go up   you can see the opposite effect share price might be very high because everyone expects huge growth in profits over the next ten years if profits grow less than expected the share price will drop share price depends on predicted future profits not on profits today

the schufa explicitly says on their website that their scoring system is a secret however if your goal is to be credit worthy for example to get financing for a house or a car or whatever just pay any loans and your credit card back on time and you 'll be fine there is no need to build a credit history i just got a mortgage on a new house without any real credit history i have one credit card which i only use on vacations because some countries do n't take my debit card and i always put money on it before i use it so i 've technically never borrowed money from a bank at all my banker looked at my schufa with me and we saw that there was nothing in there except for the credit card which has a 500 € limit and if i maxed it out the monthly interest would be € so he added that € to my expenses calculation and that was it if you 're having trouble getting a loan and you do n't know why you can ask the schufa for the data they have on you and you can correct any mistakes they might have made sometimes especially when you have the same full name and birth date as somebody else the schufa does get things mixed up and you have to sort it out

well the only way you can actually legally do a bond issuance is through a broker dealer in order to register and actually sell the securities to outside investors you need a registered representative at a registered broker dealer this falls under blue sky laws you legally have to have one   also why would you prefer to issue i mean public debt offerings are massive hence why i said unless no one is pitching you why do it for example as a first time issuer you would have to register with the sec every state you plan to issue in submit historical audited financials comply with sox and other accounting filings bring in due diligence go on etc this stuff costs a lot of time and money    for example since you 've never issued before if you 're cooking the books and the bankers do n't catch it they can be legally liable for fraud   also how much are you even trying to raise

no spdr etfs are not a good fit for a novice investor with a low level of financial literacy   in fact there is no investment that is safe for an absolute beginner not even a savings account   an absolute beginner could easily overdraw his savings account leading to fees and collections i would say that an investment becomes a good fit for an investor as soon as said investor understands how the investment works   a savings account at a bank or credit union is fairly easy to understand and is therefore a suitable place to hold money after a few hours to a day of research   even after 0 hours of research however a savings account is still better than a sock drawer money market accounts through a bank certificates of deposit through a bank and money market mutual funds through a mutual fund provider are probably the next easiest thing to understand   this could take a few hours to a few weeks of research depending on the learner equities corporate bonds and government bonds are another step up in complexity and could take weeks or months of schooling to understand well enough to try   equity or bond mutual funds or the etf versions of those which is what you asked about are another level after that also important to understand along the way are the financial institutions and market infrastructure that exist to provide these products   banks credit unions public corporations brokerages stock exchanges bond exchanges mutual fund providers etf providers etc

it depends solely on the risk your willing to take for example few years back one of the leading banks in my country was offering 25 interest rate for 5 year fixed deposits and the lending rate in the market was around 12 so people borrowed money from other banks and invested in the high return fixed deposits after 6 months the bank filed for bankruptcy and people lost their money later investigations revealed that abnormal high return was offered because the bank had a major liquidity problem so all depends on the risk associated with return on your investment higher the risk higher the return

you can take out the contributions to your roth tax and penalty free   that 's the good thing anything above the amount you contributed that you withdraw early will cost you ordinary income tax which is higher than capital gains tax plus a 10 percent penalty on that amount so if you have $ 15,000 in the account and $ 5,000 is gains and you withdraw $ 11,000 then you owe tax and penalty on $ 1,000   the penalty is 10 and your taxes high taxes are added to that   pretty bad deal if you kept it in a normal account and paid capital gains tax you just pay 15 or whatever on your gains and you get to offset income tax with your losses via tax loss harvesting so back to your question your idea works even better than you suggested if you only withdraw up to the amount that you contributed you pay no tax   take out any of the gains and you will be penalized more than you would if you just paid capital gains on them   leave those in until you are old enough to take them out penalty and tax free to me contributing to a roth making a bunch of gains on it and withdrawing only the contribution part whenever you want seems to make good sense

first i would like to say do not pay credit card companies in an attempt to improve your credit rating in my opinion it 's not worth the cash and not fair for the consumer there are many great resources online that give advice on how to improve your credit score you can even simulate what would happen to your score if you did this credit karma will give you your transunion credit score for free and offers a simulation calculator if you only have one credit card i would start off by applying for another simply because   $ 700 is such a small limit and to pay a $ 30 annual fee seems outrageous try applying with the bank where you hold your savings or checking account they are more likely to approve your application since they have a working relationship with you all in all i would not go out of my way and spend money i would not have spent otherwise just to increase my credit score to me this practice is counter intuitive you are allowed a free credit report from each bureau once annually you can get this from this wo n't include your credit score but it will let you see what banks see when they run your credit report in addition you should check it over for any errors or possible identity theft if there are errors you need to file a claim with the credit agency immediately edit from with 3 agencies to choose from you can alternate during the year to pull a different report every 4 months a couple every 2 here are some resources you can read up on improve your fico credit score top 5 credit misconceptions   9 fast fixes for your credit scores

fuck it we 'll do it live gt smart investors do n't time markets if they miss a wave they search for the next one and get themselves in position why this is hard for most investors is because buying what is not popular is frightening to them investors are like sheep going along with the crowd or their greed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their profits and moved on wise investors buy an investment when it 's not popular they know their profits are made when they buy not when they sell they wait patiently as i said they do not time the market just like a they get in position for the next big swell gt gt it 's all insider trading there are forms of insider trading that are illegal and there are forms of insider trading that are legal but either way it 's insider trading the only distinction is how far away from the inside are you the reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the inside is because that is where the money is made it 's made on information you want to hear about the next boom get in and get out before the next bust i 'm not saying do it illegally but the sooner you know the better your chances are for profits with minimal risk that is what friends are for and that is financial intelligence   those are the paragraphs i 'm talking about

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

it all has to do with risk and reward the risk is that interest rates will rise   to entice you to go with the variable they make it so it is cheaper if interest rates never rise your job is to guess whether interest rates are likely to go up or not in a first approximation you should go fixed the bank employs very smart people whose entire job is to know whether interest rates will go up or not those people chose the price difference between the two and it 's sure to favour the bank that is the risk of extra payments you 'll make on the variable is probably more than the but some people ca n't sleep at night if their payments or more realistically the interest part of their payments might double if that 's you go fixed if that 's not you understand that the actually has to be turned up a bit to get more people to go variable because of the sleeping at night feature think long and hard about your budget and what would happen if your payment jumped if you could handle it variable might be the better choice personally i have been taking variable on my mortgage for decades and now i do n't have one and never once regretted it i also my oldest child to take variable on her mortgage over this century so far if rates up they did n't tick up to the level the fixed was offered at mostly they have sat flat but if ever there was a world in which past performance does not predict future results it would be interest rate trends do your own research

the justification for an act typically comes after the decision is made people operate under a fairly universal set of instincts and social behaviors so i think condemning him for this behavior directly is short sighted    i would ask instead why do people feel that cheating organizations like target is so emotionally easy i would wager that is not the sort of person who would steal his neighbors unlocked bike from his porch or hustle a man for bus fare so what is different   we seem generally as a population to have less emotional investment in strangers than ourselves even less in people from other cultures and even less in animals we will fight hard to save the lives of 5000 of our soldiers less hard to save a million of their and we certainly do n't give a fuck about taking a bee 's honey or killing a chicken and eating it again generally    i would propose that organizations like big box stores fall somewhere between animals and foreign peasants as far as our feelings of responsibility towards them it is a little more complicated than that because obviously a big box store supports the lives of a certain number of people but if a big box store were delicious and did not support people i would wager it would not survive for very long   so the defining difference seems to be whether or not you are a person who makes a rational decision that the store provides more good for your people or if it is a net harmful force whether you have strong ingrained emotional belief structures regarding cheating or and whether your rational mind your emotional decision making mine rarely does though i try   a person who thinks that they do more harm to the population than good even with a strong sense of the of stealing might steal from the store even though they would never steal from another person they would be completely morally justified in this act   similarly a person who thinks that the store does more good than harm and does not steal from the store regardless of whether or not they think stealing is wrong would also be morally just in their actions    a person who thinks they do no harm to the community but has no negative emotional connection to the act of theft might steal from both the store and their neighbor they would obviously not be justified   a person with a strong sense of the of stealing which their rational decision regarding the value of a big box store will not steal but they may not be morally justified in the decision depending on their rational take   i think i fall into the first category i think it is wrong not to do harm to an organization like target when it is possible to do so yet i generally do n't go about this by stealing because getting caught would be much worse than whatever harm i could do by jacking a few dollars worth of merchandise this offer allowed a means of theft without getting caught and had i been aware of it i probably would have availed myself of it   as it stands i just work extremely hard in the field of with the hopes that one day i will contribute to technologies which will allow humans to live and thrive without having to buy food clothes medicine or shit from target

why would it not make more sense to invest in a handful of these    instead of also having to carry the weight of the other    450 some of which are mostly just baggage first a cap weighted index fund will invest more heavily in larger cap companies so the baggage you speak of does take up a smaller percentage of the portfolio 's value not that cap always equates to better performance there are also equal weighted index funds where each company in the index is given equal weight in the portfolio if you could accurately pick winners and losers then of course you could beat index funds but on average they 've performed well enough that there 's little incentive for the average investor to look elsewhere   a handful of stocks opens you up to more risk an enron in your handful would be pretty devastating if it comprised a large percentage of your portfolio additionally since you pay a fee on each transaction $ 5 in your example you have to out perform a low fee index fund significantly or be investing a very large amount of money to come out ahead you get diversification and low fees with an index fund

as to where the interest comes from the same place it comes from in other kinds of savings accounts the bank takes the money you deposit and invests it elsewhere traditionally by lending it out to others hence the concept of a savings and loan bank they make a profit as long as the interest they give for borrowing from you plus the cost of administering the savings accounts and loans is less than the interest they charge for lending to others no they do n't have to pay you interest but if they did n't you 'd be likely to deposit your funds at another bank which did their ideal goal is to pay as little as possible without losing depositors while charging as much as possible without losing borrowers yeah i know typo corrected why do they get higher interest rate than they pay you mostly because your deposits and interest are essentially guaranteed whereas the folks they 're lending to may be late paying or default on those loans as with any kind of investment higher return requires more work and/or higher risk plus larger reserves so you can afford to ride out any losses that do occur

you can do this with no problem what you want is a direct transfer style of rollover this is simply where the money is transferred from your 401(k custodian directly to your new ira custodian this will ensure there are no taxes or penalties on the balance   the key is that the money is moving directly to the new account without you having direct access to the balance this keeps the money out of your hands in the eyes of the irs the process should look something like this a few notes

is my understanding okay if so it seems to me that this system is    rather error prone by that i mean i could easily forget to make a    wire some day and be charged interests while i actually have more than    enough money on the check account to pay the debt which is where the credit card company can add fees so you pay more and they make more money do n't forget that in the credit case you are borrowing money rather than using your own another thing that bothers me is that the credit card apparently has a    rather low credit limit if i wanted to buy something that costs $ 2500    but only have a credit limit of $ 1500 can i make a wire    from my check account to the visa account to avoid facing the limit    if so what is the point for the customer of having two accounts and    two cards for that matter if you were the credit card company do you believe people should be given large limits first there are prepaid credit cards where you could put a dollar amount on and it would reject if the balance gets low enough prepaid mastercard would be an example here that i received one last year as i was involved in the floods in my area and needed access to government assistance which was given this way part of the point of building up a credit history is that this is part of how one can get the credit limits increased on cards so that one can have a higher limit after demonstrating that they will pay it back and otherwise the system could be abused there may be a risk that if you prepay onto a credit card and then want to take back the money that there may be fees involved in the transaction generally with credit cards the company makes money on the fees involved for transactions which may come from merchants or yourself as a cash advance on a credit card will be charged interest right away while if you buy merchandise in a store there may not be the interest charged right away

depending on your bank you may receive an ach discount for doing automatic withdrawals from a deposit account at that bank now this depends on your bank and you need to do independent research on that topic as far as dictating what your extra money goes towards each month early payments principal payments interest payments you need to discuss that with your bank i 'm sure it 's not too difficult to find in my experience most banks so long as you did n't sign a contract on your mortgage where you 're penalized for sending additional money will apply extra money toward early payments and not principal i would suggest calling them i know for my student loans i have to send a detailed list of my loans and in what order i want my extra payments toward each otherwise it will be considered an early payment or it will be spread evenly among them all

logically yes legally no any reasonable definition of an investment must include some types of gambling and insurance lottery tickets specifically are really crappy high risk high return investment   obviously most people try to avoid investments with a negative average expected future value but from a purely semantic perspective anything with a potential future value is an investment conversely anyone with a gambling problem should not pretend they are not gambling when making focused investments in high volatility stock options that said the irs taxes gains and losses differently depending on whether they are classified as gambling or just crappy investing so you will not be able to deduct your gambling losses from your earned income unlike investment losses which can be deducted up to per year

there are 2 that help make sense of insurance following those 2 rules normal insurance makes sense ca n't afford to replace your car insure it can afford to lose your tv do n't insure it people with a net worth in the low millions have very similar insurance needs to the middle class for example they might be able to afford a new car when they total it but they probably ca n't afford to pay for the long term care of the person they accidentally ran over similarly they probably need to insure their million dollar house just like average people insure more affordable housing   very wealthy people still have the same basic choices but for different assets   if you are a billionaire then you might not bother to insure your $ 30k childhood home or your fleet vehicles but you probably would insure your $ 250 m mansion your $ 100 m yacht and your more pricey collectible cars   it 's also worth noting that very wealthy people are at much higher risk of being sued for negligence or personal injury as such they are more likely to purchase personal liability or umbrella insurance coverage to protect against such risks multi million dollar personal injury suits would never be filed against a poorer person simply because they could n't afford to pay even the plaintiff 's lawyer fees when they lost the court case insurance also makes sense when the insurance company is likely to grossly underestimate the risk they are taking   for example if i am a really bad driver but i have a clean record thanks to my army of lawyers then insurance might actually be a good deal for me even on average to take the very wealthy stereotypes to the extreme perhaps my eccentric billionaire neighbor and i are in an escalating which i think will result in my accidentally running his car into my neighbor 's precious ferrari

as i see it with a debit card they    are taken kinda out of the game they    are not lending money it seems really    bad for them not exactly it is true that they 're not lending money but they charge a hefty commission from the retailers for each swipe which is pure profit with almost no risk one of the proposals considered or maybe approved already do n't know in congress is to cap that hefty commission which will really make the debit cards merely a service for the checking account holder rather than a profit maker for the bank on the other hand it 's    definitely good for individuals i disagree with that debit cards are easier to use than checks but they provide much less protection than credit cards here 's what i had to say on this a while ago and seems like the community agrees but why do we really need a credit    history to buy some of the more    expensive stuff because the system is broken it rewards people in debt by giving them more opportunities to get into even more debts while people who owe nothing to noone can not get a credit when they do need one with the current system the potential creditor can only asses the risk of someone who has debt already they have no way of assessing risks of someone with no debts to me all this credit card system    seems like an awfully nice way to make    loads of money backed by governments    as well well credit cards have nothing to do with it it 's the credit scores system that is broken if we replace the card with score in your question then yes you 're thinking correctly that of course is true for the us in other countries i have no knowledge on how the creditors assess the risks

strictly by the numbers putting more than 20 down is a losing proposition   with interest rates still near all time lows you 're likely able to get a mortgage for less than 4 the real rate of a return on the market subtracting inflation and taxes is going to be somewhere around 5 6   so by this math you 'd be best off paying the minimum to get out of pmi and then investing the remainder in a low fee index fund the question becomes how much that 1 2 is worth to you vs how much the job flexibility is worth it boils down to your personal risk preference life conditions etc so it is difficult to give good advice   the 1 2 difference in your rate of return is not going to be catastrophic     personally i would run the numbers with your fiance   build a spreadsheet tracking your estimated net worth under the assumption that you make a 20 down payment and invest the rest   then hold all other factors equal and re build the spreadsheet with the higher down payment   factor in one of you losing your job for a few years or one of you taking off for a while to raise the kids    you can make a judgement call based how the two of you feel about those numbers

this was an interesting little article thanks for sharing it   however i 'm a bit by part of the analysis     the authors give some fairly substantial hints that the value they are providing is not the standard deviation but most of the respondents miss these hints   the answers for the annualized rate also suggest that many of the respondents knew how to compute this given the standard deviation   the authors then go on to say that basically all of the respondents gave the correct mathematical definition of the standard deviation   then they go on to say that   gt whatever reason there was for their error it did not result from ignorance of the concept   but this strikes me as both disingenuous and incorrect   on the contrary the most likely explanation would seem to be that most of them were not aware of the concept of mean absolute deviation probably because they had either never learned it or never had occasion to apply it   i agree that people even highly trained people tend to be very bad at probability just look up the hall problem for a primer on that   but i strongly disagree with the notion that this paper provides any evidence of this tendency as there seems to be a much stronger case for ignorance   this alternative is further supported by the authors assertion that   gt with respondents revealed that they rarely had an immediate understanding of the error when it was pointed out to them   again suggesting ignorance as the most not least likely culprit   i also found it odd that they asked the respondents specifically about the standard deviation definition but not about the mean absolute deviation despite the fact that the latter is almost certainly more obscure   to that last bit i just went through the textbooks i have on hand and this concept is not mentioned in either of the undergraduate statistics probability textbooks i own nor in the one undergraduate finance textbook i have   i 'm in machine learning and not finance but it is mentioned in just one of the four graduate level texts i have on applied statistics and probability once on one page in a textbook on bayesian statistics   and the wikipedia page is terrible   in short while this is an interesting little experiment and write up i think the analysis and conclusions are inappropriate and not supported by the evidence the authors provide   that does n't mean that their conclusions are incorrect just that i disagree with the notion that this paper them   this response ended up being way long

because etfs unlike most other pooled investments can be easily shorted it is possible for institutional investors to take an arbitrage position that is long the underlying securities and short the etf   the result is that in a well functioning market where etf prices are what they should be these institutional investors would earn a risk free profit equal to the fee amount how much is this amount though etfs exist in a very competitive market   not only do they compete with each other but with index and mutual funds and with the possibility of constructing one 's own portfolio of the underlying   etf investors are very cost conscious as a result etf fees just barely cover their costs   typically etf providers do not even do their own trading   they issue new shares only in exchange for a bundle of the underlying securities so they have almost no costs   in order for an institutional investor to make money with the arbitrage you describe they would need to be able to carry it out for less than the fees earned by the etf   unlike the etf provider these investors face borrowing and other shorting costs and limitations as a result it is not profitable for them to attempt this   note that even if they had no costs their maximum upside would be a few basis points per year   lots of low risk investments do better than that i 'd also like to address your question about what would happen if there was an etf with exorbitant fees   two things about your suggested outcome are incorrect    if short sellers bid the price down significantly then the shares would be cheap relative to their stream of future dividends and investors would again buy them   in a well functioning market you ca n't bid the price of something that clearly is backed by valuable underlying assets down to near zero as you suggest in your question notice that there are limitations to short selling   the more shares are short sold the more difficult it is to locate share to borrow for this purpose   at first brokers start charging additional fees   as shares become harder to find they require that you obtain a locate which takes time and costs money   finally they will not allow you to short at all   unlimited short selling is not possible if there was an etf that charged exorbitant fees it would fail but not because of short sellers   there is an even easier arbitrage strategy investors would buy the shares of the etf which would be cheaper than the value of the underlying because of the fees and trade them back to the etf provider in exchange for shares of the underlying   this would drain down the underlying asset pool until it was empty    in fact it is this mechanism the ability to trade etf shares for shares of the underlying and vice versa that keeps etf prices fair within a small tolerance relative to the underlying indices

data is a funny thing there are many different ways of constructing data sets keep in mind the cite you linked is fine i follow this kind of site when i am data mining they got their data from the government and there 's no reason to doubt its validity keep in mind it 's a survey they extrapolate from a survey of a small population in the 2016 survey families were interviewed and in the 2013    survey were interviewed 1 let 's set that aside and look at the numbers as if they were gospel $ m net worth to be top 1 that 's people at all different ages and not the wealth cutoff for those dying else the estate tax would hit closer to the 1 given the limited data set i 'd only if we the age along the bottom x axis vs number of people the curve would peek in mid to late 60 's as people retire with 20 years for the couple to spend and gift it 's not tough to imagine that by the time they pass away the taxable estate $ 11 m couple falls to just .2   2 when the estate tax impacted estates over just $ 600 k and my daughter was born we set up a trust out net worth was barely positive but insurance alone would have created enough wealth to have our child be subject to the tax of our estate before she received a dime we also used the trust to fund her college as a completed gift had we made some bad decisions and lost it all at least that money would be protected keep in mind there are different flavors of trusts but it 's safe to say that in a survey to collect data the million trusts are considered family wealth not tough to imagine a good fraction of those families over $ 10 m have a nice chunk already protected this way   3 last for any illiquid assets there 's a discount that gets applied typically 30 i own a ranch and want to start gifting it to the kids the process involves creating stock with restrictions as a way to transfer the fractions required to gift the $ 14k yr per person combination that is a couple can gift = $ 56 k to a child with a spouse 4 kids all married and the gifting is $ yr $ 320 k at full valuation again these gifts may be to irrevocable trusts and still thought of as their wealth

you have plenty of good answers but i want to add something that might help you grow your intuition on stocks there are a lot of differences between the example i am going to give and how the stock market actually runs but the basic concepts are the same lets say your friend asks you if he can borrow some money to start up a company in exchange you will have some ownership in this company you have essentially just bought yourself some stock now as your friend starts to grow he is doing well but he needs more cash to buy assets in order to grow the company more he is forced with an option either give you some of the profits or buy these assets sooner you decide you do n't really need the money right now and think he can do a lot better with spending the money to buy stuff this is essentially the same as a company electing to not pay dividends but instead invest into the future you as a stock holder are fine with it since you know the money is going toward investing in the future even if you never get paid a dividend as a company grows you can then turn around and sell the stock to someone else for more money then you gave originally of course you always take the risk of having the company failing and loosing some if not all of your investment but that is just the risk of the market

patience has never been my strong suit unfortunately this is what you need to build up credit the activities that increase your credit score are paying your bills on time and not using too much of the available credit that you do have the rest age of accounts recent pulls etc are short term indicators that indicate changes in behavior that will make lenders pause and understand what the reasons behind the events are also keep in mind that your credit score should n't run your life   it should be a passive indicator of your financial habits not something that you actively manipulate    is there anything i can do to raise my score without having to take out a loan with interest pay your bills on time and do n't take out more credit than you need   you 're already in the excellent category so there 's no reason to panic or try to manipulate it   even if you temporarily dip below if you need to make a big purchase house your loan to value and debt income ratio will be much bigger factors in what interest rate you can get   as far as the bofa card goes if you do n't need it cancel it   it might cause a temporary dip in your credit but it will go away quickly and you 're better off not having credit cards that you do n't need

i 'm afraid you have missed a few of the outcomes commonly faced by millions of americans so i would like to take a moment to discuss a wider range of outcomes that are common in the united states today most importantly some of these happen before retirement is ever reached and have grave consequences yet are often very closely linked to financial health and savings not planning ahead long term 10 20 + years is generally associated with not planning ahead even for the next few months so i 'll start there the most common thing that happens is the loss of a job or illness injury that put someone out of work 6 in 10 adults in the us have less than $ 500 in savings so desperation can set in very quickly as the very next paycheck will be short or missing many of these americans have no other source of saved money either so it 's not like they can draw on retirement savings as they do n't have that either even if they are able to get another job or recover enough to get back to work in a few weeks this can set off a desperate cycle those who have lost their jobs to technical obsolescence major economic downturns or large economic changes are often more severely affected people once making excellent middle class or above wages with full benefits find they can not find work that pays even vaguely similarly in the past this was especially common in heavy labor jobs like manufacturing meat packing and so on but more recently this has happened in financial sectors and real estate construction during the 2008 economic events the more resilient people had padding switched careers and found other options the less resilient did n't especially during the 1970s and 1980s many people affected by large losses of earning potential became sufficiently desperate that they fell heavily or lost their functioning status into substance abuse including alcohol and drugs cocaine and being especially popular in this segment of the population life disruption made even more major by a lack of savings is a key trigger to many people who are already at risk of issues like substance addiction mental health or any ongoing legal issues another common issue is something more simple like loss of transportation that threatens their ability to hold their job and a lack of alternatives available through support networks savings family and public transit if their credit is bad or their income is new they may find even companies turn them away or even worse the most companies welcome them in with high interest and hair trigger repossession policies the most common cycle of desperation i have seen usually starts with banking over drafts and its associated fees people who are afraid and desperate start to make increasingly desperate short sighted choices as tunnel vision sets in and they are unable to consider longer term strategy as they focus on holding on to what they have and survival many industries have found this set of people quite profitable including high interest check cashing payday loans and title loans aka legal loan sharks and it is not rare that desperate people are encouraged to get on increasing cycles of loan amounts and fees that worsen their financial situation in exchange for short term relief as fees penalties and interest add up they lose more and more of their already strained income to stay afloat banks that are otherwise reputable and fair may soon blacklist them and turn them away and suddenly only the least reputable and most predatory places offer to help at all usually with a big smile at first and almost always with awful strings attached drugs and alcohol are often readily available nearby and their use can easily turn from recreational to addictive given the allure of the it offers especially for those made vulnerable by increasing stress desperation loss of hope isolation and fear those who have not been within the system of poverty and desperation often do not see just how many people actively work to encourage bad decision making with big budgets charm charisma and talent the voices of reason trying to act as to call people to take care of themselves and their future are all too easily drowned out in the of a smooth and enticing operation   i personally think this is one of the greatest contributions of the movement to build personal financial health and awareness as so many great people find ever more effective ways of pointing out the myriad ways people try to bleed your money out of you with no real concern for your welfare looking out for your own well being and not being taking in by the wide array of cons and bad deals is all too often fighting against a strong societal current as i 'm sure most of our regular contributors are all too aware with increasing desperation often comes illegal maneuvers often quite petty in nature those with substance abuse issues often start reselling drugs to others to try to cover lost income or get ahead with often debilitating results on long term earning potential if they get caught which can include cost barriers to higher education even if they do turn their life around   i think most people are surprised by how little and petty things can quickly cycle out of control this can include things like not paying minor parking or traffic tickets which can snowball from the $ 10 70 range into thousands of dollars due to non payment often escalating and adding additional penalties triggering traffic stops for no other reason etc arrest and more the elderly are not exempt from this system and many of america 's elderly spend their latter years in prison while not all are tied to financial desperation as i 've outlined above a deeper look at poverty crime and the elderly will be deeply disturbing some of these people enter the system while young but some only later in life rather than homelessness being something that only happens after people hit retirement it often comes considerably earlier than that if this occurs the outcome is generally quite a bit more extreme than living off social security some just die the average life expectancy of adults who are living on the street is only about 64 years of age only 2 years into early retirement age and before full retirement age which could of course be increased in the next 10 20 years even if life expectancy and health of those without savings do n't improve most have extremely restricted access to healthcare often being emergency only and have no comforts of home to rest and recuperate when they become ill or injured there are many people dedicated to helping yet the help is far less than the problem generally and being able to take advantage of most of the help scheduling where to go for food who to talk to about other services etc heavily depends on the person not already suffering from conditions that limit their ability to care for themselves mental conditions mobility etc there is also a shockingly higher risk of physical assault injury and death depending on where the person goes but it is far higher in almost every case regardless one of the chief problems in considering only retirement savings is it assumes that you 'll only have need for the savings and good financial health once you reach approximately the age of 62 if it is not raised before you get there which it has been multiple times to date as noted above if homelessness occurs and becomes longstanding before that the result is generally shortened lifespan and premature death the other major issue of health is that preventative care from simple dentistry to basic self care adequate sleep and rest a safe place to is often sacrificed in the scrambling to survive and limited budget those who develop chronic conditions which need regular care are more severely affected and injury related limb loss as one example are far more likely for those without regular support resources homeless destitute or otherwise other posters have done a great job in pointing out a number of the lesser known governmental programs so i wo n't list them again i only note the important that this may be quite a bit less in total than you think social security on average pays retired workers $ 1300 a month it was designed to avoid an all too common occurrence of simple starvation rampant homelessness and abject poverty among a large number of elderly no guarantee is made that you wo n't have to leave your home move away from your friends and family if you live in an expensive part of the country etc some people get a bit more some people get quite a bit less and the loss of family and friend networks especially to such at risk groups can be incredibly damaging note also that those financially desperate will be generally pushed to take retirement at the minimum age even though benefits would be larger and more livable if they delayed their retirement this is an additional cost of not having other sources of savings which is not considered by many well yes many can not retire whether they want to or not   i can not find statistics on this specifically but many are indeed just unable to financially retire without considerable loss social security and other government plans help avoid the most desperate scenarios but so many aspects of aging is not covered by insurance or affordable on the limited income that aging can be a cruel and lonely process for those with no other financial means those with no savings are not likely to be able to afford to regularly visit children and grandchildren give gifts on holidays go on cruises enjoy the best care or afford new technological devices to assist their aging especially those too new and experimental to be covered by the insurance plans they have   what 's worse but most people do not plan for either is that diminished mental and physical capacity can render many people unable to navigate the system successfully as we 've seen here many questions are from adult children trying to help their elderly parents in retirement and include aging parents who do not understand their own access to social security medicaid medicare resources or community help organizations   what happens to those aging without children or younger friend networks to step in and help well we do n't really have a replacement for that i am not aware of any research that just how many in the us do n't take advantage of the resources they are fully qualified to make use of and enjoy due to a lack of education social issues feeling embarrassed and afraid or inability to organize and communicate effectively a resource being available is not very much help for those who do n't have enough supportive resources to make use of it which is very hard to effectively plan for yet is exceedingly common without one 's own independent resources the natural aging and end of life process can be especially harsh elderly who are economically and food insecure experience far heightened incidence of depression asthma heart attack and heart failure and a host of other they are at greater risk for abuse accidental death life quality threatening conditions developing or worsening and more scare tactics are n't always persuasive and they do little to improve the lives of many because the people who need to know it most generally just do n't believe it but my hope here is that the rather highly educated and sophisticated audience here will see a little more of the harsher world that their own good decisions good fortune culture and position in society shields them from experiencing there is a downside to good outcomes which is that it can cause us to be blind to just how extremely different is the experience of others not all experience such terrible outcomes but many hundreds of thousands in the us alone do and sometimes worse it is not helpful to be unrealistic about this life is not inherently kind however none of this suggests that being co dependent or giving up your own financial well being is necessary or advised to help others share your budgeting strategies your plans for the future your gentle concerns and give of your time and resources as generously as you can within your own set budgets and ensuring your own financial well being and most of all do not so easily give up on your family and friends and count them as life long hopeless do wells let 's all strive to be good kind honest and offer non judgmental support and advice to the best of our ability to the people we care about it is ultimately their choice restricted by their own experiences and abilities but need not be fate people regularly but sometimes they surprise and delight take care of yourself and give others the best chance you can too

as pointed out in their answer at any given time there is a finite amount of stock available in a company one you may be missing is that there is always a price associated with an offer to buy shares that is you do n't put in an order simply to buy 1 share of abc you put in an order to buy 1 share of abc for $ 10 if no one is willing to sell a share of abc for $ 10 then your order will go unfilled this happens millions of times a day as traders try to figure the cheapest price they can get for a stock practically speaking there is always a price at which people are willing to sell their shares you can put in a market order for 1 share of abc which says essentially i want one share of abc and i will pay whatever the market deems to be the price your broker will find you 1 share but you may be very unhappy about the price you have to pay while it 's very rare for a market to have nobody willing to sell at any price it occasionally happens that no one is willing to buy at any price this causes a market crash as in the 2007 2008 financial crisis when suddenly everyone became very suspicious of how much debt the major banks actually held and for a few days very few traders were willing to buy bank stocks at any price

structuring as noted in another answer involves breaking up cash transactions to avoid the required reporting limits    there are a couple of important things to note    and the biggest caveat there have been many cases of perfectly legitimate transactions that have fallen foul of the reporting requirements   one case springs to mind of a small business that routinely deposited the previous day 's receipts as cash and due to the size of the business those deposits typically fell in the $ range   this business ended up going through a lot of headaches and barely survived   some do n't    a single batch of transactions if it is only 2 or 3 parts and they are separated by reasonable intervals is not likely in and of itself to be suspicious   however any set of such transactions does run the risk of being flagged    in your case you also run afoul of the know your customer rules because it 's not even you depositing the cash it 's your friend   why can your friend not simply write you a check   what is your friend doing with $ 5k of cash at a time   how do you know he 's not generating illegal income and using you to launder it for him   were i your bank you can be very certain i 'd be reporting these transactions   just from this description this seems questionable to me    irs millions from law businesses

the severity of wealth more so than its is what i 'm getting at when i talk about the fed the effect is a theory that essentially states that the first recipients of stimulus are far better off than those 2 or 3 degrees of separation later   so if you look at fed policies where monetary stimulus is directed only towards the financial system and credit markets certain parties will benefit disproportionately first before others later in this case that would be those employed by the industry bankers investors etc institutions in that industry banks hedge funds pension mutual funds and owners of securities the wealthy spillover effects impact the stock market real estate art etc and they are not a result of fundamentals but rather of mis allocated capital   what i 'm getting at is we do n't need central planners i.e. the fed to make decisions regarding the market for money interest rates or pursue dubious financial experiments at best to somehow fix problems that they themselves caused in the past through extended low interest rate environments central banking could take a very serious hit if cryptocurrencies become which i do not expect for a long but it 's the best emergent to the existing paradigm

when you sell your primary residence you are required to capitalize any loss or gain at that point you do not carry over your loss or gain as you might in an investment property   as such the timing of the purchase of the next house is not relevant in this discussion you gained however much you gained already   this changed from the other rollover method in 1997 see this bankrate article for more details however as discussed in irs tax topic you can exclude up to $ 250,000 single or filing separately or $ 500,000 married filing jointly of gain if it is your primary residence and meets a few requirements mostly that you owned it for at least 2 years in the past 5 years and similarly used it as your main home for at least 2 years of the past 5 years    so given you reported 25 gain as long as your house is under a million dollars or so you 're fine and if it 's over a million dollars you probably should be paying a cpa for this stuff for california state tax it looks like it is the same see this turbotax forum answer for a good explanation and links to this california franchise tax board guide which confirms it for sale or exchanges after may 6 1997 federal law allows    an exclusion of gain on the sale of a personal residence in    the amount of $ 250,000 $ 500,000 if married filing jointly    the taxpayer must have owned and occupied the residence    as a principal residence for at least 2 of the 5 years before the    sale california conforms to this provision however california    taxpayers who served in the peace corps during the 5 year    period ending on the date of the sale may reduce the 2 year    period by the period of service not to exceed 18 months

the short answer is yes paying more towards the loan as soon as a you can will reduce the interest there are calculators or you could work up a spreadsheet using the specialized family of functions pmt my personal view the amount of interest you offset in this manner is going to be fairly small i 'm going to guess less than $ 5 or $ 10 a month but i have n't done the math i would say what is more important is to automate your payments at a comfortable level while making sure your other obligations are taken care of then add an extra payment when you save up a chunk of money to pay towards it make sure you never miss a payment that means making sure you set up emergency fund to cover the payments if you lose your job or need to visit a sick family member for a while or the car breaks down or

there are a number of benefits to this type of account   if one has highly appreciated stock think apple donations of the stock are taken at current value so for example i donate $ 10,000 worth of shares which cost me $ 100 in the 28 bracket and itemizing i see a $ 2800 benefit but i also avoid a $ capital gain and the 15 tax on that or $ in this example the fund comes into play as it would allow me to break up that $ 10,000 into smaller donations and over a number of years   next example in my article some years ago fun with schedule a i describe how a strategy of ones itemized deductions every other year can help push people into the ability to itemize where normally they just miss doing so using the charitable fund can help people smooth out their contributions to the end charities while actually making the out of pocket withdrawal every other year   last there are many whose income is irregular for whatever reason this type of account can be useful to help people in this situation make a deposit in high income high tax rate years skipping the deposit in low income low rate years but still keep up with the annual charity support   obviously one 's goal is to help the charities they wish to support it 's silly to donate for the deduction but for those who are charitable these strategies help them divert more money to the charity and less to uncle sam   sorry i 'm not sure about the math to show that my answer was to share the benefits of using these types of accounts

i am glad they are going away malls are an environmental tragedy    are the product or maybe even part of the cause of suburban sprawl they encourage car usage and by virtue of their need for large open areas to be constructed are often far from where most people work and live as a result patrons have to drive large distances from their houses jobs to the shopping centers    2 the parking lots are tremendous waste of space and hugely damage the studies environment transportation parking environmental impacts development policies research roundup     3 online shopping is much better for the environment as the product can be shipped directly to the consumer    4 once they are built and then closed the space where the centers sat is basically abandoned and turns into blight depending on the businesses that were housed in the mall and the businesses that were supported by the mail especially gas stations these sites could be toxic    i am sure there are more reasons why malls are environmentally harmful but those are a few off the top of my head

the fund will take a small percentage of its assets to cover the expenses   reported returns come after the expense ratio has been factored into things money market mutual funds can have a zero yield in some cases though breaking the buck can happen in some cases as noted on wikipedia the first money market mutual fund to break the buck was first    for daily income in 1978 liquidating and    nav at 94 cents per share an argument has been made that was not    technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the    average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two    however prospective investors were informed that would invest    solely in short term 30 90 days money market obligations    furthermore the rule which restricts the maturities which money    market funds are permitted to invest in rule of the investment    company act of 1940 was not until 1983 prior to the    adoption of this rule a mutual fund had to do little other than    present itself as a money market fund which did seeking higher    yield had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities and    rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio    in order to meet increasing redemptions the fund was forced to sell a    certificate of deposit at a 3 loss triggering a of its    nav and the first instance of a money market fund breaking the    buck the community bankers us government fund broke the buck in 1994    paying investors 96 cents per share this was only the second failure    in the then history of money funds and there were no further    failures for 14 years the fund had invested a large percentage of its    assets into adjustable rate securities as interest rates increased    these floating rate securities lost value this fund was an    institutional money fund not a retail money fund thus individuals    were not directly affected no further failures occurred until september 2008 a month that saw    events for money funds however as noted above other    failures were only averted by of capital from the fund    sponsors thus consider how likely is fidelity investments prepared to have people question how safe is their money with them which is why fund sponsors rarely break the buck

couple points 1 since the roth is after tax you can effectively contribute more than you could with the traditional ira before hitting the limits so in your example if you had extra money you wanted to invest in an ira you could invest up to $ more into the roth but only $ 500 more into the traditional current limits are $ 5,500 per year for single filers under 50 your example assumes that you have exactly $ 3,750 in spare money looking for an ira home   2 the contributions but not earnings can be withdrawn from the roth at any time penalty and tax free   3 the tax rate lock in can be significant especially early on when you are at a relatively low tax bracket say 15 but expect to be higher at retirement   4 traditional iras and 401(k are taxed as ordinary income so you go through the tax brackets even if the marginal rate is 25 the effective rate may be lower if you have a roth conceivably you could reduce the amount you need to withdrawal from the trad to reduce the effective tax rate on those of course subject to minimum distributions and all that this is more an argument to have a mix of pre- and post tax retirement accounts than strictly a pro roth reason

why would you want to withdraw only the company match and presumably leave your personal contributions sitting in your ex company 's 401k plan generally 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an ira so unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to and you think those investments are where you want your money to be roll over part or all of your 401k assets into an ira and withdraw the rest for personal expenses   if your personal contributions are in a roth 401k roll them over to a roth ira but as i remember it company contributions are not part of the roth 401k and must be rolled over into a traditional ira perhaps this is why you want to take those in cash to pay for your personal purchase also what is this 30 hit you are talking about you will owe income tax on the money withdrawn from the 401k and custodians traditionally withhold 20 and send it to the irs on your behalf plus penalty for early withdrawal which the custodian may also withhold if you ask them but the tax that you will pay on the money withdrawn will depend on your tax bracket which may be lower if you are laid off and do not immediately take on a new job that is the 30 hit may be on the cash flow but you may get some of it back as a refund when you file your income tax return

to break it to you but it 's the republican policies of deregulation and tax cuts we ca n't afford that got us this shit sandwich    not even close year deficit is not related to taxes it 's related to increased spending while yes tax revenues fall a bit but you do n't take actions that will make tax revenues fall more putting additional burdens on companies does nt yield more tax revenue if it did why not tax them at 90 but then guess what happens along that chart curve there are no companies left   how much in additional taxes could we take in 100 billion conservatively ok genius what about the other $ 1 trillion year we spend too much   seems to me like a person living paycheck to paycheck would actually have a very good idea of what it 's like to live on the edge of bankruptcy   except for most people close to bankruptcy they never had any capital to begin with they lived pay check to pay check using credit cards buying houses buying cars    businesses must keep a much larger cushion of liquid capital and assets and must plan years in advance few individuals do this or ever will    the only correlation is that more and more liabilities are not meeting income except when an individual goes bankrupt it 's mostly on them if a company goes bankrupt it can effect hundreds or thousands of employees and the company an going bankrupt wo n't then bankrupt their creditors or vendors but a company going bankrupt very well could    i do n't know if you knew this but the united states itself is bankrupt we ca n't meet liabilities with the current income that does n't mean increased taxes to increase income it means reducing liabilities and creating an envionment where those who bring in the revenue can expand    what we 're talking about here is companies receiving additional burdens not less thus there is an incentive to decrease liabilities where possible sell or close if necessary

competition or actually lack of competition mostly due to a demand curve that has minimal change due to price you would buy the equivalent cheaper option if it was available but the store has little interest in offering multiple competing options that would drive their same store revenue down and the competing stores grocery department drug card have similar overhead costs floor space lights personnel most carry the cards for incremental revenue and observe little advantage to lower price for a card customers seldom buy more cards due to a lower price thus they mark the price to what most customers are willing to pay you may choose to shop the various stores and find the one that has a slightly better pricing for cards and then stop at that store when you want to buy a card but many cards are sold as an incremental purchase as part of a larger shopping trip convenience as the customer combines trips reduce the time spent shopping albeit not reducing the money spent

sipc is a corporation a legal entity separate from its owners in the case of sipc it is funded through the fees paid by its members all the us brokers are required to be members and to contribute to sipc funds can it go bankrupt of course any legal entity can go bankrupt a person can go bankrupt a country can go bankrupt and so can anything in between however looking at the history of things there are certain assumptions that can be made these are mere guesses as there 's no law about any of these things to the best of my knowledge but seeing how things were we can try and guess that they will also be like this in the future i would guess that in case of a problem for the sipc to meet its obligation any of the following would happen or combinations too big to fail large insurance companies had been bailed out before by the governments since it was considered that their failure would be more destructive to the economy than the bailout aig as an example in the us sipc is in essence is an insurance company so is lloyd 's of london breach of trust of the individual investors that can lead to a significant market crash that 's what happened in the us to fannie mae and freddie mac they 're now officially backed by the us government if sipc is incapable of meeting its obligation i would definitely expect the us government to step in even though there 's no such obligation raising funds through charging other members if the actuary calculations were incorrect the insurance companies adjust them and raise premiums that is what should happen in this case as well while may not necessarily solve a cashflow issue in the long term it will allow sipc to balance so that bridge loans from the us government feds public bonds could be used in between not meeting obligations i.e. bankruptcy that is an option and insurance companies have gone bankrupt before not unheard of but from the past experience again i 'd expect the us government to step in in general i do n't see any significant difference between sipc in the us and a generic insurance coverage elsewhere except that in the us sipc is mandatory well regulated and the coverage is uniform across brokerages which is a benefit to the consumer

1 how does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation and at worst it should be viewed as a liability and has no place alongside other real investments periods of high inflation are generally accompanied with interest rates any home is a liability as has been pointed out in other answers it costs money to live in it costs money to keep in good shape and it offers you no return unless you sell it for more than you have paid for it in total in fact as long as you have an outstanding mortgage it actually costs you money to own even when not considering things like property taxes utilities etc the only way to make a home an investment is to rent it out for more than it costs you in total to own but then you ca n't live in it instead 2 how should one view payments on a home mortgage how are they similar or different to investing in low risk low reward investments like joetaxpayer said in a comment paying off your mortgage should be considered the same as putting money into a certificate of deposit with a term and return equivalent to your mortgage interest cost adjusting for tax effects what is important to remember about paying off a mortgage besides the simple and not so unimportant fact that it lowers your financial risk over time is that over time it improves your cash flow if interest rates do n't change unlikely then as long as you keep paying the interest but do n't pay down the principal assuming that the bank is happy with such an arrangement your monthly cost remains the same and will do so in perpetuity you currently have a cash flow that enables you to pay down the principal on the loan and are putting some fairly significant amount of money towards that end now suppose that you were to lose your job which means a significant cut in the household income if this cut means that you ca n't afford paying down the mortgage at the same rate as before you can always call the bank and tell them to stop the extra payments until you get your ducks back in the proverbial row it 's also possible with a long history of paying on time and a loan significantly smaller than what the house would bring in in a sale that you could renegotiate the loan with an extended term which depending on the exact terms may lower your monthly cost further if the size of the loan is largely the same as or perhaps even exceeds the market value of the house the bank would be a lot more unlikely to cooperate in such a scenario it 's also a good idea to at the very least aim to be free of debt by the time you retire even if one assumes that the pension systems will be the same by then as they are now some do n't but that 's a completely different question you are likely to see a significant cut in cash flow on retirement day any fixed expenses which can not easily be cut if needed are going to become a lot more of a liability when you are actually at least in part living off your savings rather than contributing to them the earlier you get the mortgage paid off the earlier you will have the freedom to put into other forms of savings the money which is now going not just to principal but to interest as well what is important to consider is that paying off a mortgage is a very illiquid form of savings on the other hand money in stocks bonds various mutual funds and savings accounts tends to be highly liquid it is always a good idea to have some savings in easily accessible form some of it in very low risk investments such as a simple interest bearing savings account or government bonds despite their low rate of return before you start to aggressively pay down loans because particularly when you own a home you never know when something might come up that ends up costing a fair chunk of money

i like this part   gt;because insurance companies are required to take all applicants healthy people especially the young would be wise to pay the penalty rather than buy the insurance this makes the pool of insured individuals and more costly on average and their premiums will higher with higher premiums more people will choose to pay the penalty and a downward spiral will unfold   which is the exact opposite of reality   if you have more people in an insurance pool premium costs go down which is the whole point of the individual mandate   it 's like they 're trying to scare people to not buy health insurance and waste it on a fine instead   real nice

the answer is discounted cash flows companies that do n't pay dividends are ostensibly reinvesting their cash at returns higher than shareholders could obtain elsewhere   they are reinvesting in productive capacity with the aim of using this greater productive capacity to generate even more cash in the future this is n't just true for companies but for almost any cash generating project with a project you can purchase some type of productive assets you may perform some kind of transformation on the good or not with the intent of selling a product service or in fact the productive mechanism you have built this productive mechanism is typically called a company what is the value of such a productive mechanism yes it 's capacity to continue producing cash into the future under literally any scenario discounted cash flow is how cash flows at distinct intervals are valued   a company that does not pay dividends now is capable of paying them in the future   berkshire hathaway   does not pay a dividend currently but it 's cash flows have been reinvested over the years such that it 's current cash paying capacity has multiplied many thousands of times over the decades this is why companies that have never paid dividends trade at higher prices microsoft did not pay dividends for many years because the cash was better used developing the company to pay cash flows to investors in later years a companies value is the sum of it 's risk adjusted cash flows in the future even when it has never paid shareholders a dime if you had a piece of paper that obligated an entity such as the government to absolutely pay you $ 1,000 20 years from now this $ 1,000 cash flows present value could be estimated using discounted cash flow it might be around $ 400 for example   but let 's say you want to trade this promise to pay before the 20 years is up   would it be worth anything   of course it would   it would in fact typically go up in value barring heavy inflation until it was worth very close to $ 1,000 moments before it 's value is redeemed imagine that this promise to pay is much like a non dividend paying stock   throughout its life it has never paid anyone anything but over the years it 's value goes up   it is because the discounted cash flow of the $ 1,000 payout can be estimated at almost anytime prior to it 's payout

point of order what goes up must come down refers to gravity of objects below escape velocity and should not be generalized beyond its intent   it 's not true that stocks must come down just because they have gone up   for example we would not expecting the price of oil to come down to 1999 levels right   prices including those of stocks are not necessarily cyclical anyway short selling is n't necessarily a bad idea   in some sense it is insurance if you have a lot of assets like maybe your human capital that will take a dive when the market goes down   short selling would have lost a lot of money in your case as the stock market between 2011 when you wrote the question and 2014 when i wrote this answer performed very well   on average the long side stock market should make money over long periods of time as compensation for risk and the short side should lose money so it 's not a good way to make money if you do n't have an informational advantage   like all insurance it protects you against certain but on average it costs you money

in the case of a vehicle with a lien there is a specific place on the title to have a lien holder listed and the holder of the lien will also hold the title until the lien is cleared usually this means you have to pay off the loan when you purchase the vehicle if that loan is held by a bank meet the seller at the bank and pay the loan directly with them and have them send the title directly to you when the loan is paid this usually involves writing up a bill of sale to give to the bank when paying the loan the only thing you 're trying to avoid here is paying cash to the seller who then keeps the cash without paying the lien holder who then keeps the title and the motorcycle do n't pay the seller if they do n't have the title ready to sign over to you

a 529 plan is set up in a specific beneficiary 's name but the money can be rolled over or transferred into another 529 plan in the same beneficiary 's name or the beneficiary can be changed by the owner of the account   i mistakenly believed that the new beneficiary could be anyone else but as mhoran_psprep has   pointed out in the comment below the new beneficiary must be related to   the previous one in specific ways as detailed in publication 970 2011 tax benefits for education in order for the change to occur without any tax consequences   so my original statement that distributions can be used for anyone 's educational expense without tax consequences was incorrect if the new beneficiary is not related to the original beneficiary tax consequences will indeed occur   note also that unlike iras where the entire amount can be withdrawn by the owner without incurring a 10 penalty after a certain period or after reaching a certain age distributions from a 529 plan for nonqualified expenses including as a special case a withdrawal of funds by the owner will incur the 10 penalty tax regardless of when this occurs the problem with ugma accounts is that you have to turn the money over to the beneficiary when that beneficiary becomes an adult 18 years old in most cases regardless of your current opinion of that beneficiary and the beneficiary is free to use the money to buy a motorcycle with it if she chooses instead of using it for her education   in this sense i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer that it is best to put away the money in an ordinary account without seeking tax benefits and deal with the matter as you see fit when the niece is filling out her college paperwork

hope this helps   i understand that a reverse mortgage can be paid out in two ways a lump sum and monthly payments i figure that if you take the lump sum eventually the bank wants you to start paying it back answer    actually there are 3 payout options or 4 if you consider a combination payout as another one there 's a lump sum a line of credit or the monthly payout or a combination   i figure that if you take the monthly payments eventually the bank stops paying out and wants you to pay it back in both situations interest accrues and this is how the bank makes money off of the deal   answer the only time the monthly payments would stop would be if the borrower defaults on the lenders terms or they no longer live at home you are right though and interest does accrue on whichever payment is decided on i 'm not sure how the lender makes money probably by the interest but i know borrowers are protected against high rates and owing more than your house here 's an article i found that goes over the protections more in detail   but what determines when you have to begin paying back the reverse mortgage some sources online seem to say that it 's based only on if you die or would like to sell move that ca n't be right in all situations because you could end up with a massive debt on a property more than its value   answer there are a lot of protections or regulations in place to protect anyone who takes out a reverse mortgage one being you ca n't owe more than your house is valued at during the time of repayment a reverse mortgage is a non recourse loan in the instance that your house is less than you owe you either sell the home and the proceeds are used to pay the loan and you keep the rest or if you owe more than the house proceeds of the home go to the lender either way you 're not left paying for a mortgage without the house in the case the parent grandparent passes then the heirs would have a choice of either paying back the reverse mortgage in payments or they can sell the house heirs are protected during this as well to make sure they 're not left with major debt in case of anything   is there a formula to figure out when the bank stops the monthly payments and then wants it back   amount becomes due if loan terms are not met but the lender will discuss the options if it comes to that   is there a different formula for when the lump sum would have to be paid back   answer each payout option has the same terms and the same pay back terms as long as terms are met the lender ca n't ask for early repayment

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

you can have a positive expected return on a lottery ticket purchase but only if the lottery requires all players to pick their own numbers and does n't have an option to buy a ticket with a randomly generated set of numbers this is because people are very bad at picking random numbers and will tend to pick numbers that are fairly evenly spaced or based on dates rather than genuinely random numbers for example in january 1995 the uk national lottery happened to have fairly well spaced numbers 7 17 23 32 38 42 and there were 133 winners with all six numbers so they way to win is to wait for a draw where a rollover jackpot is high enough that your expected winnings are positive if you are the only winner and pick a set of numbers that looks stupidly non random but is not so very non random that people will have picked it anyway like 1 2 3 4 5 6 for a pick 6 in the range from 1 49 lottery you might pick something like 3 42 43 44 48 49 but it does n't work if there 's a random option since a significant number of players will use it and get genuinely random numbers and so your chances of being the only winner get much smaller

the home owner does not start foreclosure the bank decides when to foreclose   therefore you can not really decide a time to foreclose if you are trying to time the decision the process you miss payments and the banks will send you a late notice for the missing payments   expect many notices the bank will call you at home on your cell phone and at work   they will mail you letters regarding the missing payments if you continue to miss payments the bank will probably demand the loan be paid in full   you will owe the bank the full balance of the principle all past due interest all past due late charges and junk fees   the bank wo n't even take a normal monthly payment from you should you try to pay your regular payment again some law enforcement will notify you on the bank 's intent to foreclose   the bank has begun legal proceedings legal notices are published in the local newspaper soon the notices and the legal waiting period will expire   court proceedings happen   the court will then allow the bank to foreclose notices to into the paper again about the updated status of the foreclosure the house is sold at auction money from the auction is used to pay taxes owned then mortgages then other liens or creditors who file further debt for the home owner taxes when sold if the mortgage debt exceeds the home 's fair market value us federal tax rules say the selling price as the fair market value the fair market value can still be higher than the tax basis which i think is the value of the house at the time of original purchase plus improvements    if the fair market value is higher you will own taxes on sale   however tax rules in the us say if you have owned the home more than two years and make less than $ 250,000 in the transaction $ 500,000 if married you will not owe any tax   state taxes can be different additionally if the mortgage lender the debt and does n't create a deficiency that income is taxable as well   this is more an more common these days   there are exceptions if the home is your primary residence this whole process an take several months to occur but depends on where you live   if you continue to live in the home after the auction the new owner must evict you from the property which is another set of legal proceedings your credit and ability to buy are home will be damaged for the next several years i am not so sure on how pmi works for the banks but i know they are getting some money back

should i invest the money i do n't need immediately and only withdraw it next year when i need it for living expenses or should i simply leave it in my current account this might come as a bit of a surprise but your money is already invested we talk of investment vehicles an investment vehicle is basically a place where you can put money and have it either earn a return or be able to get it back later or both the neither case is generally called spending there are also investment classes which are things like cash stocks bonds precious metals etc different things that you can buy within an investment vehicle you currently have the money in a bank account bank accounts currently earn very low interest rates but they are also very liquid and very secure in the sense of being certain that you will get the principal back now when you talk about investing the money you are probably thinking of moving it from where it is currently sitting earning next to no return to somewhere it can earn a somewhat higher return and that 's fine but you should keep in mind that you are n't really investing it in that case only moving it the key to deciding about an asset allocation how much of your money to put into what investment classes is your investment horizon the investment horizon is simply for how long you plan on letting the money remain where you put it for money that you do not expect to touch for more than five years common advice is to put it in the stock market this is simply because in the long term historically the stock market has outperformed most other investment classes when looking at return versus risk volatility however money that you expect to need sooner than that is often recommended against putting it in the stock market the reason for this is that the stock market is volatile the value of your investment can fluctuate and there 's always the risk that it will be down when you need the money if you do n't need the money within several years you can ride that out but if you need the money within the next year you might not have time to ride out the dip in the stock market so for money that you are going to need soon you should be looking for less volatile investment classes bonds are generally less volatile than stocks with government bonds generally being less volatile than corporate bonds bank accounts are even less volatile coming in at practically zero volatility but also have much lower expected rates of return for the money that you need within a year i would recommend against any volatile investment class in other words you might take whichever part you do n't need within a year and put in bonds except for what you do n't foresee needing within the next half decade or more which you can put in stocks then put the remainder in a simple high yield deposit insured savings account it wo n't earn much but you will be basically guaranteed that the money will still be there when you want it in a year for the money you put into bonds and stocks find low cost index mutual funds or exchange traded funds to do so you can not predict the future rate of return of any investment but you can predict the cost of the investment with a high degree of accuracy hence for any given investment class strive to minimize cost as doing so is likely to lead to better return on investment over time it 's extremely rare to find higher cost alternatives that are actually worth it in the long term

you do n't want to do that don't lie to the irs we live overseas as well and have researched this extensively you can not make $ 50k overseas and then say you only made $ 45k to put $ 5k into retirement   i have heard from some accountants and tax attorneys who interpret the law as saying that the irs considers foreign earned income as not being compensation when computing ira contribution limits regardless of whether or not you exclude it publication what is compensation scroll down a little to the what is not compensation section those professionals say that any amounts you can exclude not just ones you actually do exclude then there are others that say the can is not implied so be careful trying to use any foreign earned income to qualify for retirement contributions i have n't ran across anyone yet who has gotten caught doing it and paid the price but that does n't mean they are n't out there an alternative in certain cases there are two things you can do that we have found to have some sort of taxable income that is preferably not foreign so that you can contribute to a retirement account we do this by using capital gains from investments as income since our agi is always zero we pay no short or long term capital gains taxes as long as we keep short term capital gains lower than $ 45k   another way to contribute to a roth ira when you have no income is to do an ira rollover of course you need money in a tax deferred account to do this but this is how it works i always recommend those who have tax deferred ira 's and no agi due to the feie to roll over as much as they can every year to a roth ira that really is tax free money the only tax you 'll pay on that money is sales tax when you spend it =)

at one point it was illegal to melt silver coins in the us but it is legal now   i do n't know that will happen with copper coins but that 's what happened with silver coins accumulating nickels and leaving them as is in their spendable state is legal   it 's also a way to take physical ownership of copper i expect to see more sales of nickels based on weight   people are already selling high copper content cents on ebay by weight   there are machines in production that sort the zinc ones from the copper ones   's law has small business backing copper cents are already worth twice their face value in the copper content   nickels will get up there too they are awfully heavy and bulky relative to their value though   precious metals give you better bang for your ounce

i think your underestimating what a 50k single influx of workers can do for an area long term   more people to a well developed city is good for the city detroit for example is structured to handled 1.5 million even though it only has 750k now 50k employees means 400k new local jobs supporting those main ones 400k new people would finally allow the city to once again be a proper city and metro area aka wealth concentration in the city less concentration on the exterior in the detroit metro area it gets wealthier as you go further from the city    i do nt see how this is in line with brazil 's corrupt class structure at all some of these cities need a golden ticket to fix the suburban flight that happened post ww2 and especially after the interstate system

why do you keep going on about test results you do realise that the drug does n't last very long in the system and as explained by the testimonies there were techniques to delay blood testing until it was clear from the system such as ringing each other up telling them that testers are here and to say out on the track for longer or to dope more often at night when testers were n't around or to simply not answer your door when testers came around   and yes there were was a test result i do n't remember which year exactly that when tested at the time was found to have no drugs but that s because the drug he used was n't by any method the blood was later on when they did have a method to test for it and they did find it in his system   let 's say i have a gun which disappears into thin air after firing i use it to kill a person in a room full of people nobody sees me directly firing the gun but i do manage to use it to kill someone and the gun disappears police search everyone including me for a gun but find no gun they find that i had motive but again no gun now a week later 26 of my one of them who was the person who manufactured this magical gun own up to the police and confess how i was able to do what i did would n't it be stupid of me to argue you never found a gun on me after the murder therefore i 'm innocent   the gun is like the drug it disappears after use with the drug it 's not so instant but still disappears fairly quickly with regards to the blood testing frequency therefore do you not see how it is stupid to say no positive test results therefore it 's evidence he never used drugs again i 'll reiterate it incase you still do n't understand it of the drug disappears quickly from the blood

on reading couple of articles some research over internet i got to know about diversified investment where one should invest 70 in equity related rest 30 in debt related funds yes that is about right although the recommendation keeps varying a bit however your first investment should not aim for diversification putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues my suggestion would be to start with an index eft or large cap then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc   on this site we do n't advise on specific funds you can refer to or or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly ps rather than buying paper buy it electronic better you can now buy it as demat if you already have an demat account it would be best to buy through it

well a statement like capitalism is killing the planet implies for me that the system has more than faults it is an utter failure and beyond any redeeming value that 's where i disagree i 'm not saying it is without fault   the goal of government is to patch over the fundamental problems with capitalism particularly regulating free markets you need to prevent externalities and there are no bigger externalities than the future of the planet and the future of energy consumption these are naturally tied together and they should absolutely be regulated in the favor of humanity 's future   it 's a fallacy to say that capitalism is bad because it can not thrive without government intervention because that option is not on the table there is no option of not having a government at least we do n't consider any of them to be good options

released census data reveals nearly 110 million americans more than one third of the country are receiving government assistance of some kind   gt;*the number counts people receiving what are known as means tested federal benefits or subsidies based on income this includes welfare programs ranging from food stamps to subsidized housing to the program most commonly referred to as welfare temporary assistance for needy families   the end of 2012 according to the stats million were on food stamps while 83 million were collecting medicaid with some benefiting from multiple programs   the programs were created to help those in need some analysts worry that the way they ’re designed is increasingly incentivizing people not to work they note that when recipients combine several government assistance programs in many cases they pay better than going to work   gt;*the cato institute ’s michael said that in the eight most generous states the benefits can be tantamount to a $ 20 minimum wage which would exceed the $ 7.25 minimum wage in most states   in many cases people could actually do better on welfare than they could in an entry level job said   cross post from /r maconservative

couple of to start off index funds and etf 's are essentially the same investments   etf 's allow you to trade during the day but also make you reinvest your dividends manually instead of doing it for you   compare vti and vtsax for example   basically the same returns with very slight differences in how they are run   because they are so similar it does n't matter which you choose either index funds and etf 's can be purchased through a regular taxable brokerage account or through an ira or roth ira   the decision of what fund to use and whether to use a brokerage or ira are separate whole market index funds will get you exposure to us equity but consider also diversifying into international equity bonds real estate reits and emerging markets   any broker can give you advice on that score or you can get free advice from for example future advisor   now the advice for most people in your situation you current tax rate is currently very low   this makes a roth ira a very reasonable idea   you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2015 if you do it before april 15 and you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2016   repeat each year   you wo n't be able to get all your money into a roth but anything you can do now will save you money on taxes in the long run   you put after tax money in a roth ira and then you do n't pay taxes on it or the gains when you take it out you can use roth ira funds for college for a first home or for retirement a traditional ira is not recommended in your case   that would save you money on taxes this year when presumably your taxes are already low since you wo n't be able to put all your money in the ira you can put the rest in a regular taxable brokerage account if you do n't just want to put it in a savings account   you can buy the same types of things as you have in your ira    note that if your stocks in your regular brokerage account go up over the course of a year and your income is low enough to be in the 10 or 15 tax bracket and you have held the stock for at least a year you should sell before the end of the year to lock in your gains and pay taxes on them at the capital gains rate of 0 this will prevent you from paying a higher rate on those gains later   conversely if you lose money in a year do n't sell you can sell and lock in losses during years when your taxes are high presumably after college to reduce your tax burden in those years this is called tax loss harvesting sounds like crazy but the name of the game is legally avoiding taxes   this is at least as important to your overall wealth as the decision of which funds to buy ok now the financial advisor   it 's up to you   you can make your own financial decisions and save the money but it requires you putting in the effort to be educated   for many of us this education is fun   also consider that if you use a regular broker like fidelity you can call up and they have people who for free will give you advice very similar to what you will get from the advisor you referred to   high priced financial advisors make more sense when you have a lot of money and complicated finances   based on your question you do n't strike me as having those   to me 1 sounds like a lot to pay for a simple situation like yours

usually sell every month arguably every day you own the house it is costing you money for mortgage and taxes and upkeep unless it is also producing income or you are actually living in it that is a serious problem in any sane market it is extremely unlikely that the house can gain enough value to offset that loss   renting it out even if you lose money versus the costs would at least slow the bleeding but unless you actually want to deal with rental or strongly expect to return very soon selling rapidly for a good price is usually optimal of course when setting the asking price and negotiating offers you are going to have to consider exactly this trade off

there are many reasons for buying new versus used vehicles price is not the only factor   this is an individual decision although interesting to examine from a macro perspective each vehicle purchase is made by an individual weighing many factors that vary in importance by that individual based upon their specific needs and values i have purchased both new and used cars and i have weighted each of these factors as part of each decision and the relative weightings have varied based upon my individual situation read freakonomics to gain a better understanding of the reasons why you can not find a good used car the summary is the imbalance of knowledge between the buyer and seller and the lack of trust although much of economics assumes perfect market information margin profit comes from uncertainty or an imbalance of knowledge   buying a used car requires a certain amount of faith in people and you can not always trust the trading partner to be honest price the price or more precisely the value proposition of the vehicle is a large concern for many of us larger than we might prefer that it be selection a buyer has the largest selection of vehicles when they shop for a new vehicle finding the color features and upgrades that you want on your vehicle can be much harder even impossible for the used buyer and once you have found the exact vehicle you want now you have to determine whether the vehicle has problems and can be purchased at your price preference a buyer may simply prefer to have a vehicle that looks new smells new is clean and does not have all the that even a gently used vehicle would exhibit this may include issues of pride image and status where the buyer may have strong emotional or psychological needs to through ownership of a particular vehicle with particular features reviews new vehicles have mountains of information available to buyers who can read about safety and reliability ratings learn about problems from the trade press and even price shop and compare between brands and models contrasted with the minimal information available to used vehicle shoppers unbalanced knowledge the seller of a used car has much greater knowledge of the vehicle and thus much greater power in the negotiation process buying a used car is going to cost you more money than the value of the car unless the seller has poor knowledge of the market and since many used cars are sold by dealers who have often taken advantage of the less knowledgeable sellers in their transaction you are unlikely to purchase the vehicle at a good price fear risk many people want transportation and buying a used car comes with risk and that risk includes both the direct cost of repairs and the inconvenience of both the repair and the loss of work that problems knowing that the car has not been abused that there are no hidden or problems waiting to leave you stranded is valuable placing a price on the risk of a used car is hard especially for those who only want a reliable vehicle to drive placing an estimate on the risk cost of a used car is one area where the seller has a distinct advantage warranties new vehicles come with substantial warranties and this is another aspect of the fear risk point above a new vehicle does not have unknown risk associated with the purchase and also comes with peace of mind through a manufacturer warranty you can purchase a used car warranty but they are expensive and often come with different problems finance terms a buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle and you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs own versus rent you are assuming that people actually want to own their cars and i would suggest that people want to own their car until it begins to present problems repair and maintenance issues and then they want a new vehicle to replace it but renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive and less flexible means to obtain transportation expense allocation a vehicle is an expense as the owner of a vehicle you are willing to pay for that expense to fill your need for transportation paying for the product as you use the product makes sense and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle capital allocation a buyer may need a vehicle either to commute to work school doctor or for work or business but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts credit cards loans the buyer may not have savings but be able to obtain financing to solve that need remember people need transportation and they are willing to pay to fill their need but they also have varying needs for all of the above factors and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals

at the moment you are paying about $ 1,300 interest each month £ 12 on your mortgage and repaying capital at about $ 1,500 per month paying $ 11,000 off your mortgage would save you about $ 9,000 as it is reduces your balance by about seven monthly capital repayments but you will only see this benefit at the end of the mortgage because you will pay it off seven months earlier there is only about $ 1,000 interest remaining on your car loans paying the $ 11,000 off your interest free loan then paying extra the interest bearing loan brings that down to $ 500 and paying it off your interest bearing loan brings it down to $ 200 either way both car loans would be finished by early 2018 in summary if you use the $ 11,000 against your car loans you will save $ less than paying it off the mortage but you will have no car loans in one year rather than three google spreadsheet for calculations here

in order to understand how much you might gain or lose from participating in the futures markets it is important to first understand the different ways in which the slope of the futures markets can be described in many of the futures markets there is a possibility of somebody buying a commodity at the spot price and selling a futures contract on it in order to do this they need to hold the commodity in storage most commodities cost money to hold in storage so the futures price will tend to be above the spot price for these commodities   in the case of stock index futures the holder receives a potential benefit from holding the stocks in an index    if the futures market is upward sloping compared to the spot price then it can be called normal if the futures market is usually downward sloping compared to the spot price then it can be called inverted if the futures market is high enough above the spot price so that more of the commodity gets stored for the future then the market can be called in contango if the futures market is below the point where the commodity can be profitably stored for the future and the market can be called in in many of these cases there is an implicit cost that the buyer of a future pays in order to hold the contract for certainly time your question is how much money you make if the price of gold goes up by a specific amount or how much money you lose if the price of gold goes down by the same specific amount   the problem is you do not say whether it is the spot price or the futures price which goes up or down   in most cases it is assumed that the change in the futures price will be similar to the change in the spot price of gold   if the spot price of gold goes up by a small amount then the futures price of gold will go up by a small amount as well   if the futures price of gold goes up by a small amount this will also drive the spot price of gold up   even for these small price changes the expected futures price change in expected spot price change will not be exactly the same   for larger price changes there will be more of a difference between the expected spot price change in expected future price change    if the price eventually goes up then the cost of holding the contract will be subtracted from any future gains   if the price eventually goes down then this holding cost should be added to the losses   if you bought the contract when it was above the spot price the price will slowly drift toward the spot price causing you this holding cost   if the price of gold does not change any from the current spot price then all you are left with is this holding cost

almost all companies in the us have changed from formal pension programs to 401k plans and most companies that still have pension programs do n't allow new employees to   enroll in the new program only the previous participants who are vested in the pension plan will get benefits while new employees get enrolled in the 401k plan if this is the case with   your prospective employer then demanding that you be allowed to enroll in the pension plan is likely to be futile in fact the likely response may well be here is our offer take it or leave it or we are withdrawing   the offer we made especially if you are in a field where there are plenty of other people who could do the job instead of you so be sure that you understand what your worth is to the company and how much leverage you have before starting to make counter offers with regard to money that you might have vested in your current employer 's pension plan your options are to leave it there until you retire and start getting a pension generally not advisable in these times when the company might not even exist by then roll it over into an ira or into your new employer 's 401k plan this last is the only matter that concerns your prospective employer and where you might need to ask the new employer 's 401k plan might not be structured to accept rollovers if the money in your current employer 's retirement plan is in a pension plan what is paid out for rolling over might be different and smaller than what has been credited to you thus far for example my state government pension plan credited 8 interest per annum on the amounts i contributed but this was fake money because had i resigned and withdrawn the pension contributions for the purpose of rolling over into an ira or even just taking it as cash i would have received only my contributions plus only 4.5 interest per annum the 8 interest credited is available only for the purpose of the purchase of an immediate annuity upon retirement it is not something that is portable to a new plan and if i want a lump sum payout upon retirement instead of a pension in the form of an annuity it would be the 4.5 rate again

assignment risk in your example if someone exercises otm call your account could be assigned in that case if you do nothing you could lose more money than there is in the account the broker wo n't do it for you because there is more than one way to handle the assignment for example you might choose to exercise the long call or buy a different call and exercise that selling the long call may be enough to satisfy any resulting margin call

payment history is probably the most significant contributor to your credit score   having a solid history of making at least the minimum payments on time will have a positive impact on your credit score   whether or not this specific transaction means anything to that equation is up for debate    if you have no credit lines now and 0 for 18 months on a computer makes sense to you then yes making this purchase this way and paying on time will have a positive impact on your credit score   paying interest does n't help your credit score   repay this computer before the 18 month period ends then be sure to pay your balance in full every month thereafter

i 'd say only look for business opportunities in areas where you have quite a lot of specific knowledge or the ability to learn from someone who already has it   further particularly in a saturated market like the one you describe you need to have a clear idea of how you 're going to be better than other players   it 's not enough to just want to do something to make money   you need a solid plan and a solid angle on how you 're going to be better than others   if you do n't have those things yet for what you 're looking at do more research until you do   if you never get there do n't bother   you 're essentially saying you want to exploit arbitrage opportunities which is a legitimate way to make a living but it requires a lot of market knowledge because there are probably millions of people doing the exact same thing

where you can put the money really depends on your risk tolerance you could take $ 50k and put it into a good share class municipal and government bond fund that would likely be tax exempt in a few years span i do n't think you 're likely to lose much in a tax managed bond fund but it 's certainly possible here is a link for vanguard tax exempt bond funds by state of residency these funds have returns well exceeding cd 's or standard savings accounts risk of loss is real but returns are possible

this is an old question but a new product has popped up that provides an alternative answer there is a website called that allows you to purchase stock gift certificates for others   these come in both electronic and traditional physical form   this meets my question 's original criteria of a gift giver paying for stock without having any of the recipient 's personal information and thus maintaining the gift 's surprise i should note a few things about this service despite these limitations i wanted to post it here so others were aware of it as an option   if no other alternative will work and this is what it takes to get a parent interested in teaching their child to invest then it 's well worth the costs

you 'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in most corporations neither positive nor negative running a business is amoral some business missions have a moral intent such as pharmaceuticals health organization etc but all have an amoral   it 's fairly simplistic the purpose of a business is to produce a profit at some point all successful well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit after they 've established market share a lasting brand customer loyalty finances well in the black and eventually look towards capital preservation in most bodies with a large monetary wealth capital preservation becomes a key focus in other words once you master the art of making money you then need to master the art of keeping it   thus the ability to then focus on these things to continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient but leaky ship the more you preserve the longer you 'll be around and the more power you 'll yield to stick around    this last point is also important to keep in mind unlike you or i a company will basically last forever well at least until society collapses you or i are only here until we die and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin a corporation is always here the people in the corporation amp it 's owners change hands but the corporation survives frankly any business that is n't aiming to make a profit is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a non profit   here is where i would believe the government plays a balancing role to reign in the power of corporations lest they rival their own but any good corporation will handle that problem as well regulatory capture anyone   also consider that for the most wealthy among us it 's probably not about the money anymore it 's now probably about the game this is certainly where the get that manic edge on the rest of us

left out of course is the fact that this is argentina 's default because its policymakers are complete and the fact that instead of not paying anybody by complying with the ruling it could probably have struck a deal with to pay them the principal and interest or a bit less if they were decent negotiators by waiting until december when a bond clause expires that states argentina ca n't willingly pay less to some creditors than others the blame is n't all argentina 's but there 's a reason why this sort of stuff does n't happen in literally any other country in latin america on such a regular basis

if the mortgage is against your primary residence then the only part that 's probably deductible is the mortgage interest   if you pay down your loan principal faster then all other things being equal you 'll get less of a tax deduction because you 'll accrue less interest in the months after you throw a big chunk at the principal the principal is less so the interest is less but do n't worry that 's all right   it 's a tax deduction so your actual tax savings will be only a fraction of the interest you paid so at the end of the day you 'll be saving yourself money

your mortgage represents a negative cash flow of $ x for n months the typical mortgage prepayment does n't reduce your next payment but does reduce the length of the mortgage if you look at the amortization table of a 30 year loan you might see a payment of $ 1000 but only $ 50 going to principal so if on day one you send an extra $ 51 or so to the bank you find that in 30 years you just saved that $ 1000 payment in effect it was a long term bond or cd yielding the post tax rate of the mortgage say your loan were 7 at 7 money doubles every 10 years or so 30 years is 3 doubles or if i were to offer you $ 1000 and ask for $ 7500 in 30 years you might accept it with an agreement to buy me out if you refinanced for me that would be an investment just like buying a bond in fact there is a real return as you see the cash flow at the end the payments not made are your payback   those who insist it 's not an investment are correct in the strict sense of the word 's definition but pedantic for the fact in practice the prepayment is a choice to be considered alongside other investment choices when i have a mortgage i am the the bank the mortgagee same as a company issuing a bond the bank holds my bond and i 'm making payments to them they hold my bond as an investment there is no question of that in fact they package these and sell them as groups of mortgages a pre payment is me buying back the last coupon on my mortgage i fail to see the distinction between me buying back $ 10 k in future coupons on my own loan or me investing $ 10 k in someone else 's loans   the real question for me is whether this makes sense when rates are so low at 4 i 'd say it 's a matter of prioritizing any high rate debt and any other investments that might yield more but even so it 's an investment yielding 4   over the years i 've developed the priorities of where to put new money the priorities are debatable i have my opinion and my reasons to back them up in general it 's a balance between risk and return in my opinion there 's something wrong with ignoring a dollar for dollar match on the 401(k in most circumstances others seem to prefer being 100 debt free before saving at all there 's a balance that might be different for each individual as i started the mortgage is a fixed return with no chance to just get it back if needed if your cash savings is pretty high and the choice is a .001 cd or prepay a 4 mortgage i 'd use some funds to pay it down but not to the point you have no liquid reserves

i suspect this is a function of deregulated banks desire to write and flip as many mortgages as possible the best targets for this sales push were naturally those with the most education who tended to have the best credit ratings and most secure jobs    the last time i bought a house the mortgage salesman practically lit up when looking at my income and credit score pushing me hard to borrow more you could buy a lot more house than this he said you could buy apartments as an investment or for resale   i resisted temptation thank heaven but it 's all too easy to see how millions of others did n't

rich people use depositor banks the same way the rest of us use banks to keep a relatively small store of wealth for monthly expenses and a savings account for a rainy day the bulk of a wealthy person 's money is in investments money sitting in a bank account is not making you more money and in fact as correctly points out would be losing value to inflation now all investments have risk that 's why interest exists if in some alternate universe charging interest were illegal across the board nobody would loan money because there 's nothing to be gained and a lot to lose you have to make it worth my while for me to want to loan you my money because sure as you 're going to use my loan to make yourself wealthier a wealthy person will choose a set of investments that represent an overall level of risk that he is comfortable with much like you or i would do the same with our retirement funds early in life we 're willing to take a lot of risk because there 's a lot of money to be made and time to recover from any losses closer to retirement we 're much more risk averse because if the market takes a sudden downturn we lose a significant portion of our nest egg with little hope of it before we have to start cashing out the very wealthy have similar variances in risk with the significant difference that they are typically already drawing a living from their investments as such they already have some risk aversion but at the same time they need good returns and so they must pay more attention to this balancing act between risk and return managing their investments in effect becomes their new job once they do n't have to work for anyone else anymore the money does the real work and they make the executive decisions about where best to put it the tools they use to make these decisions are the same ones we have they watch market trends to identify stages of the economic cycle that large movements of money to or from safe havens like gold and t debt they diversify their investments to shield the bulk of their wealth from a sudden localized loss they hire investment managers to have a second pair of eyes and additional expertise in navigating the market you or i can do much the same thing by buying shares in managed investment funds or simply consulting a broker the difference is that the wealthy get a more personal touch so what 's the difference between the very wealthy and the rest of us well first is simple scale when a person with a net worth in the hundreds of millions makes a phone call or personal visit to the financial institutions handling their money there 's a lot of money on the line in making sure that person is well looked after if we get screwed over at the teller window and decide to close our the teller can often give us our entire account balance in cash without an our multimillionaire is at the lower end of being able to alter his banks profit loss statements by his decisions and so his bank will fight to keep his business second is the level of control the very wealthy the upper 1 have more or less direct ownership and control over many of the major means of production in this country the factories mines timber farms software houses power plants recording studios etc that generate things of value and therefore new wealth while the average joe can buy shares in these things through the open market their investment is typically a drop in the bucket and their voice in company decisions equally small our decision therefore is largely to invest or not to invest the upper 1 on the other hand have controlling interests in their investments often majority holdings that allow them far more control over the businesses they invest in who 's running them and what they do
