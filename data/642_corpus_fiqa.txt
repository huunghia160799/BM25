a lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law if the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract   if a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative cheaper loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can if rates rise sharply in general due to unusual economic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble   for example the base rate in the uk and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties

to protect yourself from an increase in interest rates get a fixed rate loan the loan terms interest rate number of payments monthly payments will be fixed for the loan of course if rate for the rest of the market drops during the period of the loan you may be able to refinance the loan but if you ca n't refinance or wo n't refinance the drop in rates for the rest of the market does n't help you if you want to be able to have your rate float you can get a variable rate loan of course it can float up or it can float down so you take that risk because of that risk adjustable rate loans start at a lower rate if the market interest rate drops far enough many people will refinance into a fixed rate loan at a lower rate than they could have gotten at the start for adjustable rate loans the lender during the application process details how the rate is determined it is pegged to be x% above some national or international interest rate that they do n't have any control over if that base rate moves then your loan rate may move they also specify how often it will adjust and the maximum it can adjust between each adjustments and over the entire life of the loan   that rate that starts initially lower than the fixed rate loan is the that many people have to pick an adjustable rate loan some do it because they believe they will payoff the loan before the rates get too high or they will see enough increase in income so they can afford the higher monthly payment if rates rise if they are wrong about these things they may find themselves in trouble the terms of the adjustable rate loan still have to follow the terms of the contract the lender ca n't change the offset or the source used to used to set interest rate

interest rates are market driven they tend to be based on the prime rate set by the federal reserve bank because of the tremendous lending capacity of that institution and that other loan originators will often fund their own lending at least in part with fed loans however there is no mandatory link between the federal reserve rate and the market rate no law stipulates that rates can not rise or fall they will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital though a lender asking 10 interest might make no loans when others are willing to lend for 9 the only protection you have is that we are mostly economically free as a borrower you are protected by the fact that there are many lenders likewise as a lender because there are many borrowers stability is simply by virtue of the fact that one market participant with inordinate pricing will find fewer counterparties to transact

there do not appear to be any specific legal measures to prevent bankruptcies   in fact they seems to be part of the means for which rates are raised for the aim of lowering inflation see   the budgetary implications of higher federal reserve board interest rates by dean baker center for economic and policy research the federal reserve board fed is widely expected to start raising    interest rates some time in 2015 the purpose of higher interest rates    is to slow the economy and prevent inflation this is done by reducing    the rate of job creation and thereby reducing the ability of workers    to achieve wage gains

the answer provide by @mbhunter is correct however there are contexts shorting in spot market and carrying the position over settlement usually does not entail payment of dividend to the broker one of the reason being post ex date the price of the share downward adjusts to the extent of the dividend so practically if you have shorted at 100 and post ex date assuming a dividend of 2 and no movement of the stock price the price would slide to 98 the party who the stock 100 now is sitting on a price of 98 and received a dividend of 2 which equates to 100 the above is also to the law of the country governing the exchange and the security exchange board regulations

i live near historic massachusetts and frequently drive past pond i 'm reminded of henry david 's words   simplify simplify simplify in my opinion fewer is better 2 i do n't see how that makes budgeting any easier the normal set of expenses are easily kept as one bucket one account   the savings accounts can also be combined and tracked if you really want to think of them as separate accounts   now when you talk about retirement that can be in tax wise retirement accounts e.g. 401(k ira etc or post tax regular brokerage accounts in our situation the schwab non retirement account was able to handle emergency as money market funds along with vacation rainy day etc in cds of different maturities as an old person i remember cds at 10 or higher so leaving money in lower interest accounts was n't good cash would go to cds at 1 5 year maturities to maximize interest but keep money maturing every 6 9 months   even with the goal of simplifying my wife and i each have a 401(k an ira and a roth ira i also have an inherited roth and i manage my teen 's roth and brokerage accounts that 's 9 accounts right there no way to reduce it   to wrap it up i 'd go back to the first 4 you listed and use the 4 checking attached to the broker account to be the emergency fund now you 're at 3 any higher granularity can be done with a spreadsheet   think of it this way the day you see the house you love will you not be so willing to give up that year 's vacation

that depends where you put the top bracket but probably there is little way to jack income tax to anywhere near that without serious detrimental effect to the economy the real issue is not that the wealthiest earn too much but that they have too much there is a huge glut of massive savings at the top that is continually growing and taking money from the economy this savings drives the creation of public debt more than any other factor it is that which needs to be at least in the near term taxed aggressively

you 're conflating llc with corporation they 're different animals llc does not have s or c designations those are just for corporations i think what you 're thinking about is electing pass through status with the irs this is the easiest way to go the company can pay you at irregular intervals in irregular amounts the irs does n't care about these payments the company will show profit or loss at the end of the year those payments to you are n't expenses and do n't reduce your profit you report this on your schedule c and pay tax on that amount your state tax authority will have its own rules about how this works alternatively you can elect to have the llc taxed as a corporation i do n't know of a good reason why someone in your situation would do this but i 'm not an accountant so there may be reasons out there my recommendation is to get an accountant to prepare your taxes at least once if your situation is the same next year you can use the previous year 's forms to figure out what you need to fill in the investment of a couple hundred dollars is worthwhile on the question of buying a home in the next couple of years yes it does affect things pass through status probably does n't affect much if all of your income is coming from self employment be prepared for hassles when you are shopping for a mortgage you can ask around maybe you have a friendly loan officer at your credit union who knows your history but in general they will want to see at least two years of self employment tax returns you can plan for this in advance talk to a couple of loan officers now to see what the requirements will be that way you can plan to be ready when the time comes

most brokers have a margin maintenance requirement of 30   in your example it would depend on how much money you 're borrowing from your broker on margin consider this you have $ 250 and short aapl at $ 500 on margin this would be a common scenario federal law requires investors to have at least 50 of their margin equity when opening a transaction if your broker had a requirement of 30 they would require that for your $ 500 position you have at least $ 500 .3 = $ 150 equity since you are currently above that number at $ 250 you will not be hit with a margin call say the price of aapl doubles and now your position is worth $ 1000 $ 1000 .3 = $ 300 which is $ 50 above your initial equity your broker will now consider you eligible for a margin call most will not execute the call right away you will often have some time to either sell cover stock or add funds to your account but not all brokers will warn you if you are breaking margin requirements and sometimes margin calls can take you by surprise if you are not paying attention also many will charge interest on extra margin borrowed

not sure how your companies bonus structure is setup but bonuses are typically based on performance commission drives sales people to sell more but once you get to a certain threshold you may find that a sales person is earning enough to their hunger for more so their drive may diminish somewhat bonuses help bridge that gap e.g. you get $ nn bonus at the end of the year if you sell $ by the end of the year this helps ensure the company to reach it 's financial goals so the people who make the products can still get paid    edit i do n't agree that a company should make bonuses par for the course if the company is not doing well no one should get bonuses

started to post this as a comment but i think it 's actually a legitimate answer running a rental property is neither speculation nor investment but a business just as if you were renting cars or tools or anything else that puts it in an entirely different category the property may gain or lose value but you do n't know which or how much until you 're ready to terminate the business so like your own house it really is n't a liquid asset it 's closer to being inventory meanwhile like inventory you need to it on a fairly regular basis by maintaining it finding tenants and so on and how much it returns depends strongly on how much effort you put into it in terms of selecting the right location and product in the first place and in how you market yourself against all the other businesses offering near equivalent product and how you differentiate the product and so on   i think approaching it from that angle deciding whether you really want to be a business owner or keep all your money in more abstract investments then deciding what businesses are interesting to you and running the numbers to see what they 're likely to return as income then making up your mind whether real estate is the winner from that group is likely to produce better decisions among other things it helps you remember to focus on all the costs of the business when doing the math do n't forget that income from the business is taxed at income rates not investment rates and do n't forget that you 're making a bet on the future of that neighborhood as well as the future of that house changes in demographics or housing stock or business climate could all affect what rents you can charge as well as the value of the property and not necessarily in the same direction it may absolutely be the right place to put some of your money it may not explore all the possible outcomes before making the bet and decide whether you 're willing to do the work needed to influence which ones are more likely

i 'm not sure where people keep getting this idea but i see it come up a lot anyway you pay capital gains taxes when you sell an investment that has appreciated it makes no difference when if you reinvest the money or what you invest it in if you are afraid of the tax burden you can minimize it by 1 selling a stock that you have held longer than a year to get the lower long term rate 2 sell a stock that has n't appreciated that much and therefore does n't have a lot of gains to tax 3 sell a stock that 's below purchase price i.e. at a loss to offset any short term gains

some people have this notion that withdrawing dividends from savings    is somehow okay but withdrawing principal is not   note this notion would someone please explain the mistake on and why it 's a    mistake because there may be times where withdrawing principal may be a good idea as one could sell off something that has gained enough that in re balancing the portfolio there are capital gains that could be used for withdrawing in retirement how and why does the sale of financial instrument equate to the    receipt of dividends   in either case one has cash equivalents that could be withdrawn if you take the dividends in cash or sell a security to raise cash you have cash thus it does n't matter what origin it has if i sell a financial instrument that later    appreciates in value then this profit opportunity is lost in the    case of a dividend i 'd still possess the financial security and    benefit from the stock 's appreciation one could argue that the in the case of a dividend by not buying more of the instrument you are missing out on a profit opportunity as well thus are you out to make the maximum profit overall or do you have reason for taking the cash instead of increasing your holding

you 're ignoring the fact that you still had the taxes from the $ 5500 so $ left over when making the traditional ira contribution   so yes the roth ira grew without further taxing more than the traditional ira did but you could 've just as easily invested that $ in the same investments while you 'd owe taxes on them true you 'd still earn a of money   that 's another $ you 've earned not tax free but with gains at the 15 is still $   so you now have $ in the roth available tax free or you have $ available at a 10 or so average rate 12 if you like though i think you 'll find it 's more like 10    say $ plus $ from the not sheltered income after taxes for $ after taxes so you make about $ 2000 more by using the traditional ira for $ 5500 and then just investing the rest in a long term account   the math might be slightly worse if you invest in something that has regular dividend taxes due but if you 're careful to use tax favored investments you should be okay and even if you do n't you 'll still end up ahead in the end if you make the same exact investment as your tax sheltered account ultimately the question is are you paying more in taxes now or later comparing now marginal rate to later average rate   if you are paying more in taxes now then traditional ira plus invest the rest   if you 're paying more later then roth ira

this answer relies on why you are holding shares of a company in the first place so let 's address that so does this mean you would like to vote with your shares on the directions the company takes if so your reasons for selling would be different from the next speculator who only is interested in share price volatility regardless of your participation in potential voting rights associated with your share ownership a different reason to sell is based on if your fundamental reasons for investing in the company have changed   enhancements on this topic include trade management how to deal with position sizes buying and selling partial positions based on price action while keeping a core long term position but this is not something long term investors generally put too much effort in price targets start your long term investment with a price target in mind derived from a future market cap based on your initial fundamental analysis of the company 's prospects and finally there are a lot of things you can do with a profitable investment in shares

i 'd be curious to understand where you live with a condo costing nearly 3x the average home price in the us   that said if you are hell bent on this money is up i am a real estate agent and part of my distaste for the industry is the fact that it is the near opposite of financial fiduciary i am responsible to be truthful and act in the best interest of my client i am specifically not allowed to offer tax or financial advice a client that told me she had a only later shared that she 's using a 3 down fha mortgage and from what i see getting in over her head   in your case look at the requirements for an fha loan i recommend 20 down and the payment be less than 28 principal interest property tax of monthly gross the fha allows as little as 3 down with payment as high as 31 in your case $ 15 k is 3 and depending on the other expenses for the house the payment should be manageable   if your 401(k accounts offer matching i 'd deposit the amount to capture the match no more no less let me illustrate the power of matching say the match is on your first $ 10,000 total between the 2 of you $ 10,000 deposited is $ 20,000 in your retirement account and you are just out of pocket $ 7500 as that 's your net after tax now the $ 20 k in the account allows you to borrow half $ 10,000 at a favorable rate for a 10 year payback so to your question of raiding your retirement accounts i 'd advise the opposite a $ 10 k withdrawal will cost $ 2500 in tax and $ 1000 penalty net $ 6500 better to take the ira transfer it to the 401(k and borrow 50 your $ 40 k across the accounts will let you borrow $ 20 k and keep the retirement savings going   last i respect the answers that say do n't they are actually the right answers mine only applies if you wo n't listen to them in effect you 've asked where to buy rope and i 'm just letting you know where the store is it 's the banks who are happy to sell you the rope to hang yourself

what this means is this the authors of the website claim they have calculated the cost that it will take to fully fund the medicare medicare prescription drug program social security military and civil servant pensions they claim that the government will have to spend $ 114 t to do the things it is currently promising to do and it has n't set aside the money to do it that 's what is meant by an unfunded mandate firstly i would take with a grain of salt the calculations of any website which claims the us is a in its title you know they are coming to this with an agenda secondly this is money that the government has not actually spent the government does n't owe this money to anyone and it is absolutely untrue that you are responsible along with everyone else to pay this back the worst they can claim is that the government will one day have to spend it assuming that nothing else changes in that time a government could pass a law that reduced medicare or raised taxes and the unfunded mandate would simply go away thirdly the calculation must assume a time period over which the money is spent but the site carefully does n't specify it they can make the amount bigger or smaller as they choose just by changing the time period over which it is calculated to give an example an unfunded mandate is a bit like enrolling in a four year college course without knowing how you are going to pay for it you 've said you are going to spend money on tuition you may even have promised your mother you will finish the course but you can in fact drop out if you choose and you do n't owe anything for courses you have n't taken yet   some unfunded mandates can be legal obligations but this is n't one and in neither case are they money you actually owe that 's not to say that unfunded mandates are not a cause for concern they represent a discrepancy between what a government says it will do and what it can currently afford to do as an illustration of how this works you can look at either russia ten years ago or greece right now all the expenditures in these are being cut people are certainly angry but there is nothing they can do to force the government to make those payments

average rent rates will typically rise and fall and are market dependent just like real estate in the short term a collapse in housing like the one we saw in 2008 can induce a spike in rental costs as people walk away or get foreclosed on and move back into apartments that then tends to self adjust as the people who had been in the apartments find a deal on a foreclosed house and move out however one thing i 've seen to be near constant in the apartment business is that a landlord will offer you a deal to get in then increase the rent on you from year to year until you get fed up and move this is a big reason i did n't have the same address for two years in a row until i bought my house the landlord is basically betting that you wo n't want to deal with the hassle of moving and so will pay the higher rent rate even if when you do the math it makes more sense to move even to maintain the same rent rate eventually though you do get fed up look around find the next good deal and move resetting your rent rate i have never not once in my life seen or heard of any landlord offering a drop in rent as a loyalty move to keep you from going somewhere else it 's considered part of the game retailers will price match but most service providers landlords but also utility providers expect a large amount of churn in their customer base as people shop around it averages out

the statistics are misleading the german do not make $ that is basically a $ 140k job back in 2009 some sensationalist articles said that the average worker made $ sitting in the jobs bank that is taking the total labor cost and dividing it by the number of existing employees the most obvious example of why this number is so lopsided is through health care benefits and pensions you get the illusion that the auto worker gets paid very high when labor cost per employee is very high but the labor cost actually includes the current worker 's cost as well as some past worker 's costs so it gets double counted   so yes gm went bankrupt because labor costs were $ no the auto worker did not make $ 75 per hour and yes labor costs for the german workforce is a lot higher than the us workforce but no they do n't actually get paid 2 3x more

first some general advice that i think you should consider a good rule of thumb on home buying is to wait to buy until you expect to live in the same place for at least 5 years this period of time is meant to reduce the impact of closing costs which can be 1 5 of your total buying selling price if you bought and sold in the same year for example then you might need to pay over 5 of the value of your home to realtors lawyers this means that for many people it is unwise to buy a home expecting it to be your starter home if you already are thinking about what your next presumably bigger home will look like if you buy a townhouse expecting to sell it in 3 years to buy a house you are partially gambling on the chance that increases in your 's value will offset the closing costs mortgage interest paid increases in home value are not a sure thing in many areas the total costs of home ownership are about equivalent to the total costs of renting when you factor in maintenance i notice you do n't even mention renting as an option make sure you at least consider it before deciding to buy also do n't buy a house expecting your life situation to make up the difference in your budget if you 're expecting your girlfriend to move in with you in a year that implies that you are n't living together now and maybe have n't talked about it even if she says now that she would move in within a year there 's no guarantee that things work out that way taking on a mortgage is a commitment that you need to take on yourself no one else will be liable for the payments as for whether a townhouse or a detached house helps you meet your needs better do n't get caught up in terminology there are few differences between houses that are universal are cheaper smaller and have condo associations with monthly fees to pay for maintenance on joint property but that is something that differs on a case by case basis do n't get tricked into buying a 1,100 sq ft house with a restrictive hoa instead of a 1,400 sq ft free hold townhouse just because townhouses have a certain reputation the only true difference between a house and a townhouse is that 1 or both of your walls are shared with a neighbor everything else is flexible

the best answer to your question would to be what the interest rates are like in australia itself   the reserve bank sets the target cash which is the market    interest rate on overnight funds it uses this as the instrument for    monetary policy and influences the cash rate through its financial    market operations decisions regarding the cash rate target are made    by the reserve bank board and explained in a media release announcing    the decision at 2.30 pm after each board meeting prior to december    2007 media releases were issued only when the cash rate target was    changed from investopedia how rates are calculated   each central bank 's board of directors controls the monetary policy of its     country and the short term prime    interest rate that banks use to borrow from each other when the    economy is doing well interest rates are in order to curb    inflation and when times are tough cut rates to encourage lending and    inject money into the economy have a look at this from graph from i would then go to a website that allows you to compare graphically whichever interest rate you you could get the raw data and run some analysis to each his own   fyi this topic fx is incredibly complex and i hope my answer satisfies your needs otherwise talk to a quant you will need a ton of data inputs to model the entire economy of australia to try and predict what the central bank will do which is what people try and do everyday best of luck

senate vs. house health care bills   summarized from   1 reduces   subsidies from eligibility from 400 percent of the   federal poverty line which is a hair under $ 100,000 a year for a family of four to 350 percent of the poverty line which is about $   2 reduces premium subsidies which determines the subsidy level which should cover about 70 percent of anticipated health expenses to one with an actuarial value of 58 percent causing people to opt for plans with higher deductibles to offset effects on the elderly the bill   changes the subsidy formula to account for age   3 obamacare 's   growth subsidy cap on premium subsidies   changed from percent of gdp 0.4 percent of gdp meaning program cap   is more likely to hit cutting subsidies to some groups   4 eliminates the individual and employer mandates   may   destabilize the obamacare exchanges and subsidies   5 restricts the already small abortion coverage   6 ends the cost sharing reductions   that lowered out of pocket expenditures for people making less than 250 percent of the federal poverty line not   funded since republicans took over congress the bill pays the insurers the money they ’ve been owed ending the program makes obamacare significantly less attractive for the folks whose policies are so heavily subsidized   7 states given   a great deal more flexibility expedite waiver program with less interference from federal regulators   8) eliminates many obamacare taxes on everything from to high earners   the cadillac tax on pricey employer sponsored insurance postponed until ending an attempt   to our nation ’s hog wild tax subsidies for employer sponsored insurance   presumably senators are keeping the tax in after doing so reduces the apparent cost of a full repeal   9 market stabilization funds designed   to keep the dreaded death spiral from happening by dealing with the major problem driving costs on the exchanges very sick people   details on this are sketchy because states are expected to design programs to meet the goal   if it works it has the potential to substantially improve the sustainability of the exchanges   10 winds down the medicaid expansion funding but not as fast as the house bill    11 it also makes people below the poverty threshold eligible to buy exchange policies with subsidies this coverage is not as generous as medicaid it will probably involve substantial deductibles and but the premiums are capped at 2 percent of family income which for a single person making exactly the federal poverty line would be about $ 20 a month    12 converts medicaid to a per capita allotment rather than an open ended entitlement   like the house bill the senate bill changes the program to a per beneficiary grant based on previous spending levels   it ’s not the block granting of supply dreams but it ’s close this will give states heavy incentives to keep program growth in check especially with future payment growth will be indexed to general inflation rather than the higher medical inflation states can also apply to switch to a block grant formula or to implement a work requirement for medicaid recipients

gt;it certainly was n't a priority for the government to oversee account opening operations at the branch level   finance protection bureau   what the hell are they supposed to be doing then there are already multiple organizations for the institutional level this group was created specifically for consumer level products and they missed one of the most blatant and widespread abuses in recent history   dodd frank is like if my kid crashed my car so i broke his arm to make sure it never happened again making sure he can never crash cause he ca n't even get behind the wheel but failing to consider the greater consequences among those of us who chose to leave big banks for smaller banks who now have carte to gamble in order to compete with the big guys looks to me like a strategy to discredit smaller banks in the end   please explain this one to me because i do n't understand what you mean at all you know most of the bulge bracket banks are against this rule while many community banks have expressed support and what are you talking about freedom to compete against the big guys what are you even talking about and how is that freedom threatened   since you brought up republicans it seems to me like you are a liberal who hears republican regulation and immediately think you have to be against it there are a number of reasons this bill should receive bipartisan support   the guy who sponsored this bill was against the bail outs of 08 and wanted the banks to just fail   the compliance costs under dodd are massive and smaller banks ca n't afford to pay them and they should n't have to because if they fail to meet compliance they will just go bankrupt and wo n't bring the economy down with them    more overhead for compliance = lower deposit rates for clients = ca n't compete with bulge brackets on a side note this is a general rule anyways and why i think its stupid to be using a community bank ever    it removes the orderly liquidation authority and leaves big banks to die instead of getting bailed out   other than the stigma of voting for gop backed repealing of regulation the only real counter argument seems to be elizabeth warren trickle down wall street 1

a big part of why the insurers are pulling is is the uncertainty   the aca model worked in ma and is based on market forces there is no reason it should n't succeed other that being actively by the gop no legislation this big works out of the box yet this one has not been allowed to improve for 8 years and the gop was rewarded for that sabotage   if the insurance companies had clear understanding of the marketplace for the next few years you would not have this problem   there are changes that are needed imo first thing is to get rid of the employee mandate if it was up to me i d change it so no company would offer health insurance i do n't get my car insurance through work why do i get my health insurance from them but that is long term and we need to ease into it   there are other issues as well but they are all   the overall costs are an issue and that is not addressed in aca at all that i do n't have an answer for but the aca did n't make it worse

baseball cards do n't pay dividends but many profitable companies do just that and those that do n't could some day profits dividends is where your analogy falls apart   but let 's take it further   consider if baseball cards could somehow yield a regular stream of income just for owning them then there might be yet another group of people call them the   these i know are the kind of people that would like to own baseball cards over the long term just for their income producing capability   would seek out the cards with the best chance of producing and growing a reliable income stream   they would n't necessarily care about being able to flip a card at an inflated price to a bob but they might take advantage of inflated prices once in a while heck even some of the would enjoy this income while they waited for the eventual capital gain made by selling to a bob at a higher price   plus the could also sell their cards to not just bobs   would be willing to pay more for a card based on its income stream how reliable it is how high it is how fast it grows and where it is relative to market interest rates   a card with a good income stream might even have more value to a dave than to a bob because a dave does n't care as much about the popularity of the player addendum regarding your comment i suppose i 'm still struggling with the best way to present my    question i understand that companies differ in this aspect in that    they produce value but if stockholders can not simply claim a    percentage of a company 's value equal to their share then the fact    that companies produce value seems irrelevant to the bobs you 're right stockholders ca n't simply claim their percentage of a company 's assets rather shareholders vote in a board of directors   the board of directors can decide whether or not to issue dividends or buy back shares each of which puts money back in your pocket   a board could even decide to dissolve the company and distribute the net assets after paying debts and dissolution costs to the shareholders but this is seldom done because there 's often more profit in remaining a going concern i think perhaps what you are getting hung up on is the idea that a small shareholder ca n't command the company to give net assets in exchange for shares   instead generally speaking a company runs somewhat like a democracy but it 's each share that gets a vote not each shareholder since you ca n't redeem your shares back to the company on demand there exists a secondary market the stock market where somebody else is willing to take over your investment based on what they perceive the value of your shares to be and that market value is often different from the underlying book value per share

the article john cites says no correlation but this chart from the article says otherwise   one sees the rate drop from 14 to 4 and housing rise from an index of 50 to near 190 reaching over to my ti ba-35 calculator i see that at 14 $ 1000/mo will buy $ worth of mortgage but at 4 it will buy $ 2 1/2 times the borrowing power for the same payment but wait my friends at west egg tell me that inflation means i ca n't compare $ 1000 in 1980 to the same $ 1000 in 2010 the $ 1,000 inflates to $ i.e. an income rising only with inflation no more and that can fund a mortgage for $ this is 6.5 times the original borrowing power yet the housing index only rose see that crazy chart housing actually got cheaper from 1980 to the peak statistics can say whatever you wish   interest rate change drove all the change in housing prices but not quite as much as it should have   to answer your question i expect that when rates rise and they will housing prices will take a hit in today 's dollars a current $ 1000 borrows at 4 nearly $ 210 k but at 6 just $ if rates took a jump from these record lows that 's the nature of the risk you 'd take

typically mutual funds will report an annualized return it 's probably an average of 8 per year from the date of inception of the fund that at least gives some basis of comparison if you 're looking at funds of different ages they will also often report annualized 1- 3- 5- and year returns which are probably better basis of comparison since they will have experience the same market booms and busts   so yes generally that 8 gets compounded yearly on average at that rate you 'd get your investment doubled in roughly 9 years on average of course past performance ca n't guarantee future results and all that and variation is often significant with returns that high might be 15 one year -2 the next etc hence my emphasis on specifying on average edit based on the fund given in the comments so in your fund the times less than a year 1 mo 3 mo 6 mo 1 yr is the actual relative change that of fund in that time period anything greater is averaged using cagr approach for example the most recent 3 year period probably ending end of last month had a averaged return 2014 2015 and 2016 had individual returns of and thus that total return over that three year period was = 21 return over three years this is the same total growth that would be achieved if each year saw consistent 6.5 growth ^ 3 =   not exactly the but remember we 're looking at a slightly different time window but it 's pretty close and hopefully helps clarify how the calculation is done

on international stock exchanges they trade puts and calls typically also for currencies if for example 1 nok is worth 1 $ now and you buy calls for 10000 nok at 1.05 $ each and in a year the nok is worth 1.20 $ which is what you predict you can execute the call meaning buying the 10000 nok for the contracted 1.05 $ and selling them for the market price of 1.20 $ netting you 12000 = 1500 $ converting those back to nok would give you 1250 nok considering that those calls might cost you maybe 300 nok you made 950 nok note that if your prediction is common knowledge calls will be appropriately priced = expensive and there is little to make on them and note also that if you were wrong your calls are worth less than toilet paper so you lost the complete 300 nok you paid for them all numbers are completely made up for illustration purposes you can make the whole thing easier if you define the raise of the nok against a specific currency for example $ or eur if you can you can instead buy puts for that currency and you save yourself converting the money twice

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

as the owner of the s corp it is far easier for you to move money in out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company loans require interest payments 1099-int forms and have tax consequences whereas the distributions do n't need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed if you were paid interest disregard this answer i do n't know if or how you could re categorize the loan once there 's a 1099-int involved if no interest was ever paid you just need to account for it properly if the company did n't pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099-int form i.e. you wrote a check to the company no promissory note no tax forms no payments no interest etc then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution you can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the irs in quickbooks create the following equity accounts one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions when putting money into the company deposit into your corporate bank account and use the capital contribution equity account when taking money out of the company write yourself a check and use the distributions account at the end of every tax year you can close out your contributions and distributions to retained earnings by making a general journal entry for example debit retained earnings and credit distributions on dec 31 every year to zero out the distributions account for contributions do the reverse and credit retained earnings there are other ways of recording these transactions for example i think some people just use a member capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions and qb might warn you about posting journal entries to the special retained earnings account at the end of the year in any case this is how my cpa set up my books and it 's been working well enough for many years still never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your cpa be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary you ca n't get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits that 's a big red flag that can trigger an audit if you 're simply distributing back the money you already put into the company that should be fine

paying off your mortgage early being good is a myth   it is great for the chronic to have their mortgage paid off so when they rack up credit card bills and get behind well they still a place to stay but for those who are more logical with their money paying off your mortgage early in current conditions makes no sense   you can get a 30 year loan well below 4   discounting taxes for your average family you would have a rate floating below 3    so reasons that paying off your mortgage should be almost last given current low long term interest rates the first thing you should do is take care of any high interest debt   i would say that anything more than 7 8 including all credit card debt should be focus 1 putting money into your retirement savings is 1   you will earn way more than 3 over the long run   you can earn a higher return in the market   even with a very conservative portfolio you can clear 5 6 which will still clear more than 3 after taxes for those who say you ca n't be sure about the market well if the market did bad for 30 years in a row no one will have money and the house will also be worthless if a disaster happens to your house and you own it your money is gone   in many cases you would be able to declare bankruptcy and let the bank take the property as is    there are just too many examples but if you are paying off your house early you lose the flexible liquid money that you now have tied up in the house now the reasons for paying down your mortgage are really easy too you do n't trust your spending habits you want to move up in houses and you want to make sure that you have at least 20 down on future house to skip pmi

i can sell a put on it a bit out of the money and i seemingly win either way i.e. make money on selling the put and either i get to pick up the stock cheaper if xyz goes down or the put expires worthless in 2008 i see a bank stock pick one trading at $ 100 i buy that put from you a $ 90 strike and pay you $ 5 for the option the bank blew up and trades for a dollar i then buy the $ 1 share and sell it to you for $ 90 you made $ 500 on the sale of the put but lost $ when it went bad you do n't win either way there is a chart you can construct or a table showing your profit or loss for every price of the underlying stock when selling a put you need to know what happens if the stock goes to zero since the odds of such an occurrence is non trivial   a leap is already an option with the new coding scheme for options i 'm not sure there 's really any distinction between a leap and standard option the leap just starts with a long till expiration time there are no options on leaps that i am aware of as they are options already

former employee so i have a little insight they are very scared of unionization and also losing their exemption in the railway act this fedex as an airline railway company where ups is a ground shipping company what that means is that fedex has protections against unions fedex ground drivers are not employees they are contractors some of these guys are not happy and the states were changing laws to benefit the workers in some way i 'm not entirely sure how it works but fedex is smart so they are these people as independent service providers they are forcing single route drivers to sell to multi route isp owners when you have an owner that owns multiple routes they ar likely to be pro union and it also puts another barrier between the driver and fedex

if she selects 2012 and contributes $ 500 she will have contributed the maximum allowable amount for 2012 and has the option of contributing the maximum amount for 2013 as well if she chooses to do so if she does not max out her contribution for 2012 by april 15 2013 that opportunity is lost though she continues to have the option of contributing the maximum amount for 2013 whether contributing the maximum allowable amount to a roth ira is a good thing or bad thing is something about which unreasonable people might differ edit   's answer makes a very good point that i will elaborate on and incorporate into this answer eligibility to make a contribution for 2012 is presumably a given at this point there is at least $ 5000 in earned income and agi is not too large see pub 950 for details but eligibility to make a contribution for 2013 is as yet if the 2013 agi turns out to be more than the limit so that the op 's sister can not contribute to a roth ira for 2013 that contribution for 2013 made today will have to be withdrawn or re characterized as a non deductible contribution to a traditional ira for 2013 to the best of my knowledge it will not be possible to re characterize it as a roth ira contribution for 2012 at that point in time so the opportunity to add $ 500 to the roth ira will be lost as joetaxpayer says why not keep options open by making a full contribution for 2012 while the opportunity is there in this sense i think there is a downside to choosing 2013 instead of 2012 for that $ 500 contribution

the answer depends on your wife 's overall situation whether you are in a community property state and other factors i 'm assuming that since your wife paid $ 5,000 more for a car than it was worth has a six year 25 auto loan and you talk about repossession as a routine event that her credit history is extremely poor if that is the case you 're unlikely to be able to refinance particularly for more than the car is worth you 're in a bad situation i 'd look for a legal clinic at a nearby law school and find out what the law says about your situation in your state if she has other debt your best bet is to put the car in a garage somewhere stop paying and demand better terms with the lender threaten bankruptcy if they do n't go for it and your wife has other debt she should look into bankruptcy given the usurious terms of the loan you have a fighting chance of keeping the car in a chapter 13 find out and the legal implications for this before proceeding if she does n't have other debt you need to figure out to get the thing repossessed on the best possible terms for you if it 's her mother 's car you 're in a moral dilemma   bottom line get rid of this thing asap and make sure that going forward you are both controlling the finances

it really depends on the answers to two questions 1 how tight is your budget going to be if you have to make that $ payment every month   obviously you 'd still be better off than you are now since that 's still $ 30 cheaper but if you 're living essentially paycheck to paycheck then the extra flexibility of the $ 400/month option can make the difference if something unforeseen happens   2 how disciplined financially have you proven you can be the i 'll make extra payments every month sounds real nice but many people end up not doing it i should know i 'm one of them i 'm still paying on my student loans because of it if you know by having done it before that you can make that extra $ 130 go out each and every month and not talk yourself into using it on all sorts of more important needs then hey go for it financial flexibility is a great thing and having that monthly nut all your minimum living expenses combined as low as possible contributes greatly to that flexibility   update another thing to consider another thing to consider is what they do with your extra payment will they apply it to the principal or will they treat it as a prepayment if they apply it to principal it 'll be just like if you had that shorter term your principal goes down additionally by that extra amount and the next month you owe another $ 400   on the other hand if they treat it as a prepayment then that extra $ 130 will be applied to the next month 's bill principal stays the same and the next month you 'll be billed $ 270    there are two practical differences for you   1 with prepayment you 'll pay slightly more interest over that 60 months paying it off because it 's not amortized into the loan the principal balance does n't go down faster while the loan exists and since interest is calculated on the remaining principal balance end result is more interest than you otherwise would have paid that sucks but   2 with the prepayment consider that at the end of year 2 you 'd have over 7 months of payments prepaid so if some emergency does come up you do n't have to send them any money at all for 7 months there 's that flexibility again   honestly while this is something you should find out about the loan it 's really still a wash i have n't done the math but with the interest rate amount of the loan and time frame i think the extra interest would be pretty minor

you need to talk to the 401(k administrator or hr for the exact details typically you can only borrow 50 of your balance and can pay it back up to a ten year term some plans have different rules this is just a common offering   the larger issue is whether the loan prevents you from making further deposits till repaid this would cost you not just the growth in the account but the matched deposits for those years that would be a deal killer for me if that were the case i 'd drop my deposits to only get the match and save for a real deposit without the loan

if you are considering this to be an entry for your business this is how you would handle it you said you were making a balance sheet for monthly expenses so on the balance sheet you would be debiting cash for the income statement side you would be crediting owner 's equity to balance the equation assets = liabilities + owner 's equity so if you deposited $ 100 to your account the equation would be affected thus $ 100 in assets debit to cash account = 0 liabilities $ 100 credit to owner 's equity it is correctly stated above from the bank 's perspective that they would be crediting you account with $ 100 and any outflow from the bank account would be debiting your account

your initial premise mid cap and small cap company stocks have outperformed the market is partially correct they have over many 40 yr periods provided higher returns than large caps or bond funds the important thing to consider here is that risk adjusted the returns from a diversified portfolio are far more robust with proper asset allocation you and expect high returns and reduce your risk simultaneously   imagine this scenario you decide to stick to small mid caps for 10 15 yrs and move into a more diversified portfolio then had you made that decision during a sustained period of poor small cap performance late 80s or the 40 's you would have lost a of return as those were periods were small underperformed the market as a whole and large caps in particular as an example from 1946 to large caps outperformed small every single year if 2016 were to be the first year of a similar trend you 've done yourself a major disservice   since the dot com crash small have outperformed for sure pretty much every year but that does n't mean that they will continue to do so the reason asset allocation exists is precisely this over a 40 yr period no single asset class outperforms a diversified portfolio   if you attempt to time the market even if you do so with a multi decade time horizon in mind there a good chance that you will do more poorly

to add to 's answer this is almost certainly a scam   the money deposited into your account is not from a person that made an honest mistake with account numbers   it 's coming from someone that has access to send money that is n't their own   i do n't know exactly what they 're doing to send the money but at some point in the near future your bank will claw that money back from you on the grounds that it was transferred to you in the first place   if you send someone money on the premise that you 're returning this money then that will be a separate transaction which wo n't be undone when the deposit in question is undone another possibility is that this person has gained access to an account from which they can send domestic wires but not international wires   their hope is to send money to someone domestically you and that this person will then send the money on to nigeria   if you comply with them you in a worst case scenario could be seen as a money laundering in addition to having the deposit taken back from you   it 's not very likely you would n't be seen as another victim of a scam but people have been thrown in jail for less you should not respond to this person at all   do n't answer the phone when they call and ignore their emails   do n't delete the emails it 's possible that someone at the bank or le want them   call your bank immediately and tell them what 's up

this is not an end all answer but it 'll get you started i have been through accounting courses in college as well as worked as a contractor files as sole proprietor for a few years but i am not an accountant following 's answer if you 're making that much money you should hire a bean counter to at least overlook your bookkeeping what type of business first if you 're the sole owner of the business you will most likely file as a sole proprietorship if you do n't have an official business entity you should get it registered officially asap and file under that name the problem with sole proprietorships is liability if you get sued not only are your business assets vulnerable but they can go after your personal assets too including house cars etc legally you and your business are considered one and the same to avoid liability issues you could setup a s corporation basically the business is considered it 's own entity and legal matters can only take as much as the business owns you gain more protection but if you do n't explicitly keep your business finances separate from your personal finances you can get into a lot of trouble also corporations generally pay out more in taxes technically since the business is it 's own entity you 'll need to pay yourself a reasonable salary if you skip the salary and pay yourself the profits directly ie evade being taxed on income salary the irs will shut you down that 's one of the leading causes of corporations being shut down you can also pay distribute bonuses on top of that but it would be wise to burn the words within reason into your memory first the tax man gets mad if you short him on payroll taxes   s corporations are complicated if you go that route definitely seek help from an accountant bookkeeping if you 're not willing to pay a full time accountant you 'll need to do a lot of studying about how this works generally even if you have a sole proprietorship it 's best to have a separate bank account for all of your business transactions every source drain of money will fall into one of 3 categories assets what your business owns assets can be categorized by liquidity meaning how fast you can transform them directly into cash just because a company is worth a lot does n't necessarily mean it has a lot of cash some assets depreciate lose value over time whereas some are very hard to transform back into cash based on the value and/or market fluctuations like property liabilities what you owe others and what others owe you everything you owe and everything that is owed to you gets tracked just like credit cards it 's completely possible to owe more than you own as long as you can pay the interest to maintain the loans equity the net worth of the company the approach they commonly teach in schools is called double entry bookkeeping where they use the equation in practice i prefer the following because it makes more sense basically if you account for everything correctly both sides of the equation should match up if you choose to go the sole proprietorship route it 's smart to track everything i 've mentioned above but you can choose to keep things simple by just looking at your equity equity the heart of your business basically every transaction you make having to do with your business can be simplified down to debits money value increasing and credits money value decreasing for a very simple company you can assess this by looking at net profits which can be calculated with revenues are made up of money earned by services performed and goods sold expenses are made up of operating costs materials payroll consumables interest on liabilities etc basically if you brought in 250 k but it cost you 100 k to make that happen you 've made 150 k for the year in profit so for your taxes you can count up all the money you 've made revenues subtract all of the money you 've paid out expenses and you 'll know how much profit you 've made the profit is what you pay taxes on the kicker is there are gray areas when it comes to deducting expenses for instance you can deduct the expense of using your car for business but you need to keep a log and can only expense the miles you traveled explicitly for business same goes for deducting dedicated in your house basically do the research if you 're not 100 sure about a deduction if you do n't keep detailed books and try to expense stuff without proof you can get in trouble if the irs comes knocking there are always mythical stories about that one guy who wrote off his boat on his taxes but in reality you can go to jail for tax fraud if you do that it comes down to this at the end of the year if your business took in a ton of money you 'll owe a lot in taxes the better you can justify your expenses the more you can reduce that debt one last thing you 'll also have to pay your personal federal state taxes including self employment tax that means medicare social security etc if this is your first into self employment you 're probably not familiar with the fact that 1099 employers pick up 1/2 of the 15 medicare social security bill typically if you have an idea of what you make annually you should be paying this out throughout the year my pay as a contractor was always erratic so i usually paid it out once twice a year it 's better to pay too much than too little because the gov't will give you back the money you overpaid at the end of the day paying taxed sucks more if you 're self employed but it balances out because you can make a lot more money if as you said you 've broken six figures hire a damn accountant adviser to help you out and start reading when people say a business degree will help you advance in any field it 's subjects like accounting are core requirements to become a business undergrad if you do n't have time for more school and do n't want to pay somebody else to take care of it there 's plenty of written material to learn it on your own it 's not rocket surgery just basic arithmetic and a lot of business jargon ie almost as much as technology

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had n’t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

while i 'm sure there 's some truth to the argument that unsophisticated retail investors index against the s&amp;p 500 thinking that they 're tracking the market i do n't think it makes sense to steer the s&amp;p 500 in that direction to cater to that lowest common denominator the ad conclusion of that course of action of course would be to abolish the s&amp;p 500 entirely and move those assets into the s&amp;p total market index but clearly there 's value in having an index that tracks us large caps with single share classes just as there 's value in having an index that tracks us large caps in general   as for whether it will be a loss for passive investors it will be interesting to see how that pans out maybe good corporate governance and direct accountability by managers really do contribute positively to returns in the long run and investors will benefit from this change as a result or maybe this will result in companies with multiple share classes being undervalued and create an opportunity to earn outsized returns by investing in them and indexes that omit those companies will underperform only time will tell

the everyday investor buys at the ask and sells at the bid but the market maker does the opposite this is misleading it has nothing to do with being either an investor or a market maker it is dependent on the type of order that is submitted when a market trades at the ask this means that a buy market order has interacted with a sell limit order at the limit price when a market trades at the bid this means that a sell market order has interacted with a buy limit order at the limit price an ordinary investor can do exactly the same as a market maker and submit limit orders furthermore they can sit on both sides of the bid and ask exactly as a market maker does in the days before high frequency trading this was quite common an example being whose traders were notorious for stepping in front of the designated market maker 's bid ask on the island ecn an order executes only when both bid and ask meet bid = ask this is completely incorrect a transaction occurs when an active marketable order is matched with a passive limit book order if the passive order is a sell limit then the trade has occurred at the ask and if it is a buy limit the trade has occurred at the bid the active orders are not bids and asks the only exception to this would be if the bid and ask have become crossed when a seller steps in he does so with an ask that 's lower than the stock 's current ask almost correct he does so with an order that 's lower than the stock 's current ask if it 's a marketable order it will fill the front best bid and if it 's a limit order his becomes the new ask price a trade does not need to occur at this price for it to become the ask this is wrong market makers are the opposite party to you so the prices are the other way around for them this is wrong there is no distinction between the market maker and yourself or any other member of the public beside the fact that designated market makers on some exchanges are obliged to post both a bid and ask at all times you can open an account with any broker and do exactly the same as a market maker does although with nothing like the speed that a high frequency market making firm can hence likely making you uncompetitive in this arena the prices a market maker sees and the types of orders that they are able to use to realize them are exactly the same as for any other trader

contrary to popular belief you can build your credit if that is important to you without paying a penny in interest   this is done through the responsible use of credit cards paying the bill in full each month without accruing any interest charges if i were you i would pay off the loan today if possible   after that if you decide you need to build up your credit apply for a credit card   if you have difficulty with that you can get a small secured credit card or retail store credit card until you have enough history to get a regular credit card

there are cases where it makes sense to insure something even if you can bear its loss   insurance is a tool to control risk   one reason you might want to control risk is indeed if you can not afford to bear it 's loss   however there are other reasons you might wish to insure something when you look at your life in totality let 's say you have $ 100 to work with and you have an item a that costs $ 30 perhaps you really need a in your life but its clear here that you can afford to replace it so maybe you do n't insure it   then you get item b which also costs $ 30 and item c which costs $ 30   we can see that you can cover all three of these total value $ 90 so one might argue that you do n't need to insure it now let 's add item d onto the plate also at a cost of $ 30   now you 're in an interesting position with 4 items you depend on a b c and d which have a sum total replacement cost of $ 120   now if all of these break or are stolen you no longer have the funds to replace them   of course what are the odds that all of them break at the same time   you may be able to do the math to determine the probability of going broke and use that to determine whether you want to insure the item or not now consider that you will have to make a similar mathematical analysis for every additional purchase you make   you will also have items which you can bear to lose but you really do n't want to   these can add a large amount of effort to every decision you make   it may be worth getting insurance in such a case   one could think of the purchase in two parts   there is the part that accounts for the statistical expectation of loss and the other is the insurance company 's profits   the profits could be thought of as paying the insurance company for a service which makes it easier for you to think through complicated decisions by removing risk

every year you save your receipts track your expenses and when april comes around pay your taxes but what if you know of someone who is n't as honest as you are someone who on their income or information in order to be placed in a lower bracket   the internal revenue service irs estimates that americans underpay their articles tax by about $ billion every year according to barron 's the popular financial news website and magazine in fiscal 2009 the irs collected $ billion in enforcement revenue this process required the employment of thousands of revenue officers agents and special agents unfortunately this type of enforcement happens every year and often spans to multiple previous years in the end there is still a large amount of tax money that goes unpaid   there 's definitely a gap between the tax and the irs evaders are usually exposed due to a slip up on their part or a tip from a bystander if you 'd like to help close that gap you can but why should you and how is it done   why help the irs   nobody likes paying more than their fair share of taxes in order to compensate for others who intentionally evade theirs why should n't tax evaders give up a portion of their incomes to provide things that benefit the general good like roads and when you do reporting a tax cheat is like reporting a you 're just asking them to pay for something they 're trying to unfairly get for free   gather the evidence   the irs is not likely to pursue someone without good reason if the time and resources are going to be spent the odds need to be good that the efforts will result in a payoff besides determining who what where when and why the person his or her taxes the irs will need specific information type of violation availability of books or records having a hunch without supporting details just is n't good enough   also ensure that the evasion is financially significant enough for example stating that your neighbor failed to report a $ 50 babysitting earning is not going to interest the irs on the other hand if you work for a large business that you suspect is its income the irs will likely be very interested   blowing the whistle on a tax cheat   the irs may pay awards in exchange for valuable information that leads to the collection of taxes penalties interest or other amounts from the taxpayer according to the agency 's website there are various types of awards granted depending on the 's income level and classification business or individual the irs likely chooses to focus its efforts on these larger cases because they have a higher payoff it has also been suggested that higher income individuals have been found to cheat more frequently and for higher sums of money mostly because they tend to earn more self reported income   cover your assets   a complaint in order to spite an undesirable neighbor who does in fact pay taxes is not a good way to get revenge when you sign off on the irs form providing your report you are stating i declare under penalty of perjury that i have examined this application my accompanying statement and supporting documentation and that such application is true correct and complete to the best of my knowledge you do n't want to be found guilty of perjury   keep it legal   breaking into the cfo 's office at work to get evidence to support your claim is not a good idea the irs does n't want you to break the law to help find a tax cheat however if you are the bookkeeper for a company that is cheating on its taxes and part of your job involves working with documents that prove the company is cheating that paperwork would be acceptable to submit to the irs   while the irs wants to maintain your privacy if the case against the person you report ends up going to trial you could be asked to be a witness if you 're comfortable with that possibility go ahead and put your name on the report   reasons not to report a cheat   if your information is really just speculation it 's probably best to keep it to yourself as explained earlier in this article the irs does not have the resources to pursue your hunch   if you yourself are a tax cheat it might be best to stay in the clear there 's nothing that says that people who submit claims of cheating by others will have their own tax returns examined more carefully still it stands to reason that you would n't want to do anything to call irs attention to yourself if you 're not in compliance with its rules   if you helped plan or initiate the cheating of the person you are reporting it might be smart to think twice if you decide to report a crime in which you took part be prepared for the consequences and definitely do n't expect to receive a reward   as with many government processes there 's a lot of red tape to cut through therefore if you 're looking for fast cash you might want to look elsewhere it can take several years to complete an investigation of tax evasion and if there is no conviction there is no award not only does the irs have to determine guilt it has to actually collect the amount owed before paying you what 's more if the irs determines that your tip did not substantially contributed to the service 's detection and recovery of tax you will not receive an award   it 's also important to note that under some circumstances like attorney client confidentiality you may not be able to report tax cheating   other considerations   if you earn a whistle blower award it will need to be reported when you file your taxes if you 're blowing the whistle on your employer and you 're not planning to change jobs an irs audit could make your work situation extremely unpleasant this is n't to say that you should n't report someone who is cheating but it is something to consider   what 's next   if you decide to report the person or business you suspect of cheating use irs this form asks for basic information on the tax you are reporting the types of violations you believe to be committed the details of the violation and how you learned about it if you do not want to fill out this form you can also simply write the irs a letter if you are providing your name and want the possibility of receiving an award also submit irs form which is an application for the award   the bottom line   underpayment of federal income taxes and subsequently state income taxes is a serious problem the irs encourages people to submit tips by allowing anonymous submissions and offering generous rewards for who are willing to identify themselves if you can substantiate your claims and are willing to accept the potential consequences of reporting a tax cheat can be lucrative not only for the government but also for you   take control of your money    whether you ’re buying a home consolidating debt or planning a

individual product prices do not necessarily rise at inflation rates   what inflation means is that the purchasing power of one unit of currency decreases by x% in a year which is typically measured by looking at a broad spectrum of products in an economy and to all products   so for all products across an economy the aggregate price of all goods will on average be x% higher that they were this time last year   some products will be cheaper some will be more expensive but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates for the other part of your question inflation is an annualized percentage so an inflation rate of 12 means prices are 12 higher than they were a year ago so if you extrapolate that linear trend prices will rise again on average 1 in a month

gt creating goods and services people are willing to pay for   let 's get real here you are using terms like economic rich and political rich so that you can ascribe to them whatever meaning you like   they are both perfectly phrases but i do n't see how value investing = = creating goods and services people will pay for       i think you just like to imagine these big strong entrepreneurs who make a buck while making the world better and over there are these leeches that suck at the government      things are n't that simple and yes the overlap is significant   essentially the policy makers in america work for the rich   all this of regulation totally misguided which lobbyists do you think asked for that and in some cases actually wrote the legislation for the lawmakers   it was n't my lobbyist and it was n't yours it was the lobbyist employed by the economic elites   every regulation serves as a barrier to entry for smaller newer competitors        for whatever historical reason that 's the case today in the usa if we want it changed we got ta strip political power from all economic elites build a wall between the two worlds that is so broad so firm that nobody tries to breach it

this is how its done   i am a certain french bank aka   i have some piigs debt i can use this as collateral at face value 100 with the ecb in order to secure cash lets say i use 1mn of italian debt this has an clean of 88   i use that 88 to get me 100 1mn of cash from which i buy another for 88 of which i use as collateral pledged to the ecb to get this get another   so now i am long 3 all pledged to the ecb and i have 36 in cash and i owe the ecb in 3 years   remember the yield on my shitty is a lot higher than the interest on the deposits   secondly i have three years so i do n't need to give a fuck about the mark to market on the notes i could even buy a 2 year and n month note maturing just before so i can make some free yield at the ecb 's expense   also this frees up 36 in cash of which i can use to meet short term funding instead of tapping the bond market this trade can be made infinitely although the ecb might catch on   you can view it as getting a mortgage on your house to buy another house then mortgaging house 2 to buy house 3 and so on

yes pmi is what the lender requires to loan you more than of the home 's value i could easily present scenarios where it 's exactly the right decision to use pmi and get the purchase done a 100 k mortgage at 90 ltv will cost you $ in pmi   if you are renting and struggling to get a higher downpayment it can take quite a long time to save the additional $ 11 k to put down only the buyer can know if the house is such s bargain or if rates have bottomed but the decision is n't so clear cut

if you download the historical data from yahoo you will see two different close prices the one labeled close is simply the price that was quoted on that particular day the one labeled adj close is the close price that has been adjusted for any splits and dividends that have occurred after that date   for example if a stock splits 10:1 on a particular date then the adjusted close for all dates prior to that split will have been divided by 10 if a dividend is paid then all dates prior will have that amount subtracted from their adjusted quote using the adjusted close allows you to compare any two dates and see the true relative return

you really should consider sitting down with an independent financial advisor to run the numbers for the various options and discuss what risks you 're comfortable with and what your requirements goals are this is n't a simple decision   unfortunately advice i 've seen suggested that some portion of the money should stay in the market earning market rate of return exactly how much and invested in what is complicated an annuity is essentially an insurance policy   the company assumes the risks and promises you specific payments in exchange for keeping the money   they would n't do so if they did n't think that on average they 'll pay out less than the combination of your purchase price plus earnings so you really are paying a fee for this service whether it 's worth that cost and for how much of your money depends on how much you have saved and how risk tolerant you are i 'm going to steal a moment here to point out that many charities offer annuities these may or may not pay out less than commercial annuities   but the profits go to a better cause either way if you plan to leave part of your estate as donation to a charity anyway this basically lets them have the money earlier while you continue to receive income from it

i strongly recommend that you talk to an accountant right away because you could save some money by making a tax payment by january 15 2014 you will receive forms 1099-misc from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you a copy will go to the irs also you file a schedule c with your form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099-misc forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received e.g. amounts less than $ 600 for which a 1099-misc does not need to be issued or tips say if you are a taxi driver running your own cab and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income including tools books or gasoline etc that you bought for doing the job you will need to file a schedule se that will compute how much you owe in social security and medicare taxes on the net income on schedule c. you will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employee 's share but also the employer 's share at least you will not have to pay income tax on the employer 's share your net income on schedule c will transfer onto form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe and then add on the social security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid you will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013 plus   interest on the tax paid late   send the irs a check for the total if you talk to an accountant right away he she will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe and sending in that amount by january 15 will save some money the accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above

if i were you i would pay off these loans today here are the reasons why i would do this car loan for car loans in particular it 's much better to not pay interest on a loan since cars lose value over time so the longer you hold the debt the more you end up paying in interest as the car continues to lose value this is really the opposite of what you want to do in order to build wealth which is to acquire assets that gain value over time   i would also recommend that once you pay the loan that you set aside the payment you used to make on the loan as savings for your next car that way you will be able to pay cash for your next car avoiding thousands of dollars of interest you will also be able to negotiate a better price by paying cash just by doing this you will be able to either afford to buy a nicer car with the same amount of money or to put the extra money toward something else student loan for the student loan 3 is a very low rate historically however the reason i would still pay these off is that the return you are getting by doing so is completely risk free you ca n't often get this type of return from a risk free investment instrument and putting money in the stock market carries risk so to me this is an easy way to get a guaranteed return on your money the only reason i might not pay this down immediately is if you have any other debt at a rate higher than 3 general reasons to get out of debt overall one of the basic functions of lifetime financial planning is to convert income into assets that produce cash flow this is the reason that you save for retirement and a house so that when your income ends when you 're older these assets will produce cash or in the case of the house that you will no longer have to make rent payments similarly paying off these debts creates cash flow as you no longer have to make these payments it also reduces your overall financial risk as you 'd need less money to live on if you lost your job or had a similar emergency you can probably reduce your emergency fund a bit too discharging these loans will also improve your debt to income ratio if you are thinking of buying a house soon i wonder whether as someone who 's responsible with money the prospect of cutting two large checks feels like big spending to you even though it 's really a prudent thing to do and will save you money however if you do pay these off i do n't think you 'll regret it

what a lovely position to find yourself in there 's a lot of doors open to you now that may not have opened naturally for another decade if i were in your shoes benefiting from the hindsight of being 35 now at 21 i 'd look to do the following two things before doing anything else 1- put 6 months worth of living expenses in to a savings account a rainy day fund 2- if you have a pension i 'd be contributing enough of my salary to get the company match then i 'd top up that figure to 15 of gross salary into stocks shares isas with a view to them also being retirement funds now for what to do with the rest some thoughts first house if you do n't want to live in it just yet i 'd think twice about buying you would n't want a house to limit your career mobility or prove to not fit your lifestyle within 2 years costing you money to move on travel spending it all on travel would be excessive travel tends to be more interesting on a lower budget that is meeting people and riding trains and buses putting a amount in an account to act as a natural budget for this might be wise wealth managers approx 12 gain over 6 years so far equates to about 1.9 annual return not even beat inflation over that period so guessing they had it in ultra safe cash a guaranteed way to lose money over the long term give them the money to look after again i 'd sooner do it myself with a selection of low cost vehicles and equal or beat their return with far lower costs decisions a if you decided not to use the money for big purchases for at least 4 5 years then you could look to invest it in equities as you mentioned a broad basket of high yielding shares would allow you to get an income and give opportunity for capital growth the yield income could be used for your travel costs over a few years you could fill your isa allowance and realise any capital gains to stay under the annual exemption over 4 years or so it 'd all be tax free b if you do want to get a property sooner then the best bet would to seek out the best interest rates current accounts fixed rate accounts etc are offering the best interest rates at the moment usual places like and would help you identify them there 's nothing wrong with sitting on this money for a couple of years whilst you your way with it it might n't earn much but you 'd likely keep pace with inflation and you definitely would n't lose it or risk it unnecessarily c if you wanted to diversify your investment you could look to buy to let as the other post suggested this would require a 25 deposit and likely would cost 10 of rental income to have it managed for you there 's room for the property to rise in value and the rent should cover a mortgage but it may come with the headache of poor tenants or periods of so it 's not the buy and forget that many people assume with some effort though it may provide the best route to making the most of the money d some mixture of all of the above at different stages your money your choices and a valid choice would be to sit on the cash until you learn more about your options and feel the direction your heart is pointing you hope that helps i 'm happy to elaborate if you wish chris

great question while investing in individual stocks can be very useful as a learning experience my opinion is that concentrating an entire portfolio in a few companies stock is a mistake for most investors and especially for a novice for several reasons after all only a handful of professional investors have ever beaten the market over the long term by picking stocks so is it really worth trying if you could i 'd say go work on wall street and good luck to you diversification for many investors diversification is an important reason to use an etf or index fund if they were to focus on a few sectors or companies it is more likely that they would have a sided risk profile and might be subject to a larger downside risk potential than the market as a whole i.e. do n't put all your eggs in one basket diversification is important because of the nature of compound investing if you take a significant hit it will take you a long time to recover because all of your future gains are building off of a smaller base this is one reason that younger investors often take a larger position in equities as they have longer to recover from significant market declines while it is very possible to build a balanced diversified portfolio from individual stocks this is n't something i 'd recommend for a new investor and would require a substantial college level understanding of investments and in any case this portfolio would have a more discrete efficient frontier than the market as a whole lower volatility picking individual stocks or sectors would could also significantly increase or decrease the overall volatility of the portfolio relative to the market especially if the stocks are highly cyclical or correlated to the same market factors so if they are buying tech stocks they might see bigger and downswings compared to the market as a whole or see the opposite effect in the case of utilities in other words owning a basket of individual stocks may result in an unintended volatility beta profile lower trading costs and taxes investors who buy individual stocks tend to trade more in an attempt to beat the market after accounting for commission fees transaction costs bid ask spread and taxes most individual investors get only a fraction of the market average return one famous academic study finds that investors who trade more trail the stock market more trading also tends to incur higher taxes since short term gains < 1 year are taxed at marginal income tax rates that are higher than long term capital gains investors tend to trade due to behavioral failures such as trying to time the market being speculating on stocks instead of long term investing following what everyone else is doing and getting in and out of the market as a result of an emotional reaction to volatility ie buying when stocks are high rising and selling when they are low falling investing in index funds can involve minimal fees and discourages behavior that causes investors to incur excessive trading costs this can make a big difference over the long run as extra costs and taxes compound significantly over time it 's hard to beat the market since markets are quite efficient another reason to use funds is that it is reasonable to assume that at any point in time the market does a fairly good job of pricing securities based on all known information in other words if a given stock is trading at a low p e relative to the market the market as a whole has decided that there is good reason for this valuation this idea is based on the assumption that there are already so many professional analysts and traders looking for arbitrage opportunities that few such opportunities exist and where they do exist persist for only a short time if you accept this theory generally obviously the market is not perfect there is very little in the way of insight on pricing that the average novice investor could provide given limited knowledge of the markets and only a few hours of research it might be more likely that opportunities identified by the novice would reflect of relevant information trying to make money in this way then becomes a bet that other informed professional investors are wrong and you are right options traders for example prices are unpredictable behave like random walks if you want to make money as a long term investor owner rather than a speculator trader than most of the future change in asset prices will be a result of future events and information that is not yet known since no one knows how the world will change or who will be tomorrow 's winners or losers much less in 30 years this is sometimes referred to as a random walk you can point to fundamental analysis and say x company has great free cash flow so i will invest in them but ultimately the problem with this type of analysis is that everyone else has already done it too for example warren buffett famously already knows the price at which he 'd buy every company he 's interested in buying when everyone else can do the same analysis as you the price already reflects the market 's take on that public information market theory and what is left is the unknown i would n't use the term random overall i think there is simply a very large potential for an individual investor to make a few mistakes with individual stocks over 20 + years that will really cost a lot and i think most investors want a balance of risk and return versus the largest possible return and do n't have an interest in developing a professional knowledge of stocks i think a better strategy for most investors is to share in the future profits of companies buy holding a well diversified portfolio for the long term and to avoid making a large number of decisions about which stocks to own

a better question would be to ask why do n't movie theaters charge to use the bathroom or why do n't movie theaters charge for parking in america either government regulation or the mall itself forbids charging for parking or limits the amount that can be charged for parking this tends to be more true in suburban areas where land is cheap but less true downtown in cities the nearest theater to me is in a mall that is also on a metro line those who arrive by metro to see the movie are effectively subsidizing those who arrive via automobile and park i do n't know of any place in america that charges to use the bathroom but the practice is still common in europe i saw the second the matrix film in brussels and had to pay to pee i 'm not sure why this is n't the case in the u.s. maybe there are widespread regulations against this or maybe it 's a cultural thing that we would be so offended by this that we would never go back to the theater

start by paying down any high interest debt you may have like credit cards   reason being that they ultimately eat into any positive returns you may have from investing   another good reason is to build up some discipline   you will need discipline to be a successful investor educate yourself about investing the motley fool is probably still a good place to start   i would also suggest getting into the habit of reading the wall street journal or at the very least the business section of the new york times   you 'll be overwhelmed with the terminology at first but stick with it   it is certainly worth it if you want to be an investor   the investor 's business daily is another good resource for information though you will be lost in the deep end of the pool with that publication for sure   that is not a reason to avoid getting familiar with it   though at first it may very well be overkill save some money to open a brokerage account or even an ira   you 'll learn that there are some restrictions on what you can do in an ira account   though they should n't necessarily be shunned as a result   money placed in an ira is tax deductible up to certain limits profit note in case you are not familiar with the joke steps 4 5 are supposed to be humorous   which provides a good time to bring up another point if you are not having fun investing then get out   put your money in something like an s&p 500 index fund and enjoy your life there are a lot more things to say on this subject though that could take up a book   come back with more questions as you learn about investing edit i forgot to mention drips and investment clubs   both ideas are suggested by the motley fool

could it be done yes it could subject to local law a variant of such an approach has been suggested for those countries experiencing collapse of demand one might consider whether whether it applied to secured loans such as mortgages unsecured loans or both whether it would be capped at a certain absolute say £ 100k or proportional first 50 of each mortgage whether it would cover first homes only or all homes and so on   these details would radically change the feasibility and consequences of any such intervention see the related question such a policy of debt cancellation would have several consequences beyond initial stimulation of demand that would need additional policies to deal with them inflation the resultant surge in demand would in the absence of any other intervention result in a massive surge in inflation there are some interesting questions about whether this burst of inflation would be a one off or not one could make an argument that as housing has become much more affordable at least for home owners it would increase the downward pressure on wages which would be in itself counter inflationary in the medium long term nevertheless it would be injecting much more money into the economy than has been seen in qe to date so the risks would be of extraordinarily high inflation which might or might not get entrenched in order to manage the short term risk and long term inflation expectations it might be necessary to incorporate a lot of tightening either fiscal higher taxes and/or lower public spending or monetary higher interest rates unwinding qe new requirements for higher core capital for banks moral hazard there are risks of moral hazard for individuals however as a society we were prepared to accept the moral hazard for financial institutions and their staff so that may or may not be an issue it is likely to be a question of long term expectations if the expectation is that this is at most a once in a lifetime occurrence then the consequential risk from moral hazard ought to be lower excess profits to lenders lenders will typically work on the basis of a certain proportion of defaults so paying off all loans effectively gives them an artificial boost to their profits worsening balance of payments there is to a degree a prisoners dilemma facing nations here pressing the reset button on personal debt across many of the countries experiencing demand collapse would benefit all of them however if just one such country were to do it alone they alone would increase domestic demand resulting in a large increase in imports but no significant increase in exports

there are many ways to calculate the return and every way will give you a different results in terms of a percentage value one way to always get something meaningful count the cash you had 977 + 31 and in the end you have which means you have earned dollars but what is your return in terms of percentage one way to look at it is by pretending that it is a fund in which you invest 1 dollar what is the fund worth in the beginning and in the end the tricky part in your example is you injected new capital into the equation initially you invested 977 dollars which later in the second period became worth you then sold off 200 shares for 950 dollars remember your portfolio is still worth split between 950 in cash and 523 in shares so far so good still easy to calculate return 977 -1 = return now you buy share for dollars but you only had 950 in cash we now need to consider 2 scenarios either you or someone else injected 31 dollars into the fund or you actually had the 31 dollars in the fund to begin with if you already had the cash in the fund to begin with your initial investment is and not 977 977 in shares and 31 in cash in the end the value of the fund is which means your return is = 36 consider if the 31 dollars was paid in to the fund by someone other than you you will then need to recalculate how much you each own of the fund just before the injection the fund was worth 950 in cash and in stock 310 200 = 110 x = dollars then 31 dollars are injected bringing the value of the fund up to the ownership of the fund is split with = of the value for the old capital and 2.2 for the new capital if the value of the fund was to change from here you could calculate the return for each investor individually by applying their share of the funds value respective to their investment because the value of the fund has not changed since the last period bullet 3 the return on the original investment is 977 1 = and the return on the new capital is 31 31 = 0 if you and not someone else injected the 31 dollar into the fund you will need to calculate the weight of each share of capital in each period and get the average return for each period to get to a total return in this specific case you will still get return but it gets even more for each time you inject new capital

right just like the good time when you where busting your ass in factory for + 12 hours a day and i 'm taking the low estimation here for a penny but without taxes and that they were no taxes or regulation or when your child of 6 was forced to work in mine because you could n't make enough to feed your four person family or when you where sweating your ass in a cotton field for a piece of before the big bad govt decide it was time to end certain things    money is a way of expressing value in an organized economy money is and has always been the government installing a way for your society to work by upgrading basic good exchange   so that people that does n't product anything but virtual sociological value can take a share like bankers politicians ceo and other    taxes are just another way of making the value flows like debt gt;when the public sector comes in there will be a lot of people in between who consume resources yet do not provide anything useful in return   i bet neither the military nasa fda or your local police station firefighters are n't providing any

it depends to some extent on how you interpret the situation so i think this is the general idea say you purchase one share at $ 50 and soon after the price moves up say to $ 55 you now have an unrealized profit of $ 5 now you can either sell and realize that profit or hold on to the position expecting a further price appreciation in either case you will consider the price change from this traded price which is $ 55 and not the price you actually bought at hence if the price fell to $ 52 in the next trade you have a loss of $ 3 on your previous profit of $ 5 this even though your net p&l is calculated from the initial purchase price of $ 50 allows you to think in terms of your positions at the latest known prices this is similar to a markov process in the sense that it does n't matter which route the stock price and your position 's p&l took to get to the current point your decision should be based on the current latest price level

there is a distinct difference between having a degree and being genuinely smart and business savvy if you 're genuinely smart and business savvy you could theoretically break into the business world with no degree and make a decent salary the trouble there is that many people are n't smart and business savvy until they get a degree   on the other hand it 's very possible to get a degree and be completely oblivious about how to conduct your career poor resume interviewing skills no business sense etc in that case an mba might not be totally useful but probably still will be to a degree however if you are smart about how you conduct your career an mba should help you immensely

if you know that your tax situation is not easily handled by the standard withholding table then you can use that line to ask for additional funds be withheld you could also ask for less money to be withheld    why would somebody do this they had a small side business that made them extra income and wanted to withhold extra money from their full time job to cover the extra income they might have been awarded a big bonus and it caused too much in taxes to be withheld so they wanted to not have as much taxes from their regular pay check given the fact that you are young in your first real job and almost the entire tax year ahead of you it is likely that the standard tax tables will be close enough so leave the line blank or put zero

when i first purchased my home six years ago i was able to get into a bank of america first time homebuyer program that required no down payment and no pmi while i hope you find a lower initial payment the banks have tightened their requirements so that buyers have more skin in the game so to speak exotic loan options coupled with the subprime mortgage crisis caused the housing bubble to burst now banks are being very selective about who they provide a mortgage the other things you need to look at are interest rate and terms do you feel you will be in the home for the next 30 years have you considered a 15 year mortgage shop around pmi used to have a bad connotation at least it did when i bought my home six years ago but i feel now that it would have been worthwhile for the banks and the economy in the long run had banks required buyers to utilize pmi

if you know when and by how much something will fluctuate you can always make money buy it when it 's cheaper and sell it when it 's more expensive if you just know that it fluctuated a lot recently then you do n't know what it will do next most securities that go to zero or go much higher bounce all over the place for a while first   but you do n't know when they 'll move lower or higher   so how could you figure out if you 'll make money you ca n't know dca will on average make you better off unless the extra commissions are too high relative to your purchase sizes but it will in retrospect make you worse off in many particular cases this is true of many investment disciplines such as rebalancing they are all based on averages   if the volatility is random then on average you can buy more shares when the price is lower using dca but when the lowest price turns out to have been on a certain day you 'd have been better off with a single lump sum put in on that day no way to know in advance   degree of volatility should n't matter any fluctuation is enough for dca or rebalancing to get you ahead though it 's true they get you ahead farther if the fluctuations are larger since there 's then more difference between dca and a lump purchase   i think the real reason to do dca and rebalancing is risk control they reduce the risk of putting a whole lump sum in on exactly the wrong day and they can help keep a portfolio growing even if the market is stagnant

you need to have them consult with a financial adviser that has a focus on issues for seniors this is because they are beyond the saving for retirement phase and are now in the making their money last phase they also have issues related to health insurance ira rmds long term care insurance the adviser will need to review what they have and determine how to make sure it is what they need it is great idea for you to go along with them so you can understand what needs to be done you will want an adviser that charges you a fee for making the plan not one that makes a commission based on what products you buy or invest in

this is opinion no right or wrong two schools of thought one saying you should aim to be debt free asap the other suggests that when your borrowing expense is so much lower than expected market return just keep investing   with your mortgage a variable i trust the payment is recalculated so if you pay down half the loan it will drop to half when the rate changes and new payment calculated right if not you still have a high payment due until it 's paid in full   me i like the flexibility of going with the full term and saving the money as long as rates are low even moderate inflation will make that payment fell like less over time and there are funds whose dividends are above the mortgage rate if when rates rise you can always pay down aggressively i 'm concerned that you do n't have a good sense of your saving goals you have less than a years income saved for the long term to replace 80 of your income you need about 20 times your current income or $ of course you get to subtract pension income or whatever canada 's social security system is forgive my ignorance on this

so if we ca n't trust people to know what they want who makes the decisions about what they should have and what gives them that right   i 'm not suggesting environments do n't play a role in human development i 'm suggesting that people need to learn to deal with the realities of their environments as part of their character growth when you say that not being able to resist buying is a serious problem while there are still people living on the streets i think you need some perspective   i 'd wager that what you 're seeing as you get older is the poverty trap which is a real problem but which is caused by barriers to expanding earnings much more than by irrational spending though it is a factor   as for the insult that 's the impression your arguments gave and i 'd still like to know whether you believe you yourself need to be protected from these marketing practices or you only feel that this is only necessary for others implying they are somehow your in their ability to self manage

when you start investing makes a very large difference to the outcome but that is on the time scale of what generation you were born into not what week you choose to open your 401(k   as you note in your last sentence there is nothing that you can do about this so there is no point in worrying about it if you could successfully market time successfully then that would make a difference even at smaller time scales   but you probably ca n't so there is no point in worrying about that either as points out your statement about not their net worth until 2013 applies to someone who invested a lump sum at the 2007 peak not to someone who invested continuously throughout    by my calculation if you started continuously investing in a broad market index at the peak around jun 4 2007 you would have recovered your net worth relative to investing in a safe instrument that merely kept up with inflation a hard thing to find these days around april 12 2010   i 've done the computation on each business day because that is easier so it might be slightly worse if do the periodic investment on each payday which is much more realist for a 401(k and of course if you need to preserve recover you net worth in 3 years you should n't be in stocks in the first place

movie going actual tickets sold in and the theater market has only been kept afloat since then by increasing ticket prices   however the more ticket prices increase it creates a cycle where it 's less attractive to go to the movies and so they have to increase ticket prices again   movie theaters typically cede most of the opening week revenue to the studio so they need some minimum foot traffic so a percent of audience buys the high margin popcorn and drinks   movie studios got wanting to take the movie out of the theater ever faster to multiple revenue generating venues star wars was in the theater a now all but the biggest movies are in what a few weeks costs to a c heat buildings rise big tvs are cheaper every year netflix etc   not to mention the tablet which i watch netflix on more than a big tv and the rise of the formula superhero movie   pure no value added theaters are on the way out in any areas with decent internet   they arose in a time of touring stage entertainment and displaced many a live performance with this new moving picture tech   now they are being displaced by tech just the same   a of restaurant theaters and or next tech theaters and the like will stick around in 25 years as attractions but it just wo n't be the same scale   you can this to how consoles eventually killed the video game even with shittier hardware   it 's happening to retail market crashing down and it happened to small chain book stores cd stores and a bunch of other categories etc   no surprise to anyone that pays attention and thinks the next tech economical step   in the end it 's really up to studios to decide if the movie theater is a relic worth keeping and only if they work jointly and in the end it still might just buy them a few years til it sinks   i do n't think it 's worth keeping   my preferred local one is one of the better ones out of 4 5 3 are small time with limited screens and yet even they have n't replaced the in 15 years and it smells like piss in the summer   this is in one of the richer areas of the country not some ghetto not going to the movies for that bonus

in most cases the brand on the card eg visa or mastercard is a middleman the company processes the transaction transferring $ xx from the bank to the seller and telling the bank to debit the buyer 's account the bank is at risk not the company transacting the purchase what 's interesting is that american express started as both my first amex card issued in 1979 long expired but in my box of had no bank american express offered a card that offered no extended credit it was pay in full each month since then amex started offering extended credit i.e. with annual interest and minimum payments and more recently offering transaction processing for banks which take on the credit risk essentially becoming very similar to mastercard and visa

if you want to buy once the price goes up to $ 101 or above you can place a conditional order to be triggered at $ 101 or above and for a limit order to entered to buy at $ 102 this will mean that as soon as the price reaches $ 101 or above your limit order will enter the market and you will buy at any price from $ 102 or below so if the price just trickles over $ 101 you will end up buying at around $ 101 or just over $ 101 however if the price gaps above $ 101 say it gaps up to $ then you will end up buying at around $ if the price gaps up above $ 102 say $ then your limit order at $ 102 will hit the market but it will not trade until the price drops back to $ 102 or below

i have a car loan paid in full and even paid off early and 2 personal loans paid in full from my credit union that do n't seem to reflect in a positive way and all 3 were in good standing but you also   my credit card utilization is 95 i have a total of 4 store credit cards a car loan 2 personal loans so assuming no overlap you 've paid off three of your ten loans 30   and you still have 95 utilization    what would you do if you were laid off for six months   regardless of payment history you would most likely stop making payments on your loans   this is why your credit score is bad   you are in fact a credit risk   not due to payment history   if your payment history was bad you 'd likely rank worse   but simple fiscal reality is that you are an adverse event away from serious fiscal problems    for that matter the very point that you are considering bankruptcy says that they are right to give you a poor score   bankruptcy has adverse effects on you but for your creditors it means that many of them will never get paid or get paid less than what they loaned    the hard advice that we can give is to reduce your expenses   stop going to restaurants   prepare breakfast and from scratch and bag your lunch   do n't put new expenses on your credit cards unless you can pay them this month   cut up your store cards and do n't shop for anything but necessities   whatever furniture appliances clothes shoes etc you have now should be enough for the next year or so    cut your expenses   have premium channels on your cable or the extra fast internet   drop back to the minimum instead   turn the heat down and the a c temperature up so it cools less   turn off the lights if you are n't using them   if you move move to a cheaper apartment   nothing to do   get a second job   that will not only keep you from being bored it will help with your financial issues    bankruptcy will not itself fix the problems you describe   you are living beyond your means   bankruptcy might make you stop living beyond your means   but it wo n't fix the problem that you make less money than you want to spend   only you can do that   better to stop the spending now rather than waiting until bankruptcy makes your credit even worse and forces you to cut spending    if you have extra money at the end of the month pick the worst loan and pay as much of it as you can   by worst i mean the one with the worst terms going forward   highest interest rate etc   if two loans have the same rate pay the smaller one first   once you pay off that loan it will increase the amount of money you have left to pay off your other loans   this is called the debt snowball snowball effect    after you finish paying off your debt save up six months worth of expenses or income   these will be your emergency savings    once you have your emergency fund write out a budget and stick to it   you can buy anything you want so long as it fits in your budget   avoid borrowing unless absolutely necessary   instead save your money for bigger purchases   with savings you not only avoid paying interest you may actually get paid interest   even if it 's a low rate paid to you is better than paying someone else    one of the largest effects of bankruptcy is that it forces you to act like this   they offer you even less credit at worse terms   you wo n't be able to shop on credit anymore   no new car loan   no mortgage   no nice clothes on credit   so why declare bankruptcy   take charge of your spending now rather than waiting until you ca n't do anything else

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

finance and accounting go together like peanut butter and jelly having said that you really should read need to determine what part of finance you 're interested in because that 's the only way to give you an informed answer as to whether you should pursue a cpa cfa mba   with all of that in mind your post in my opinion really comes across as you sounding like you do n't want to put in the work to pass the cpa if that 's the case finance is really not the field you want to be in   lastly experience is not a substitute for having your cpa license but rather a compliment

a cfd broker will let you open a trade on margin as long as your account balance is more than the margin required on all your open trades if the required margin increases within a certain percentage of your account balance you will get a margin call if you then do n't deposit more funds or close losing trades out the broker will close all your trades note your account balance is the remaining funds you have left to open new trades with i always use stop loss orders with all my open trades and because of this my broker reduces the amount of margin required on each trade this allows me to have more open trades at the one time without increasing my funds effects of a losing trade on margin say i have an account balance of $ 2,000 and open a long trade in a share cfd of 1,000 cfds with a share price of $ 10 and margin of 10 the face value of the shares would be $ 10,000 but my initial margin would be $ 1,000 10 of $ 10,000   if i do n't place a stop loss and the price falls to $ 9 i would have lost $ 1,000 and my remaining margin would now be $ 900 10 of $ 9,000 so i would have $ 100 balance remaining in my account i would probably receive a margin call to deposit more funds in or close out my trade if i do n't respond the broker will close out my position before my balance gets to $ 0 if instead i placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 my initial margin might be reduced to $ 500 as the price drops to $ i would have lost $ 400 and my remaining margin would now only be $ 100 with my account balance at $ 1,500 when the price drops to $ 9.50 i will get stopped out my trade will be closed and i would have lost $ 500 with my account balance still at $ 1,500 effects of a winning trade on margin say i have the same account balance as before and open the same trade but this time the price moves up if i do n't place a stop loss and the price goes up to $ 11 i would have made a $ 1,000 profit and my remaining margin will now be $ 1,100 10 of $ 11,000 so my account balance would now be $ 2,000 + $ 1,000 $ 1,100 = $ 1,900 if i had placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 again and the price moves up to $ 10.50 i would have made a profit of $ 500 and my margin would now be $ 1,000 my account balance would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 1,000 = $ 1,500 however if after the price went up to $ 10.50 i also moved my stop loss up to $ 10 then i would have $ 500 profit and only $ 500 margin so my balance in this case would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 500 = $ 2,000 so by using stop losses as part of your risk management you can reduce the margin used from your balance which will allow you to open more trades without any extra funds deposited into your account

you are kind of thinking of this correctly but you will and should pay for insurance at some point   what i mean by that is that although the insurance company is making a profit that removing the risk for certain incidents from your life you are still receiving a lot of value    things that inflict large losses in your life tend to be good insurance buys   health liability long term care long term disability and property insurance typically fall into this category    in your case assuming you are young and healthy it would be a poor choice to drop the major medical health insurance   there is a small chance you will get very sick in the next 10 years or so and require the use of this insurance   a much smaller chance than what is represented by the premium   but if you do get very sick and do n't have insurance it will probably wipe you out financially   the devastation could last the rest of your life    you are paying to mitigate that possibility   and as you said it 's pretty low cost    while you seem to be really good at numbers it is hard to quantify the risk avoidance   but it must be considered in your analysis also along those lines is car insurance   while you may not be willing to pay for full coverage it 's a great idea to max out your personal liability if you have sufficient assets

the steps you outlined are fine by themselves step 5 seeking criticism can be less helpful than one may think   see   there are a lot of opposing opinions all of which can be correct over different time frames   try and quantify your confidence and develop different strategies for different confidence levels i was never smart enough or patient with follow through to be a successful value investor it was very frustrating to watch stocks trade sideways for years before the company 's intrinsic value was better reflected in the market   also you could make an excellent pick but a macro change and slump could set you back a year and raise doubts in my experience portfolio management techniques like asset allocation and dollar cost averaging is what made my version of value investing work your interest in is something to applaud   is there something specific about that you do not understand   context is key these types of reports are more relevant and understandable when compared to competitors in the same sector    it is good to assess over confidence   it is also good to diversify your knowledge and the effort put into securities analysis 6th edition will help with other books in the field   i see a bit of myself in your post and if you are like me than subsequent readings and full mastery of the concepts in securities analysis 6th ed   will lead to over confidence or a false understanding as there are many factors at play in the market   so many that even the most scientific approaches to investing can just as equally be described as an art i 'm not aware of the details of your situation but in general for you to fully realize the benefits from applying the principals of value investing shared by graham and more recently warren buffett you must invest on the level that requires use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting e.g. > 20 ownership    sure the same principals used by buffett can work on a smaller scale but a small scale investor is best served by wealth accumulation which can take many forms not the addition of instant equity via acquisitions to their consolidated financials lastly to test what you have learned about value investing and order execution try the inverse   at least on paper   short a stock with low value and a high p e.   may be a good example learn what it is like to have your resources at stake and the anguish of market and security volatility it would be a lot easier to wait it out as a long term value investor from a beach house in santa barbara

price is decided by what shares are offered at what prices and who first   the buyer and seller are both trying to find the best offer for their definition of best within the constraints then have set on their bid or ask the seller will sell to the highest bid they can get that they consider acceptable the buyer will buy from the lowest offer they can get that they consider acceptable the price and whether a sale purchase happens at all depends on what other trades are still available and how long you 're willing to wait for one you 're happy with and may be different on one share than another at the same time if the purchase could n't be completed with the single best offer and had to buy from multiple offers this may have been easier to understand in the days of open outcry pit trading when you could see just how chaotic the process is but it all boils down to a high speed version of seeking the best deal in an old fashioned marketplace where no prices are fixed and every sale requires or at least offers the opportunity for negotiation fred sells it five cents cheaper then why are n't you buying from him he 's out of stock well when i do n't have any my price is ten cents cheaper maybe i wo n't buy today or i 'll buy elsewhere maybe i wo n't sell today or maybe someone else will pay my price sam looks interested ok ok i can offer two cents more three sam looks really interested two and a half and throw in an apple for susie done and the next buyer or seller starts the whole process over again open outcry really is just a way of trying to shop around very very very fast and electronic reconciliation speeds it up even more but it 's conceptually the same process either seller gets what they 're asking or they adjust and/or the buyer adjusts until they meet or everyone agrees that there 's no agreement and goes home

gifts from your parents are not treated as income for tax purposes you should not include that in your subsidy calculation if you are here on a student visa and have been in the us for less than 5 years then you are considered a non resident alien and you are not required to buy a qualified plan through the insurance marketplace you might be able to get a cheaper student plan through your school but the subsidy might be enough that it 's still worth it when calculated correctly if you are a resident alien or you are a citizen of the us then you are required to get coverage though you can choose not to purchase coverage and pay the tax for not having coverage that tax can not be collected by the irs unless you have already had federal tax withheld they can only confiscate your tax return money to recoup that money i do n't have enough information to recommend one way or the other what you should do but i would bet that if you recalculated your subsidy without including your parents income it would cover the majority of the cost you should also consider applying for medicaid if you meet the eligibility requirements in your state

while the question is very localized i 'll answer about the general principle my main question is with how far away it is over 1000 miles how do    i quantify the travel expenses generally necessary and ordinary expenses are deductible this is true for business and also true for rentals but what is necessary and what is ordinary is it ordinary that a landlord will manage the property 1000 miles away by himself on a daily basis is it ordinary for people to drive 1000 miles every week i 'd say no to both i 'd say it would be cheaper for you to hire a local property manager thus the travel expense would not be necessary i would say it would be cheaper to fly although i do n't know if its true to the specific situation of the op but as i said its too localized to deal with rather than drive from texas to colorado if the op thinks that driving a thousand miles is indeed ordinary and necessary he 'll have to justify it to the irs examiner as i 'm sure it will be examined 2 trips to the property a year will be a nearly 100 write off 2000    miles hotels etc from what i understood and that is what i 've been told by my cpa irs generally allows 1 one trip per year per property if there 's an exceptional situation be prepared to justify it also keep all the receipts like gas hotel etc if you claim mileage but in reality you took a flight you 'll get hit hard by the irs when audited also while i 'm up there am i allowed to mix business with pleasure you can not deduct personal pleasure expenses at all if the trip is mainly business but you go out at the evening instead of staying at the hotel that 's fine but if the trip is business trip where you spend a couple of hours at your property and then go around having fun for two days the whole trip may be disallowed if there 's a reasonable portion dedicated to your business rental and the rest is pleasure you 'll have to split some of the costs and only deduct the portion attributed to the business activities you 'll have to analyze your specific situation and see where it falls do n't stretch the limits too much it will cost you more on the long run after all the audits and penalties can i also write off all travel involved in the purchase of the    property although again the necessary and ordinary justification of such a trip is arguable lets assume it is necessary and ordinary and generally justified it is reasonable to expect you to go and see the property with your own eyes before the closing imho of course i 'm not an authority such an expense can be either business or investment expense if its a business expense its deductible on schedule c. if its an investment expense if you do buy the property its added to the cost of the property capitalized i 'm not a tax adviser or a tax professional and this is not a tax advice this answer was not written or intended to be used and can not be used for the purpose of avoiding any tax related penalties that may be imposed on you or any other person under the internal revenue code you should seek a professional consultation with a cpa licensed in your or a federally licensed enrolled agent ea

i think wikipedia offers a very good explanation a dividend reinvestment program or dividend reinvestment plan drip is an equity investment option offered directly from the underlying company the investor does not receive quarterly dividends directly as cash instead the investor 's dividends are directly reinvested in the underlying equity the investor must still pay tax annually on his or her dividend income whether it is received or reinvested this allows the investment return from dividends to be immediately invested for the purpose of price appreciation and compounding without incurring brokerage fees or waiting to accumulate enough cash for a full share of stock so essentially a dividend reinvestment plan is offered by companies directly allowing investors to bypass brokerages and immediately re invests dividends rather than paying them out in cash investopedia also gives a definition a plan offered by a corporation that allows investors to reinvest their cash dividends by purchasing additional shares or fractional shares on the dividend payment date   a drip is an excellent way to increase the value of your investment most drips allow you to buy shares commission free and at a significant discount to the current share price most drips do n't allow much lower than $ 10   i had a hard time finding a comprehensive listing of companies that offered or drips but offers these suggestions   finding a dividend reinvestment plan offers one stop shopping for hundreds of dividend reinvestment plans they offer a searchable list that can be filtered to easily find a dividend reinvestment plan that fits your needs you can also use probably the best way to find out if a company offers a dividend reinvestment plan is to visit the company website most companies have an investor relations area that will highlight the various options available to for example coca cola disney and wal mart hope this helps

you 'll have to research the canada side of things on your own or maybe someone else can answer that side for the germany side there is a gift tax which depends on the relationship of the giver and receiver has an overview here which shows the tax class and tax free amount so according to the overview nieces get 20 000 € tax free amount anything over 20 000 € within 10 years from the same gift giver will be taxed with tax class 2 which can range from 15 to 43 depending on the gifted amount the full article is here it also a few tricks for example if you want to gift 40 000 € to your niece you could gift 20 000 € directly and 20 000 € to your brother or sister who then gifts it to their daughter you 'll have to trust them to do that though because you ca n't put that in a contract bottom line of this if you want to gift more than 20 000 € your niece should contact a tax advisor   about the bank transfer your niece will have to declare any bank transfers over 12 500 € that she receives her bank will know how to do that so she should just ask them it also might be helpful for her to have a letter from you stating that the money came from you and is a gift just in case the tax office does n't believe that the money is n't from

it 's hard to financially justify buying a house just for one person to live in you end up being over housed and paying for it would you rent a whole house for yourself   a condo might be an option but to me the maintenance fees are hard to take and they are notorious for increasing dramatically as the building ages you could consider buying a house that includes 1 or 2 rental units or sharing with a friend you do run the risk of having bad tenants though and you have additional to deal with having a rental unit in my modest house has worked out very well for me living alone and i have been very fortunate with tenants

congratulations on doing all the right things in your financial life to me the answer to your question is a no brainer pay off the loans immediately however i am sure that some people will post answers arguing exactly the opposite i would also   recommend using the extra cash that you will have each month since the payments on the loans will disappear to increase your 401k contributions even though they will not attract additional company match and once again you will certainly get answers telling you why doing so is a very bad idea

yes exactly var is just a single confidence interval   to go from model to strategy you need to design some kind of indicator i.e. when to buy and when to short or stay out in practice this will look like a large matrix with values ranging from -1 to 1 corresponding to shorting and holding respectively for each security and each day or hour or minute or tick etc which you then just multiply with the matrix of the stock returns the resulting matrix will be your daily returns for each stock you can then just row sum for daily returns of a portfolio or calculate a cumulative product for cumulative returns   a simple example of an indicator would be something like a value of 1 when the price of the stock is below the 30 day moving average and 0 otherwise you can use a battery of econometric models to design these indicators but the rest of the strategy design is essentially the same and it 's relatively easy to build a one size fits all back testing code   i 'll try to edit this post later and link a blog that goes through some of the code   edit simple machine learning model trade is a post that discusses implementing a simple ml strategy you can ignore most of the content but if you go through the github you 'll see how the ml model is implemented as a strategy   an even easier example can be found from the github connected to this how to measure the performance of a trading where the author is just using a totally arbitrary signal as you can see deriving a signal can be a ton of work but once you have actually simulating the strategy can be done in just a few lines of code   hopefully the author wo n't mind me linking his page here but i find his coding style to be very clean and good for educational purposes

when the inflation rate increases this tends to push up interest rates because of supply and demand if the interest rate is less than the inflation rate then putting your money in the bank means that you are losing value every day that it is there so there 's an incentive to withdraw your money and spend it now if say i 'm planning to buy a car and my savings are declining in real value then if i buy a car today i can get a better car than if i wait until tomorrow when interest rates are high compared to inflation the reverse is true my savings are increasing in value so the longer i leave my money in the bank the more it 's worth if i wait until tomorrow to buy a car i can get a better car than i would be able to buy today also people find alternative places to keep their savings if a savings account will result in me losing value every day my money is there then maybe i 'll put the money in the stock market or buy gold or whatever so for the banks to continue to get enough money to make loans they have to increase the interest rates they pay to lure customers back to the bank there is no reason per se for rising interest rates to consumers to directly cause an increase in the inflation rate inflation is caused by the money supply growing faster than the amount of goods and services produced interest rates are a cost if interest rates go up people will borrow less money and spend it on other things but that has no direct effect on the total money supply except you may note i put a bunch of in that paragraph in the united states the federal reserve loans money to banks it creates this money out of thin air so when the interest that the federal reserve charges to the banks is low the banks will borrow more from the feds as this money is created on the spot this adds to the money supply and thus contributes to inflation so if interest rates to consumers are low this encourages people to borrow more money from the banks which encourages the banks to borrow more from the feds which increases the money supply which increases inflation i do n't know much about how it works in other countries but i think it 's similar in most nations

i think all transportation uses only 1/3 of oil produced at best   that includes many things that wo n't be soon like planes and ships   do n't forget how much oil agriculture uses in both fertilizer pesticides and the least in running the equipment itself   so while demand may soften over time it 's not like will suddenly glut   peak oil which we reached with conventional oil vs kinda says that each subsequent barrel will get more and more expensive to pump out rather the popular perception we will suddenly run out   that basically has been a truism since over a century because on oil has declined   at peak return iirc in the 1930s or so we were getting something like 300 barrels of oil out for every barrel of energy invested on some fields in saudi arabia now the overall average is down to around 10 or less   point is oil wo n't go to $ 10   oil industry could not survive on it and they know we do n't have alternatives for many oil uses it 's the most easily portable liquid with the highest energy concentration so why price it as such   if people really wanted to reduce their carbon oil footprint they 'd stop for electric cars and switch to a diet which will have a far greater impact for much less investment   on top of all the health benefits they accumulate

the answer is far more simple    the purchasers of periphery debt have been banks in the periphery since these countries do n't have a central bank their private banks were swallowing the national debt since nobody else wanted to touch it    when the market value of that debt plummets the banks have massive holes they need to fill on their balance sheets to fulfill capital requirements and solvency therefore the banks themselves need to be injected with liquidity   now you can see why its a problem

as you pointed out in reference to cost cutting fiduciary lawsuits come out when things go wrong when directors successfully increase stock value everyone including shareholders is happy    i 'm not sure exactly where the best place is to look for such cases but here 's what my google fu yielded   example the media business excerpts from ruling in paramount paramount is sold to viacom at a lower price than 's offer shareholders sue paramount claims they were looking out for long term but shareholders sued them for screwing them out of maximal share value   example law on the fiduciary duty of directors to maximize the wealth of corporate dodge v. ford motor co ford had a majority share in his company and wanted to stop paying dividends to shareholders so he could expand his business at trial ford testified to his belief that the company made too much money and had an obligation to benefit the public and the firm ’s workers and customers the court disagreed as his motor company was set up for profit not charity ford was ordered to resume paying dividends   interestingly i found many more lawsuits where corporations sacrificed long term for short term it seems once incorporated this is where the internal incentives and pressures lead many managers lawsuits are merely one of these pressures

idk why the comment before this got -10 and this one got + 30 when it 's all in the same vein   anyway the truth of the matter is regardless if trump is correct or not finding good solutions is n't about democracy democracy is about mitigating the risks of concentrated political power and granting the people a chance to influence the nation    however effective problem solving and finding the truth is about placing powerful people in their respective positions while considering their qualified opinions not everyone 's opinion should matter believe it or not democracy of capital causes misallocation democracy of information causes misunderstanding and why because we have unqualified opinions a doctor has a qualified opinion on health care and in a way so does a patient and perhaps an insurance company but a plumber who spends little time with his children does n't belong on the school board and a teacher does n't necessarily know anything about the coal industry   in the end our country is operated like a giant sub reddit where of people upvote this and that just because they feel like it we get a lot of important things right but we get some critical things incredibly wrong these stack up and produce problems of immense proportions with seemingly no answer for example health care and the government 's recommendation for diet in public schools as obvious examples with simple solutions that no one likes or agrees with   anyway the whole nation is sick from head to toe and the remedy is not democracy democracy is an tool it is neutral how we use it is how we benefit from it

i think a larger issue is that you 're trying to do market timing whether you had a large or small amount of money to invest no one wants to put the money in to watch it go down   you ca n't really predict if prices in a market or security will go up in six months in which case you want to put all your cash in now of if it will go down in which case you 'd want to wait until the bottom or if it will around in which case you 'd want to only buy at the bottoms   of course if you 're magic enough to nail all of those market conditions you 're a master finance trader and will quickly make billions if you 're really concerned with protecting your money and want to take some long positions i 'd look into some put options you 'll of course pay the fees for those put options but they 'll protect your downside   much of this depends on your time horizon at the age of 35 someone can expect to see ~6 more recessions and perhaps ~30 more market corrections before retirement with that big of a time range it 's best to avoid micro optimizing since that tends to hurt your performance overall because you wo n't be able to time the market correctly most of the time   one thing that 's somewhat reasonable if you have the stomach for it is to not buy at somewhat obvious market highs and wait for corrections this is n't fool proof by any means but as an example many people realized that us equities basically were on a ~5 year up run by december 2014 many people cashed out those positions expecting that a correction would be due and around late summer of 2015 that correction came for those with patience they made ~15 with a few mouse clicks   of course many others would have been waiting for that correction since 2010 and missed out on the market increases   boiled down

yeah    they actually have said that their new strategy is not to make money from breakage people who pay but do n't use it i believe they also guaranteed the $ 10 deal for a year but i 'm not at all certain so do n't quote me on that    instead they want to make money from the data and eventually convince movie theaters to cut them in on sales and/or give them discounts on tickets both of which depend on people actually using moviepass    i think those are really silly plans the movie data is highly unlikely to cover the costs of the tickets that moviepass has to buy    movie theaters like studios are stubborn bastards who have a history of sticking to their guns and refusing to budge even an inch when it comes to certain terms they also have recently demonstrated a preference for building out their own direct to consumer offerings rather than with third party offerings    i do n't see them getting a ton more traffic from mp customers and more concession sales and then deciding to give up any of their highly prized concession sales considering that most heavy theater likely have a primary theater that they go to it would probably make more sense for theaters to simply market their own offering to them in theater and wait for mp to run out of money    finally amc is the biggest chain and actively wants this $ 10/month subscription to fail amc has announced that it absolutely will not give mp any deals on ticket prices something that mp is counting on to make this sustainable maybe mp is counting on amc to eventually change its mind but i do n't think that 's a smart bet    otoh what the hell do i know i 've been wrong plenty of times before

there are two factors in your credit score that may be affected the first is payment history lenders like to see that you pay your bills which is the most straightforward part of credit scores imo if you 've actually been paying your bills on time though then this should still be fine the second factor is the average age of your open accounts longer is considered better here because it means you have a history of paying your bills and you are n't applying for a bunch of credit recently in which case you may be taking on too much and will have difficulties paying them if this card is closed then it will no longer count for this calculation if you do n't have any other open credit accounts then that means as soon as you open another one your average age will be one day and it will take a long time to get it to good levels if you have other matured accounts then those will balance out any new accounts so you do n't get hit as much incidentally this is one of the reasons why it 's good to get cards without yearly fees because you can keep them open for a long time even if you switch to using a different card primarily

great answers here 's my two cents first do n't forget to look at the overall picture not just the dividend study the company 's income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement for the last few years make sure they have good earnings potential and are not carrying too much debt i know it 's dull but it 's better to miss an opportunity than to buy a turkey and watch the dividends and the share price tank i went through this with bac bank of america a couple of years ago they had a history of rising dividends when i bought them and the yield was about 8 then the banking crisis happened and the dividend went from $ to $ 0.04 and the price fell from $ 40 to $ 5 i stuck with it continuing to buy at lower and lower prices and eventually sold them all at $ 12 and managed to break even but it was not a pleasant experience do your homework still one of the most reliable ways to judge a company 's dividend paying ability is to look at its dividend history once a company has started paying a dividend there is a strong expectation from shareholders that these payments will continue and the company 's management will try very hard to maintain them though sometimes this does n't work out e.g. bac you should see an uninterrupted stream of non decreasing payments over a period of at least 5 years this timeframe is just a rule of thumb well established profitable companies also tend to increase their dividends over time which has the added benefit of pushing up their share price so you 're getting increasing dividends and capital gains next look at the company 's payout ratio over time and the actual cost of the dividend can the projected earnings cover the dividend cost without going above the payout ratio if not then the dividend is likely to get reduced in the case of the dividend history is short and erratic the earnings are also all over the place so it 's hard to predict what will happen next year the company is up to its eyeballs debt current ratio is .2 and its earnings have dropped by 20 in the last quarter they have lost money in two of the last three years even though earning have jumped dramatically this is a very young company and in my opinion it is too early for them to be paying dividends a very speculative stock and you are more likely to make money from capital gains than dividends is a different story they are profitable and have a long dividend history although the dividend was cut in half recently this may be a good to buy them hoping the dividend comes back once the economy recovers however they are trading at over 40 times earnings which seems expensive considering their low profit margins before investing your money invest in your education get some books on interpretation of financial and learn how to read the numbers it 's sort of like looking at the codes in the matrix and seeing the in the red dress or whatever it was good luck

it seems like you would want the work done that is necessary for society to be less expensive   for instance without food i am dead so someone growing food is very important   but if it takes up 100 of my income then that means a society where the majority of people are growing food and doing nothing else

great work so far and good question   i think a lot of it depends on how risky your financial life is    for example lets say that you are working a temp or contract job that ends in 3 months   that is also the same month your savings and student loan will be equal   i think most would agree that it would be foolish to empty out your savings in such a risky month    now same situation one month later   the company you were working for takes you on as a full time employee   i would go ahead and empty out my savings and make the student loan go away    there could be other risks to consider like needing a different car moving to a new place potential medical bills or a needing to travel   anything like that on the horizon i would hold off out my savings   however once it is smooth sailing go for it being debt free is wonderful and it is a worthy goal

two options not mentioned information about your emergency fund in your question if you do n't have 6 months of expenses saved up in a safe place high yield savings account or money market fund i 'd add to that first you auto withdraw the amount over six months then when you can start contributing contribute twice as much so you are still putting in $ 18,000 a year the amount you pulled into savings the first 6 months could be used to make up for the extra income coming out after the six months are over depending on your income and since you have the ability to save it 's important not to lose access to these tax efficient accounts and also tax brokerage account as mentioned above is also fine but if you will use this money for downpayment on a home or something similar within the next five years i would n't recommend investing it however having money invested in an after tax account is n't a terrible thing yes you 'll get taxed when you sell the investments but you have a lot of flexibility to access that money at any time unlike your retirement accounts

gt;i say better to distribute cash to the shareholders who can then choose for themselves whether to reinvest it in the company or elsewhere   why should n't apple which i agree with you is its shareholder 's returns reinvest the money in the company or in other ventures that produce returns for shareholders   my argument was simply that dividends diminish the earnings potential of firms future cash flows now if they are unable to find or invest in positive npv projects then i would agree a dividend payment is the best route to go   however i find that highly suspect for firms like apple microsoft and ge they may not be able sustain double digit growth rates but given strong balance sheets and cost of capital they surely should be able to find positive npv projects that would contribute more gains for shareholders than stocks which have been struggling for momentum    the only reason to invest in a company like ge these days is for the dividend cash flow rather than the company 's earnings and future growth prospects that seems sad to me but hey what do i know

logically yes legally no any reasonable definition of an investment must include some types of gambling and insurance lottery tickets specifically are really crappy high risk high return investment   obviously most people try to avoid investments with a negative average expected future value but from a purely semantic perspective anything with a potential future value is an investment conversely anyone with a gambling problem should not pretend they are not gambling when making focused investments in high volatility stock options that said the irs taxes gains and losses differently depending on whether they are classified as gambling or just crappy investing so you will not be able to deduct your gambling losses from your earned income unlike investment losses which can be deducted up to per year

i suggest taking a look at your pay stub or pay statement your employer should provide you with one for each time you get paid this shows your gross income pay period and year to date or ytd for short and all stuff that gets deducted and how your actual payment is calculated in my case there are nine things that get taken off other things that might show up there are various life or accident insurances child care flexible spending account legal pet insurances long term disability etc some of those are under your control through benefit election or contribution choices others you just have to live with still it 's worth spending the time to look at it occasionally

i found a good description of these on the bank website   very similar to 's answer but the details are a little different perhaps because it 's canadian certified cheque a cheque which has been certified by the bank that the funds to be drawn are available and locked in for the sole beneficiary this type of payment is guaranteed in case of theft loss or destruction certified cheques can be entirely replaced after investigation may be subject to a fee official cheque as for the certified cheque the official cheque is guaranteed by the bank against theft loss or destruction this type of cheque is different because it will be automatically and fully reimbursed within a 30 to 90-day period if the amount is over $ 1,000 fees will be higher than    those of the certified cheque money order the money order is also a bank guaranteed payment in case of theft loss or destruction as with the official cheque it will be replaced or totally refunded within a 30 to 90-day period its difference resides in the fact that the maximum amount is $ 1,000 and it can be issued in us dollars bank draft a bank draft is the ideal guaranteed payment vehicle for all your foreign currency transactions it ’s guaranteed against theft loss or destruction and will be replaced or totally reimbursed within a period that varies according to the currency if you are an immigrant or an or if you make purchases outside of the country you could require this payment vehicle

the two are closely related a budget is a detailed plan for how to spend expense tracking is a tool to analyze your previous spending performance creating a plan for how to spend your money without any record of your previous spending is an empty promise to yourself that you will never follow up on did i stay within my budget does n't matter i did n't track the spending anyway even if you do plan to track your performance if you have not previously done so you wo n't have a good basis for how much to expect in each category   most people have a general idea of how much they have spent and many budgets are formed based on that general intuition but they are often surprised when they track how every penny is spent and look at the totals from month to month and over years by actually seeing how much has been spent it 's easier to pick the big financial drains and target them for reduction if your desire is more savings for example i know people who keep a close eye on what they spend each month but they do n't allocate money in categories for the next month they do n't perform as well on reducing spending but they often do n't care they feel like they make enough and they save enough so why worry i also know people who create an unrealistic budget each month because they have n't done a good job tracking their previous spending they know what the monthly bills are but they do n't account well for variable or cyclical expenses   like repairs christmas etc both tools are essential for maximizing your own personal finance

i 've seen go the other way on my job    a generation accounts payable clerk in my department was promoted to an accounts payable supervisory role simply because she has kids and my baby boomer boss with her on a personal level the punchline is this woman does n't understand accounting on a fundamental level she has some junior college education no degree   i generation y on the other hand had to train up my baby boomer boss in our industry over the course of a year attempt to teach him how to use our erp system he refuses to learn how to use our accounting system and he 's the cfo big red flag we 're going on year 2 now cover for him when he make bone headed accounting 101 mistakes and be the defacto department manager i 'm the senior accountant because his accounts payable supervisor does n't know how to debit and credit accounts correctly the buck should stop with her when it comes to accounts payable transactions but she 's too incompetent to handle the responsibility   so now my boss is looking hire a new staff to the department and i 'm for a manager 's title i do the managing already i just want the official title and pay raise in addition i would like to have an official direct report instead of all this   unofficial direct reporting going on    i found out last week that i 'm not up for consideration but the girl that has no college degree who was in my position before me but left knew someone who got her a better job is on the short list for the position of course she 's a generation i 'm more experienced technically than she is i have less years of experience but my skill set is larger i 'm much better educated and i bring database administration and programming to the table in addition to accounting accounting erp softwares are essentially databases i even fixed the tax mess she left the department on the way out   i suspect the reason why i was n't up for consideration is because i stand out i 'm young 28 look young gym fit coworkers are all overweight and no kids that seems to really single me out everyone else never learned what a was and had children around 16 19 years of age so instead of the workplace becoming a meritocracy it 's a game of who can put themselves in bad situations and garner sympathy for pay raises and promotions they do n't deserve

in a sole proprietorship and an llc the expenses can still be deducted against the profits or losses from the operations the irs does not even require that a profit seeking activity be incorporated under its own entity hence why this is also applicable in a sole proprietorship from what you 've said there is no reason to use a more complicated and costly corporate structure at all in comparison a sole proprietorship and single member llc will be completely pass through entities to the irs and all of their earnings go to you with the llc you have the option of letting the llc 's earnings remain with the entity itself or you can just treat it as your own and pay individual income taxes on it this has nothing to do specifically with a gambling business and is largely a red herring to your profit seeking motives gambling in casino games and lotteries already enjoy favorable tax treatment in some regards gambling in capital markets also enjoy a myriad of favorable tax laws a business entity related to this purpose should be able to deduct costs related to this trade and pass an audit more convincingly than not having formed an llc and business bank account

traders sometimes look at the depth of the book number of outstanding limit orders to try and gauge the sentiment of the market or otherwise use this information to formulate their strategy   if there was a large outstanding buy order at $ there 's a decent chance this could increase the price by influencing other traders however a limit order at $ 2 is like an amazon.com price of $ 200,000 for a book   it 's so far away from realistic that it is ignored   people would think it is an error submitting this type of order is perfectly legal   if the stock is extremely thinly traded it might even be encouraged because if someone wanted to sell a bunch and did a really bad job of it the price could conceivably fall that far and the limit order would be adding liquidity   i guess   your example is pretty extreme it is not uncommon for there to be limit orders on the book that are not very close to the trading price   they just sit around   the majority of trades are done by algorithmic traders and institutional traders and they do n't tend to do this but a retail investor may choose to submit an order like that just hoping against hope also buy orders are not likely to push prices down no matter what their price is   a sell order yes even if it is n't executed

i 'm normally not a fan of investment money into buckets but your case may be the clearest case for it i 've seen in awhile   your income and saving is good and you have two clearly defined goals of retirement saving and saving for a house each with very different time frames ~30 years and 3 5 years respectively for medium term money like saving for a house just building up cash is not actually a bad idea this minimizes the chance that a market crash will happen at the same time you need to withdraw the money   however given you have the means to take more risk a generally smarter scheme would be to invest much of the money in a broad liquid bond funds with a somewhat lower percentage in stocks and then reduce the amount of stock each year as you get closer even moving some into cash   this gives reasonable positive expected return while lowering the risk of having to sell during a crisis as the time to purchase gets shorter and shorter the retirement money should be invested for the long term as usual   a majority in low fee index stock funds etfs is the standard advice for good reason

why is that with all the successful investors including myself on a not infrequent basis going for individual companies directly would n't it make more sense to suggest that new investors learn how to analyse companies and then make their best guess after taking into account those factors i have a different perspective here than the other answers   i recently started investing in a roth ira for retirement i do not have interest in micromanaging individual company research i do n't find this enjoyable at all but i know i want to save for retirement could i learn all the details probably as an engineer software person i suspect i could but i really do n't want to but here 's the thing for anyone else in a similar situation to me the net return on investing into a mutual fund type arrangement even if it returns only 4 is still likely considerably higher than the return on trying to invest in stocks which likely results in $ 0 invested and a return of 0 i suspect the overwhelming majority of people in the world are more similar to me than you in that they have minimal interest in spending hours managing their money for us mutual funds or etfs are perfect for this

this is similar to your tfsa question while the s in rrsp or tfsa stands for savings it does not stipulate exactly what instruments you use to build up those savings with few exceptions you can hold any type of investment in either an rrsp or tfsa thus do not think of them as savings accounts per se but more like umbrella accounts or plans it 's actually the financial industry that creates these of so called rrsps which are usually gics or balanced mutual funds held inside an rrsp plan or tfsas which are literally savings accounts held inside a tfsa plan the most versatile accounts are the self directed rrsp or tfsa accounts usually through a discount broker where you can purchase many different types of investments inside your registered accounts including stocks bonds mutual funds gics gold etc thus a share purchase plan held inside an rrsp is completely eligible and may be a sensible investment for retirement savings

a loan with modest interest is better than paying by cash if there are better alternatives for investment for example suppose you are buying a house consider two extremes a you pay the house entirely by cash b the entire buy is financed by the bank   historically real subtracting inflation house prices at least in the u.s. have not risen at all in the long run and investing all of your own capital in this way may not be optimal notice that we are looking at a situation where one is buying a house and living in it in any case rent savings are equal in cases a and b if instead you were buying a house not for yourself but as a separate investment for renting out then you would receive rent in the case a the real return on your capital will be zero whereas in case b you can invest the cash in e.g. the stock market and get on average 7 the stock market has yielded a 7 real return annually including dividends   annually minus the bank 's interest rate if the interest is lower than 7 it may be profitable to take the loan of course the final decision depends on your risk preferences

well you had it a bit backwards the more liquid a market is the less important the idea of insider information becomes this is the opposite in less liquid markets such as low volatile stocks about to announce earnings knowing the earnings would net you a much larger percentage than say knowing if the ecb will cut rates of not the change will be a much larger and as with currencies it is more important to know what the major players are planning as in central banks and reserves carry trades etc

you need to contact the lender your copy of the title should show that your lender has a lien on the car the potential buyer will want to be able to walk away with good title without risking their money   it will not be as simple as signing the back of the title the lender does n't drop their lien until they get their money when trying to sell a car with a lien to a private buyer you may have to both go to the lender to complete the transaction or the buyer might want to send the money directly to the lender or may insist on an escrow service the fact you do n't own the car may scare most individuals from the process you will have to do whatever makes them comfortable   a dealer will not be concerned about this type of transaction but the fact that most individuals are   may give the dealer enough competitive advantage to lower their offer to you steps keep in mind that after only 7 months many car loans are upside down

i place 90 of the blame on carly and then the board that bitch was primed by her contract to gut and the company   when a board links a ceos remuneration to annual profit it makes unscrupulous individuals do things which have clear and obvious negative long term impacts but which will hike the annual profit for this year and another year or so but then turn badly negative   because carly is a little bitch and wanted to extract as much money as was humanly possible from her position at hp she on the most disastrous set of actions possible   the direct result is what we see now   ceo compensation should never be linked to profitability for an individual year but to their performance throughout their tenure and then beyond   it 's my belief a ceo should take a base salary of no more than 50 times the mean worker 's salary is not the average because that simply encourages the board to enrich the management team rather than the workers   if the company is profitable for a single year ceos should receive a large bonus say no more than 20 times the mean salary at the company   and 3 years after the ceo leaves he 'd be entitled to another round of payments base on long term performance of the company this means ceos have a duty and a very large responsibility to ensure that their replacement is actually a better ceo than they are   when board members leave there 's no incentive to them personally to ensure their replacement is even capable let alone excellent   the other issue i have with ceos is their stock options or stock grants i believe all companies should have strict rules about stock ownership by the board they must own a certain number of shares and those shares must be purchased before they join the board and demonstrably not by any mechanism which the company pays for   directors and officers with no personal investment interest in the performance of the company are a concern

let me summarize your question for you i do not have the down payment that the lender requires for a mortgage how can i still acquire the mortgage short answer find another lender or find more cash do n't overly complicate the scenario the correct answer is that the lender is free to do what they want they deem it too risky to lend you $ 1.1 m against this $ 1.8 m property unless they have $ 700k up front you want their money so you must accept their terms if other lenders have the same outlook consider that you can not afford this house find a cheaper house

most businesses want to grow and there are a variety of ways to raise the money needed to hire new employees and otherwise invest in the business to increase the rate of that growth you as a stock holder should hope that management is choosing the least expensive option for growth some of the options are debt selling equity to venture capitalists or selling equity on the open market going public if they choose debt they pay interest on that debt if they choose to sell equity to venture capitalists then your shares get diluted but hopefully the growth makes up for some of that dilution if they choose to go public dilution is still a concern but the terms are usually a little more favorable for the company selling because the market is so liquid   in the us current regulations for publicly traded companies cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $ year so that 's the rule of thumb for considering whether going public makes sense when calculating the cost of fundraising but as mentioned regulations make it less advantageous for executives who choose to sell their shares after the company goes public they ca n't sell when good spot prices appear going public is often considered the next step for a company that has grown past the initial venture funding phase but if cash flow is good plenty of companies decide to just reinvest profits and skip the equity markets altogether

the t+3 rule relates only to accounting and not to trading   it does not prevent you from day trading   it simply means that the postings in you cash account will not appear until three business days after you have executed a trade   when you execute a trade and the order has been filled you have all of the information you need to know the cash amounts that will hit your account three business days later in a cash account cash postings that arise from trading are treated as unsettled for three days but this does not mean that these funds are available for further trading   if you have $ 25,000 in your account on day 1 this does not mean that you will be able to trade more than $ 25,000 because your cash account has not yet been debited   most cash accounts will include an item detailing cash available for trading   this will net out any unsettled business transacted for example if you have a cash account balance of $ 25,000 on day one and on the same day you purchase $ 10,000 worth of shares then pending settlement in your cash account you will only have $ 15,000 cash available for trading similarly if you have a cash balance of $ 25,000 on day one and on the same day you day trade purchasing $ 15,000 and selling $ 10,000 worth of shares then you will have the net of $ 20,000 cash available for trading $ 20,000 = $ 25,000 $ 15,000 + $ 10,000 if by prop account you mean an account where you give discretion to a broker to trade on your behalf then i think the issues of accounting will be the least of your worries   you will need to be worried about not being fleeced out of your hard earned savings by someone far more interested in lining their own pockets than making money for you

will pull your credit report and perform a hard inquiry on your file this means the inquiry will be noted in your credit report and count against you slightly this is perfectly normal just do n't apply too many times too soon or it can begin to add up they will want proof of your income by asking for recent pay stubs with this information your income and your credit profile they will determine the maximum amount of credit they will lend you and at what interest rate the better your credit profile the more money they can lend and the lower the rate   you want financed the price of the car minus your down payment that is the amount you can apply for and in that case the only factors they will determine are 1 whether or not you will be approved and 2 at what interest rate you will be approved while interest rates generally follow the direction of the prime rate as dictated by the federal reserve there are market fluctuations and variances from one lending institution to the next further different institutions will have different criteria in terms of the amount of credit they deem you worthy of   know the price of the car now determine how much you want to put down and take the difference to a bank or credit union or work directly with the dealer dealers often give special deals if you finance through them a common scenario is 1 a person goes to the car dealer 2 test drives 3 negotiates the purchase price 4 the salesman works the numbers to determine your monthly payment through their own bank pay attention during that last process this is also where they can gain leverage in the deal and make money through the interest rate by offering longer loan terms to maximize their returns on your loan it 's not necessarily a bad thing it 's just how they have to make their money in the deal it 's good to know so you can form your own analysis of the deal and make sure they do n't completely bankrupt you   that you can comfortable afford your monthly payment the car dealers do n't really know how much you can afford they will try to determine to the best they can but only you really know do n't take more than you can afford be conservative about it for example think you can only afford $ 300 a month budget it even lower and make yourself only afford $ 225 a month

getting a mortgage for the interest write off is like buying packs of baseball cards for the gum that said i 'd refer you to the correct order of investing as much of that question really overlaps with this this question boils down to priorities the best use of the funds there are those who suggest that a mortgage brings risk of course it does just not for the borrower the risk is borne by the lender risk comes from lack of liquidity say your girlfriend buys the house with cash and leaves little reserve she loses her job and it 's great that she has no mortgage but she does have every other cost life brings including a tax bill that can turn into a house getting foreclosed on the details that you did n't disclose are those needed to look at the rest of the priorities list a fully funded 401(k with appropriate balance and no other debt and a 1 year emergency fund i would n't argue against buying the house with cash no real savings and passing on the 401(k matched deposit i 'd think carefully about the longterm impact of the cash purchase

the thing is corporate taxes are n't paid on revenues or costs they 're paid on net income    meaning no matter what happens any investment the company makes that improves their net income automatically means more money for the company     so let 's say 12 vs 14 tax    a 2 increase in tax means a 2 lower net roi on the investment     but so long as the incremental improvement to your bottom line is there the investment is sound with or without taxes    even at a 50 corporate tax rate    you hire one more person at $ 60k yr and they make $ 120k yr in net income for you    you still keep $ 30k of the profits     it 's an incremental increase regardless   and if that person does n't make you money   say the incremental benefit is 0    well your net income just dropped $    and you just paid $ 30k less in taxes    meaning the true cost of that hire is $ 30k to your bottom line   where it hurts business is that your retained earnings do n't build up as fast    it makes the next investment harder to make is all    and as a corporation if you 're not paying dividends you need to keep reinvesting your retained

when you sell a house around between 7 10 of the sales price will go to various fees mostly to the agents but also to county fees city fees deed tax and possibly covering closing costs for the buyers so if you sell a $ 400k house for the same price you buy just in fees you 're out $ 40k mortgages are structured so that the frontend is very interest heavy while at the end you 're mostly paying towards principal so for the first two years you will pay down very little of the principal figure around $ 2500 for the mortgage and without running the numbers i bet you would pay an average for the first two years of around $ in interest $ mortgage interest is tax deductible so you 'll get some of that back that 's also $ 16,800 in equity you 'll have on the house so you 'll get that back out when you sell rough numbers i would be you lose around $ 50k buying the house and selling for the same price two years later that does n't take into account having to do any maintenance and it assumes you can sell quickly when you want to renting is not throwing away money you do n't lose any money you get a place to live in exchange you do n't build equity sure but you do n't need to worry about maintenance and other related issues when you 're looking to be somewhere short term renting is generally the best idea

etfs do n't need sell side research yes they do no they do n't   they need to keep their fees minimal   mutual funds need equity research and they charge fees to pay for it   look at the flows into mutual funds and the flows into etfs and make your own mind up   however bear in mind that there will always be some demand for really good research   it just probably is n't a growing field   it will be a shrinking field where the best of the best do well and everyone else is playing a game of survivor trying not to get kicked off the island

so it comes down to whether you think helping someone after they 've taken a risk is a reward or not i guess same problem different perspective if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes    you could argue that the system failed her because she was n't taught to use protection or to plan enough but then it gets real hard to use that one way or the other

companies do both quite often   they have opposite effects on the share price but not on the total value to the shareholders   doing both causes value to shareholders to rise ie any un bought back shares now own a larger percentage of the company and are worth more and drops the per share price so it is easier to buy a share of the stock   to some that 's irrelevant but some might want a share of an otherwise expensive stock without paying $ 700 for it as a specific example of this apple appl split its stock in 2014 and also continued a significant buyback program apple announces $ repurchase program oct 2014 apple stock splits in june 2014 this led to their stock in total being worth more but costing substantially less per share

what explains the most of the future returns of a portfolio is the allocation between asset classes in the long term stock investments are almost certain to return more than any other kinds of investments for 40 + years i would choose a portfolio of 100 stocks how to construct the portfolio then diversification is the key you should diversify in time do n't put a large sum of money into your stock portfolio immediately if you have a large sum to invest spread it around several years you should diversify based on company size invest in both large and small companies you should also diversify internationally do n't invest in just us companies if you prefer to pick individual stocks 20 very carefully selected stocks may provide enough diversification if you keep diversification in mind during stock picking however careful stock picking can not be expected to yield excess returns and if you pick stocks manually you need to rebalance your portfolio occasionally thus if you 're lazy i would recommend a mutual fund or many mutual funds if you have difficulty finding a low cost one that is internationally diversified the most important consideration is the cost you can not expect careful fund selection to yield excess returns before expenses however the expenses are certain costs so prefer low cost funds almost always this means picking index funds avoid funds that have a small number of stocks because they typically invest only in the largest companies which means you fail to get diversification in company size so instead of euro stoxx 50 select stoxx 600 when investing to the european market etfs may have lower costs than traditional mutual funds so keep etfs in mind when selecting the mutual funds in which to invest for international diversification do not forget emerging markets it is not excessive to invest e.g. 20 to emerging markets emerging markets have a higher risk but they also have a higher return a portfolio that does not include emerging markets is not in my opinion well diversified when getting close to retirement age i would consider increasing the percentage of bonds in the portfolio this should be done primarily by putting additional money to bonds instead of selling existing investments to avoid additional taxes not sure if this applies to other taxation systems than the finnish one bond investments are best made though low cost mutual funds as well keep bond investments in your local currency and risk free assets i.e. select us government bonds whatever you do remember that historical return is no guarantee of future return actually the opposite may be true there is a mean reversion law if a particular investment has returned well in the past it often means its price has gone up making it more likely that the price goes down in the future so do n't select a fund based on its historical return instead select a fund based on low costs however i 'm 99 certain that over a period of 40 years stocks will return better than other investments in addition to fund costs taxes are the other certain thing that will be deducted from your returns research what options you have to reduce the taxes you need to pay 401-k was explained in another answer this may be a good option some things recommended in other answers that i would avoid

this is a reasonable requirement which many banks probably have the reason is that after you deposit a check ach or direct deposit they may be reversed after a couple of days check bounced payment canceled etc if you wire the money out and then the check by which you got the money gets bounced the bank is left hanging because money wired out is very hard to return wire transfers are generally irreversible unless its a mistake in the wire   after 10 days these transactions can not be reversed and the money is bound to remain on the account so you can wire it out by the way it also goes for cashier 's checks as well i had a similar discussion with my banker do n't remember if it was wf or chase when i needed one based on a ach transfer from my savings account elsewhere they gave me the check but said that its because i proved that the transfer was from my own account

here is from yahoo finance the s&p 500 over the last ~60 years logarithmic scale   the behavior since has been weird by historical standards and it 's very easy looking at that graph to say yes i would have made so much money had i invested in march 09 of course back in march 09 it was n't so clear that was the bottom but yes over the last 10 years or so you could have made more money by adopting a rule that you 'll accumulate cash in a fdic or similar insured savings account and dump it into an s&p index fund etf when the index is n% off its high of course if you look at the rest of the chart that strategy looks a lot less promising start in the early 80 's and you 'd have held cash until the crash in 2000 except for the recent the general trend in the s&p 500 and stock markets in general has been upward in other words to a first order approximation the s&p 500 is always at an all time high that 's just the general trend

gt cough cough blockbuster   blockbuster was ten thousand little independent franchise companies that rented videos to individuals at the strip mall   the franchises paid dues to blockbuster corporate for advertising and marketing   essentially corporate was the franchise union   if your union corporate was going to cut all the employees franchises out of all the revenue and business streaming like netflix then there would be problems   the only choice was for blockbuster to go out business otherwise they would have had to buy back all the franchises at full retail value and pay future profits   it was cheaper to close them down have the execs take their bonuses and wave at netflix

balance transfer is a specific type of transactions where you use card x to pay off card y. assume you have a credit card y with $ 1000 current balance you open a new credit card x and use the newly approved credit to pay off the balance on y. you 'll pay $ 30 fee 3 of the balance you 're transferring this does n't apply to transfers from your checking savings to the credit card to pay off the balance on that credit card balance transfer is when you use credit limit of card x to pay off existing balance of card y nothing else

for a lot of info on different funds fees average returns etc see this site not all sections are free but areas like best of the rest are and they offer good basic starting info i think for getting further into the nitty gritty for example if a fund is socially responsible you will need to go to the individual fund sites or read reviews although sites like morningstar may help however a few funds like this are free super and i 'm with the latter it might be useful to check out their sites to yourself to the aussie approach to this issue and then start searching more broadly from there and for what it 's worth for a general overview of the superannuation system and some nice to know info see this page on the oz govt website

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

i 'm a debt guy hence the bias i guess   's answer is relevant   as for considering alternatives in a given situation it sometimes happen is often done through a combination of equity and debt for example    mostly issuing equity dilutes control and potential dividend returns while debt pushes your interest charges up and adds pressure to or refinance later balancing the two will depend on the company 's intentions it 's capacities servicing debt requires a more stable cash flow generation capacity while equity is more rewarded by strong growth potential and a host of other factors

i think you should consult a professional with experience in 83(b election and dealing with the problems associated with that the cost of the mistake can be huge and you better make sure everything is done properly for starters i would look at the copy of the letter you sent to verify that you did n't write the year wrong i know you checked it twice but check again tax advisers can call a dedicated irs help line for practitioners where someone may be able to provide more information with your power of attorney on file and they can also request the copy of the original letter you 've sent to verify it is correct in any case you must attach the copy of the letter you sent to your 2014 tax return as this is a requirement for the election to be valid

monitoring all three is good practice that way you will be notified as soon as there is a hard pull on any of your reports most financial institutions only pull one of your three reports to open new credit if you 're only monitoring one you wo n't be alerted to new accounts until about a month passes and they are reported to all three by this time restoration will be much much more difficult than if you called the financial institution immediately to say that 's not me

look at your options with a 529 program if the money is used for education expenses that currently includes tuition room board even if living off campus books transportation it grows tax free earnings are not subject to federal tax and generally not subject to    state tax when used for the qualified education expenses of the    designated beneficiary such as tuition fees books as well as room    and board contributions to a 529 plan however are not deductible if it is a 529 associated with your state you can also save on state taxes you can make contributions on a regular basis or ad hoc accounts can even be setup by other relatives i have used a 529 to fund two kids education it takes care of most of your education expenses   529 programs are available from most states and even some of the big mutual fund companies many have the option of shifting the risk level of the investments to be more conservative as the kids hit high school   some states have an option to have you pay   a large sum when the child is small to buy semesters of college the deal is worth considering if you know they will be going to a state school the deal is less good if they will go out of state or to a private college   the irs does limit the maximum amount that you can contribute in a year an amount that exceeds the 14,000 annual gift limit if in 2014 you contributed more than $ 14,000 to a qualified tuition    plan qtp on behalf of any one person you may elect to treat up to    $ 70,000 of the contribution for that person as if you had made it    over a 5-year period the election allows you to apply the    annual exclusion to a portion of the contribution in each of the 5    years beginning in 2014 you can make this election for as many    separate people as you made qtp contributions one option at the end is to take any extra money at graduation and give it to the child so that it can be used for graduate school or if the taxes and penalties are paid it can be used for that first car it can even be rolled over to another relative

actually regulation was really helpful here some investors tried to invest into facebook privately having very limited information ipo just made things visible   perhaps a shitty analogy would help you to understand   gt when john was beating his wife privately that was ok because nobody saw her face i 'm sure she was asking for it but now due to stupid federal regulations there is an open investigation and everybody knows she was beaten this sucks start at the root fight with those stupid federal regulations which break into private homes   this makes as much sense as your comment
