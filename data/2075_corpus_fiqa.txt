consider this thought experiment take 10 million people and give them each $ 3,000 every day they each    purchase a random stock with all of their money the next day they    flip a coin and if it 's heads they do nothing and if it 's tails they    sell it and purchase another random stock repeat everyday for 5    years after 5 years you 'll probably have many people that lost all of their money due to the fees they paid for each trade they made a lot of people will have lost a little or won a little some people will have doubled or tripled their money or even better a very small number of people will have made millions some of those small number of people that made millions will likely go on to write books and sell seminars on how to make money in the stock market

i did once read a book titled how i made a million dollars on the stock market it sounded realistic enough to be a true story the author made it clear on the first page that a this was due to some exceptional circumstances b that he would never again be able to pull off something like this and c you would never be able to pull of something like this except with extreme luck   the situation was small company a with a majority shareholder other small company b tries to gain control by buying all the shares the majority shareholder of a trying to prevent this by buying as many shares as possible share price shooting up ridiculously smart traders selling uncovered shorts to benefit when the price inevitably drops the book author buying $ 5,000 worth of shares because they were going up and then one enormous short squeeze catching out the traders and he claimed having sold his shares for over a million before the price dropped back to normal   clearly not a matter of playing your cards right but of having an enormous amount of luck

you 'll need 25k to start or 2k in multiple accounts that way you have access to margin and do n't have to worry about pattern day trading limits be right more than you are wrong go up look for 3x potential up vs down risk compound daily   you ca n't double a penny every day every day for a month it becomes to difficult but you can do or maybe better 2k compounded 1 every day becomes 75k at the end of a year but you 'll likely have to take weekends off or look for other markets

warren buffett pointed out that if you set 1 million monkeys to flipping coins after ten flips one monkey in about 1,000 actually would have a perfect track record of 10 heads if you can double your money every three to five years basically the outer limit of what is humanly possible you can turn $ 1,000 into $ 1 million in 30 50 years but your chances of doing this are maybe those of that one in 1,000 monkeys there are people that believe that if warren buffett were starting out today today 's version could not beat the historical version one of the believers is warren buffett himself if you read between the lines of his writings what the promoters do is to use the benefit of hindsight to show that if someone had done such and such trades on such and such days they would have turned a few thousand into a million in a few short years that 's easy in hindsight but then challenge them to do it in real time

10k in stock at $ 1.00 per share made those who held into the hundreds per share made millions   but think about the likelihood of you owning a $ 1 stock and holding it past $ 10.00 they millionaires were both crazy and lucky   a direct answer better off buying a lottery ticket stocks are for growing wealth not gaining wealth imho of course there are outliers though   to the point in the other answer if it was repeatable the people teaching the tricks if they worked would make much more if they followed their own advice if it worked   also if everyone tells you how good gold is to buy that just means they are selling to get out if it was that good they would be buying and not saying anything about it

the short answer is yes it is possible to do what these classes claim however it is highly unlikely for every person they can show you that got rich using whatever so called method they are teaching there are hundreds of people that did n't that they are n't telling you about what i would recommend is invest in a well diversified portfolio if you have a higher tolerance for risk then you can make some of that portfolio out of higher risk reward investments maybe you pick the next apple or google or netflix or whatever but that portion of your portfolio should be money that you can afford to lose in case you pick

i would n't give it a second thought i 'd get rid of the extra car and do everything i could in the following months to repay the emergency fund even without the interest payments i 'd consider getting rid of an unused car due to the very nature of a car being a depreciating asset that has insurance expenses and annual registration fees on top of that depreciation the one exception to the above would be a classic car that was purchased for an investment that is always and does n't need to be registered for road use i take it for granted that most people who can afford such investments do n't need my advice about when to sell

firstly a stock split is easy for example each unit of stock is converted into 10 units   so if you owned 1 of the company before the stock split you will still own 1 after the stock split but have 10 times the number of shares    the company does not pay out any money when doing this and there is no effect on tax for the company or the share holder now onto stock dividend when a company make a profit the company gives some of the profit to the share holders as a dividend this is normally paid in cash   an investor may then wish to buy more shares in the company using the money from the dividend       however buying shares used to have a large cost in broker charges etc therefore some companies allowed share holders to choose to have the dividend paid as shares    the company buys enough of their own shares to cover the payout only having one set of broker charges and then sends the correct number of shares to each share holder that has opted for a stock dividend   along with any cash that was not enough to buy a complete share this made since when you had paper shares and admin costs where high for stock brokers    it does not make sense these days a stock dividend is taxed as if you had been paid the dividend in cash and then brought the stock yourself

i honestly do n't understand this sense of entitlement to being able to use your own device   by giving an employee access to sensitive data on their own device you are taking a risk that the company can not technologically or legally mitigate in the uk it would be a de facto breach of the data protection act   if there was a on an employee 's phone or laptop and they got access to any sensitive data then game over    this is not about inconvenience it is about not costing the companies in question billions in fines it is simply not worth it especially as most employees are perfectly capable of losing work computers on trains and so on so trusting them to look after their own system security is asking a bit much   what happens if they lose their own laptop a work laptop can be set to self destruct but few employees are going to let their companies have that level of control over their laptop and here in the uk if sensitive data is lost in that way and can be recovered using forensic tools then bam fines a company has a legal obligation to ensure that their employee 's and customer 's data is safe and any data accessed on a phone or laptop is still stored somewhere on that phone or laptop   third party software like dropbox is notoriously insecure too so that should n't ever be used on a machine containing sensitive data it 's hard enough getting employees to take security seriously before exponentially increasing these risks as you describe

i feel these beliefs can not be changed so easily once someone loses their money how can you convince him and on what ground can you convince him can you give a guarantee that investments will perform at a certain level there are many people who are happy with low returns but highly safe instruments they are not concerned with what you earn in the stock market or the realty market they are happy not losing their money i known many people who earned decently during the up rise of the stock market but all profits were squared up in the downturn and it turned to negative such people have their own thinking and such thinking is not out of place after experience with much turmoil i feel that they are also right to a great extent hence i feel if the person is not getting convinced you should accept it with greatness

the united states federal reserve has decided that interest rates should be low they think it may help the economy the details matter little here though it will enforce this low rate by buying treasury bonds at this very low interest rate bonds are future money so this means they pay a lot of money up front for very little interest in the future the fed will pay more than anyone who offers less money up front so they can set the price as long as they 're willing to buy at the end of the day treasury bonds pay nearly no interest    since there 's little money to be made with treasuries people who want better than zero returns will bid up the current price of any other bonds or similar loan like instruments to get what whatever rate of return that they can there 's really no more than one price for money you can think of the price of those bonds as basically treasury rate + some based on the risk percent   i realize thinking about bond prices is weird and different than other prices you 're measuring future money using present money and it 's easy to be confused and assure you it ultimately makes sense anyway your savings account money has to compete with everyone else willing to lend money to banks everyone else lends money for peanuts so you get peanuts on your savings account too your banking is probably worth more to your bank on account of your check card payment processing fees collected from the merchant than from the money they make lending out your savings notice how many places have promotional rates if you make your direct deposits or use your check card to make a purchase n times a month   in europe it 's similar except you 've got a different central bank if europe 's bank operated radically differently for an extended period of time you 'd expect to see a difference in the exchange rates which would ultimately make the returns from investing in those currencies pretty similar as well such a change may show up domestically as inflation in the country with the loose money policy and internationally as weakness against other currencies there 's really only one price for money around the entire world any difference boils down to a   difference in perceived risk

yes there are huge number of parts in the chain entire careers can be made out of handling clearing and settlement back office work for banks exchanges and trading houses even more so in the old days when this had to be done by hand but obviously now everything is electronic i can provide some insight into your questions at least on the trading side   brokers in many cases have their own brokers or their own trading operations they will have their own order entry and risk control systems so that is all proprietary but it usually does n't involve more than send buy sell y shares of name x to venue z at price p with extra instructions a b c d e. eventually an order will make its way to a direct market participant who sends an electronic order directly to an exchange   note that when you say market you should be referring to such exchanges in the us these are the nyse nasdaq and so on when you are talking about futures there is the cme and so on in europe there is the and so on the market refers to all these exchanges together which all have their own order mechanisms and matching engines in many cases exchanges will route orders to other exchanges depending on the specific country 's trading rules exchanges compete with each other by fee and liquidity offerings which are directly by market participants   another detail is that each market participant has its own clearing firm which has prior credit lines established with the market participant and a central clearing house like you said as soon as an order is matched the exchange where the order takes place hands the trade over to the clearing house where the trade is then settled between the clearing firms representing either side of the trade clearing disputes happen at this step

are you in the united states is there some sort of written agreement that the money your parents paid into the house is a loan that will be paid back   i assume the deed to the home is in your name and your parents do not have a lien on the property in any way in the united states provided there is no lien and your parents are not also on the mortgage that home is 100 yours now i would argue you still owe your parents money but absent some sort of contract it sounds like an interest free loan that you 'll pay back at a rate of   your parents could attempt to sue you and if this happens i recommend you find a real estate attorney it 's unlikely that they would win the case since there 's no paperwork and even if there was it is unlikely to hold up since it so strongly favors them your parents   now if your parents are listed on the mortgage or somehow have a lien on the house you have a bigger issue as they technically own or at least have an interest in part of the property and when you decide to sell the house you would have to involve them

a lower price is likely to be slightly more attractive to sellers than paying an equivalent amount in closing costs the seller is going to be paying the commission on the higher sale price and will net slightly less money it is common in my experience to ask for closing costs   the generic answer for your questions about how it is spent depends on the bank and type of loan in general you will not be able to walk away with the cash if closing costs are less than the concession but they can be applied to funding escrow and points transfer fees etc there is the potential to lose the concession if there are n't sufficient closing costs i am fairly certain that there is n't any tax differences between the two in the us

i have read in many personal finance books that stocks are a great investment for the long term because on average they go up 5 7 every year this has been true for the last 100 years for the s&p500 index but is there reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely into the future it has also been wrong for 20 + year time periods during those last 100 years it 's an average and you can live your whole career at a loss there are many things to support the retention of the average over the next 100 years i think the is out of scope of your actual investment philosophy but basically there are many ways to lower your cost basis by reinvesting dividends selling options or contributing to your position at any price from a portion of your income and by inflation and by the growth of the world economy with a low enough cost basis then a smaller percentage gain in the index gives you a magnified profit

some qualitative factors to consider when deciding whether to finance with equity vs debt for a publicly traded company     1 the case for equity is the stock trading high relative to what management believes is its intrinsic value if so raising equity may be attractive since management would be raising a lot of $ $ $ but the downside is you give up future earnings since you are diluting current ownership   2 the case for debt what is the expected return for the project in which the raised capital will be utilized for is its expected return higher than the interest payments in terms if so raising debt would be more attractive than raising equity since current ownership would not be diluted   that 's all i can think of off the top of my head right now i 'm sure there are a few more qualitative factors to consider but i think these two are the most intuitive

unfortunately if your taxes are too complicated for the 1040ez form then your tax situation is effectively unique and you need to try both options and see for yourself which one is better if you do your taxes yourself you may be more likely to do a more thorough job in digging everything up   you might even find that you can deduct some things that you had n't thought of before on the other hand whenever i 've gone to a tax professional it 's always been pretty much an all or nothing proposal   you sit down with them and hand them your records they ask a couple simple questions and they either give you your completed tax return on the spot or they have you come back in a week for a brief review of the final numbers   if they do n't prepare your return on the spot you can usually send additional items later on if you think of something that you forgot the first time around but for the most part it 's still a one time shot that said i 'm beginning to think the difference in monetary cost of completing even a mildly complex tax return is going to be insignificant and the main factors to consider are the value of your own time and how much of the tax code you want to learn because in my experience the software always refers to additional irs forms or codes that are not automated in the software   in theory your tax return should be the same regardless of whether you have a tax professional do your taxes or if you do them yourself which software you use   given the same inputs you should get about the same outputs   even though that theory does n't always hold exactly true all the options should get you in the same ballpark close enough that it does n't make much difference in the grand scheme of things unless your tax return is done incorrectly e.g. you choose the wrong filing status or forget to take a major deduction suppose you 're married and you or your spouse is a partner in an llc   maybe a tax professional wants to charge you $ 500 for your tax return this will vary based on your circumstances   you could alternatively buy the tax software for $ and spend 20 + hours navigating through the interviews and reviewing tax codes for the decisions and worksheets that are not automated in the software   depending on how much time you personally have to spend on the tax return one option might be better than the other   maybe you have to pay your in house accounting person to use the tax software or you have to pay an employee to cover for you while you use the software   keep in mind that the tax professional and the tax software are probably deductible whereas your time may not be   in the end even if you save money up front it might be a wash on the following year 's tax return especially after you consider the time that you could have spent with your family on your business

gt no it 's really not i have no illusions that private school is any better than the public schools around here the problems with them differ but one is no better than the other our education system in florida is broken the voucher system they instituted created broken schools and soon to be bankrupt private schools every state that 's done so has or soon will have the same problems even states that are n't screwing their public schools with vouchers are screwing them with poor funding at every level   how do vouchers fuck over our education system does n't it allow parents to pick the best school for their kids despite their economic condition i may be mistaken on what vouchers are is n't it just the government paying for what ever school you decide to go to   gt;every state that 's done so has or soon will have the same problems   source please   broke and getting more broke every year eventually it might get fixed but i 'm not going to play maybe games with my kids i 'd rather move them to a country that is n't supporting the most expensive military on the planet   as long as you send your kids to a school where they do n't fear for their lives have teachers that at least do the bare minimum and you are involved in your kid 's school life then they will be fine it is n't a school that makes the kids successful it is the parents who are active in their kids lives if the school is also good then that is all the better    canada is n't a magical i get the feeling that you surround yourself in an echo chamber of other parents who are mad at the education system you guys build off each other to make america 's education system seem like hell on earth

the livret a is a very specific product it 's tax exempt and would historically not be available through regular banks commercial banks can now offer it but they only collect the money on behalf of the des cdc the cdc then pays interest to the savers and a commission for the bank the commission is baked into the system not charged to the customer directly but since the interest rate is set centrally banks can not compete on that so this is risk free money for them but on the flip side it does not help them meet capital adequacy requirements other savings account or products have different rules another angle to consider is that a livret a was historically very attractive for consumers and was certainly perceived as such so that many people would have a checking account at a regular bank and another account at the or the just to open a livret a. for commercial banks the alternative therefore is n't having your money on your checking account vs. your livret a or another savings account it was having your money on a livret a they administer vs. seeing you run away to another institution there is also a cap on the livret a and you 're not allowed to save more money by opening several of them at different banks at the same time banks have been complaining that the decrease of the interest rate and consequently of their commission makes the whole scheme a lot less interesting for them for what it 's worth i recently a bank account in france after living abroad for a long time and the customer advisor did not seem particularly interested in pushing a livret a.

definitely get a lawyer to write up all the details of the partnership in a formal agreement if your ex does not want to do this that is a bad sign you both need to be clear about expectations and responsibilities in this partnership and define an exit strategy in the case one of you wants out this is the most fair to both parties generally what is common is that property is split cleanly when the relationship ends i would strongly recommend you both work towards a clean split with no joint property ownership how this looks depends on your unique situation to address your questions 2 and 3 you have two roles here tenant and owner   as a 50 owner you are running a business with a partner   that business will have assets home income expenses and profit you basically need to run this partnership as a simple business   all the rent income your rent and the other tenant 's should go into a separate account the mortgage and all other housing expenses are then paid from only this account any excess is then profit that may be split 50/50 all expenses should be agreed upon by both of you either by contract or by direct communication you should see a financial professional to make sure accounting and taxes are set up properly under this system your ex could do work on the house and be paid from the business income however they are responsible to you to provide an estimate and scope of work just like any other contractor if you as a joint owner agree to his price he then could be paid out of the business income this reduces the business cash flow for the year accordingly you can probably see how this can get very complicated very fast there is really no right or wrong answer on what both of you decide is fair and best for the sake of simplicity and the least chance of a disaster the usual and recommended action is to cleanly split all property good luck

there are in fact two balances kept for your account by most banks that have to comply with common convenience banking laws   the first is your actual balance it is simply the sum total of all deposits and withdrawals that have cleared the account that is both your bank and the bank from which the deposit came or to which the payment will go have exchanged necessary proof of authorization from the payor and have confirmed with each other that the money has actually been debited from the account of the payor transferred between the banks and credited to the account of the payee   the second balance is the available balance this is the actual balance plus any amount that the bank is floating you while a deposit clears minus any amount that the bank has received notice of that you may have just authorized but for which either full proof of authorization or the definite amount or both have not been confirmed this is what 's happening here your bank received notice that you intended to pay the train company $ x. they put an authorization hold on that $ x deducting it from your available balance but not your actual balance the bank then for whatever reason declined to process the actual transaction insufficient funds suspicion of theft fraud but kept the hold in place in case the transaction was re attempted holds for debit purchases usually expire between 1 and 5 days after being placed if the hold is not subsequently settled by the merchant providing definite proof of amount and authorization before that time the expiration time mainly depends on the policy of the bank holding your account holds can remain in place as long as thirty days for certain accounts or types of payment again depending on bank policy in certain circumstances the bank can remove a hold on request but it is the bank and not the merchant that you must contact to remove a hold or even inquire about one

your chief problem seems to be that you 're mixing visa credit cards and a european automated clearing house credit cards are primarily an american concept but do work worldwide especially in industry the credit card companies are financial institutions themselves and operate similar to international banks they 're typically acting as intermediaries between the customer 's bank and the retailer 's bank so this works even if those two banks have no existing agreements   this is expensive though is a cheaper european system which eliminates the middle man it allows the consumer 's bank to directly pay the retailer 's bank visa is not a member of

i am only familiar with american banks but generally speaking they will work with you if you can demonstrate that you have an adequate average income over a period of time it is likely they will want a record of your income for at least the last 24 months more would be better the terms of the individual contracts i.e. termination clauses etc should n't be important as long as you have a demonstrated history of making a good income i 'd recommend finding a bank that performs manual underwriting i.e. they actually have someone on staff that will look at your credit history income debt ratios as opposed to them just generating an offer based on a computer model lending standards can vary quite a bit from bank to bank and you have not listed your average annual income so it is difficult to say whether they will offer you a mortgage or for what amount but you have a significant down payment however assuming that your numbers are good and that you can find someone intelligent to work with it 's unlikely that they will deny you simply because your income is uneven best of luck

there is no federal law that mandates that they must re open a closed account they can either refuse the transfer return the money or they can optionally re open your account so they get money makes more sense for them it is however in one of your agreements that they reserve the right to re open a closed account in order to receive the deposit at which point your account will become active and the balance may be below the required minimum balance threshold so you may have maintenance or low balance fees charged against the account credit unions are less likely to have these fees if you want to call them out on their bs you can ask them to cite the law which mandates the re opening of closed accounts they will likely fall back on your member agreement there may be some state laws that discuss this but i have n't found anything this has become such a problem for some bank customers where they are charged fees on the money they were n't aware they had that a law was proposed in sept. 2013 called the freedom and mobility in consumer banking act which would essentially only allow the named account to re open a closed account i went ahead and looked up the guidelines for ach transfers i got the 2013 version   2013 corporate rules and guidelines these lines reference article which is uniform commercial code section funds transfer this means that if your account is actually closed they have an exception to the standard timeframe for issuing a return entry this means that if you notify them in writing that you refuse any future credit entries to the account they must return them i then went looking for the return reason codes rdfi = receiving depository financial institution from what i gather based on these guidelines your cu did n't actually close your account they put it on hold or some similar state if they actually close your account they are required to issue a return entry with code   in your case your cu does n't charge you any maintenance fees but for those working with banks the best bet is to notify them in writing that you refuse any future credits to the account or go into a branch and insist on fully closing out the account

that does n't answer either of my questions   for the first you 've given me a quotation which i 've seen several times before and can not find the original source if you know it please cite it that consists of opinion and speculation not a definition   for the second it could be inferred that you mean to tell say you would support reverting to a monetary system based on exchanging precious metals which mr. jefferson implies his tolerance of however if this is what you mean to communicate you 're not doing yourself any favors in helping me understand your position by basing it on a minor aside in an quotation about something else   i 'm very much on board with the movement within ows that 's pushing for socioeconomic justice but most of the people i see shouting end the fed really have no clue as to what they 're talking about this sort of willingness to act on ignorance is damaging   edit if the ows reference was weird it was because i was previously reading a banking story from one of the occupy subreddits and briefly forgot where i was nothing changed except a spelling error and this note

a company does n't offer up 100 of its shares to the market   there 's a float amount of varying significance maybe 30 of the shares are put up for public offer   generally some amount of current shareholders will pledge some or all of their shares for offer to the public   this may be how the venture capital private equity or other current investors cash out their initial investment   the company may issue new shares in order to raise money for some initiative   it may be a combination of existing shares and new additionally a company may hold some treasury shares on its balance sheet   in this instance fluctuations in the share price directly affect the health of the balance sheet as far as incentive goes stock options to management and c suite employees keep everyone interested in an increasing stock price

another way of explaining the balance right after a particular bill is paid you have $ 0 saved to pay that bill the next time   just before the bill is next due you wisely have the whole amount saved   that 's the purpose of the whole process   so for that bill on average over time you 'll have one half that upcoming bill in the account but the same argument holds for every one of the upcoming bills   so for a large number of bills with varying sizes and times between occurrence the average amount in the account will be approximately one half of the total amount of all the bills that you 're saving for

diversifying your portfolio between asset a and asset b only reduces the portfolio risk if asset a and asset b are not correlated if they have either a low correlation or a negative correlation to each other then you benefit from combining them in a portfolio in terms of risk reduction the standard deviation of returns will be lower in a portfolio of low or uncorrelated assets if on the other hand you combine two correlated assets into a portfolio you are doubling down on the same assumption which means you are not reducing your risk you are also wasting capital because now you have allocated capital to 2 separate trades investments yet they have shown a high tendency of moving together here is an article that discusses this further why diversify your stock portfolio

yes when i place an order with my broker they send it out to the exchange for individual investors what are some cons and pros of trading on     the exchanges directly versus indirectly via brokers i may be highly doubt it but from my understanding you can not trade directly through an exchange as a retail investor bats allows membership but it is only for   your firm must be a registered broker dealer registered with a self regulatory organization and connected with a clearing firm no apple aapl is listed on the nasdaq so trades go through the nasdaq for aapl caterpillar inc cat is listed on the nyse so trades go through the nyse   the exchange you trade on is dependent on the security if it is listed on the nyse then you trade on the nyse as a regular investor you will be going through a broker when looking to purchase a security it is more important to know about the company and less important to know what exchange it is listed on since there are rules a company must comply with for it to be listed on certain exchanges it does make a difference but that is more the case when speaking about a stock listed over the or nyse it is not important when asking nyse or nasdaq selecting a broker is something that 's dependent on your needs you should ask your self what s important to me do i want iphone android do i need fancy trading tools generally all the brokers you listed will most likely do the trick for you some review sites brokerage review   online broker review 2012 barron 's 2012 online broker review

the justification for an act typically comes after the decision is made people operate under a fairly universal set of instincts and social behaviors so i think condemning him for this behavior directly is short sighted    i would ask instead why do people feel that cheating organizations like target is so emotionally easy i would wager that is not the sort of person who would steal his neighbors unlocked bike from his porch or hustle a man for bus fare so what is different   we seem generally as a population to have less emotional investment in strangers than ourselves even less in people from other cultures and even less in animals we will fight hard to save the lives of 5000 of our soldiers less hard to save a million of their and we certainly do n't give a fuck about taking a bee 's honey or killing a chicken and eating it again generally    i would propose that organizations like big box stores fall somewhere between animals and foreign peasants as far as our feelings of responsibility towards them it is a little more complicated than that because obviously a big box store supports the lives of a certain number of people but if a big box store were delicious and did not support people i would wager it would not survive for very long   so the defining difference seems to be whether or not you are a person who makes a rational decision that the store provides more good for your people or if it is a net harmful force whether you have strong ingrained emotional belief structures regarding cheating or and whether your rational mind your emotional decision making mine rarely does though i try   a person who thinks that they do more harm to the population than good even with a strong sense of the of stealing might steal from the store even though they would never steal from another person they would be completely morally justified in this act   similarly a person who thinks that the store does more good than harm and does not steal from the store regardless of whether or not they think stealing is wrong would also be morally just in their actions    a person who thinks they do no harm to the community but has no negative emotional connection to the act of theft might steal from both the store and their neighbor they would obviously not be justified   a person with a strong sense of the of stealing which their rational decision regarding the value of a big box store will not steal but they may not be morally justified in the decision depending on their rational take   i think i fall into the first category i think it is wrong not to do harm to an organization like target when it is possible to do so yet i generally do n't go about this by stealing because getting caught would be much worse than whatever harm i could do by jacking a few dollars worth of merchandise this offer allowed a means of theft without getting caught and had i been aware of it i probably would have availed myself of it   as it stands i just work extremely hard in the field of with the hopes that one day i will contribute to technologies which will allow humans to live and thrive without having to buy food clothes medicine or shit from target

i 'm not familiar with the law and taxes in india but can provide guidance based on general accounting and tax principles you are right that receiving money as a loan is not income and is n't liable to income tax therefore i suggest you actually this loan through a written contract with your friend the contract should include all the usual elements of a loan amount interest even if preferential or zero principal term consequences of default and currency of loan you can then simply state the purpose of transfer as personal loan agreement if you have such a document and are questioned by tax authorities you can easily show that the inward remittance is from a loan and should therefore be treated like any commercial loan for tax purposes as long as you disclose the debt in your tax return if required in india and your friend discloses any interest received as income i think you 'll be above board and wo n't be liable for any income tax to make sure you might be better off having a quick consultation with an accountant or tax specialist in india to advise you and draft the loan agreement

if markets are efficient which they are n't but anyways the frequency of dca investments should n't yield any meaningful difference in return   the one possible item to note is that if you 're able to invest more frequently you 'll have more money exposed to the effects of compounding for longer which may increase return however there are also transaction costs to consider which may render something like continuous dca ing ineffective    that same compounding effect also negates the potential benefits of dca altogether making it more logical to lump sum your investments    you may be conflating dca with simply making additional cash every week that 's available for investment if that 's the case again lump sum as early as possible should yield the best results   this is n't financial advice read the sidebar disclaimers

first there will always be people who think the market is about to crash it does n't really crash very often when it does crash they always say they predicted it well even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while you could go short short selling stocks which requires a margin account that you have to qualify for typically you can only short up to half the value of your account in the us and if you 've maxed out your margin limits and your account continues to drop in value you risk a margin call which would force you to cover your shorts which you may not be able to afford you could invest in a fund that does the shorting for you you could also consider actually buying good investments while their prices are low since you can not predict the start or end of a crash you should consider dollar cost averaging until your stocks hit a price you 've pre determined is your trigger then purchase larger quantities at the bargain prices the equity markets have never failed to recover from crashes ever

i answered a similar question before essentially you should n't trust a site you find on the internet merely because it looks professional and real   before signing up with any new service provider you found online you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm any site you happen to come across on the internet could be an elaborate of a real company intended to capture your personal details or worse first to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities in the united states you can consult finra 's online service   this might be the first of many checks you should undertake after you convince yourself that finra is legitimate   a meta problem then if you want to know if the web site address is authentic one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source such as the finra details   unfortunately those details do not currently appear to contain the broker 's web site url   else that could be useful another thing to look at is the site 's login or sign up page for a valid ssl certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a well known certificate authority e.g. for a financial services firm of any kind you should look for and expect to see an extended validation certificate   any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domain name owner and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name   yes anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic ssl certificate for that domain fwiw scottrade and sharebuilder are both legitimate brokers i was aware already of each but i also just checked in the finra tool and the urls currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each   also you can see their ev certificates in action on secured pages here and here as to whether your investments with those brokers would be safe in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt you 'll want to know that they are members of the securities investor protection corporation wikipedia   of course this kind of protection does n't protect you if your investments simply go down in value but do your own due diligence always

i will give a slightly different answer which is actually an addendum to joetaxpayer 's soon to be edited answer do not go to your financial advisor and ask him how do i go about transferring my roth ira to where is whichever broker or mutual fund family that you have chosen from the list that joe has suggested   instead go to the website of the new group or call their toll free number and tell them i want to open a roth ira account with you and fund it by transferring all the money in my roth ira from first clearing your new roth ira custodian will take care of all the paperwork and get the money transferred over at no cost to you except possibly fielding a call from your current financial advisor because he had just ordered his new lamborghini and now will have difficulty making payments on his auto loan why are you leaving me after all the years we have had together you will need to choose some place to put the money and i suggest that you use their s&p 500 index fund   not the s&p 500 etf just the standard vanilla s&p 500 index mutual fund this recommendation is almost heresy in this forum but it is better to pay the extra 0.01 fee that the fund charges over and above the etf until you become a little more savvy and are ready to branch out into individual stocks which is when you really need a brokerage account revelation i have never made the transition and invest only in mutual funds which does not require a brokerage account after doing all this pay no attention whatsoever to your roth ira investment or how the s&p 500 index is doing for the   next 20 years this will help avoid the temptation of taking all your money out just because the index went down a little everybody is told buy low sell high but far too many folks end up doing exactly the opposite buying because the stock market is up and selling when it starts going down

who 's to say it was n't priced into the markets at least to some degree without any information on the behaviour of holders pre expiry no one can know if they 've been shorting the stock in advance of selling on expiry day and with the float being such a small proportion of the total issuance there 's always the risk of sudden fluctuations picking up big momentum which could easily explain the 7 drop on expiry day add into all this uncertainty the usual risks of shorting e.g. limited upside unlimited downside and the observed phenomena are n't by any means killer blows of the efficient market hypothesis that 's not to say that such evidence does n't necessarily exist just that this is n't it

i think there 's value in charging family members friends interest if it will make them take the loan seriously   the problem is that if you 're thinking about charging interest because the person seems to be borrowing from you too it may be too late to make them take it seriously in the situation you describe if you 're concerned about the loans being paid back i think you need to have a serious conversation with the kids and make it clear you expect them to pay the loans back on whatever schedule you agreed to   if based on your knowledge of your kids you think charging interest would help motivate them to do this great   if not charging interest is unlikely to accomplish anything that the conversation itself wo n't accomplish   if you have n't previously outlined a specific schedule or set of expectations for how you want to be paid back just doing that in writing may be enough to make them realize it 's not a joke the conventional wisdom is that you should n't lend money to anyone unless you 're either a okay with never being paid back or b willing to pursue legal remedies to ensure you 're paid back   most people are n't willing to sue their own family members over small loans which means in most cases it 's not a good idea to loan money to family unless you 're okay with never being repaid whatever level of okay with makes sense for you i should note that i do n't have kids my advice here is just how i would handle it if i were considering loaning money to my brother or a close friend or the like   this means i do n't really know anything about teaching the kids about the real world but i have to say my hunch is that if your kids are 25 + and married it 's too late to radically change their views on how the real world works unless they had a very sheltered early adulthood they 've been living in the real world for too long and will have their own ideas of how it works

this decision depends upon a few things i will list a 1 what is your perception about financial markets in your time span of investments 2 what kind of returns are you expecting 3 how much liquidity do you have to take care of your daily monthly expenses your perception about financial markets is weak for the near future do not invest all your money in a mutual fund at 1 time because if the market falls drastically chances are that your fund will also lose a lot of money and the nav will go down on the other hand if you think it is strong go ahead and invest all at one time 2 if you are expecting very high returns in a short time frame then sip might not be a very good option as you are only investing a portion of your money so if the market goes higher then you will make money only on what you have invested till date and also buy into the fund in the upcoming month at a higher rate so you will get less units   3 if you put all your money into a mutual fund will you have enough money to take care of your daily needs and emergencies the worst thing about an investment is putting in all what you have and then being forced to sell in a bear market at a lower rate because you really require the money other option is taking a personal 16 and taking care of your daily needs but that would not make sense either as the average return that you can expect from a mutual fund in india is 12 13 to 1 if you have money to spare and think the market is going to go higher a mutual fund is a better option 2 if you have the money to spare and think that the market is going to fall don't do is always better to be even than lose 3 if you do n't have the money and do n't know about markets but want to be part of it then you can invest in an sip because the advantages of this are if the market goes high you make money on what you 've put it and if the market falls you get to buy more units of the fund for a cheaper price eventually you can expect to make a return of 14 15 on these but again investments are subject to market risk please watch the funds average return over the last 10 years and their portfolio holdings all the best i am assuming you are talking about equity funds

disallowed losses due to the wash sale rule are added to the basis of the repurchased shares   in your example on day two you paid $ per share then the disallowed $ 0.30 loss from the previous day gets added to the basis making your total basis $ 1.00 per share when you sell at the end of the day for $ 1.00 per share your net gain loss is zero furthermore you can recapture disallowed losses by selling the last lot of abc completely yourself of all holdings in abc for at least 31 days even if that last lot was a loss when taking into account the increased basis from previously disallowed wash sale losses you can claim the loss fully on this last non wash sale

because that s not how insurance works yes they make a profit but the only reason any single person can get a policy is because there is a pool of people large enough to spread the risk that means there needs to be healthy people too the bigger the pool the lower the cost if you 're still pissy at that point that it 's expensive it 's not the insurance company at that point its the actual costs of medical care that are expensive and require a policy as expensive as it is to cover those costs

every bill you write counts as income if the bill does n't get paid you would count that as an expense in cases where you do n't write bills i think the payment you receive would count as income but you might check that on the hmrc website so to record your income you can basically record the payments that you receive   anything you pay out for your business is an expense you keep a receipt for every expense if you do n't have a receipt you ca n't count it as an expense so keeping all the receipts is very very important an exception are investments for example buying a computer that should last multiple years there you can count a percentage of the investment as expense every year   all income minus all expenses is your profit you pay tax and national insurance contributions according to your profit you can do whatever you like with the profit   notice that i did n't mention any salary self employed means you have no salary you have profits and do with them whatever you like on the other hand you pay taxes on these profits almost exactly as if they were income   if you have this blog but are also employed you 'll add the profits to your normal income statement

but is the money saved taxable not sure i understand the question if say you have salary of rs 5 lacs after paying taxes and expenses lets say you save rs 1 lacs if you keep this 1 lacs in savings account you will get interest if this interest is less than rs 10,000/- it is not taxable if it is more that rs 10,000 then the additional amount is taxable i.e. if you get a savings bank interest of rs the difference rs 15,000 minus rs 10,000 i.e. rs 5000 is taxable note if you keep the 1 lacs in fixed deposits then all interest even if you get rs 1 is taxable edit if you invest the rs 1 lacs in tax saving fd lock in period of 6 years then yes you can claim deduction under section 80c.

any sensible lender will require a lean lien against your formerly free and clear property and will likely require an appraisal of the property the lender is free to reject the deal if the house is in any way not fitting their underwriting requirements examples of such situations would be if the house is in a flood emergency zone in a declining area an unusual property and therefore hard to compare to other properties not in salable condition so even if they foreclose on it they 'd have a questionable ability to get their money back and so forth some lenders wo n't accept mobile homes manufactured housing as collateral for instance and also if the lender agrees they may also require insurance on the property to be maintained so they can ensure that a terrible fate does n't both properties at one time as happens occasionally on the downside in my experience in the us lenders will often require a lower loan percentage than a comparable cash down deal an example i encountered was that the lender would happily provide 90 loan to value if a cash down payment was provided but would not go above 75 ltv if real estate was provided instead these sort of deals are especially common in cases of new construction where people often own the land outright and want to use it as collateral for the building of a home on that same land but it 's not uncommon in any case just less common than cash down deals depending on where you live and where you want to buy vs where the property you already own is located i 'd suggest just directly talking to where you want to first consider getting a quote for financing this is not an especially exotic transaction so the loan officer should be able to direct you if they accept such deals and what their conditions are for such arrangements on the upside many lenders still treat the to calculate their rate quote the same no matter where the down payment is coming from with the lower the ltv the lower the interest rate they 'll be willing to quote some lenders might not and some might require extra closing fees you may need to shop around you might also want to get a comparative quote on getting a direct mortgage on the old property and putting the cash as down payment on the new property thus keeping the two properties legally separate and giving you some walk away options that are n't possible otherwise   i 'd advise you to talk with your lenders directly and shop around a few places and see how the two alternatives compare they might be similar or one might be a hugely better deal underwriting requirements can change quickly and can vary even within individual regions so it 's not really possible to say once and for all which is the better way to go

the twrr calculation will work even with negative values twrr = 1 + 0.10 x 1 + x 1 + ^ 1/3 = which is a 4.7 return your second question concerns the return calculated for the second quarter   you seem to think this return is way off   not really   the twrr calculates a return by accounting for cash that was added or deducted to from the account   so if i started with $ 100,000 added $ 10,000 to the account and ended up with $ 110,000 what should be the return on my investment   my answer would be 0 since the only reason my account balance went up was due to me adding cash to it   therefore if i started with $ 100,000 added $ 10,000 in cash to the account and ended up with $ 100,000 in my account then my return would be a negative value since i lost the $ 10,000 that i deposited in the account in the second quarter you started with $ 15,000 deposited $ 4,000 and ended with $   you essentially lost almost all of the $ 4,000 you deposited   that is a significant loss

does it ever make sense yes but almost never   if you 're in a situation where you 're invested in something with low rates think government securities or cash equivalents then you do need to think about rate spread as you mention does the savings over the life over the mortgage beat out the 35 hit now plus all the interest you would earn over those 20 years have you factored in other considerations such as mortgage interest deduction on taxes do n't forget you need to think about how rates will change down the line they ca n't go much lower so potentially you 'll get better rates in the 401(k down the line do n't forget there 's also the impact of inflation again the rates on your savings may go up but your mortgage is a fixed payment so with even a low rate of inflation your payments effectively become less over time if your investments are in something like stocks and bonds then i would say undoubtedly you would want to keep the money in the 401(k time in market and compounding are your best friends over a long time horizon also as mentioned by @johnfx the hit of your 35 now is something you will absolutely feel now hopefully not but your life situation could change where you have an emergency and need to drain your savings or you may not see the end of that 20 years

the short answer is that it 's never the right time to buy an emerging technology as long as the technology is emerging you should expect that newer revisions will be both better and less expensive with solar specifically there are some tax credits to help the early adopters that may help you on the cost benefit analysis but in the end you still have to decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs now and if not whether that will change in the near future for me part of the solar benefit is the ability to generate electricity when the power goes out that option does require local battery storage however one of the benefits of using musk 's solar tiles instead of actual slate is the weight of the quartz tiles which is much lower than the weight of real slate in many cases a slate roof is heavy enough to require major reinforcement of the roof before installation the lower weight also saves significantly on shipping costs this is where musk can lower costs enough to be competitive to some of the materials he hope to compete with

as i understand it capital gains from real estate sales in india can be shielded from income tax entirely if the proceeds of the sale are invested in certain specific types of bonds rural highway authority of india for a period of three years beginning no later than x months 6 months after completion of the sale perhaps this applies to sales of inherited real estate only and not to commercial property or residential property acquired by purchase since there is no step up of basis on death as occurs in the us and in all likelihood records of the purchase price of the inherited property are lost in the of time and so the basis of the investment is effectively zero or treated as such by the revenue authorities the interest paid by these bonds is included in taxable income perhaps will be willing to correct any mistakes in the above so it may be necessary to check whether a the interest income from the bonds was declared on form 1040 schedule b for each year b whether the appropriate boxes the ones that ask whether the taxpayer has signature authority over foreign accounts etc were checked on schedule b or not c whether form td 90 22.1 was filed each year or not this is the fbar requirement note that if the total value of the accounts is less than us $ 10 k during the entire year then the taxpayer is supposed to check no on schedule b and need not file form td 90 22.1   also there is a separate requirement to file a form 8938 for certain specific types of investments   there was a two part article describing these rules in forbes magazine some time ago and this is available on line part 1 and   part ii as says the irs might be lenient if the only issue is not filing the forms in timely fashion and the taxpayer is voluntarily coming into compliance even though the filing is late they are likely to be less   forgiving if the foreign income was not reported and still remains unreported even after filing the various forms

selling one fund and buying another will incur capital gains tax on the sale for the amount of the gain i 'm not aware of any sort of exemption available due to you moving out of the country however long term capital gains for low tax bracket taxpayers is 0 as long as your total income including the gains fits within the 15 regular tax bracket you do n't pay any long term capital gains options for you that i see to avoid taxes are note that even if you do sell it all it 's only the amount of gains that would take your income over the 15 normal tax bracket that would be taxed at the long term rate of 15 which may not end up being that much of a tax hit it may be worth calculating just how bad it would be based on your actual income also note that all i 'm saying here is for us federal income taxes the state you most recently lived in may still charge taxes if you 're still considered a resident there in some fashion and i do n't know if your new home 's government may try to take a cut as well

first the single worst reason to do anything is because most people are doing it the second worst thing is to take tax advice from a non tax pro ironic i understand but read on run through your 2015 tax return do you itemize already if not there 's a reason the standard deduction for a couple is $ 12,600 in 2016 so a renter is n't likely to have enough deductions to itemize even with a high state tax   for 2016 project your total interest from the mortgage and the year 's property tax then add your state income tax and last any charitable donations this total comprises the bulk of what people take on their schedule a. now since your current withholding assumes the standard $ 12,600 subtract this number and you 're left with the amount your taxable income will be reduced for the fact that you have the house last divide this number by $ 4000 the result is how many more withholding allowances you can claim one personal exemption a withholding allowance is exactly $ 4050 this year   for what its worth median home price for early 2016 was $ after 20 down a $ 152 k mortgage would cost about $ 6000 in interest the first year and maybe $ 3000 in property tax the average couple making $ 60,000 or so wo n't have a state bill much over $ 3000 so shy of some nice donations it 's easy to have a house yet still not itemize   of course if you have higher income and a more expensive home the numbers will be different   the best you can do is to get tax software or use an online service and estimate the 2016 return based on your numbers if you wish to post numbers via an edit to your question i 'm happy to update my answer a bit to your situation   note the form you 'll use to adjust withholdings the w4 offers a worksheet to perform the calculation   it asks in line 1 for your total itemized deductions then subtract the standard deduction then divide by $ 4050 pretty much what i suggested above

the brokerage firm will purchase shares for the dividend paid in a account for the security of the issuer and then they will distribute fractional shares among all their clients that chose div reinvest   they will only have to buy 1 extra share to account for the fractional portion of what they allocate   the structure of the market does not permit trading of fractional shares there is generally not any impact to the market place for div reinvest with the exception of certain securities that pay large dividends that are not liquid sometimes this occurs in   preferred securities where a large amount of div reinvestment could create a large market order that has market impact   most brokers place market orders for the opening on the day following the payment of the dividend when you sell the fractional portion same process as full shares are sold into the market and the fractional if traded between you and the brokers account   if it creates a full share for the broker has .6 shares and you sell him .5 they would likely flip that out to the street with the full share portion of your order this would not have impact to outstanding shares and all cost are operational and with the broker handling the div reinvestment service

a flat tax rate is terrible economically but also morally on the one hand it seems morally right to me that the rich should contribute to a larger share of government spending    but that aside economically it makes sense for wealthier people to be taxed more as they are far to save any spare money at the end of the month which by definition if they are rich should be plenty with a flat rate poorer people meanwhile are far to spend any extra income either out of necessity and or perhaps as investments that they have been putting off even small luxuries can now be fitted into the budget like meals in a restaurant or strong comfortable shoes       my point is that this very consumption creates a demand becomes vital to maintaining more demand and have you heard how demand that needs supply creates it 's own demand i know it 's crazy but it 's an actual concept called say 's news economics brief our series looks reasoning made jean say

i think it is clear that this has a lot to do with keeping salaries down     the company has a maximal possible salary limit i.e. the most they would be willing and able to pay for what you do   you have a minimal possible salary   both of you know that the current salary is in between the two figures   for negotiations it would be very useful for you to know the maximal possible salary i.e. the utmost the company would be willing to pay you to stay and continue the company on the other hand is obliged to keep costs low and hence would like to know your new minimum acceptable salary so they wo n't make an offer too high     but if you knew all salaries of people around you you could make a better guess about your own maximal possible salary   you probably would over estimate it because we all tend to over estimate our own relevance and competence but it would be a better informed guess at least   the company would hence give up an informational advantage which could lead them to have higher costs   so they will ask you how much you were offered at the competitor i.e. they will be close to your new minimum acceptable salary while trying to prevent you from learning anything about the maximal possible salary

you can often convert the outstanding balance of a heloc into a fixed rate home equity loan generally with the same bank   doing this can open possibilities to extend the term allowing for lower monthly payments but resulting in a larger overall payoff cost most helocs allow for an interest only payment or in some cases no payment at all if you still have unused available credit not advising that you do this if you are struggling with the size of the payment converting to a fixed rate fixed term loan may be what you need the key will be getting the term such that you can manage both the principal and interest that will be included in the payment

the main thing you 're missing is that while you bear all the costs of manipulating the market you have no special ability to capture the profits yourself you make money by buying low and selling high but if you want to push the price up you have to keep buying even though the price is getting high so you are buying high this gives everyone including you the opportunity to sell high and make money but you will have no special ability to capture that others will see the price going up and will start selling within a tiny fraction of a second you will have to keep buying all the shares they keep selling at the artificially inflated price so as you keep trying to buy more and more to push the price up enough to make money everyone else is selling their shares to you you have to buy more and more shares at an inflated price as everyone else is selling while you are still buying when you switch to selling the price will drop instantly since there 's nobody to buy from you at the inflated price the opportunity you created has already been taken by the very people you were trading with billions have been lost by people who thought this strategy would work

when dividend is announced the stock and option price may react to that news but the actual payout of the dividend on the ex dividend date is what you probably are referring to the dividend payout affects the stock price on the ex dividend date as the stock price will drop by the amount of paid out dividend not taking into account other factors this in turn drives the prices of all options   the amount of change in the option price for this event is not only dependent the dividend payout but also on how far these are in our out of the money and what there time to expiration is the price of a call option that is far out of the money would react less than the price of a put that would be far in the money therefore i would argue that these two will not necessarily offset each other

listed simultaneously in new york london and maybe even some asian markets is this correct if the exchanges are not connected then in primary market the shares are listed on other exchanges the depository receipts are listed i.e. the company will keep say 100,000 shares with the primary stock exchange depository based on this it would create new instruments depository receipts they can be 1:1 or whatever ratio hypothetically if i want to buy all of the company 's stock even if it is on one exchange buying all stocks would trigger various regulatory aspects of companies act or stock exchange rules this is not simple or easy like clicking some buttons and buying everything that is let 's say that in new york the company has listed 1000 shares and in london only 10 shares each worth 10 usd market capitalization is sum of all outstanding shares into value

edit it has been pointed out this is a false quote and that lincoln actually said this   as early as lincoln had written to secure to each the whole product of his labour or as nearly as possible is a most worthy object of any good government which was remarkable for a lawyer of that time speaking in new england in 1860 he praised the right to strike as then being exercised by the of his clear assertion of the labor theory of value in the message labor is prior to and superior to capital and his answers to the addresses of abroad and at home gave a color of marxism to his thinking he was surely the best friend labor ever had in the white house source

using cash to purchase a home allows you access to certain deals that mortgage buyers can not take advantage of   these are typically distressed properties and need to be moved off the books quickly   think of things like foreclosures and auctions this does not mean that it gives you an advantage with every house on the market   while you may be able to close quickly with cash some buyers may choose to wait for the presumably higher offers of mortgage buyers    there are complications to purchasing in cash then mortgaging to replace that cash   namely how was that cash invested   if one were in mutual funds or stocks with the money one will have to pay capital gains tax on any profit   if those investments increase in value during the time the money is tied up what do you do then   do you buy at the higher value or hold it back and dollar cost average it in

no share are equity in companies that usually have revenue streams and/or potential for creating them that revenue can be used to pay out dividends to the shareholders or to grow the company and increase its value most companies get their revenue from their customers and customers rarely give their money to a company without getting some good or service in exchange

for the lazy wikipedia says the term microcap stock also micro cap refers to the stock of public companies in the united states which have a market capitalization of roughly $ 300 million or less the shares of companies with a market capitalization of less than $ 50 million are typically referred to as nano cap stocks   many micro cap and nano cap stocks are traded over the counter with their prices quoted on the or the pink sheets a few of the larger more established are listed on the nasdaq capital market or american stock exchange amex   micro cap and especially nano cap stocks are notorious for their volatility a high percentage of these companies fail to execute their business plans and go out of business fraud and market manipulation are not uncommon and the transactions costs in trading can be quite high pricing is more likely to be inefficient since fewer institutional investors and analysts operate in this space due to the relatively small dollar amounts involved and the lack of liquidity

if you participate in an ipo you specify how many shares you 're willing to buy and the maximum price you 're willing to pay all the investors who are actually sold the shares get them at the same price and the entity managing the ipo will generally try to sell the shares for the highest price they can get whether or not you actually get the shares is a function of how many your broker gets and how your broker distributes them which can be completely arbitrary if your broker feels like it the price that the market is willing to pay afterward is usually a little higher to a certain extent this is by design a good deal for the shares is an incentive for the big million billion dollar financiers who will take on a good bit of risk buying very large positions in the company which they ca n't flip at the higher price because they 'd flood the market with their shares and send the price down   if the stock 100 and sticks around that level though the underwriting bank is n't doing its job very well investors were willing to give the company a lot more money it 's not stealing but it 's definitely giving the original owners of the company a raw deal just to be clear it 's the existing company 's owners who suffer not any third party of course linkedin was estimated to ipo at $ 30 before they it to $ 45 and plenty of people were skeptical about it pricing so high even then so it 's not like they did n't try and there 's a variety of analysis out there about why it soared so much on the first day fewer shares offered wild speculative bubbles no one could get a hold of it to short sell et cetera they probably could have for more but it 's unlikely there was say $ financing available just because one sucker will pay the price does n't mean you can move all million ipo shares for it

as to where the interest comes from the same place it comes from in other kinds of savings accounts the bank takes the money you deposit and invests it elsewhere traditionally by lending it out to others hence the concept of a savings and loan bank they make a profit as long as the interest they give for borrowing from you plus the cost of administering the savings accounts and loans is less than the interest they charge for lending to others no they do n't have to pay you interest but if they did n't you 'd be likely to deposit your funds at another bank which did their ideal goal is to pay as little as possible without losing depositors while charging as much as possible without losing borrowers yeah i know typo corrected why do they get higher interest rate than they pay you mostly because your deposits and interest are essentially guaranteed whereas the folks they 're lending to may be late paying or default on those loans as with any kind of investment higher return requires more work and/or higher risk plus larger reserves so you can afford to ride out any losses that do occur

it seems like a more commonly recurring issue on reddit that people are referencing logical fallacies without really understanding them   for reference ad hominem attacks are personal attacks they are person specific you can not make an ad hominem attack against a group of people such as the poor   straw man attacks are when an argument is changed to something that it is not and then beaten down it skews the topic at hand to something it is not   when i make an assumption clearly state it and then ask a question based on it with the words if yes it is not a straw man by any definition i was attempting to expand the argument to see how you view the rich vs. poor because the vast majority of arguments in favor of helping the poor come with the caveat that the rich should pay that price a higher minimum wage is an example of that those greedy business owners need to pay it am i right   i would suggest that you do not refer to these logical fallacies until you fully understand them   me as some guy that just does n't understand how the real world works   this is basically the problem with your source your arguments and your personal position you mention that you worked through high school and college you did n't mention managing people but even if you did i would be surprised if you managed long term minimum wage the kind of people who never rise above it the majority of the workers around you probably were doing much what you did using the job as a stepping stone   your source mentions most people are willing to work yet states that 46 are child care workers and 48 are home care workers do you know why the government will pay relatives who get a simple home health care provider license to care for relatives who are on medicare thus their grandma requires care and their daughter or grandchildren provide said care for a fee paid by the government the us government is literally paying people to take care of their family it is relatively the same with child care it 's disgusting   that article is making the argument that they want to work i do n't think taking a part time job caring for your family denotes a will to work i build low income housing i actually deal with the tenants who do this kind of work on a personal level you could not convince me that a 26 year old with two kids from two different fathers who on occasion provides care to their family members has a will to work i see their daily lives how does the government even check to see if the care is being provided is grandma going to lie nope   i can assume that you do n't manage minimum wage employees because it is nearly impossible good labor refuses to work at that price the market is much higher depending on the job it is usually double or triple the cleaning guy at my apartment building makes $ 12 an hour i 've paid minimum wage the only people i pay that are day laborers most of which have serious problems in their lives and even then it usually is more hell i 've seen a guy from the neighborhood pay as low as $ 25 a day to people looking for a fix   you are constantly arguing that i look down on these people it 's not entirely wrong but it 's not about the wage i am very friendly with the staff at the local mcdonalds in one of the of houston the manager is a really nice guy i asked him why certain positions kept turning over he complained that it was hard to find people and he kept having employees no show this is minimum wage and they ca n't even show up do you really believe that people want to work when simple positions that require no skill can not be filled   you make it seem as though i am assuming the worst it 's quite the opposite i am incredibly optimistic and giving but with many people in the us it does n't matter you just do n't see it on the day to day you read a study that is incredibly biased and take it to the grave there are many many people in the us who do not want to work they rely on government subsidies and refuse to improve their own lives it will always happen it 's just a matter of what the government will try to do about it next   i forgot to mention houston has built more homes in the last 5 years every year houston almost built more single family homes than the entire state of california in the year 2014 thus my painter is leaving one of the largest construction markets in the us to go to seattle because he ca n't find people to paint a building

it 's a good point to make with bot presence for the most part twitter is made of people even if there are a lot of false or bot accounts that being said i do n't find it as strong a marketing channel because of the nature of twitter at its core    if you follow 1000 people you 're likely to have nearly 10,000 tweets going through your feed it 's hard to really fight for attention but you can still get decent response and views when done right    as for instagram   i think in the long term just as any other social network the lifespan of it depends on the content as long as people are having new experiences and taking photos of them there will always be more content    that being said there are tons of accounts that pretty much post the same content it things like the explore feature because they 're using less than kosher tactics to get likes    ultimately i think policing of instagram as they have been is the best strategy for keeping it going    even though i 'm a marketer i 'm also a millennial with pretty typical values blatant advertising is annoying and intrusive when it comes to user experience and many young people today feel that way    by policing things like auto engaging false locations you used to be able to just type locations like follow me and being very keen on following through with reports of spam accounts is a good way to keep younger people on it    unless you 're paying for ads marketing on instagram typically consists of native content that looks good on feeds and needs engagement to rise up this is a good way to curb marketing while still maintaining a good user experience    as a side note part of why i use snapchat less is how they shove ads down your throat which gets old pretty fast ads on snapchat pretty much ruined the platform for me personally aside from using it for communication    as long as instagram maintains this balance based around the user and not the advertisers i think it will be going for quite some time

make sure you are paid on volume not people   almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others   that 's not bad it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs   that 's what the commissions are for   the largest cost of distributing a product outside of mlm is advertising and marketing   if i remember correctly this adds up to about 66 of the cost of the product   if that 's true an mlm has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive but when all is said and done you should be paid on volume just like a sales manager position in a company   a sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff but once they are out producing the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff   if an mlm is setup the same way then this is good   if they are setup to pay on recruiting people then run away as quickly as you can the biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it   it 's whether or not the people you recruit can do it i have been involved with an mlm of sorts for 10 years   it pays a nice continual flow of income   i worked it hard for about 6 years and have ever since   the problem was attrition   it was greater than i ever imagined   it became very   i never have and never will be a high pressure person   i would show them the business and if they were interested great if not great   the problem was that people became interested but did n't have the skills to be successful   i should never have let them join the business   so they leave the business and say that mlm is bad   no it just was n't right for them or they were n't right for it regardless of what business you join make sure that you believe that everyone you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing   if they do great otherwise do n't even show it to them

to add to 's answer you should automate all your loans except for the one with the highest interest rate   leave that one manual and pay the most you can afford each month to pay it off as quickly as possible   once you finish that loan move to the next highest interest rate   ultimately this wo n't be quite as convenient as just having 1 loan   the differences are you need to set up all the automatic payments   this is probably comparable to in complexity of consolidating your loans each time you finish one loan you need to turn off an automatic payment and start doing the next loan manually if you organize yourself well initially you 'll know exactly what order to do the loans in so this should n't take too long however unless your consolidated loan has the same interest rate of your cheapest current loan you will likely save money over all by using this method

the problem is that every option comes with risk as you note if you put money in stocks you could lose and many stocks are overpriced   if you put money in bonds you could lose many bonds are overpriced   if you buy precious metals they could fall further currently   if you hold cash central banks might try to ban cash we 'll hear the typical this will never happen from financial advisers and they 'll be wrong   cryptocurrencies are an option but boy do they fluctuate so there 's risk here too those are options and all come with risks and here 's my preferred approach to handling negative interest rates

not all call options that have value at expiration exercise by purchasing the security or attempting to with funds in your account    on etns they often always settle in cash   as an example of an option i 'm currently looking at it settles in cash please confirm by reading the documentation on this set of options at but it is an example of this   there 's nothing it can settle into as you ca n't purchase the index only options on it   you may quickly look wikipedia at the difference between american style options and european style options for more understanding here interestingly i just spoke to my broker about this subject for a trade execution   before i go into that let me also quickly refer to joe 's answer   what you buy you can sell   that 's one of the jobs of a market maker to provide liquidity in a market   so when you buy a stock you can sell it   when you buy an option you can sell it   that 's at any time before expiration although how close you do it before the closing bell on expiration friday saturday is your discretion   when a market maker lists an option price they list a bid and an ask   if you are willing to sell at the bid price they need to purchase it generally speaking   that 's why they put a spread between the bid and ask price but that 's another topic not related to your question just note the point of them buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price that 's what they 're saying they 'll do now one major difference with options vs. stocks is that options are contracts so therefore we can note just as easily that you can sell the option on something particularly if you own either the underlying or an option deeper in the money   if you own the underlying instrument stock and you sell a call option on it this is a strategy typically referred to as a covered call considered a risk reduction strategy   you forfeit potential gains on the upside for money you receive in selling the option the point of this discussion is is simply what one buys one can sell   what one sells one can buy that 's how a market is supposed to work   and also not to think that making money in options is buying first then selling   it may be selling and either buying back or ideally that option expiring worthless now a final example   let 's say you buy a deep in the money call on a stock trading at $ 150 and you own the $ 100 calls   at expiration these have a value of $ 50   but let 's say you do n't have any money in your account to take ownership of the underlying security you have to come up with the additional $ 100 per share you are missing   in that case need to call   your broker and see how they handle it and it will depend on the type of account you have e.g. margin or not ira etc   generally speaking though the margin department makes these decisions and they look through folks that have options on things that have value and are expiring and whether they have the funds in their account to absorb the security they are going to need to own   exchange wise options that have value at expiration are exercised   but what if the person who has the option does n't have the funds to own the whole stock well ideally on monday they 'll buy all the shares with the options you have at the current price and immediately liquidate the amount you ca n't afford to own but they do n't have to   i 'm mentioning this detail so that it helps you see what 's going or needs to go on with exchanges and brokerages and individuals so you have a broader picture

with an appropriate selection within a 401 k and if operating expenses are low you get tax deferred savings and possibly a lower tax bracket for now   the returns vary of course with market fluctuations but for almost 3 years it has been double digit growth on average   some health care sector funds were up over 40 last year   ymmv   with stocks and mutual funds that hold them you also are in a sense betting that people want their corporations to grow and succeed   others do most of the work    real estate should be part of your savings strategy but understand that they are not kidding when they talk about location   it can lose value tenants tend to have some problem part of the year such that some owners find it necessary to have a paid property manager to buffer from their complaints   other owners get hauled into court and sued as slum lords for allegedly not doing basics tenants can ruin your property as well   there is maintenance repair replacement insurance against injury not just property damage and property taxes   while some of it might be deductible not all is    you may want to consider that there are considerable ongoing costs and significant risks in time and money with real estate as an investment at a level that you do not incur with a 401k.   if you buy mainly to flip then be aware that if there are unforeseen issues with the house or the market as it can you could be stuck with an immovable drain on your income   if you lose your job could you make payments   many many people sadly lost their homes or investment properties that way in 2008 2010

quick pay off the student loans you have 140 k in savings with a combined salary of you are looking to make money with the 140 k so just pay off the loans it will turn your monthly loan payments in to a stream of money that can be used to save money for the next house   assume the rest of the 700 k needed for a 1.5 million dollar house has to come from savings and the profit from selling the first house if the house sells for loan balance + 300 k you still need 400 k in savings   turning 140 k into 400 k in 5 years will funneling a large amount of your income into savings or excellent returns of course there is no way to predict return or what will happen to the market if you do n't sell the first home you can rent the house you either hope that the rental you charge allows you a positive cash flow or you hope that the house appreciates in value so you hold on to it even if the rental income is a little below break even of course some keep the house because they ca n't sell it in your case the equity might be more important for you to purchase the next house

look at a broader diversification something like for physical gold i 'd look at a mix of gold coins and bullion study the pricing model for coins you 'll probably find that the spreads on small coins make them too expensive there are a few levels of risk with storing in a vault the practical risk is that your government will close banks in the event of a panic and your money will be inaccessible you need to balance that risk with the risk to your personal security that comes with having lots of gold or cash in your home my recommendation is to avoid wasting time on the mad max scenarios if the world economy collapses into utter ruin we 're all screwed a few gold coins wo n't do much for you

1 for fha loans pmi is required for where there is not at least 20 equity   bank financed non fha loans may have other standards if you are getting an fha loan if possible put down 20   so that you do not have to pay pmi   that said your pmi costs should be reduced by the size of your down payment since the pmi covers the difference between your equity value based on the appraisal at time of purchase and 20 equity value of the home so if you buy a home for 100 appraisal price 20 equity would be 85k   so if you put 10 down you would be paying pmi until you accrue an addition in equity   and you will be paying pmi on that for about 12 on 30 year mortgage or until you home appraised at higher value than purchase price where you would have 20 equity   there are ways to get out of pmi early but few banks are willing to help you through the hoops unless you pay more closing costs 2 different banks offer better rates or other benefits for paying points   we paid $ 300 for a 1.5 reduction in our interest rate less than 1 but it was called a point we were offered a few other points .25 for 2500 and an one time on demand interest rate adjustment for but declined but they may make more sense on a home than our more modest one   you can talk to a banker about this now get helps with getting offers accepted sometimes and find out more details about the mortgage they will offer you   this meeting should be would say will but some bank would charge just to prove me wrong and help answer your questions more than anyone here can    3 the costs will come out of your down payment   so if you put down down your costs will come out of that   so you will probably end up with being applied towards your purchase price with the rest going for costs   you can tell the banker you want to put 10 towards the price and the banker will give you a down payment probably around 50k to cover costs etc   my figures are hopefully intentionally high better to find out that it will cost less than my than get your hopes up just to find out the costs are higher than expected

to quote adam smith everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it in this case that means the value of a stock is equal to the price that someone will pay for it if you buy shares in a company the number of people who want shares in that company has just gone up by 1 if you buy shares in companies profiting from the dapl you are increasing demand for those shares you are actually making those shares more valuable not less if you bought all those shares then you could simply shut the pipeline down but that means you 'd be spending billions of dollars to do so and that money would go to the people who own the company now the concept of shareholder activism that you refer to is actually more that an individual who owns a substantial number of shares usually in the 10 ballpark will become on the direction of the company and attempt to elect board members who will take action to suit their liking this is done to increase the profits of the company so that the shareholder can make more money off of their investment it is very expensive and not generally done for reasons of ethics unless those ethics align with a view to long term profit in this case you 'd need at least $ to buy enough of a stake in the dapl to make a difference what you may instead want to consider is ethical investing this refers to the concept that you should only put your investments in companies which act ethically for example you could buy shares in a solar company if you felt that was an ethical industry in this way you drive up demand for those types of companies and reward the business owners who act in that fashion

you missed the catch there is always a catch and in this case it is not well publicized    first some background congress both parties in 98 passed graham leach bliley it allowed commercial banks to invest securitize and insure securities it also had privacy provisions which prevented a of a mortgage from providing any personal information about the mortgage that means that as chase wrote these mortgage backed securities they were forbidden by law from telling the potential purchasers the addresses of the houses or ss 's of the purchasers    of course chase did not choose to insure these mbs 's themselves instead they chose a third party like aig because aig could not know personal information about the mortgages and was thus blinded to risk aig chose a middle of the road risk rating something like 2 risk of default    chase fraudulently represented the quality of the mortgages to the people writing the credit default swaps to insure them and to the potential buyers chase knew the mortgages were crap    fraud is fraud and is illegal in security sales even after graham leach bliley however to be clear in this case there does not need to be any faking of paperwork the loans can be passed along blindly with insurance as they were if it could be documented that chase misrepresented the quality of these aaa mbs 's they would be on the hook but the catch is that graham leach bliley offered them a cop out   aig were the real dummies in all this who writes insurance without having a good idea of the risk

considering i 'm in a nearly identical situation i 'll speak to my personal strategy and maybe there 's some value for you as well    you have in loans which you say you could pay off today   so what i read is that you 're sitting there with a $ 22k investment and want to know which investment to make pay down debt invest in yourself start up or some variation between those options   any investor worth his salt will ask a couple of questions what is my risk and what is my gain paying off your student loans offers no financial risk at the cost of opportunity risk and gains you returns of 3.4 6.8 3.4 4.5 and 6.8   those percentage gains are guaranteed and the opportunity risk is unknown investing in a startup is inherently risky with the potential for big payoffs but with this investment you are accepting a lot of risk for potentially some gain it could be the next apple it could also fail   so with your situation like mine i 'd say it 's best to accept the easy investment for now and fully vet out your tech start up idea in the meantime

yea right this is some communist propaganda if i have ever seen it   no rational person would ever want someone else to be making decisions as personal as health care for them get out of here with these ignorant socialist lies   no questions asked people want health care decisions to be made between them the patient and the doctor it is a fact in all practical honesty no one wants those types of decisions made by some pampered disconnected bureaucrat miles away anyone who argues otherwise is not being honest with themselves   the plain reality of health care in america is that it is a protected and dark market where no one actually gets to see the cost of services all we need legislatures to do is make insurers and health service providers publish price sheets and cost lists to the general public and we all will get to watch costs for everyone across the socioeconomic landscape plummet to unprecedented lows    fuck the republicans for letting the insurance companies continue to write these disasters of legislation that they call a repeal bill equally fuck the democrats for letting the insurance companies give us the complete failure by design that is the aca both of these shit wings embedded with bureaucratic incompetence need to just give us a fucking price listing for services and medications and get the fuck out of our way

it 's quite common for vat registered businesses to quote ex vat prices for supply to other businesses   however you 're right that when you make an order you will be invoiced and ultimately have to pay the vat inclusive price assuming your supplier is vat registered   if you 're not clear on this then you should check since it obviously makes quite a difference since your business is not vat registered you can not charge vat to your customers

if you 're planning to walk away from the house do n't invest any more money in it just be aware of the consequences it may be worth considering a short sale if both the lenders will agree to erase the debt if you 're going to keep the house then the fact that you 're underwater now is irrelevant and you should do your best to reduce the burden by paying off the higher rate loan but i personally think that accumulating enough cash to make you comfortable in case of a job loss for several months is a higher priority

while there are many very good and detailed answers to this question there is one key term from finance that none of them used and that is net present value while this is a term generally associate with debt and assets it also can be applied to the valuation models of a company 's share price the price of the share of a stock in a company represents the net present value of all future cash flows of that company divided by the total number of shares outstanding this is also the reason behind why the payment of dividends will cause the share price valuation to be less than its valuation if the company did not pay a dividend that those future outflows are factored into the npv calculation actually performed or implied and results in a current valuation that is less than it would have been had that capital been retained unlike with a fixed income security or even a variable rate debenture it is difficult to predict what the future cashflows of a company will be and how investors chose to value things as intangible as brand recognition market penetration and executive competence are often far more subjective that using 10 year libor rates to plug into a present value calculation for a floating rate bond of similar tenor opinion enters into the calculus and this is why you end up having a greater degree of price variance than you see in the fixed income markets you have had situations where companies such as amazon.com google and facebook had highly valued shares before they they ever posted a profit that is because the analysis of the value of their intellectual properties or business models would overtime provide a future value that was equivalent to their stock price at that time

both us gaap and are accrual basis frameworks 99.9 of businesses report under those frameworks or their local but still accrual based usually it 's public sector entities which are cash basis in my experience    anyway accrual basis has more to do with revenue recognition not taxation so that 's not really relevant here the value date of an invoice ie in which moment it becomes taxable depends on tax legislation which sets the rules to determine the so called date of taxable event not so much on accounting principles    in many cases taxable rules are intertwined with cash collection payment however to prevent creative accounting for tax evasion purposes for example provisions for various uncertain future events might be required by accounting rules but the corresponding expenses are generally not deductible for tax purposes so you wo n't be able to deduct them until the event actually occurs and you pay

i have been careful here to cover both shares in companies and in etfs exchange traded funds some information such as around corporate actions and is only applicable for company shares and not etfs the shares that you own are registered to you through the broker that you bought them via but are verified by independent fund administrators and brokerage reconciliation processes this means that there is independent verification that the broker has those shares and that they are ring as being yours the important point in this is that the broker can not sell them for their own profit or otherwise use them for their own benefit such as for collateral against margin etc   1 since the broker is keeping the shares for you they are still acting as an intermediary in order to prove that you own the shares and have the right to sell them you need to transfer the registration to another broker in order to sell them through that broker this typically but not always involves some kind of fee and the broker that you transfer to will need to be able to hold and deal in those shares not all brokers have access to all markets 2 you can sell your shares through a different broker to the one you bought them through but you will need to transfer your ownership to the other broker and that broker will need to have access to that market 3 you will normally depending on your broker get an email or other message on settlement which can be around two days after your purchase you should also be able to see them in your online account ui before settlement you usually do n't get any messages from the issuing entity for the instrument until agm time when you may get invited to the agm if you hold enough stock all other corporate actions should be handled for you by your broker it is rare that settlement does not go through on well regulated markets such as european hong kong japanese and us markets but this is more common on other markets in particular i have seen quite a lot of trades reversed on the market recently that is not to say that is unsafe its just that i happen to have seen a few trades reversed recently

ed saw your comment thank you the short answer a rough simplification seems to be that you pay pa income tax for income made in pa you pay il income tax for income made in il not income made across both states and you make sure the il amount paid is correct via a credit calculated on schedule cr it looks to me bear with me i am no expert on tax law in il pa or in general so consult a professional for good advice like you basically do this on schedule cr it looks like there may be some more pertinent info on publication 111 so that may potentially change the math a bit too this check is 2014 income during which you are a resident of il it 's income from a pa employer you must file a tax return in pa regardless since you earned income in pa did your former employer withhold pa income taxes on this particular paycheck i 'm not seeing where it says you should not include tax withheld could you please point that out perhaps they mean you should only include tax actually considered due on the pa tax return from il 's schedule cr instructions what is the purpose of schedule cr    schedule cr credit for tax paid to other states allows you to    take a credit for income taxes you paid to other states on income    you received while a resident of illinois you are allowed this credit    only if you filed a required tax return with the other state you must    use information from the tax return you filed with the other state to    complete schedule cr        what taxes qualify for the credit    taxes that qualify for the credit are income taxes you paid to another    state of the united states

if you have a great technical trading system that gets you winning trading 80 85 of the time in backtesting the question should be why are you not trading it to get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade this will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio for example if you are getting winning trades 80 of the time but your average win size is $ 100 and your 20 of losses average $ 500 then you will still be losing money you should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size this will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50 if your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it also if you put your trading system out there in the public domain together with your trading results you will actually find that quite opposite to what the consensus above is your results from your trading plan should actually improve further the more people acting on the outcome of a signal in the same direction the higher the probability that the movement in the desired direction will actually occur if you are looking to make money from your trading ideas no one will pay anything unless you have real results to back it up so if you are so confident about your system you should start trading it with real money of course you should start off small and build it up over time as your results as per your simulations

as nri pio non resident indian person of indian origin the overseas income and transfers in foreign currency are exempt from indian income taxes however the account in india has to be designated nre or fcnr there are three kind of accounts that an nri can maintain interest earned in nre and fcnr accounts is exempt from income taxes interest earned in nro accounts is not exempt from income taxes in fact banks would withhold about 30 of interest tds the exact tax liability would depend upon income generated in india and tds could be applied towards that liability when the tax returns are filed there are other implications also of designating the account as nre or nro nre accounts can only be funded via inward remittance of permitted foreign currency e.g. deposit usd gbp so proceeds like rental income pension etc that are generated in inr within india ca n't be deposited in this account the money deposited in nre account can grow tax free and can be converted back in any foreign currency freely on the other hand nro accounts can be funded through both inward remittance of permitted foreign currency or local income e.g. rental pension etc all the amount in this account is treated as indian originated inr even if remitted in foreign currency and thus is taxed as any other bank account the amount in this account is subject to the annual cap of of usd 1 million both nre and nro accounts are maintained in inr and can be saving and term deposit any remittance made to these accounts in any foreign currency is converted to inr at the time of deposit and is maintained in inr fcnr account are held in foreign currency and can only be term deposit official definitions accounts for non resident indians nris and persons of indian origin

my motivation was to see what other people thought i know i have my own bias so i would rather see what other people thought    one of the points i took from was that money not being used is less valuable than money being used in that sense a bank creates real value in an economy by allocating money to people who need it at a specific moment from those who do not need it at that moment   i see so many threads and comments on reddit about how banks are purely evil institutions that have no benefit to society so i guess i just hoped to see some insight from the finance community but also to see a discussion about banking from people with opposing opinions   thanks

1 yes both of your scenarios would lead to earning $ 10 on the transaction at the strike date if you purchased both of them call it scenario 3 you would make $ 20 2 as to why this transaction may not be possible consider the following the call and put pricing you describe may not be available what you have actually created is called arbitrage 2 identical assets can be bought and sold at different prices leading to a zero risk gain for the investor in the real marketplace if an option to buy asset x in january cost $ 90 would an option to sell asset x in january provide $ 110   without adding additional complexity about the features of asset x or the features of the options buying a call option is the same as selling a put option well when selling a put option you do n't have the ability to choose whether the option is exercised meaning buying options has value that selling options does not but ignore that for a moment that means that you have arranged a marketplace where you would buy a call option for only $ 90 but the seller of that same option would somehow receive $ 110   for added clarity consider the following what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 200 then you could exercise your call option buying a share for $ 90 selling it for $ 200 making $ 110 profit you would not exercise your put option making your total profit $ 110 now consider what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 10 you would buy for $ 10 exercise your put option and sell for $ 110 making a profit of $ 100 you would not exercise your call option making your total profit $ 100 this highlights that if your initial assumptions existed you would earn money at least $ 20 and at most unlimited based on a skyrocketing price compared to your $ 90 put option regardless of the future price therefore such a scenario would not exist in the initial pricing of the options now perhaps there is an initial fee involved with the options where the buyer or seller pays extra money up front regardless of the future price that is a different scenario and gets into the actual nature of options where investors will arrange multiple simultaneous transactions in order to limit risk and retain reward within a certain band of future prices   as pointed out by r this fee would be very significant for a call option which had a price set below the current price typically options are sold out of the money initially which means that at the current share price at the time the option is purchased executing the option would lose you money if you purchase an in the money option the transaction cost initially would by higher than any apparent gain you might have by immediately executing the option for a more realistic options example assume that it costs $ 15 initially to buy either the call option or the put option in that case after buying both options as listed in your scenarios you would earn a profit if the share price exceeded $ 120 the $ 120 sale price less the $ 90 call option = $ 30 which is your total fee initially or dropped below $ 80 the $ 110 put price less the $ 80 purchase price = $ 30 this type of transaction implies that you expect the price to either swing up or swing down but not fall within the band between $ perhaps you might do this if there was an upcoming election or other known event which might be a failure or success and you think the market has not properly accounted for either scenario in advance i will leave further discussion on that topic arranging options of different prices to create specific bands of profitability loss to another answer or other questions which likely already exist on this site or in fact other resources because it gets more complicated after that point and is outside the root of your question

there seems to be a disconnect between brands and channels in which brands advertise while i see and agree the point of the article it treats all media channels as equal where there are clear differences between them and as an extension the level of confidence given to a brand as a result    the author does focuses on the millennials as a target group that is less receptive to advertising but neglects to take into account the sheer volume of advertising that is around us compared to ten or even twenty years ago the increase has been exponential today it ’s almost impossible to even go to even a family without having it sponsored by your local dentist real estate agent and pizza chain   the fact that millennial are performing more due diligence is not just a reflection on the group as a whole but speaks volumes of the sheer quantity of many low quality options of media and advertising we come across on a daily basis

be very careful with this   when we tried this with furniture they charged an administrative fee to setup the account   i believe it was about $ 75   so if you defer interest for one year on a $ 1000 purchase and pay a $ 75 administrative fee it 's 7.5 interest also they do n't always send you a bill when it 's due they just let you go over the date when you could have paid it without paying interest and then you owe interest from the date of purchase   these plans are slimy   be careful

keep in mind that you need to have a cash reserve   blindly applying all stray cash to debt reduction is a bad idea   your lenders do not care about your balance   all they care about is your next payment   it is therefore imperative that you have a cash reserve that can carry these payments for several months   having zero cash reserves puts you at high risk for such simple things as the payroll clerk at work missing the monthly deposit rare but it happens i 've also been in situations where a major client had a cash flow issue and delayed payment and our company had to borrow to meet payroll that month   fortunately we were in good standing with the bank and had low debt but it could have been catastrophic for any employees living paycheque to paycheque

why do people buy them when they would be cheap to make for themselves convenience while you could easily find some pictures and lay them out with a sentiment buy some card stock print in colour trim it and perhaps glue on some glitter or whatnot and then find an envelope that fits it it 's likely to take you an hour or more to do so and you 'll invest far more than $ 6 on your printer and various inventories i made cards for my we had construction paper glitter markers etc and there was no need for an envelope but most people will find it quicker and simpler to buy one fully assembled the cost of the online ones is weird i agree perhaps people are also not confident they can compose a good why do stores stock $ 6 cards that they buy for $ 3 retail markup is 50 100 and i 'm sure it 's closer to 100 for cards when a different supplier might provide them for $ 2 well even if such a supplier existed i 'm sure the store would be happy to sell for $ 6 still see people buy them so there would be no consumer impact a store that sells cards for $ 5 is n't going to siphon customers from elsewhere because most of us just do n't buy cards often enough for it to matter   why does nobody become that supplier who will sell them cheaper selling stuff is more expensive than making stuff and getting your product into retail stores is hard hard means time and time means money and all of that contributes more to the card price than the ink and paper do that said dollar stores sell cards for a dollar typically and people do buy them i find they have less colours and the artwork is perhaps you even get what you pay for when it comes to design layout printing etc

you are doing great but you might want to read a couple of books and do some studying on budgeting and personal finance education yourself now and you will avoid pain in the future i learned a lot from reading dave ramsey 's total money makeover and i have found some great advice from the simple budgeting guidelines on budget in these three categories with these percentages you may find that your essentials lower than 50 because you are sharing room and utilities you want to put as much into financial as you can for the first 1 2 years to reduce or eliminate your student loan debt many folks will recommend you save six months salary expenses for emergencies and unexpected situations but understand that you are in debt now and you have a unique opportunity to pay off your debt before your living expenses creep up as they so often do since you are a contractor put aside 2 months expenses twice what i would normally advise and then attack paying off your debts with passion since you have a mix of student loans focus on paying them off by picking one at a time paying the minimum against the others while you pay off the one you picked then proceed to the next dave ramsey advises a debt snowball paying the smallest one first psychological advantage early wins while others advise paying the highest interest off first since you have over $ available to pay down debt you could plan on reducing your student loan debt substantially in a year   but avoid accumulating other debt along the way save for larger purchases your bedroom purchase may have been premature but you needed some basics but check your contract since many 0 furniture loan deals retroactively charge interest if you do n't pay them off in full you might want to make regular payments and pay the debt off a month early avoid any gotcha 's you might want to open a retirement account many folks recommend a roth account for folks your age it is after tax but you do n't pay tax when you withdraw money roth is better when you have lots of deductions think mortgage kids but some retirement account would be great to get started open a credit union account if you can that will make getting a credit card or personal loan installment easier you want to build a credit file but you do n't want credit card debt seems contradictory so opening 2 credit cards over the next year will help your credit you want a good credit mix student loans revolving installment and mortgage wait on that one

this question can simply be answered with it depends but i am sure that is not the answer you want so here is all of the reasons why it depends the philosophy behind real time energy pricing is that   you pay for what it actually costs for the energy to be produced peak times costs the power company a lot of money to produce the power there are many reasons for this but the simplest reason is that at some point the company will have to build extra power plants in order to be able to provide for the peak demand while these plants will be widely during off peak times in the traditional flat rate charge per billing you had to be charged higher then it actually costs during the off peak hours in order for the power company to make sure they brought in enough money to cover the costs of the peak hours technology has now advanced enough that power company can charge you more directly of what it actually costs them potentially this could mean that you would pay more in electricity this can happen if you are a person who loves to use energy during peak hours do you like turning on all of your lights when you get home from work in the summer what about watching tv or what about cooking dinner or what about turning the ac down colder to overcome the heat produced by cooking dinner all of those things that you might be used to doing are actually costing the power company more money because they have to plan for those higher peak loads you can save yourself money if you are willing to shift your usage to other times of day such as cook later in the evening or decide to grill outside or wait to watch your tv show until later in the evening if you are someone who is stuck in your ways and does n't want to adjust the time of day that you do certain things doing real time pricing may end up costing you more some people could argue that it actually should cost you more why should someone who is saving the power company money have to pay extra for someone who is costing the power company more money all of this is viewed from the short term though you may save some money here or there or you may end up paying a little extra here or there but i truly believe that in the long run everything will equalize out such that you will be paying the same anyways or at least a small enough difference i would n't worry about it if you stick with the flat rate pricing they are already have to factor in you being a peak rate user when you might not actually be one   in short if you are willing to adjust your habits i will almost promise you that you will save money if you do n't want to change and especially like to use energy during summer you might want to just stay where you are at

the government bailed out the financial system because it was in its best interest to letting the system all crash on top of yourself is definitely not smart so we loan financial institutions money shore up any short term issues and we get most of the money back if not all of it if i 'm not mistaken all the bail out money was paid back   but beyond the point there may be merit in basic income ideas but this is definitely not the kind of rhetoric thinking analysis or insight that it needs

if you 're really a part time worker then there are some simple considerations the remote working environment choice of own hours and non guarantee of work availability point to your part time situation being more like a consultancy and that would normally double or triple the gross hourly rate but if they 're already offering or paying you a low hourly figure they are unlikely to give you consultant rates

getting a mortgage for the interest write off is like buying packs of baseball cards for the gum that said i 'd refer you to the correct order of investing as much of that question really overlaps with this this question boils down to priorities the best use of the funds there are those who suggest that a mortgage brings risk of course it does just not for the borrower the risk is borne by the lender risk comes from lack of liquidity say your girlfriend buys the house with cash and leaves little reserve she loses her job and it 's great that she has no mortgage but she does have every other cost life brings including a tax bill that can turn into a house getting foreclosed on the details that you did n't disclose are those needed to look at the rest of the priorities list a fully funded 401(k with appropriate balance and no other debt and a 1 year emergency fund i would n't argue against buying the house with cash no real savings and passing on the 401(k matched deposit i 'd think carefully about the longterm impact of the cash purchase

investing in the stock market early is a good thing   however it does have a learning curve and that curve can and eventually will cost you one basic rule in investing is that risk and reward are proportional   the greater the reward the higher the risk that you either a wo n't get the reward or b lose your money instead   given that do n't invest money you ca n't afford to lose you mentioned you 're on a student budget if you want to start with short but investments try finding a high interest savings account or cd   for example the bank i use has an offer where the first $ 500 in your account gets ~6 interest certainly not bad if you only put $ 500 in the account   unfortunately most banks are offering a pittance for savings rates or cds if you 're willing to take more risk you could certainly put money into the stock market   before you do i would recommend spending some time learning about how the stock market works it 's flows and and how stock valuations work   do n't buy a stock because you hear about it a lot understand why that stock is being valued as such   also consider buying index funds such as spy which is like a stock but tracks an entire index   that way if a specific company suddenly drops you wo n't be nearly as affected   on the flip side if only 1 company goes up but the market goes down you 'll miss out   but consider the odds of having picked that 1 company

the share price on its own has little relevance without looking at variations in your case if the stock went from 2.80 to you should care only about the 88 drop in value not what it means in pre split dollar values you are correct that you can un split to give you an idea of what would have been the dollar value but that should not give you any more information than the variation of 88 would as for your title question you should read the chart as if no split occurred as for most intents and purposes it should not affect stock price other than the obvious split

it is important to distinguish between cause and effect as well as the supply saving versus demand borrowing side of money to understand the relationship between interest rates bond yields and inflation what is mean by interest rates is usually based on the officially published rates determined by the central bank and is referenced to the overnight lending rate for meeting reserve requirements   in practice what the means is for example in the united states the federal reserve will have periodic meetings to determine whether to leave this rate alone or to raise or lower the rate   the new rate is generally determined by their assessment of current and forecast national and global economic conditions and factors in the votes of the various regional federal reserve presidents   if the fed economic weakness they will tend to lower and keep rates lower while when the economy seems to be overheated the tendency will be to raise rates bond yields are also based on the expectation of future economic conditions but as determined by market participants   at times the market will actually lead the fed in bidding bond prices up or down while at other times it will react after the fed does   however ignoring the varying time lag the two generally will track each other because they are really the same thing   the only difference is the participants which are collectively determining what the rates yields are the inverse relationship between interest rates and inflation is the main reason for fluctuating rates in the first place   the fed will tend to raise rates to try to slow inflation and lower rates when it feels inflation is too low and economic growth should be stimulated   likewise when the economy is doing poorly there is both little inflationary pressure driving interest rates down both in terms of what savers can accept to keep ahead of inflation and at and depressed levels of borrowing reduced demand for money driving down rates to try to balance supply and demand and the opposite is true when the economy is booming bond yields are thus positively correlated to inflation because during periods of high inflation savers wo n't want to invest in bonds that do n't provide them with an acceptable inflation adjusted yield   but high interest rates tend to have the effect or in inflation because it gets more costly for borrowers and thus puts a on new economic activity so to summarize

interesting thing is not all of this analysis is typically done by the person you are speaking with re your mortgage   likely there is an economic team at some institution or another as many many loans are sold distributed in some fashion finance team and all of them are looking at various rates etc   typically what is offered is matching an offsetting liability somewhere else   so there may be cases where the spread someone is looking to pick up might be tighter or looser within institutions or types of institutions vs others even though the overall market is at one place   e.g. banks vs. insurance companies     so you may have negotiating room at a certain term but not another or the reverse at another firm   one firm might have lots of 10 year money while another might be limited so will be picky in what they choose   either more conservative loan terms ltv or a higher spread for example   so many things go into the ultimate rate someone can get but in theory the blog did a decent job

i have a loan that was picked up by bofa too   they required escrow but there was a problem with one of their checks to my insurance company where it evidently got lost in the mail   my insurance company contacted me and i called bofa who said it had been paid and may just be taking the insurance company a while to credit all the individual accounts they send a check for a lot of customers at a time   well since the check was n't received my insurance company contacted me again and i finally straightened it out with everyone   after that i complained that it would have been much easier for me if i paid it myself instead of being a middle man so they canceled my escrow refunded the money to me and now i pay the taxes and insurance myself   i prefer it that way as it simplifies things   i 've been a little surprised that bofa has been really nice whenever i contact them and always seems willing to make me happy   maybe it 's just because i pay on time and have paid a lot of extra on the principal so that there 's no danger that i 'll default

the price of a bond goes up when yields go down   for example you purchase a 5 bond today for $ 100 and the very next day the same bond is being offered with a rate of 10   will you be able to sell you bond for the $ 100 you paid   no you must compete with the 10 bonds being sold so you will have to sell your bond for less than the $ 100 you paid to compete with the new bonds being sold   thus bond prices are inversely related to bond yields the 20-year index you cited tracks bond prices and bond prices have gone up over the last 10 years which means bond yields have gone down   why have bond prices gone up   demand   more investors are moving their savings into bonds   why   i believe there a couple of reasons   one us treasuries are thought to be one of the safest investments   with the financial crisis and increased stock market volatility see chart below more investors are allocating more of their portfolios to safer investments   two a large portion of the us population is approaching retirement see chart below   these folks are not interested in watching their retirement portfolios potentially shrink in the stock market so they move into bonds

from chase faq it looks like this is a regular ach transfer ach transactions can be reversed under certain conditions i have n't been able to find some authoritative link on this so i suggest this budgeting blog instead allowed reasons you can have ach transactions reversed for one of three reasons under    the rules wrong money amount wrong account or    transactions for example if your mortgage bill is for $ but    your lender 's website messes up and you 're charged $ the    transaction is reversible it because it 's the wrong dollar amount if    the website charges you $ twice the second    transaction is reversible reversal procedures you might have to bring a mistake to the originator 's attention to get    it fixed only the originator the person or company taking or    sending money can ask for a reversal for example if you have a    transaction for a wrong dollar amount from your lender 's website the    originator is the lender an originator is supposed to send the    reversal within 24 hours of the error 's discovery and within five    banking days of the original transaction when a reversal is required    because of a wrong amount or wrong account the originator must send a    correcting entry with the right information bank 's responsibility a bank should honor an ach reversal even if it means debiting a    customer 's account again because of a correcting transaction however    the bank does n't have to debit your account if you closed it or the    new transaction would overdraw it your bank does have to tell you if    a correcting entry is going to take money out of your account but the    bank does n't need your permission to do it

imagine that a fund had a large exit load that declined over several years if you wanted to sell some or all of your investment in that fund you would face a large fee unless you held it a long time you would be hesitant to sell because waiting longer would save you money that is the exact opposite of a liquid investment   therefore the ideal level for a liquid fund is to have zero exit load
