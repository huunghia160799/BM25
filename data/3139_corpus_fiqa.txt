from also corp or is an intentionally erroneous spelling of the word bank but pronounced the same way it has been adopted by companies which are not banks but wish to appear as such and satisfy legal restrictions on the usage of the word bank for instance if the original company is known as bank of america then the new investment banking entity may be known as of america securities llc if the original company is known as bank of manhattan then its insurance business might be known as of manhattan insurance and its holding company might be called manhattan this practice originates from legal necessity under the laws of most states a corporation may only use the word bank in its name if it has obtained a banking charter under state or federal banking laws so of america is the subsidiary of boa that does n't have appropriate licenses to be called bank wonders of complex regulation

does n't make any sense it 's just an article for the author to feel like he 's a superior strategist to kohl 's leadership amp primarily rant about how crappy amazon treats its partners     however if we accept the examples as fully true none are relevant   kohl 's is n't at all making itself dependent on amazon they 're not giving up their control of their e commerce site or giving up any control for that matter   so please tell me how his history lessons apply     unclear of the strategic initiatives really   i do n't need an mba to realize ignoring aws is probably compensating kohl 's for the moment that there 's plenty   one it brings in more foot traffic to the store some of which may have never stepped into a kohl 's in favor of their usual department store that competes with kohls     two it has the potential to increase repeat visits from their existing customers who may need to return a package and hey kohl 's takes that too might as well take a glance while i 'm there     three it increases their product assortment in kohl 's stores without incurring all the operational logistic costs of adding new product lines   that 's called free money off the margins     these are the kinds of deals that should be lauded mutually beneficial partnerships between businesses that end up adding more value to the customer   amazon gets to increase the customer experience by starting to address one of the biggest pains with e commerce in general the burdensome process to return something you order online     it 's a great idea and i 'm sure they 'll partner with other big retailers as well   that does n't hurt kohl 's at worst as it expands the positive impact wo n't be as great because customers will have more options    no harm done     it 's also naive to think kohl 's is n't getting compensated whether it 's a marginal thing or some fixed contractual amount amazon pays to kohl 's or at the minimum covering all of the involved logistic costs kohl 's incurs to do this     ugh i just hate who want to pour gasoline on anything that irritates them from preconceived biases

that 's true   i think the reason the chains are blaming other factors is that they are thinking our food has n't changed much so that ca n't be the problem       however people have more options now   plenty of fast casual places make genuinely good food now so people do n't have to choose between a chain or a fast food place   and knowledge of cooking at home is increasing       so while they 're kind of right in saying it 's not our fault we have n't changed our customers have that 's a cop out they should say our customers and the competition have changed so we will too

investment strategies abound bonds can be part of useful passive investment strategy but more active investors may develop a good number of reasons why buying and selling bonds on the short term a few examples also note that there is no guarantee in bonds as you imply by it to a guaranteed stock dividend bond issuers can default causing bond investors to lose part of all of their original investment as such if one believes the bond issuer may suffer financial distress it would be ideal to sell off the investment

based on my understanding of your query well you need to understand atm and itm options the   delta and gamma factor specifically usually delta of atm is around 0.5 while itm option is above than that say 0.6 or 0.8 or 0.9 and deep itm is very close to 1 for every movement of 1 buck the itm will move say 1.6 atm 0.5 and otm 0.3 approx say a abc stock price is rs 300 so if you check option chart you try to see which one is closer suppose you find of 320 300 280 so   320 is itm 300 is atm and 280 is otm for call options so will the delta value e.g 0.55 0.35 so suppose if stock price rise by 7 i.e rs then will rise simultaneously say atm is it will start rising by 0.55 i.e. the moment the share price move from to your atm will turn to itm now the part if you buy otm and the share price rise by 15 your otm will now become itm and your profit will roll around 100 to 120 approx hope it answers your query

resign may be a bit far but as for backing up damore i disagree   you can what damore wrote how he cherry picked research and maybe his suggestions were n't the best but this quote quoted in the article is the best way to the backlash   gt i can not remember the last time so many outlets and observers so many aspects of a text everyone possessed   the backlash has truly been post factual and it 's fair to the leadership of a company whose culture has clearly become post factual and not just post factual in describing what damore wrote very often where he went out of his way to repeatedly write the opposite but also in flat out rejecting any research into nature in nature vs nurture that does n't say nature matters 0   many angry voices admit to not having read what they are ranting about he said x uh no he did n't i did n't read it but it 's horrible and he should be fired   we rightly and fear the faux news trump post factual bs politics but the left adopting it is only going to make things worse and avoiding that in corporate culture falls into the lap of corporate leadership so why exactly is playing along albeit much much less with this post factual interpretation

okay let 's try this a different way completely forget about what the bond is with here is how a bond works    you get paid interest for holding the bond 5 interest means a coupon of $ 50 assuming one coupon a year     at the end of the bond term maturity you get paid $ 1000      in your scenario you get paid the $ 50 as an interest payment and the $ 1000 final payment     if you only had the bond for one year your total payment will be $ 1050      try drawing a timeline to it a bit better

inflation is an attempt to measure how much less money is worth it is a weighted average of some bundle of goods and services price 's increase   money 's value is in what you can exchange it for so higher prices means money is worth less monthly inflation is quoted either as a year ending on that month or since the previous month   as the values differ by more than a factor of 10 you can usually tell which one is being referred to when they say inflation in august was 0.4 a record high or inflation in august was 3.6   you do need some context of the state of the economy and how surprised the people talking about the numbers are   sometimes they refer to inflation since the last month and then annualize it which adds to the confusion consumer inflation 's value depends on what the basket of goods is and what you define as the same good   is a computer this year the same as the last   if the computer is 10x faster do you ignore that or factor it in what basket do you use   the typical monthly consumables purchased by a middle class citizen   by a poor citizen   by a rich citizen   a mixture and if so which mixture more detailed inflation figures can focus on inflation facing each of the population by household income split durable goods from non durable goods from services split wage from non wage inflation ignore volatile things like food and energy etc inflation does n't directly cause prices to raise instead it is a measure of how much raise in prices happened   it can easily be a self as inflation expectations can lead to everyone automatically increasing the price they charge for everything wages goods etc inflation can be viewed as a measurement of the cost of holding cash   at 10 inflation per year holding a million dollars in cash for a year costs you 100,000 $ in buying power   at 1 inflation it costs   at 0.1 inflation inflation of 10 in one year followed by 10 the next adds up to 1.1 1.1 1 = 21 inflation over the two years   for low inflation numbers this acts a lot like adding the further from 0 you get the more the lower order terms make the result larger   1 inflation for two years adds up to 10 over two years 21 100 over two years 300 1000 over two years 12000 etc   and yes some places suffer 1000 inflation

for starters that site shows the first 5 levels on each side of the book which is actually quite a bit of information   when traders say the top of the book they mean just the first level   so you 're already getting 8 extra levels if you want all the details you must subscribe to the exchange 's data feeds this costs thousands of dollars per month or open an account with a broker who offers that information more important than depth however is update frequency   the bats site appears to update every 5 seconds which is nowhere near frequently enough to see what 's truly going on in the book   depending on your use case 2 levels on each side of the book updated every millisecond might be far more valuable than 20 levels on each side updated every second

imagine a married couple without a mortgage but live in a house fully paid for they pay state income taxes and property tax and make charitable deductions   that together total $ that is $ 1 below the standard deduction for 2015 therefore they do n't itemize   now they decide to get a mortgage $ 100,000 for 30 years at 4 that first year they pay about $ 4,000 in interest now it makes sense to itemize that $ 4,000 in interest plus their other deductions means that if they are in the 25 bracket they cut their tax bill by $ 1,000 these numbers will decrease each year   if they have a use for that pile of cash such as a new roof or a 100 sure investment that is guaranteed make more money for them then they are losing in interest it makes sense but spending $ 4,000 to save $ 1,000 does n't using the pile of cash to pay off the new mortgage means that the bank is collecting $ 4,000 a year so you can send $ 1,000 less to uncle sam

it comes down to individual priorities   some people prefer to spend their money on a luxury car or suv rather than on computer gear a bigger house having three extra kids eating in restaurants or whatever some people are quite happy to take out a loan to get more expensive products and service that loan over several years there is also status attached to some makes e.g. german    that comes with a status premium which some people are prepared to pay for or take out debt to get and some are not     compare say a base model audi or bmw with a similarly priced non luxury model from a japanese competitor    the japanese model will probably have more features leather large safety aids etc than the european at the same price point and it will be necessary to tick several options and pay extra for them which can amount to 30 40 extra cost to get the luxury car with a comparable set of features     for some people the luxury brand is worth the difference   for some it is not

i 'm not sure there 's a good reason to do a closing the books ceremony for personal finance accounting and you 're not only wanting to do that but have a fiscal year that 's different from the calendar year yikes my understanding is that usually this process is done for businesses to be able to account for what their retained earnings and such are for investors and tax purposes generally individuals would n't think of their finances in those terms it 's certainly not impossible though gnucash for example implements a closing books feature which is designed to create transactions for each income and expenses account into an end of year equity retained earnings account it does n't do any sort of closing out of assets or liabilities however and i 'm not sure how that would make any sense as you 'd transfer it from your asset to the end of year closing account and then transfer it back as an opening balance for the next year if you want to keep each year completely separate the page about closing books in the gnucash wiki mentions that one can create a separate gnucash file per year by exporting the account tree from your existing file then importing that tree and the balances into a new file i expect that it makes it much more challenging to run reports across multiple years of data though while your question does n't seem to be specific to gnucash i just mention it because it 's the accounting tool i 'm most familiar with i 'd expect that any accounting program would have similar functionality i would however like to point out this section from the gnucash manual note that closing the books in gnucash is unnecessary you do not need to zero out your income and expense accounts at the end of each financial period gnucash ’s built in reports automatically handle concepts like retained earnings between two different financial periods in fact closing the books reduces the usefulness of the standard reports because the reports do n’t currently understand closing transactions so from their point of view it simply looks like the net income or expense in each account for a given period was simply zero and that 's largely why i 'm just not sure what your goals are if you want to look at your transactions for a certain time to just focus on the range of years i 'm interested in for any given purpose as you say then just go ahead and run the report you care about with those years as the dates the idea of closing books comes from a time when you 'd want to take your pile of paper ledgers and go put them in storage once you did n't need to refer to them regularly computers now have no challenges storing every account from the beginning of time at all and you can filter out that data to focus on whatever you 're looking for easily if you do n't want to look at the old data just do n't include them in your reports i 'm pretty sure that 's the better way to keep the books manageable

assuming a person knows how to use and invest their money wisely would it still be a bad idea to entirely disregard a 401k plan yes a 401k like an ira is a qualified plan and as such enjoys certain legal protections   for a roth 401k the taxes are paid now and the interest accumulates tax free and withdrawals will be tax free doing it on your own means that your own savings will have interest taxed as you earn it   for a traditional 401k current savings are deducted from current earnings and the withdrawals will be taxed doing it on your own loses the deferral of tax at this time    generally 401ks and iras are highly resistant to judgements in civil lawsuits if you file for bankruptcy protection at any time in your working career the assets in these accounts are immune in most states from being used to pay off your creditors if you do it on your own that savings account will be emptied to pay off creditors in bankruptcy and also will be assets that can be taken from you in civil judgements for example you get in a car accident and they sue you you might never be sued nor file bankruptcy in your entire life but you are unnecessarily exposing yourself to risks anything might happen in the next 50 years what you will lose in such circumstances far outweighs any perceived benefits you could possibly earn by rolling your own if you are the sort of person who can max out your 401k and ira contributions each year and still have a significant sum to set aside for savings you should contact an investment advisor and attorney to see about protecting your assets

money market accounts insured in the same way as other deposits are strange hybrids of traditional bank deposits and bond mutual funds because of the high inflation of the 1970s banks were starved of deposits and could not produce loans at sufficient rates   for this reason they desired a way to fund loans and congress enacted the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act which permitted a new form of account that retained the functionality of a deposit account such as checking and now electronic transfers yet transferred the risk to the account thus most of the profit   this allowed banks to fund each others new loans through packaging them into asset backed securities to be held in these special accounts as an added protection they are not permitted to carry a market value less than what 's owed to depositors and are forcibly liquidated and paid in such event   this is a rare occurrence because of the nature of the assets held credit assets such as commercial paper mortgages and corporate bonds   this is the opposite case of deposits because so long as a bank can maintain payments on its liabilities and satisfy a few other regulatory requirements non regulation satisfying assets could theoretically carry a zero balance meaning that a bank could owe depositors more than what could be paid by liquidating all assets money market accounts will typically pay a higher rate because of their structure   while inflation is low and immediate term interest rates set by the central bank are also low the net figure will not appear high but the ratio will be fantastic usually something like 3x the one downside to money market accounts is that withdrawals are restricted by frequency   this is not such a problem as before since brokerages are now issuing debit cards tied to brokerage accounts and excess money can be swept into money market accounts bypassing the regulatory restriction in short money market accounts are currently a far better choice than traditional checking accounts but pay less than savings accounts

in short pun intended the shareholder lending the shares does not believe that the shares will fall even though the potential investor does the shareholder believes that the shares will rise because the two individuals believe that a different outcome will occur they are able to make a trade by using the available data in the market they have arrived at a particular conclusion of the fair price for the trade but each individual wants to be on the other side of it consider a simpler form of your question why would a shareholder agree to sell his her shares why do n't they just wait to sell when the price is higher after all that is why the buyer wants to purchase the shares on review i realize i 've only stated here why the original shareholder would n't simply sell and rebuy the share themselves because they have a different view of the market as to why they would actually allow the trade to occur and other answers point out that the shares being lent are compensated for by an initial fee on the transaction + the chance for interest during the period that the shares are owed for

i agree that this is a bad idea but i want to add in one more reason let 's pretend your family and you are ok with all the tax ramifications and legal issues this is still a horrid idea   you have to deal with the what ifs what if you get in an accident with your car and then a law suit comes around and they decide to seize your assets again the reason is n't important what is important is your ability to pay a critical thing is going to be based off accounts and money that are not yours   so you goof up on child support and they freeze your accounts guess what now your family members lose access to their money because on paper it 's your money keep in mind it does n't have to be an irresponsible action that causes the issue id theft for example often results in a temporary account freeze while things are sorted out so now your mom ca n't eat because your money is pending review   in this situation you might even turn to your mother or father or brother for help while your accounts are frozen for 2 3 months and everything is sorted out but now you ca n't because their money is tied up too   lastly lets assume the id theft issue that id thief now has access to a big pool of money they walk off with everyone 's nest eggs not just yours

you probably have a ugma account while the money in that account belongs to you as long as you 're a minor which is until the age of 18 in california you can not directly access it instead your or or any other trustee manages that account for you with your best interests in mind while you may want to spend that money or give it away to your boyfriend or whoever else it is very likely not in your best interest to do that that is why your dad refuses he has a legal responsibility which is called fiduciary duty to ensure the money is spent in a way that is best for you if the fiduciary just lets you spend the money away you could later when you 're no longer a minor sue that person for the breach of trust when you 're older and a bit more mature you 'll be able to make your own decisions and do whatever you want with that money but as long as your parents have the responsibility to act in your best interests it is likely that your boyfriend will stay in pennsylvania for a while

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

gt couple things i will admit i was wrong about the total graduates at each of those programs however numbers taper out the lower the program is down to about 250 300 a class also cut each of those numbers down to about 1/2 1/3 and you get the group that 's actually focused on finance many mbas do consulting marketing product development etc nowadays   agreed you also have to remember many of those mba 's are the ones that move on to get cfa charterholder as an emphasis on quantitative   gt also i 'm a bit offended by you saying i do n't understand the cfa could n't be more mistaken boss i 'm for l3 in june like you    then you should clearly understand where l2 and l3 diverge from the memorize and regurgitate that you labelled it as   gt the requirement is only 2 years in an investment decision role this also means a lot of back office risk guys qualify that 's a pretty fungible qualification you do n't have to be a pm to qualify i have a buddy who qualified having done 2 years in fund accounting not exactly sell side er    um it 's most certainly 4 candidate membership pages of qualified work exp   gt to become a regular member you must have completed four years 48 months of qualifying work experience in activities that consist to a majority extent of    gt at least 50 percent of your work experience must be   directly involved in the investment decision making process   engaged in responsibilities and/or producing a work product that informs or adds value to that process    we just had a middle office colleague pass his l3 and get denied his years as a qualifying role   cfai is moving towards a more strict criteria for qualified roles     gt i 'm also going to guess you 're a trader brokerage cap markets guy if you wanna throw titles around i 'm in a front office role at a bb too and worked at worked on buy side research at a value shop cfa is definitely more desired in sell side markets focused as opposed to ibd where an mba is more useful more strategy focused   not throwing titles around   simply informing you that my perspective unlike 90 of the people in this subreddit is from a real world environment   cfa 's are more desired and less common than mba 's in the capital markets roles and portfolio mgmt bb 's and the street based hf 's   large part of this is due to the associate programs that most ib 's employ for newly grad mba 's   this over the job market for front office with mba 's as opposed to bs w/ cfa 's   might i also add at this point you 're clearly diverging from the original discrepancy we had where i said mba 's are dime a dozen and cfa 's are far less common   gt the cfa is vital for up on quantitative skills an mba wo n't cover i 'll absolutely give you that but a lot of people fall into the trap of assuming a cfa is their ticket to bigger and better things if you 're working in back office risk management getting a cfa does n't immediately qualify you to do er which is a very common pitfall i see like an mba it teaches everyone how to do the same type of analysis too another reason the title means less and less   never argued that it was n't   just like any education it simply gives you the foundation of knowledge to be successful   it does n't teach you how to think   neither does a mba   it teaches you the nitty gritty details but you still have to hold the capacity for outside the box critical thinking as well   i 'd disagree in that it teaches you the same analysis as someone else   it may teach the same formulas but i find it as emphasizing teaching what the indicators mean rather than how to use them in your analysis   it leaves it up to you to use the calculations to form your own perspective   ps for the most part mba 's in er is becoming more and more uncommon   research roles especially in the bb are becoming more and more focused on people with hard science backgrounds ms econometrics comp sci phd in theo mathematics etc   gt last weekend i had a conversation with a friend of a friend about this very thing he 's sitting for l3 cfa works back office at a very notable hf and expects to be moved up without any indication that he will to research when he 's done i asked his opinions about things like the european situation fiscal cliff and a hard landing in china not only was he not familiar these concepts he did n't even know what hft was the cfa gives you the tools to analyze the impacts of pension liabilities on eps but it still takes a passion about the markets as well as creative analytical judgement to make it to er   i agree   just like an mba though it 's what you make of it   if you do n't invest your time in understanding and following the markets you can graduate with a mba or a cfa and you still wo n't be qualified   just a heads up er is not the holy grail of cfa candidates i do n't know what mislead you to that perception but er is actually a dying market and certainly not one that the front office people i know want to move towards   gt my only point is an mba and cfa are very similar in many ways    yep   both are certifications of certain skill sets   gt both tend to hold their noses way to high too    arrogance is a part of this industry   it 's a fueled do or die competitive market   if you ca n't stand it then bail out now   gt it 's about what you chose to get out of it and too often people care more about the title than the process which is why they are still stuck in mediocrity after completing the designations   which is true regardless the mba or cfa   people get both and are incompetent   the title is a tool to open opportunities and educate you in a specialized manner with the cfa being even more specialized than mba 's   once again you have fully from your original point of trying to say cfa are more common and less valuable than mba 's   the bottom line is there are 100,000 total in the world according to the cfai   fewer than half of which are located in the us   that is 10 20 years worth of mba target school grads and does n't take into consideration the number of mba 's that pursued cfa 's nor the number of cfa charter holders that have gone on into academia a much larger number of cfa 's move into academia than target school mba 's not to mention the total number of mba 's that have worked their way into roles over the years   i can guarantee there are more mba 's than that in this industry   the bb 's alone employ upwards of 1.1 million   to say that less than 5 of those employed at bb 's hold a mba is absurd even for back office standards

here 's the real reason okpay actually the banks they interface with wo n't accept us citizens    the foreign account tax compliance act congress passed the foreign account tax compliance act fatca in 2010 without much one reason the act was so quiet was its four year long ramp up fatca did not really take effect until 2014 never before had a single national government attempted and so far succeeded in forcing compliance standards on banks across the world fatca requires any non u.s. bank to report accounts held by american citizens worth over $ 50,000 or else be subject to 30 withholding penalties and possible exclusion from u.s. markets by more than 100,000 foreign entities had agreed to share financial information with the irs even russia and china agreed to fatca the only major global economy to fight the feds is canada however it was private citizens not the canadian government who filed suit to block fatca under the international governmental agreement clause making it illegal to turn over private bank account information read more the tax implications of opening a foreign bank account | investopedia   follow us investopedia on facebook

tl;dr   sears is failing because the ceo is running the company into the ground for personal profit   there have been many many articles written on the issue   the ceo is having the stores sell their property at a discount to one of his other companies then having the stores pay rent   except boutique stores actually pay more money than sears does   so whenever a store closes his other company can rent the space out for almost double   oh and he encouraged a corporate culture where the department heads use those screen hospitals use to keep each other from spying on their laptops during meetings   the way it works some departments actually contract out to a 3rd party rather than going through corporate since it 's cheaper   yes departments individually have an it budget and are required to have their own contract to use in house it   it 's so bad that many employees say they are explicitly barred from helping another department   so customers feel and end up because there 's no one to help them or to run the register   that 's the power of a bad ceo that the board refuses to fire

this is a great question considering that all of your expenses including maintenance etc are paid by a tenant your cash flow is $ 0 most people would stop and assume your investment is not performing and your only chance at making money is through appreciation your question eliminates appreciation so here are the returns you would get on your investment the math will probably surprise many that you are actually earning a return on your money    annual return = future per of periods   = $   as chris rea commented the that some would miss is that while income covers expenses exactly embedded in the expenses is actually a repayment of the loan principal and technically that 's not an expense so not all of the income is lost covering the expenses that repayment of principal portion of the rental income constitutes the return on the original capital invested

great question there are two ways to increase the amount of money you have it 's difficult to decrease your expenses past a certain point and your question is focused on the first aspect anyway but it 's worth noting that controlling spending is a significant part of accumulating wealth you need to make more money and there 's no trick to it ask for a raise sure that ca n't hurt but also think about what you need to do to get a higher paying job there 's a lot to think about does you current job have growth potential are you doing everything you can do to maximize that potential if you 're just it in and collecting your paycheck that 's not going to make you much more money but if you 're working hard learning new skills and have an opportunity to grow into more responsibilities and more money that 's a good start in my experience the biggest paycheck increases have come from looking for new opportunities and switching jobs btw i 'm not suggesting quitting your job you need to always have the new job locked up before quitting the old job the wealthiest people i know are self employed and they worked hard to build up their companies do you work in an industry where you can build your skills to a point where you can go out on your own does entrepreneurship interest you either way focus on your job skills and maximizing your income potential be your own advocate make sure your boss knows what a good job you 're doing if you need to start looking for other options take your time and start looking the often quoted line the harder i work the luckier i get is appropriate

it 's a tough question because there is society and individual to consider and the society 's effects on the individual   currently employers do n't have to provide insurance they do it to compete in the employee marketplace employers have an advantage over employees in that regard because they can procure insurance at a lower cost that employees can and they get tax breaks for doing so employers providing health insurance get a more stable relationship with their employees because employees always hold great value in having an employee who provides good benefits   the company i work for provides good benefits but suppose tomorrow they told me hey we 're not providing benefits anymore but we 'll bump your salary to what your benefits are worth plus enough to compensate for the tax break we get so now everything is equal to what it was before but i have to go out and find my own insurance which is a hassle but presumably because of the ppaca i can get a good value and carry this insurance with me wherever i go and never have to mess with changing every time i change jobs   but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up and they 've essentially pocketed the difference or passed it on to their customers now people have less money to buy health insurance and those near the bottom will now have to rely on the government to assist with providing health insurance   this is the way it works now with the minimum wage a recent report found that walmart employees rely on welfare to the tune of $ billion a fuels inequality epidemic taking advantage of our safety net while the company makes $ 15 billion in profit so 18 of walmart 's profits are an indirect subsidy from the us taxpayer which comes to about $ 48 per us citizen or about $ a year for the top 50 of wage earners   even so i think i 'd prefer to get my whole compensation package in one shot all else being equal that last part is important though i would need to get all the breaks my employer gets for providing myself with health insurance

how i understand it is supply demand affect price of stock    negatively positively respectively correct volume is the amount of buying selling activity in these stocks more    volume = more fluctuation right sort of   higher volume means higher liquidity   that is a stock that is traded more is easier to trade   it does n't necessarily mean more fluctuation and in the real world it often means that these are well understood stocks with a high amount of analyst coverage   this tends towards these stocks not being as volatile as smaller stocks with less liquidity company revenue and profit will help an investor predict company    growth that is one factor in a stock price   there are certain stocks that you would buy without them making a profit because their future revenue looks potentially explosive   however these stocks are very risky and are bubble prone if you 're starting out in the share market it 's generally a good idea to invest in index funds i am not a broker my advice should not be taken as financial advice   these funds aggregate risk by holding a lot of different companies   also statistics have shown that over time buying and holding index funds long term tends to dramatically outperform other investment strategies particularly for people with low amounts of capital

executive summary it sounds like the merchant just did an authorization then cancelled that authorization when you cancelled the order so there was never an actual charge so you 'll never see an actual refund and there 's no money to claim more detail from your second paragraph it sounds like they just did an authorization but never posted the transaction a credit card authorization is basically the merchant asking your credit card company does have enough credit to pay this amount and if so please reserve that amount for a bit the authorization will decrease the total credit you have available on the card but it 's not actually a charge so if your billing cycle ends it wo n't show up on your statement depending on which company issued your credit card you may be able to see the authorization online usually labelled something like pending transactions even if your credit card company does n't show pending transactions you 'll see a decrease in your available credit however you should n't see an increase in your balance the next step and the only way the original merchant gets paid is for the merchant to actually post a transaction to your card then it becomes a real charge that will show up on your next credit card statement and you 'll be expected to pay it unless you dispute the charge but that 's a different issue if the charge is for the same amount as the authorization the authorization will go away it 's now been converted to an actual charge if the amounts are different or the merchant never posts a transaction the authorization will be removed by your credit card company automatically after a certain amount of time so it sounds like you placed the order the merchant did an authorization to make sure you could pay for it and to reserve the money but then you cancelled the order before the merchant could post the transaction so you were never really charged for it the merchant then cancelled the authorization going by the start of your third paragraph so there was never an actual transaction posted you were never charged and you never really owed any money your available credit went down for a bit but now should be restored to what it was before you placed the order you 'll never see an actual refund reflected on your credit card statement because there was no actual transaction

the 5 to 6.5 loan rates are a bit high you 'll probably want to pay those off first and make it one of your priorities as soon as you have a 6-month savings fund this should probably take precedence over savings for retirement unless you 're giving up a 401(k match pay extra on the highest interest loan until it 's all paid off then switch to the next one down and accelerate the payoff as much as you can if you 're looking at a loan at 6 and a payoff date in 8 years or so 2020 am extra dollar paid now will save you not a bad return in general and an excellent return for something that 's zero risk the other loans at 2 3 are different an extra dollar paid now on a 2 loan will save you $ 0.17 over 8 years that 's a pretty mediocre return if you have a good stable job and good job prospects and a decent family support network and few commitments like children and mortgages and a low cost of living generally the things that help you have a high tolerance for risk then you should consider investing your money in the stock market instead of paying off these loans any earlier than you need to broad index funds and the like not individual stocks

assuming nothing here helps here are some thoughts first if principal financial knows the 401k was rolled over to an ira then it must have been a custodian to custodian transfer which means they need to know who the recipient custodian was so i 'd call them back and push a little harder next they could n't have just created an ira out of thin air and moved some money into it without some paperwork and signatures from you so you should have copies of that paperwork principal may also still have archived copies of that paperwork that they may be able to provide to you although they 'll probably charge for that service also there would have been tax reporting around the rollover for the year the rollover occurred in you would have received a 1099-r and 5498 the 1099-r would have to have been reported on your federal and possibly state income tax for that year it may be possible to obtain copies of old 1099-r 's from the irs maybe call them and ask in subsequent years you should have received at least a year end statement if you do n't have any of that and contacting principal and the irs do n't help then i 'm not sure there 's much that anyone can do to help you as far as i know there 's no universal clearinghouse for iras and there are a lot of ira custodians i would expect you to receive a year end statement from the custodian for 2015 sometime in early 2016 so maybe just wait for and watch for that and take this as an object lesson that you need to keep better track of your finances no one 's going to do it for you unless you pay them a bunch of money

i pretty much only use my checking what 's the downside checking accounts do n't pay as much interest as savings account oh but wait interest rates have been zero for nearly 10 years so there is very little benefit to keeping money in my savings account in fact i had two savings accounts and well fargo closed one of them because i had n't used it in years downsides of savings accounts you are limited to 5 transfers per month into or out of them no such limit with checking upsides of savings accounts well maybe you will be less likely to spend the money why do n't you just have your pay go into your checking and then just transfer extra money out of it rather than the reverse if you want to put money away so that you save it assuming you 're in the open a traditional ira max deposit of $ and it reduces your taxable income it 's not a bad idea to have a separate account that you do n't touch except for in an emergency but for me the direction of flow is from work to checking to savings

for it looks something like this   to make it a bit clearer let 's also plot the difference in net income for self employment and a single person company compared to employment   self employment is slightly worse between £ and about £ 10,500 because class 2 ni kicks in before the employed person starts paying any tax after that self employment is better because you pay 9 class 4 ni rather than 12 class 1 ni once higher rate tax kicks in the saving stops growing the single person company is most tax efficient at all points ignoring any accountancy costs it incurs strange things happen between £ 100k and about £ because the withdrawal of the personal allowance kicks in at a different point when receiving dividends we can also plot the percentage of income paid as tax for each case   the strange for self employment below £ 10k is caused by class 2 ni again employment and self employment both gradually tend towards paying 47 reaching for £ 2 m gross income the company tends towards reaching for £ 2 m gross income

competition or actually lack of competition mostly due to a demand curve that has minimal change due to price you would buy the equivalent cheaper option if it was available but the store has little interest in offering multiple competing options that would drive their same store revenue down and the competing stores grocery department drug card have similar overhead costs floor space lights personnel most carry the cards for incremental revenue and observe little advantage to lower price for a card customers seldom buy more cards due to a lower price thus they mark the price to what most customers are willing to pay you may choose to shop the various stores and find the one that has a slightly better pricing for cards and then stop at that store when you want to buy a card but many cards are sold as an incremental purchase as part of a larger shopping trip convenience as the customer combines trips reduce the time spent shopping albeit not reducing the money spent

have a bank account here you need to have a credit history that is wrong whoever informed you that you do n't need a credit history to open a bank account some banks allow you to open no frills accounts without a credit history i myself opened an account with barclays with my ni card job contract and probably my passport too and i from the eu also the bank that allowed me to open the account does n't allow me to wire transfer my money to another uk account and claims that ll the bank have the same policy for cash accounts is that true i mean is there an actual law that for some reason allow you to transfer your funds why did you read the t&cs chances are that other the account is with a different bank and it always is fishy atleast for banks because of heightened money laundering regulations for people opening accounts and starting to transfer money to accounts with other banks after you have banked with them for certain time you can ask them to upgrade you to a current account which allow these services secondly because it might be a no frills account and they are n't allowed to charge fees they might disallow transfers to other banks and banks generally do n't charge fees for no frills accounts so certain services are disallowed which cost them money i have had a cash account for 4 5 years with barclays and i used to transfer money to other banks but i probably never tried transferring money just after opening an account

this is basically what financial advisers have been saying for years that you should invest in higher risk securities when you are young and lower risk securities when you get older however despite the fact that this is taken as truth by so many financial professionals financial economists have been unable to formulate a coherent theory that supports it   by changing the preferences of their theoretical investors they can get solutions like putting all your investments in a super safe asset until you get to a minimum survival level for retirement and then investing aggressively and many other solutions   but for none of the typically assumed preferences does investing aggressively when young and becoming more conservative as you near retirement seem to be the solution   i 'm not saying there can be no such preferences but the difficulty in finding them makes me think maybe this idea is not actually correct couple of problems with your intuition that you should think about it 's not clear that things average out over time   if you lose a bunch of money in some asset there 's no reason to think that by holding that asset for a while you will make back what you lost prices are not cyclical   moreover does n't your intuition implicitly suggest that you should transition out of risky securities as you get older perhaps after having lost money you can invest in safe assets or even better the portfolio from your graph and then lever up if you do want higher risk return   you do n't need to change your allocation to risky assets and it is suboptimal to do so you want to move along the cal not the curve the riskiness of your portfolio should generally coincide negatively with your risk aversion   when you are older and more certain about your life expectancy and your assets are you exposed to more or less risks   in many cases less risks   this means you would choose a more risky portfolio because you are more sure you will have enough to live on until death even if your portfolio takes a dive your actual portfolio consists both of your investments and your human capital the present value of your time and skills   when you are young the value of this capital changes significantly with market performance so you already have background risk   buying risky securities adds to that risk   when you are old your human capital is worth little so your overall portfolio becomes less risky   you might want to compensate by increasing the risk of your investments edit note that this point may depend on how risky your human capital is how likely it is that your wage or job prospects will change with the economy overall the answer to your question is not definitively known but there is theoretical evidence that investing in risky securities when young is n't optimal having said that most people do seem to invest in riskier securities when young and safer when they are older i suspect this is because with life experience people become less optimistic as they get older not because it is optimal to do so   but i ca n't be sure

depending on the student loan this may be improper usage of the funds   i know the federal loans i received years ago were to be used for education related expenses only   i would imagine most if not all student loans would have the same restrictions bonus answer you must have earned income to contribute to an ira e.g. money received from working see irs publication 590 for details   so if your earmarked money is coming from savings only then you would not be eligible to contribute   as far as whether you can designate student loans for the educational expenses and then used earned income for an ira i would imagine that is fine   however i have not found any documentation to support my assumption

first you are not exactly giving the brokerage $ 2000 that money is the margin requirement to protect them in the case the stock price rises if you short 200 shares as in your example and they are holding $ 6000 from you then they are protected in the event of the stock price increasing to $ 30/share sometime before it gets there the brokerage will require you to deposit more money or they will cover your position by repurchasing the shares for your account the way you make money on the short sale is if the stock price declines it is a buy low sell high idea but in reverse if you believe that prices are going to drop then you could sell now when it is high and buy back later when it is lower in your example you are selling 200 shares at $ 20 and later buying those at $ 19 thus your profit is $ 200 not counting any interest or fees you have paid it 's a bit confusing because you are selling something you 'll buy in the future selling short is usually considered quite risky as your gain is limited to the amount that you sold at initially if i sell at $ 20/share the most i can make is if the stock declines to $ 0   your potential to lose is unlimited in theory there is no limit to how high the stock could go in theory so i could end up buying it back at an infinitely high price neither of these extremes are likely but they do show the limits of your potential gain and loss   i used $ 20/share for simplicity assuming you are shorting with a market order vs a limit order if you are shorting it would be better for you to sell at 20 instead of 19 anyway if someone says i would like to give you $ 20 for that item you are selling you are n't likely to tell them no i 'd really only like $ 19 for it

that depends really generally speaking though roth iras are the place for stock market mutual fund investing all the off the wall or not so off the wall things like real estate investments or buying up gold or whatever other ideas you hear from people they may be good or bad or whatnot but your roth ira is maybe not the best place for that sort of thing   the whole philosophy behind iras is to deliberately set aside money for the future anything reasonable will work for this explore interesting investment ideas with today 's money not tomorrow 's money that being said at your age i would go for the riskier options within what 's available   if i were in your situation and i have been recently i would lean toward low fee mutual funds classified as growth funds   my own personal opinion this is not advice is that small cap international funds are the place to be for young folks that 's a generalized opinion based on my feel for the world but i do n't think i 'm personally competent to start making specific stock picks so mutual funds makes sense to me in that i can select the fund that generally aligns with my sense of things and assume that their managers will make reasonably sound decisions within that framework of course that assumption has to be backed up with reputation of the specific mf company and the comparative performance of the fund relative to other funds in the same sector as to the generalized question how else can you work toward financial stability and independence outside of your roth ira find ways to boost your earning potential over time and buy a house before the next bubble within the next 18 months i 'm guessing

short answer yes for federal income tax purposes you are taxed on your total income adding up positives and negatives if business a made say $ 100,000 while business b lost $ 20,000 then your total income is $ 80,000 and that 's what you 'll be taxed on as @littleadv says of course any business losses you claim must qualify as business losses under irs rules and yes there are special rules about losses that the irs considers passive if you have wage income in addition to business income business losses do n't offset wage income for social security and medicare tax purposes you ca n't get a refund of the social security tax deducted from your paycheck i do n't know if this is relevant to you but if you have businesses in different states each is taxed by that state for example i have two tiny side businesses one in michigan and one in ohio last year the michigan business made money while the ohio business lost money so my federal income was michigan minus ohio my ohio income was negative so i owed no ohio income tax but i could n't subtract my ohio losses from my michigan income for michigan income tax purposes thus having say $ 10,000 income in michigan and $ 10,000 in ohio would result in lower taxes than $ 30,000 income in michigan and a $ 10,000 loss in ohio even though the total income in both cases is the same and this would be true even if the tax rates in both states were identical

20 is almost certainly too high i agree with 2 as a very rough rule it will vary significantly depending on the industry i generally calculate an average of the previous 2 3 years working capital and deduct that from cash working capital is current assets less current liabilities current assets is comprised of cash prepaid expenses and significantly accounts receivable this means that ca is likely to be much higher than just cash which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted which reduces ev which makes the ev ebitda ratio look even more pricey as noted but a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter as such and because of seasonal effects it 's critical to smooth this by averaging several periods after calculating this for a few companies compare to revenue is it close to 2

well the idea of good practice is subjective so obviously there wo n't be an objectively correct answer i suspect that whatever article you read was making this recommendation as a budgeting tool to physically isolate your reserve of cash from your spending account(s as a means to keep spending in check this is a common idea that i 've heard often enough though i do n't think i am alone in believing that it 's unnecessary except in the case of a spender who can not be trusted to stay within a budget   i suppose there is a very small argument to be made about security where if you use a bank account for daily spending and that account is somehow compromised the short term damage is limited in the end i would argue that if you 're in control of spending and budgeting have a single source of income that is from regular employment and you use a credit card for most of your daily spending there 's no compelling reason to have more than one bank account   some people have a checking and savings account simply for the psychological effect of separating their money some couples have 3 4 accounts for income personal spending and savings other people have separate accounts for business self employment funds and a few people like having many accounts that act as hard limits for spending in different categories of course the other submitted answer is correct in noting that the more accounts that you have the more you are opening yourself up to accounting issues if funds do n't transfer the way you expect them to assuming you 're the accounts often some banks are more lenient with this however and may offer you the option to freely overdraft by pulling funding from another pre designated account that you also hold at the same bank

well first this program would n't exclude people from privately funding their own education if they have the resources but second the investors would n't be investing in individuals but entire classes so it is n't whether or not an individual student is worth the investment but whether or not that academic program was worth an investment if a basic physics degree from a particular university was typically attracting people that were going to school for knowledge and a deep understanding of the world then the investors would demand a larger fraction of the student 's future income   which presumably the students would be ok with since they were n't wanting an income

in theory if a company has 1 m shares at $ 10 and does a 10 for 1 split then the day after it has 10 m shares at $ 1 assuming no market move so both the price and the number of share change keeping the total value of the company unchanged regarding your bis i suspect that the new number of shares has not been reported yet because it 's an etf the number of shares in issue changes everyday due to in out flows your twx example is not ideal either because there was a spin off on the same day as the stock split so you need to separate the two effects some studies have documented a positive stock split effect one of the suggested reasons is that the stock becomes more liquid after the split but other studies have rejected that conclusion so you can probably safely consider that on average it will not have a material effect

to round out something that w. rea pointed out the business that a reit is in will be either a equity reit property management b mortgage reit lending or c hybrid reit both   a very key point about why reits broadly have been struggling lately and this would show up in the reit indices etfs you 've linked to is linked to the reit business models   for an equity reit they borrow money at the going rate let 's say for commercial scale loans and use that to take out mortgages on physical properties if a property rents for $ 15 k per month and they can take out a $ 1.8 million loan at $ 9,000 per month then their business is around managing maintenance operating expenses and taxes on that $ 6,000 per month margin for a mortgage reit they borrow funds as a highly qualified borrower again let 's say and lend those funds back out at a higher rate the basic concept is that if you borrow $ 10 million at 4.5 for 30 years you need to pay it back at $ per month if you can lend it out reliably at 5 you collect $ per month a handy $ 3,000 per month the cheaper you can get money at below 4.5 and the higher you can lend it at above 5 the better your margin is   the worry is that both reit business models are very highly dependent on the cost of borrowing money with the us fed changing its bond buying qe stimulus activity the prevailing interest rates are likely to go up while this has its benefits inflation it also will make it more expensive for these types of companies to do business

as mhoran said the risks of buying a bankrupt company are huge and even successful bankruptcy do n't involve keeping the same stock for instance the gm bankruptcy was resolved by the company more or less selling all its valuable assets brands factories inventory to a new version of itself using that money to pay off what liabilities it could and then dissolving the new company then issued new stock and you had to buy the new stock to see it rise the old stock became worthless aa could have gone the same way delta could have bought it out of bankruptcy and consumed it outright with any remaining shareholders being paid off at market value that 's probably the best the market was hoping for instead the deal is a much more equal merger brings a very large airport network and aircraft fleet to the table and delta brings its cash an also considerable fleet and network and a management team that 's kept that airline solvent the stockholders therefore expect to be paid off at a much higher per share price either in a new combined stock in delta stock or in cash

for the most part saving money usually depends upon having a budget and being able to stick to it the toughest part of budgeting is usually setting it up how much do i need for x and sticking to it each month in regards to sticking to it there is software that you can use that helps figure out how much you are spending and how much you have left in a given category and they all pretty much do the same thing track your spending and how much you have left in the category if you are good with spreadsheets you might prefer that route cost free but software that you can buy usually has value in that it can also generate reports that help you spot trends that you might not see in the spreadsheet sticking to a budget can be tough and a lot of what people have said already is good advice but one thing that helps for me is having play money that can be used for whatever i want in general this should be a fairly nominal amount $ 20 or $ 40 a week but it is enough that if you see a new book you want or what to go out for lunch one day you can do it without impacting the overall budget in some way likewise having bigger savings goals can also be useful in that if times get tough it is easier to stop putting $ 100 a month to the side for a vacation than it is to cut back your grocery budget

you can get an sba disaster loan to help cover costs there are a few different kinds of loans you have to live in a qualifying area to get one which you likely do there are physical disaster loans which cover inventory and that may help replace the flowers plants they also have which you can use to help cover ongoing costs like fixed bills while you get back into business important to note these are loans intended to be low interest or at least lower than a merchant cash advance or putting charges on credit cards and do have to get paid back there are hoops to jump through too but they may be your best option depending on your current financial situation you could also go to your local small business development center for help they have free resources and experts who can help you understand your options and when you get back up on your feet get a business line of credit and business insurance so you have a backup plan and immediate access to capital for next time this article is about harvey but same ideas apply for irma

one big factor that no one has mentioned yet is whether you believe in a deflationary or inflationary future right now we are leaning towards a deflationary environment so it makes sense to pay off more of the debt if you make just one extra payment a year you will have paid off your house 7 years early however should this change depending on government and central bank policy you may be better off putting down the very minimum   in a year or three from now you should have a clearer picture in the meanwhile here is a recent business week article discussing both sides of the argument

in other words to a first order approximation the s&p 500 is always at an all time high i 'm going to run with this observation a bit the crash of 87 was remarkable it was a drop of 1/3 in a short time yet when one looked at the year the dow was up nearly 5 with dividends included a one year rip van would have up thinking it an year   i actually recall a conversation i had on aug 25th 1987 i was discussing the market with a colleague over lunch and while i did n't call the top that day i remarked that it did n't matter much that 5 10 years later just staying in the market would have been the right thing     compare this 87 95 chart to the longer term chart shows in his chart this is all but a blip in my chart you can see it took about 3 1/2 years to be in the black as the market then shot up from there a dollar cost would not have bought at that short term high well not more than a tiny bit   the best i can do to conclude is to say i 'd never just buy in all at once you buy in over time x% of your income each month and if you have a chunk to invest smooth it out over a few years

say the rate is 6 and the payment is $ 500/mo if the bank credits on the day received the .5 per month is $ 2.50 for the whole month in other words pulling in the payment by the full 30 days will save you about $ 2.50 the whole loan may be costing $ but you can only impact the amount one payment at a time   to be clear you need to find out exactly how they credit you some loans do not accept partial payments separate from the normal payment if a $ 500 payment is due that 's the time to prepay principal but they might not accept say $ 200 each week   as a side note mortgages typically do n't credit the way you 'd hope i have a standard 30 year mortgage and whether i send the payment a full 15 days early or 14 days late the next month shows a balance that i can pull from an amortization table assuming all payments are on the 1st of the month if i were you i 'd make a full payment 2 weeks early then check your balance and see what the impact was just to be sure

i was in a similar situation and my method was this since i already had a fidelity 401k account it was pretty easy to open a individual account through the website   from there you can just put the money into a general market mutual fund or exchange traded fund i prefer low expense ratio funds like passive indexed funds since studies show that there is n't much benefit to actively traded funds   so i just put my money into the popular low fee fund spy which tracks to the s&p 500   i   plan on leaving the money there for at least a year if not several years so i can pay the lower capital gains tax rate on any gains and avoid paying the commissions too many times in your situation you might want to consider using the extra cash to max out you and your wife 's 401k this year since you are n't already taking full advantage of that often people recommend saving 10 or 15 of gross income throughout their career for retirement so you 're on the low side and maybe have a small bit of catch up to do finally you could also start a 529 education saving plan to save for kid 's future college cost

california and new york are very aggressive when it comes to revenue and taxes as such mere having an employee in these states creates a nexus and tax filing liability for the company wood mentioned sales tax that is correct having an employee in the state of california will require collecting sales tax for ca and if until now your employer did n't have to that would be a good enough reason to refuse your request in addition to sales taxes there 's also the issue of corporate filings they will now have to file paperwork in ca and pay ca franchise taxes just because of you and payroll taxes which are pretty high in ca and ny it will also subject the to ca ny wa labor laws which are more liberal than in most of the other states washington does n't have personal income tax but does have corporate income tax and sales tax so i 'm guessing the reasons to exclude this state are the same

i would definitely pay down the debt first   if it is going to take 15 years to do so you probably need to allocate more money to paying down debt cut expenses by going out to eat less and keeping spending to the bare necessities   you might even consider getting a second job just for paying down the debt   if that is n't enough consider selling off some assets   you should be able to come up with a plan to be debt free excluding maybe a regular mortgage within 3 5 years once the only debt you have is a home mortgage then its time to look at putting money towards retirement again note you should not take money out of a 401k or ira to pay off debt   the costs for doing so are nearly always too great

you are right it is a ponzi scheme unless it pays all of the profits as dividends here 's why today 's millenials are saving a lot less and instead they choose to be spenders it 's just that their mentality is different if the trend continues there will be more spenders and less savers   that means that in 20 years from now a company might sell more and make more profits but because there are less investors on the market it will worth less judging by supply and demand this has to be true   does n't that seem like a disconnect to you guys does n't that just prove that all those profits are not really yours but instead you 're just sitting on the side making bets about them if i own a company from the point where it goes public and while the value goes up i hold on to it for 50 years let 's say for 45 years it made tons of profits but never paid a cent in dividend and then in 5 years it goes out of business what happened to all the profits they made throughout the 45 years   if you owned a restaurant that made a profit for 45 years and then went bankrupt you are fine you took your profits every year because why on earth would you reinvest 100 of the profit forever but what if you could sell of that restaurant on the stock market get all of that ipo money and still keep all of the profits while claiming that you reinvest it forever that 's exactly what they do they just buy expensive things for personal use from fancy cars to private jets they just write it down as an investment and you ca n't see what the money was spent on because you are not a majority stakeholder you have no power it was not like this forever companies used to pay all of their profits in dividends and be valued according to that not anymore now they are just in it for the growth it will keep growing as long as people keep buying into it and that 's the exact definition of a ponzi scheme

the problem with short would be that even if the stock eventually falls it might raise a lot in the meantime and unless you have enough collateral you may not survive till it happens   to sell shares short you first need to borrow them as naked short is currently prohibited in us as far as i know now to borrow you need some collateral which is supposed to be worth more that the asset you are borrowing and usually substantially more otherwise the risk for the creditor is too high suppose you borrowed 10 k worth of shares and gave 15 k collateral numbers are totally imaginary of course suppose the shares rose so that total cost is now at this moment you will probably be demanded to either raise more collateral or close the position if you can not thus generating you a 4 k loss little use it would be to you if next day it fell to 1 k you already lost your money   as keynes once said markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent see also another answer which other issues with short selling as noted by options may be a safer way to do it or a short etf like lists of those are easy to find online

the art of short selling by stanley providers for many case studies about what kind of opportunities to look for from a fundamental analysis perspective typically things you can look for are financing terms that are not very favorable expensive interest payments as well as other on cash flow arbitrary decisions by management poor management and dilution that does n't make sense usually another product of poor management from a quantitative analysis perspective you can gain insight by looking at the credit default swap rate history if the company is listed in that market the things that affect a cds spread are different than what immediately affects share prices some market participants trade over credit default swaps when they are betting on a company 's insolvency but looking at large trades in the options market is n't indicative of anything on its own but you can use that information to help confirm your opinion you can certainly jump on a trend using bad headlines but typically by the time it is headline news the majority of the downward move in the share price has already happened or the stock opened lower because the news came outside of market hours you have to factor in the short interest of the company if the short interest is high then it will be very easy to squeeze the shorts resulting in a rally of share prices the opposite of what you want a short squeeze does n't change the fundamental or quantitative reasons you wanted to short the technical analysis should only be used to help you decide your entry and exit price ranges amongst an otherwise random walk the technical rules you created sound like something a very basic program or stock screener might be able to follow but it does n't tell you anything you will have to do research in the company 's public filings yourself

with no written agreement in place the right rate is whatever both parties can agree to i could argue that i could have invested the money in s&p 500 index funds and made about 9 annually over the last 15 years and the 15,000 would have been over 40,000   the fair rate would be whatever rate of return could have been expected from whatever your father would have done with the money otherwise keep it in a bank account pay off debt invest in the market start a business whatever   your father has the benefit of hindsight to know what would have been a good use of the funds over 15 years using the rate of inflation results in effectively a zero percent loan in real interest terms meaning no profit was made just accounting for the time value of money both parties need to either decide on an amount or equivalent rate or decide if squeezing the other for a few thousand euros is worth the strife

for now we can pay off our debt in united states dollars if we lose our reserve currency status we would have to pay it off with a different currency if we continued printing money we would be our currency against the new reserve currency which would mean that after we took on too much debt we would n't really be able to pay our creditors back after exchanging our devalued currency for the new one on the international markets we are lucky enough not to have to worry about this now but i think op was referring to all countries in these situations other countries do n't have the luxury of just printing out massive amounts of money to pay off their debts that is why i am saying that america has a very view of reality when it comes to deficit spending we would n't have that any more if the un followed through with its suggestion to create a global reserve currency or reverted back to the gold standard i do n't think the second option is nearly as realistic but we never know

another possibly significant issue is that the number ten thousand is very important in the japanese language   in japanese you count in ones tens hundreds thousands ten thousands but instead of a hundred thousand you have ten ten thousands   and then one hundred ten thousands and then a thousand ten thousands    the ten thousand yen note equivalent roughly to the $ 100 bill is the main base of japanese currency   if you go to the bank for example you will almost always take out your money in ten thousand yen notes    knowing a little about the language i would say it would become quite strange and un natural to suddenly start using a hundred as the main note value   i doubt the japanese people would ever even consider that and my guess is the only people who are even put out by the large number of zeroes are foreigners who are used to dealing in dollars and cents

if there was no question of improvements to the property the problem would be simple each person invests whatever amount calculate the percentage of each person 's investment out of the entire investment and that 's what share each one owns like a puts in $ 10,000 for the deposit and pays $ 5,000 toward the mortgage over the next however many years b puts in $ 5,000 toward the deposit but pays $ 7,000 of the mortgage c puts in $ 15,000 but pays only $ 1,000 of the mortgage payments so total investments a $ 15,000 b $ 12,000 c $ 16,000 total $ so a 's share of the house is = etc if you then sell it you pay off any outstanding debt and then everybody gets their share of what 's left but once you start making improvements there is no simple formula suppose you put down new flooring in the dining room you pay $ 500 for materials and put in 20 hours of labor presumably you have now added something more than $ 500 to your share but how much more how much are the hours worth what if someone damages the house puts a hole in the all or something and then fixes it does the time and effort they put into fixing it add to their investment or did that just cancel out the damage they did what if one person does a lot to keep the house in generally good condition in small snippets of time like cleaning furnace filters and polishing the floors while another does nothing and lets their share get run down and dirty it gets very complicated theoretically you could come up with a rate at which you value your work like say every hour spent maintaining the house is worth $ 10 or $ 20 or whatever but who 's going to keep track of it over the course of potentially many years and what if one person does a small number of big easily quantifiable jobs while another does many small hard to count jobs like if a the floor every week for 2 years is that worth more or less than b installing 3 ceiling fans a door and 2 windows you could go around and around on this sort of thing

i do n't see a tag for united states so i 'm having to assume this is us taxes   it does n't matter what app you use irs trades are all calculated the same first you have to report each trade on a 8949 and from that the totals go into a schedule d.   short term trades are stocks that you 've kept exactly one year or less long term trades are for 1 year + 1 day or more   trades where you sold a stock for a loss then bought that stock back again under 30 days do n't get to count as a loss   this only affects realized capital gains and losses you do n't count fees first take all of your short term gains then offset them by all of your short term losses   do the same for long term gains and losses   short and long term gains are taxed at different rates   you can deduct losses from short term to your long term and vice versa   then you can deduct the total losses up to $ 3000 household $ 1500 married filing separately per year on your regular income taxes or other dividend taxes   if you have over $ 3000 in losses then you need to carry that over to subsequent years edited per dave 's comments thanks dave

there are a number of factors here 1 it 's important that there is human oversight on the system at one level someone needs to be monitoring the computers that manage the trading to be sure they are functioning at another level someone needs to be making judgement calls on important but rare events when you you suspend trading in a stock when do you close the stock exchange entirely it is alleged that computer trades were at least partly responsible for the may 2010 selloff even if that 's unproven would you really want those computers trading with each other for a couple of days or even for a couple of hours 2 providing 24/7 trading would increase the cost of running a stock exchange but with only a tiny improvement in liquidity 3 if the stock exchange ran 24/7 then traders would have to run 24/7 that would add hugely to the cost of trading 4 the people who would really suffer would be day traders because there would no longer be such a thing as a day trader if you were a sole trader then you would need to monitor your investments 24/7 or risk waking up in the morning to find one of your stocks had plummeted overnight

you can interpret prices in any way you wish but the commonly quoted price is the last price traded if your broker routes those orders unlikely because they will be considered unfair and will probably be busted by the exchange the only way to drive the price to the heights lows in your example is to have an overwhelming amount of quantity relative to the order book your orders will hit the opposing limit orders until your quantity is exhausted starting from the best price to the worst price this is the functional equivalent to a market order

i speak from a position of experience my bs and ms are both in comp sci i know very little about loans or finances that is very unfortunate as you are obviously an intelligent human being   perhaps this is a good time to pause your formal education and get educated in personal finance   to me it is that important i study computer science and am thus confident that i will be able to find work after i finish school this kind of attitude can lead to trouble   you will likely have a high salary but that does not always translate into prosperity   personal finance is more about behavior then mathematics   i currently work with people that have high salaries in a low cost of living area   some have lost homes due to foreclosure some are very limited in their options because of high student loan balances   some are millionaires without hitting the ipo startup lotto   the difference is behavior it 's possible that someone in my family will be able to cosign and help me out with this loan this is indicative of lack of knowledge and poor financial behavior   this kind of thing can lead to strained relationships to the point where people do n't talk to each other   never co sign for anyone and if you value the relationship with a person never ask them to co sign i 'll be working as a ta again for a $ 1000 stipend yikes   why in the world would you work for 1 k when you need 4 k   you should find a way to earn 6 k this semester so you can save some and put some toward the loans you already acquired   accepting this kind of situation raises red flags on your attitude towards personal finance   and yes it is possible you can earn that waiting tables and if you can find a part time programming gig you can make a lot more then that   consider working as a ta and wait tables until you find that first programming gig i am just about done with my undergraduate degree and will be starting graduate school at the same university next semester to me this is a recipe for failure in most cases   you have all your financing options to date and are planning to go backwards even more   why not get out of school with your bs and go to work   you can save up some of your ms tuition and most companies will provide tuition reimbursement    computer science software engineering can be a fickle market   right now things are going crazy and times are really good   however that was not always the case during my career and unlikely for yours   for example just this year i my highest rate of pay that occurred in 2003   i was out of work most of 2004 and for part of 2005 i actually made less then when i was working while in college   in 2009 my company cut our salaries by 5 but the net cost to me was more like a 27 cut   in 2001 i worked as a contractor for a company that had a 10 reduction in full time employees yet they kept us contractors working    recently i talked with a recruiter about a position doing which is what i am doing now   it required a high level security clearance which is not an easy thing to get   the rub was that it was located in a higher cost of living area and only paid about 70 of what i am making now   they required more and paid less but such is the market   you need to learn about these things good luck

the short answer is yes you probably can take the deduction for a home office because the space is used exclusively and you are working there for the convenience of your employer if you do n't have a desk at your employers office the long answer is that it may not be worth it to take the home office deduction as an employee you 're deduction is subject to a 2 agi floor you can only deduct a percentage of your rent or the depreciation on your home a quick and dirty example if you make $ 75k year rent a 1200 sqft 2 bedroom apartment for $ 1000/month and use one bedroom 120 sqft regularly and exclusively for your employer you can deduct 10 of the $ 12000 $ 1000 12 months assumes your situation did n't change in rent or $ 1200 however because you are an employee you are subject to the 2 agi floor so you can deduct $ salary 2 floor = so in order to deduct the first dollar you need an additional $ 300 worth of deductible expenses   depending on your situation it may or may not be worth it to take the home office deduction even if you qualify for it

of course the rationale is exactly the same as always profit is taxed the fact that you use intermediate barter to make that profit is irrelevant to clarify as it seems that you think it makes a difference that no money changed hands consider this situation so far your cost is $ 10000 how will the tax authority address this they will look at the fair market value of the barter you got gold worth of $ 20000 so from their perspective you got $ 20000 and immediately exchanged it into gold what does it mean for you that you 're taxed on the $ 10000 gain you made on your product x the $ 20000 worth of barter that you received minus the $ 10000 worth of work material expenses that you spend on producing the merchandise and that you have $ 20000 basis in the gold that you now own if in a year when you plan to sell the gold its price drops you can deduct investment losses if its price goes up you 'll have investment gain but for the gain you 're making on your product x you will pay taxes now because that 's when you realized it sold the and received in return something else of a value

the point about insurance is solidarity think about this in london a few hundred years ago people first started insuring their houses against fire there were several insurance companies and if you used one you got a marker on your house so if your house caught fire they would come and check and they would put the fire out only if it had their marker on it   now in most places these days the fire brigade will always come and always put your fire out we expect this and we are happy to pay for this service by taxation and we do not fret about wasted money if we pay it for decades without ever having a fire we also do not complain if the neighbour 's house burns and they get the full fire service which we have been paying for   now all the fire brigade do is rescue you and put your fire out here in germany every house owner is also obliged to have fire insurance so if your house burns it can be repaired or rebuilt everyone pays insurance premiums and i never heard anyone complain if they paid for 50 years and never claimed anything if you need a new house the payout is huge but the premiums are low this only works if everyone is insured this can only work if we all accept the concept of solidarity it is easy to say i do n't smoke so i do n't need to insure against fire or i live a healthy life so i do n't need to insure against cancer but lightning does not check your cv before it strikes it hits you or your fellow man and how can you justify not helping your neighbour insurance can only work if we all take part

i think your very long list of possible assumptions makes a point of your own   to state 15 as a general value is bogus   i think in most cases the 15 is merely a popular meme    to give any fixed number or percentage of income saved is insufficient without expanding things in the way you show   therefore a formula in which at least a handful of variables can be plugged into it seems like the right approach   and this is what is being discussed here with the monte carlo method

there are two significant drawbacks to this type of transfer they were the reasons why i kept my american 401(k as is and started funding my canadian rrsp from zero balance 1 taxes a large chunk of your 401(k will be lost to taxes there is probably no way to transfer the funds without making a withdrawal which will incur the us federal tax and the 10 early withdrawal penalty   when the money went into the 401(k you got a tax deduction in the us and the tax break is supposed be repaid later when you make a withdrawal that 's basically how tax deferral works   it 's unlikely that any country will let you take a deduction first and send the payback to a foreign country   the withdrawal amount may also be taxable in canada canadians generally pay taxes on their global income and that includes pensions and distributions from foreign retirement plans   foreign tax credit will apply of course to eliminate double taxation but it 's of little help if your marginal canadian tax rate is higher than your average us tax rate 2 expenses your rrsp will have to be invested in something and mutual fund management expenses are generally higher in canada than in the us   for example my employer sponsored rrsp has a standard poor 's stock index fund that charges 1.5 and that is considered low cost   it also offers a number of managed funds with expenses in excess of 2 that i simply ignore   you can probably invest your american in mutual funds more efficiently

there are two totally different things there is your limited company and there is yourself   your limited company will absolutely have to pay 20 corporation tax on all its profits the profits are the income of the limited company you say it 's £ 5,000 a year minus all expenses usually you would pay yourself a salary which immediately reduces your profits and of course the payment to the accountant will reduce the profits   if the limited company is your only source of income the usual method is to pay yourself £ salary a year possible pay money into a pension for yourself which is tax free and reduces the company 's profits pay 20 corporation on the rest and pay yourself a dividend twice a year unless you have another job where you make a lot of money you should have paid all that money to yourself as income and paid zero corporation tax   and may i say that if you made £ 5,000 a year then there is most likely not enough going on to justify that an accountant charges you £ 600 you should be able to find someone doing it cheaper i can not imagine that he or she had to do a lot of work for this

first radon is common in some areas of new jersey   before you back out of this house you should consider if you can find a different place to live that does not have a radon issue    you should be able to find someone who does radon testing specifically   such a company should be able to check that neither the gas nor the on walls etc are present in the house after the mitigation   apparently checking the water is possible as well   if such a test fails and the seller does not do more mitigation that would be grounds for withdrawing from the contract    since radon is common in new jersey it is likely that the contingencies are written such that the seller offering to mitigate is enough to keep you in the contract   you would have to ask a lawyer to be sure    in general contingencies are based on the offer you made which is a contract   if you wanted radon to be a deal breaker then you should have written the offer that way   left to themselves real estate agents will offer mitigation instead   this is because they get paid a commission on the sale   no sale no commission   obviously too late for this house but in the future you may want to be more careful about this    radon mitigation is common and costs in the $ range   one estimate in that link suggests that $ 1300 is the minimum with required fees etc    if your offer is not written to allow you to walk away if there is a radon issue you will probably lose your deposit if you walk away   you can also try to be extra picky about your contingencies   in particular they have to show you that they have mitigated the radon problem   if you can find something that indicates that they have not then you can get more mitigation   if they either fail to respond or choose not to respond that could allow you to withdraw from the deal without losing your deposit    there usually are n't additional problems beyond losing your deposit from walking away   but again this depends on the offer contract   this is really something that a lawyer should read

it has got to do with the irrationality of humans   the so called long term investor is in it for the long term they are not worried about market fluctuations nor timing the market but yet they will aim to try to get a bargain when they buy in   it is contradictory in a way think about it if i buy a stock and it drops by 30 i am not worried because i am in it for the long term but i am worried about getting 1 off when i buy it   they usually tend to buy when the stock starts falling however what they do n’t realise is when a stock starts falling there is no telling when it will stop so even if they get a bargain for that day it is usually quickly wiped out a few days later instead of waiting for the price to find support and start recovering they are eager to buy what they think is a bargain i think this type of long term investing is very risky and the main reason is because the investor has no plan they just try to buy so called bargain stocks and hold them until they need the money usually in retirement but what happens if the stock price is lower when they want to retire than when they bought it i hope no long term investor was trying to retire in 2008 if they simply had a plan to indicate when they would buy and under what conditions they would sell and have a risk management plan in place then maybe they could reduce their risk somewhat and conserve their capital a good article to read on this is what 's wrong with long term investing

i seem not to be able to comment on the first answer due to reputation so i 'll aim to enhanced the first answer which is generally good but with these caveats 1 dividends are not guaranteed to preferred shareholders   rather preferred shareholders are normally in line ahead i.e. in preference to or preferred of common shareholders in terms of dividend payment   this is an extremely important distinction because unlike investments that we generally consider guaranteed such as cds known as gics in canada a company 's board can suspend the dividend at anytime for long periods of time without significant repercussions whereas a missed payment to a bank or secured bondholder can often push a company into bankruptcy very quickly 2 due to point 1 it is extremely important to know the or rules both the preferred shares you are buying and the other more senior creditors of that issuing company i.e. taxes almost always come first banks loans leases bonds etc   it is also important to know if a particular preferred share has cumulative dividends   you generally only want to buy preferred 's that have cumulative dividends since that means that anytime the company misses a payment they must pay those dividends first before any other dividends at the same or lower priority in the future 3 unlike a common stock your upside on a preferred stock is relatively fixed you get a fixed share of the company 's profit and that 's it whereas a common shareholder gets everything that 's left over after interest and preferred dividends are paid so if the company does really well you will theoretically do much better with common stock over time for the above reasons it is generally advisable to think of preferred shares as being more similar to really risky bonds in the same company rather than similar to common stock    of course if you are an advanced investor there are a lot more variables in play such as tax considerations and whether the preferred have special options attached to them such conversion into common shares

some of the other answers mention this but i want to highlight it with a personal anecdote i have a property in a mid sized college town in the us its current worth about what we paid for it 9 years ago but i do n't care at all because i will likely never sell it that house is worth about $ 110,000 but rents for $ 1500 per month it is a good investment if you take rental income and the increase in equity from paying down the mortgage subtracting maintenance the return on the down payment is very good i have n't mentioned the paper losses involved in depreciation as that 's fairly us specific the laws are different in other jurisdictions but for at least the first two years we showed losses while making money so there are tax advantages as well at least currently those laws also change over time there is a large difference between investing in a property for appreciation and investing for income even in those categories there are niches that can vary widely commercial vs residential trendy vacation tourist areas etc each has their place but ensure that you do n't confuse a truism meant for one type of real estate investing as being applicable to real estate investing in general

some places banks credit unions will allow you to refinance a auto loan my credit union only does this if the original loan was with another lender they will send the money to the old lender then give you a loan under the new terms they are trying to get your business not necessarily looking for a way make less money for themselves   you will have to see how much you will save which will be based on the delta of the length of the loan or the change in interest rate or both my credit union has a calculator to show you the numbers based on keeping the size of the payments the same or keeping the number of payments the same   make sure you understand any limitations regarding the refinance based on the age of the car and if you are underwater

who issued stock typically support it when the stock price go down   no not many company do that as it is uneconomical for them to do so money used up in buying back equity is a wasteful use of a firm 's capital unless it is doing a buyback to return money to shareholders does the same thing happen with government bonds   not necessarily again here bond trading is very different from equities trading there are conditions specified in the offer document on when an issuer can recall jack up the price of an oversold bond even government bonds have them   the actions of the government has a bigger ripple effect as compared to a firm the government can start buying back bonds to increase it 's price but it will inflation because of the increase in the supply of money in the market which may or may n't be desirable then again people holding the bond would have to incentivized to sell the bond even during the greek fiasco the greek government was n't buying greek bonds as it had no capital to buy printing more euros was n't an option as no assets to back the newly printed money and the ecb would have stopped them from being accepted   and generally buying back is n't useful because they have to return the might run into billions invested in long term projects by the government and can not be liquidated immediately while servicing a bond is cheaper and investing the proceeds from the bond sale is more useful while being invested in long term projects the government can just roll over the bonds with a new issue and refrain from returning the capital till it is in a position to do so

it was actually meant to be more of just a joke comment but it does n't take very many successful billion dollar lawsuits to justify $ 10 million a pop   personally i think that part of the patent reform solution is that patents are non exclusive however licensing must be set up before use including free licensing if the owner wants to public domain it if the two parties ca n't agree to terms then it goes to a to set the the licensing fees which is binding the arbitration will take into account the research and development costs required likelihood of the same thing being independently created estimated profits from products using the patent etc   of course the core issue is granting patents for silly stuff but since the ones already in existence are presumably grandfathered in i think enforcing market driven licensing fees is the best way to prevent all of the dumb lawsuits going on the patent holder gets its money or maintains market advantage if the licensing fee is so high that no one wants to pay it and it does n't prevent competition from using other another party 's patented ideas

the government started the crisis and the banks concluded it     barney frank and the house committee on financial services continually pushed fannie mae and freddie mac to issue new mortgages with the intent of increasing home ownership   the house set goals for mortgage thus fannie and freddie lowered the requirements for obtaining a new mortgage   other banks saw this happening and were forced to lower their requirements for issuing mortgages   then the banks realized they were holding a lot of risky mortgages on their books so they found a way to spread the risk among other banks and investors   through financial ingenuity to reduce risk and maximize return they created a new investment securitized the debt where risky mortgages were bundled the earnings and resold to investors   in this way they transformed hard to sell subprime mortgages into salable aaa and aa debt   this depended on the fact that the risk of default on each mortgage was independent of the others   this scheme reduced risk and increased returns for banks and investors   however the securitized mortgages contributed to a higher overall system risk   as long as there were n't mass defaults everyone was better off   well clearly there were mass defaults on risky mortgages which destroyed the securitization scheme and brought down the banks     the missing element in all this was a strong competent regulatory body that looked out for the country 's welfare   everyone else was looking out for themselves barney frank amp the house looked out for their voters agenda to push home ownership   home buyers were taking advantage of the favorable credit   the banks satisfied mortgage demand   the banks also figured out a way to sell risky mortgages to investors so more could be issued   however no one looked out for the system wide risk

in less than two decades more than half of all publicly traded companies have disappeared there were u.s. stocks in november 1997 according to the center for research in security prices at the university of chicago ’s booth school of business nowadays there are fewer than 3,600   a close look at the data helps explain why stock pickers have been underperforming and the shrinking number of companies should make all investors more skeptical about the market beating claims of recently trendy strategies   back in november 1997 there were more than 2,500 small stocks and nearly 4,000 tiny microcap stocks according to crsp at the end of 2016 fewer than 1,200 small and just under 1,900 microcap stocks were left   most of those companies melted away between 2000 and 2012 but the numbers so far show no signs of recovering   several factors explain the shrinking number of stocks analysts say including the regulatory red tape that discourages smaller companies from going and staying public the flood of venture capital funding that enables young companies to stay private longer and the rise of private equity funds whose buyouts take shares off the public market   for stock pickers differentiating among the remaining choices is an even harder game than it was when the market consisted of twice as many companies says michael an investment strategist at credit suisse in new york who wrote a report this spring titled the incredible shrinking universe of stocks   that ’s because the surviving companies tend to be fewer bigger older more profitable and easier to analyze he says making stock picking much more competitive   consider small stock funds often they compare themselves to the russell 2000 an index of the u.s. stocks ranked through 3,000 by total market value twenty years ago there were over 4,000 stocks smaller than the inclusion cutoff for the russell 2000 says pastor a finance professor at the university of chicago that number is down to less than 1,000 today   so fund managers have far fewer stocks to choose from if they venture outside the index the very area where the best bargains might be found more money chasing fewer stocks could lead some fund managers to buy regardless of value   eric is a veteran portfolio manager with a solid record of investing in small stocks last year he took the drastic step of shutting down his roughly $ 400 million mutual fund river road independent value and giving his investors their money back   prices got so crazy in small caps i fired myself he says my portfolio was 90 in cash at the end because i could n’t find anything to buy if i ’d kept investing i was sure i ’d lose people their money   he adds it was the hardest thing i ’ve ever done professionally but i did n’t feel i had a choice i knew my companies were overvalued   mr. hopes to return to the market when in his view values become attractive again he does n’t expect recent conditions to be permanent   the evaporation of thousands of companies may have one enduring result however and it could catch many investors by surprise   most research on historical returns points out mr. is based on the days when the stock market had twice as many companies as it does today was the population of companies so different then he asks that the inferences we draw from it might no longer be valid   so called factor investing also known as systematic or smart beta investing picks hundreds or thousands of stocks at a time based on common sources of risk and return among them how big companies are how much their shares fluctuate how expensive their shares are relative to asset value and so on   but the historical outperformance of many such factors may have been driven largely by the tiniest companies exactly those that have disappeared from the market in droves   before concluding that small stocks or cheap value stocks will the market as as they did in the past you should pause to consider how they will perform without the from thousands of tiny stocks that no longer exist   the stock market has more than tripled in the past eight years so the eclipse of so many companies has n’t been a catastrophe but it does imply that investing in some of the market ’s strategies might be less profitable in the future than they looked in the past

there are three or four ways that a company can grow crowdfunding is a relatively new in mainstream businesses alternative financing method where people will finance a company with the expectation that they will benefit from the product or service that they provide obviously a startup has no prior income to use so it must either raise money through equity or debt people say that one must borrow contingent on their salary banks lend money based on the ability to pay the loan back plus interest   for individuals their income is their primary source of cash flow so yes it is usually the determining factor in getting a loan   for a business the key factor is future cash flows   so a business will borrow money say to buy a new asset like a factory that will be used to generate cash flows in the future so that they can pay down the debt   if the bank believes that the use of the money is going to be profitable enough that they will get their money back with interest they 'll loan the money equity investors are essentially the same but since they do n't get a guaranteed payback they only get paid through non guaranteed dividends or liquidation their risk is higher and they are looking for higher expected returns so the question i 'd have as a bank or equity investor is what are you going to do with the money   what is your business strategy what are you going to do that will make profits in the future   do you have a special idea or skill that you can turn into a profitable business   crowdfunding would be similar people are willing to give you money based on either the social or personal benefit of some product or service so any business either starts small and grows over time which is how the vast majority of businesses grow or has some special idea asset skill or something that would make a bank willing to take a risk on a huge loan i know again that people here tend to turn blind eyes on unfortunate realities but people do make giant businesses without having giant incomes the unfortunate reality is that most startups fail   which may sound bad but also keep in mind that most startups are created by people that are ok with failing   they are people that are willing to fail 9 times with the thought that the 10th one will take off and make up for the losses of the first 9    so i would say if you have some great idea or skill and a viable strategy and plan to take it to market then go for it you do n't need a huge salary to start off   you need something that you can take to market and make money   most people myself included either do not have that idea or skill to go out on their own or do n't have the courage to take that kind of risk   but do n't go in assuming all you need is a loan and you 'll be an instant millionaire   you might but the odds are very long

the thing is simply this if it were not for israeli control of america 's economy the fed the treasury would not be arming israel and spending billions of dollars in military aid    the palestinians ca n't even get water and medical supplies because israel has been them for the last decade   as america 's economy fails and military power and its opinion is no longer of any importance and the world comes to openly admit that israel is the root cause of terrorism and the facilitator financier and operator of groups like isis things will change while you may not be it will indeed be fun to watch brave israeli forces fight an armed palestinian force with the ability to hit back meaningfully   i am sure middle east peace will find you a lot quicker

as @mbhunter says make sure you pay off any debt you have first   then it 's a good idea to keep some or all of your savings as an emergency fund   if you use every last dime to pay for a house you 'll have no cushion available when something breaks down   the most common recommendation i 've seen is to have 3 6 months worth of expenses as an emergency fund   once you have that then you can start saving for your down payment    as @victor says try to find the best interest rate you can for that money but i would n't invest it in any kind of stock or bond product because your need for it is too short term   safety is more important than growth given your time frame when you 're ready to invest make sure you learn all you can   you do n't want to invest in something you do n't understand because that 's how you get ripped off   you can be reading and talking to people while you 're saving for your house so that when the time comes you 'll have a pretty good idea of what you want to do for investments

22 june 2016 would have been the time to do this nobody on here can tell you what gbp eur will do in the next few months and years now brexit is going to happen which implies lower uk growth and consequently a lower path for gbp interest rates but this is all already priced in   if you believe the uk economy will underperform current forecasts and/or the euro area economy will outperform current forecasts that may imply there 's scope for further gbp depreciation if you believe the probability of a further political shock from a no deal brexit is materially higher than the market thinks the same is true but the opposite of these things could happen also   i would worry less about playing the currency markets as a retail investor and more about what currency your outgoings are denominated in you live in spain do you have significant gbp expenses or liabilities or do you expect to have them in the future if not why are you taking currency risk by holding gbp balances whereas if you do e.g. if you plan to move back to the uk in the near future then it makes more sense

the mortgage is a debt and you pay interest on it typically more than you can earn elsewhere especially once taxes are taken into account by lowering the principal you lower the total interest you pay this is true whether you sell the house after 1 year 10 years or 100 years in your case prepayments made in the next few years would mean that when you sell your mortgage principal would be lower than it otherwise would have been and your house equity will be higher you can therefore either move up to more house for the same monthly payment or have a lower monthly payment for the same kind of house either of those are good things right now is the easiest time to find a little more money so do it if you can later you will have more obligations and develop a taste for more expensive things statistically speaking and therefore find a few hundred a month much harder to come by

you can ask your employer for anything that you want however most employers if they are contributing their own money into your hsa or you are contributing to your own hsa through payroll deduction only work with one hsa which is much easier for them to manage you are free to decline their hsa if you want   however if they are kicking in free money into your hsa i do n't recommend that you decline it   just pick the best option you have for investing as for the money that you are contributing if you do n't want to put your own money into your employer 's aetna hsa you can open up an hsa with any institution you like   you can even do this and still keep aetna hsa to take advantage of the employer 's contributions   however your annual limit is still the total of all contributions to all hsa 's in your name whether you make them or your employer makes them when deciding whether or not to use payroll deduction into the aetna hsa or to go your own way keep in mind that payroll deduction skips some payroll taxes

you can do this through a journal entry in quickbooks   it can all be entered as one entry there 's no need to do separate ones for each bill the journal entry should debit accounts payable and credit your equity account   in the line for accounts payable make sure to choose your name in the name column   this in effect enters a credit to your account which will offset the bills that were shown there previously the last step is to apply those credits to the bills   even though they offset each other your name would still show up in any reports and in the pay bills window   to do this open the pay bills window and select one of the bills owed to you   there should be an option to choose apply credits or something similar depends on which version of quickbooks you are running   choose that option and apply credits in the amount of the bill so that it zeroes out   do the same for all of the other bills   once they are all checked off click the button to pay bills   this wo n't actually pay anything but will instead just apply the credits to the bills as indicated

from the irs section 1091 loss from wash sales of stock or securities   section provides that in the case of any loss claimed to have been sustained from any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where it appears that within a period beginning 30 days before the date of such sale or disposition and ending 30 days after such date the taxpayer has acquired by purchase or by an exchange on which the entire amount of gain or loss was recognized by has entered into a contract or option so to acquire substantially identical stock or 3 securities then no deduction shall be allowed under 165 the document is not long 4 pages and should be read to see the intent it 's tough to choose the one but the conclusion is this is the definitive response to that question   a purchase within an ira or other retirement account can create a wash sale if such a purchase would be a wash sale otherwise i.e. the fact that it 's a retirement account does n't avoid wash rules

nowhere to back up a bit mutual funds are the stock market and the bond market that is when you invest in a mutual fund your money is ultimately buying stocks on the open market some of it might be buying bonds the exact mix of stocks and bonds depends on the mutual fund but a mutual fund is just a basket of stocks and/or bonds and/or other more exotic investments at 25 you probably should just be investing your roth ira in index stock mutual funds and index bond mutual funds you probably should n't even be doing peer to peer lending unless you 're willing to think of any losses as the cost of a hobby the higher interest rate you 're getting is a reflection of the risk that your borrowers will default i 'm not even sure if peer to peer lending is allowed in roth ira 's   investing in just stocks bonds and cast is boring but these are easy investments to understand the harder the investment is to understand the easier it is for it to be a scam or just a bad investment there 's not necessarily anything wrong with boring

a mutual fund could make two different kinds of distributions to you capital gains when the fund liquidates positions that it holds it may realize a gain if it sells the assets for a greater price than the fund purchased them for as an example for an index fund assets may get liquidated if the underlying index changes in composition thus requiring the manager to sell some stocks and purchase others mutual funds are required to distribute most of their income that they generate in this way back to its shareholders many often do this near the end of the calendar year   when you receive the distribution the gains will be categorized as either short term the asset was held for less than one year or long term vice versa based upon the holding period the gain is taxed differently currently in the united states long term capital gains are only taxed at 15 regardless of your income tax bracket you only pay the capital gains tax not the income tax short term capital gains are treated as ordinary income so you will pay your probably higher tax rate on any cash that you are given by your mutual fund you may also be subject to capital gains taxes when you decide to sell your holdings in the fund any profit that you made based on the difference between your purchase and sale price is treated as a capital gain based upon the period of time that you held the mutual fund shares it is categorized as a short- or long term gain and is taxed accordingly in the tax year that you sell the shares dividends many companies pay dividends to their stockholders as a way of returning a portion of their profits to their collective owners when you invest in a mutual fund that owns dividend paying stocks the fund is the owner that receives the dividend payments as with capital gains mutual funds will redistribute these dividends to you periodically often quarterly or annually the main difference with dividends is that they are always taxed as ordinary income no matter how long you or the fund have held the asset i 'm not aware of texas state tax laws so i ca n't comment on your other question

the likely reason the mortgage is tricky to get is the adviser is probably recommending an interest only mortgage in which there is no repayment of principle before maturity   that would allow you to deduct the amount of the interest expense from your taxable income   your investment grows compound tax deferred and the principal invested the mortgage balance is completely tax free since it never qualifies as income for tax purposes example ideal scenario refinance $ 100,000 on a arm interest only at 3   invest the $ 100,000 at 6   each year you effectively pay taxes on only the gains greater than interest   if you reinvest the profits it looks something like net profit     $ effective tax rate

up to some degree a higher or lower interest rate means a bit less or a bit more money in your pocket if the interest rate gets too high you may be in trouble so you first look at the situation and ask yourself at what interest rate would i be in trouble   if this is a $ 20,000 student loan then even a very high rate would n't be trouble it would be unfortunate and unpleasant but not fatal for a $ 800,000 mortgage that 's different each percent more is $ 8,000 a year going from 3 to 10 would change the interest from $ 24,000 to $ 80,000 a year which would be fatal for many people   in a situation where you can afford increasing variable payments without problems you can go for it if your variable rate would vary over time between 4 and 6 you would still be even in that situation go for variable taking into account where you think interest rates will go in the future for a mortgage the security would likely be more important on the other hand if your dad is a multi millionaire who would help you out then that big rate increase would n't be fatal and you could go for a variable rate mortgage   in some countries you can cancel any loan contract when the interest rate is raised so raising a variable mortgage interest rate would allow you to look elsewhere without early repayment penalties check out if that is the case for you

should i pay off the credit cards now or do the monthly payments thing it need not be a binary choice you could take the middle ground assuming that an emergency fund of $ 10 15k is sufficient you could pay off one credit card and do the monthly payment for the other cards with one card cleared you may feel better i would choose to clear the card with the highest interest followed by the smallest debt first as it 's the mathematically optimum way i should also let you know that there 's this debt snowball method which is not as optimum but has some valid reasons for existing choose the optimum way if you 're financially disciplined p.s i 'm not trained financially nor am i in the industry just my two cents

context assessed project as part of a tech internship in an investment bank working in small groups task to design an app using a financial solution that has an ethical impact   we came up with what i hope is the smart sounding idea of an app for impoverished farmers in developing countries who lack the information and market access that larger or farmers would have the app would use some kind of decision tree which may grow with machine learning to assess the best kind of crops to grow given the region and local conditions for max profitability and would provide access to some kind of derivatives market and insurance allowing the farmers a consistent income   struggling with the specifics of how the business finance side of things would work let 's assume the bank builds the app and puts it on the app store as part of some charitable initiative 1 would the farmers go directly to the bank to price and purchase derivatives on their crops 2 options futures forwards which is most appropriate or would it make sense to offer all three 3 is there any way this could be adjusted to provide regular payments with a lump sum at the end would this be something the bank chooses to do or is there an existing financial instrument for this kind of setup 4 how does this tie in with the commodities markets or is that what the derivatives already are 5 probably a long shot but any chance of know your customer implementations for countries with terrible infrastructure   6 probably a dumb question say the farmer sells an option on his crops would this be sold directly to the bank or a 3rd party who 'd be more interested in actually buying the crop or is this a far too simplistic view basically who would the farmer actually deliver the crops to 7 any other issues any ideas to make this sound somewhat viable   it does n't have to strictly be realistic in any sense but it also ca n't be flat out incorrect   in advance edited to make questions clearer

i agree that the surface explanation is that expenses used to generate income are deducted however there clearly is a double standard in how is applied   for example i can not deduct my car even though i use it primarily for commuting to work i would consider that income generation yet companies are allowed to deduct corporate jets i ca n't deduct meals when i ate out with professional acquainted where much of the conversations are related to my profession and so directly relevant to my income yet businesses can claim sending their executives to a country club because business was discussed or it was a team building excise etc etc

this is a good question and you seemed troubled by this and this person 's choices in life   and that is the rub they are choices   they know how to make them they know the consequences and they know how to work around them   its a skill you probably do n't have and do n't want to have    in the end they will survive   if you go to a fast food store in a popular retirement location you will see plenty of elderly people working   they might live in low income housing receive some financial assistance and utilize other charities such a food banks   they might depend on family and friends   there is also the ugly it is not a fairy tale that some supplement their diets with pet food    there is of course social security   the amount is very low for most workers but the amount is almost inconsequential   they would spend it all anyway and still be short despite the predictability of the income and a time frame with   predictable expenses   budgeting is a skill so i have a friend that deals with this himself and is helping an relation   he and his wife provide some help but when it started there was a endless stream of requests   his policy now is   no more help unless he works out a budget with the person requesting help i 've used his ideas myself and by using this it becomes clear on who is in actual need and who is just looking for the next handout   you can feel good about yourself for helping an actual needy person or say no

the irs gets notified when you note this is not a comprehensive list as mentioned banks are required to send a ctr for any transactions over $ 10,000 they also are obligated to file a suspicious activity report for transactions deemed suspicious by bank policy these filings are primarily for law enforcement purposes the irs may or may not have access to this information the irs is n't all seeing or all knowing but in the event of an audit checks do provide a paper trail documenting the origins of your deposits so if you fail to report income from an off the books job or do not fully report self employment income deposit records could be used against you you are particularly vulnerable to this if you are in a profession where off the books transactions are routine plumbers auto repair vending machines etc at the end of the day give caesar his due and you 'll have alot less to worry about

how are derivatives like covered warrants or cfds different from the bucket shops that were made illegal in the us after reading up a little on the topic the core difference seems to be that bucket shops were basically running betting pools with everyone betting against the operator whereas cfds and similar derivatives are traded between speculators and the operator merely provides a market and checks the liquidity of participants a seems to be a different matter that i 'm not fully sure i understand at least the description of wikipedia seems to contradict your statement about not trade being performed on the underlying security should i worry that some regulator decides that my market maker is an illegal gambling operation not really nations with a mature financial industry like japan invariably have heavy regulations that mandate constant auditing of institutions that sell financial instruments in japan the financial services agency is in charge of this it 's almost impossible that they would let an institution operate and later decide that its basic business model is illegal what is possible are mainly two scenarios

if you 're looking for a purely financial answer ignoring the social environmental aspects there are a few different ways you can look at it for these types of improvements the simplest is a payback calculation   how long would it take you to recoup the initial costs    for example if the entire installation cost $ 5,000 including any tax credits and you save $ 100 per month i 'm making both numbers up you 'll pay back your investment in 50 months or about 4 years    note that if you borrow money to do the improvement then your payback period is longer because you 're reducing the amount that you 're saving each month by paying interest if you 're deciding between different uses for the money like investing or paying down other debt then you can look at the return that you 're getting   using the same example you are spending $ 5,000 and getting $ 100 per month back for a 24 annual return $ 1,200 $ 5,000 which is better than you can get on almost anything but a 401(k match meaning do n't stop your 401(k contributions to do this either the decision on whether or wait or not then becomes will the price drop faster than the amount of savings you will realize   so if you will save $ 100 per month in your electric bill is the price of the complete installation going down by more than $ 100 each month   if not you 'd be better off buying now and start paying back the investment sooner

there 's an ideological psychological aspect of this too apart from the practical problems eurozone leaders keep saying the mantra conversion to the euro is irreversible there are analogies of this in recent history it reminds me of the soviet leaders and their belief that communism is where history ends they genuinely thought that once a communist system is built up in a country it would stay forever they believed in the superiority of their system among other things this lead to the isolation of the soviet union from the west and the start of the cold war then in 1956 they were proven wrong with the hungarian revolution and while they tried to clean up the situation as fast as they could and forget about it their downhill inevitably started   back to the present you can easily see the importance of keeping greece in the ez if greece exits the illusion of the of the euro is gone and it would start to fall apart

i think the key concept here is future value   the nav is essentially a book keeping you add up all the assets and remove all the liabilities   for a public company this is spelled out in the balance sheet and is generally listed at the bottom   i pulled a recent one from cisco systems because i used to work there and know the numbers   and you can see it here roughly $ 56 billion   another way to think about it in theory and we know about this right the nav is what you would get if you liquidated the company instantaneously   a definition i like to use for market cap is the current assets plus the perceived present value of all future earnings for the company so let 's that a little   the term present value is really important because a million dollars today is worth more than a million dollars next year   a company expected to make a lot of money soon will be worth more i.e. a higher market cap than a company expected to make the same amount of money but later   the all future earnings part is exactly what it sounds like   so again following our cisco example the current market cap is billion which means that the market thinks they will earn about $ 85 billion over the life of the company in present day dollars

learn something new every day i found this interesting and thought i 'd throw my 2c in good description i hope from short selling what is short selling first let 's describe what short selling means when you purchase shares of stock in purchasing stocks you buy a piece of ownership in the company you buy sell stock to gain sell ownership of a company when an investor goes long on an investment it means that he or she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future conversely when an investor goes short he or she is anticipating a decrease in share price short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller does n't own more specifically a short sale is the sale of a security that is n't owned by the seller but that is promised to be delivered   still with us here 's the skinny when you short sell a stock your broker will lend it to you the stock will come from the brokerage 's own inventory from another one of the firm 's customers or from another brokerage firm the shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account sooner or later you must close the short by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returning them to your broker if the price drops you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference if the price of the stock rises you have to buy it back at the higher price and you lose money so what happened the plan the reality lesson i never understood what shorting a stock meant until today seems a bit risky for my blood but i would assume this is an extreme example of what can go wrong this guy literally chose the wrong time to short a stock that was in all visible aspects on the decline   how often does a large company or individual buy stock on the decline and send that stock soaring how often does a stock go up 100 in 24 hours 600   another example is recently when bought 10 of weight watchers and caused the stock to soar 105 in 24 hours you would have the day you shorted that stock on that particular day if you believed enough to gamble on it going down in price

the answer is simple you can generally claim a deduction for an expense if that expense was used to derive an income most business expenses are used to derive profits and income most individual expenses are not of course social policy sometimes gets in the way and allows for deductions where they usually would n't be allowed regarding the interest on a mortgage being deductible whilst the principal is n't that is because it is the interest which is the annual expense by the way deductions for mortgage interest in the usa for a house you live in is only allowed due to social policy as there is no income rent being produced here unlike with an investment property

disclaimer i am neither a lawyer nor a tax expert this page on the hmrc site lists several pages that appear to be relevant starting with foreign currency delayed remittances and on to foreign currency example which seems pertinent to your case paraphrased a property bought in 1983 is sold for a taxable gain in one tax year but the proceeds can not be released remitted to the uk until later by which time currency fluctuations have created a second taxable gain the size of the first gain selling the property is determined by the exchange rate in effect at the time of the sale but because of local restrictions this can be deferred   the size of the second gain currency movement is determined by the change in exchange rate between the time of the sale and the time of conversion in your case the first gain was actually a loss so i believe you should be able to use this to offset any tax due second gain   this page states that losses can be claimed up to four years after the end of the tax year in which they were incurred so you are probably still ok the example makes application under to defer the gain made on the original sale because of the inability to transfer funds but as i understand it this is primarily to avoid a tax liability in that year   since you made a loss on the sale there would n't have been a tax liability so there would be no need to defer it

what it means is that you can always come up with alternative where the difference between two options is stated as a gain or a loss but the effect is the same in either case   for instance if i offer to sell a t shirt for $ 10 and offer a cash discount of $ 1 you pay $ 10 if buying with a credit card or $ 9 if buying with cash   if i instead offer the shirt for $ 9 with a $ 1 surcharge for credit card use you still pay $ 10 if buying with a credit card or $ 9 if buying with cash   the financial result is the same in either case but psychologically people may perceive them differently and make different buying decisions in a tax situation it may be more complicated since exemptions would n't directly reduce your tax but only your taxable income   however you can still see that in general having to pay $ x more in tax for not doing some action e.g. not purchasing health insurance is the same as being able to pay $ x less in tax as a reward for doing the action   either way doing the action results in you paying $ x less than you would if you did n't do it the only difference is in which behavior doing it or not doing it is framed as the default option   again these may influence people 's behavior even when the net result is the same

it depends what area of finance but an ivy league education is not a good school probably but the best thing you can do for yourself is go through the internship program at a bank or financial institution usually after junior year but you find the occasional sophomore there are often many job offers to those that complete it well and if not you apply to other firms with your internship as your backing it would help to know what asked and know what area and what school you went to

note that the quote distinguishes between all families and families with some savings this just means there are so many families with less than 5k that they equal all those with savings above 5k that might be because they are young and have n't started yet or because it is just not a priority for them compared to food and rent nothing about the quote suggests that anyone believes once you 've saved 5k you 're done in fact since they show savings vs age you can immediately see many people still have decades to save more they may have 5k or less now but they 're not retiring now how do you survive if you get to 65 and have nothing saved there is some government money social security and many people sell their houses or get a reverse mortgage having equity in a house is not the same as having savings and some older people live very frugally they stop buying clothes they stop their houses while others live in flat out poverty but you ca n't tell if that is their future from the fact they only had 5k saved when they were 32

it is unfortunate to think that people determine as a result of paying a living wage they need to illegally undercut their employees   if your business model can not succeed by paying living wages then you need to rethink your business model     $ is not luxury   that is still close to poverty for a family of 3   take home would not afford an apartment gas food utilities etc for a single person without having roommates   people deserve to afford their basic needs without getting government assistance when working full time

that 's a of the fisher equation which is the correct way to determine real rates   however people often use the approximation real ≈ nominal inflation and if you 're doing this for homework on software that is looking for exactly 1 numerical answer they may be expecting you to use that instead   real interest rate is less formal nomenclature and refers to using the approximation   inflation adjusted return is the equation    in the real world you will use the approximation when you 're figuring out a real rate while you 're talking mid sentence during a meeting and use the equation in spreadsheets calculations

the government wants money and is n't particularly interested in you getting your deductions right doing the worksheet on the back of the w-4 will give you a much better idea of how many deductions you can take while many people are excited to get a tax refund a refund means you loaned the government money all year long without getting paid interest for your generosity the irs will penalize you for underpaying your taxes in amounts larger than $ 1000 or 10 of your income but a good ballpark estimate aiming for about ~$100 in payment at tax time is a relatively safe way to get all your money sooner than later

tl;dr because stocks represent added value from corporate profits and not the price the goods themselves are sold at this is actually a very complicated subject   but here 's the simplest answer i can come up with   stocks are a commodity just like milk eggs and bread   the government only tracks certain commodities consumables as part of the consumer price index cpi   these are generally commodities that the typical person will consume on a daily or weekly basis or need to survive food rent etc   these are present values stock prices on the other hand represent an educated guess or bet on a company 's future performance   if apple has historically performed well and analysts expect it to continue to perform then investors will pay more for a stock that they feel will continue pay good dividends in the future   compound this with the fact that there is usually limited a supply of stock for a particular company unless they issue more stock if we go back to apple as an example they can raise their price they charge on an iphone from $ 400 to $ 450 over the course of say a couple years   some of this may be due to higher wage costs but efficiencies in the marketplace actually tend to drive down costs to produce goods so they will probably actually turn a higher profit by raising their price even if they have to pay higher wages or possibly even if they do n't raise their price   this in economics is termed value added finally is absolutely correct in his comment about the stocks in the s&p 500 not being static   additionally the s&p 500 is a hand picked set of winners if you will   these are not run of the mill penny stocks for companies that will be out of business in a week   these are companies that standard poor 's financial services llc thinks will perform well

the companies which define the major indexes do not derive profit directly from the indexes they are typically brokerages which use the indexes as a tool for discussing investment options with their clients and as a publicity tool to remind the public that they are long standing respected firms whom we might want to consider working with ca n't mention the dow without being reminded of dow jones for example likewise the standard poor 's 500 reminds us that s&p is still going strong there may also be some slight market manipulation opportunities in choosing which specific stocks are included in each index but since investors rarely follow an index exactly as originally defined i 'm not convinced that 's significant and the mix included in each index changes relatively rarely and has to be justified by what the index claims to be representing

intellectually and logically it should n't bother me for a second to charge something for a buck   it 's a losing proposition for the merchant but their immediate business costs should be of little concern to me   they 're making a choice to sell that item to me at that price and by accepting that means of payment right   but the more i charge as opposed to paying cash the more cash back i get in my old ish age i 've gotten a little and will pay cash more often for smaller amounts because i understand the business costs but it 's not a matter of caring what other people think accepting credit cards or not is a business decision   it 's usually a good one   but with that decision come the rules which up until about a year ago meant that merchants could n't set a minimum charge amount   now that 's not the case merchant account providers can no longer demand that their merchant clients accept all charges though they are allowed to set a minimum amount that is no lower than $ 10.00 in the end it 's a matter of how much you 're willing to pay in order to influence people 's thinking of you because the business financial benefits of doing one or the other are pretty clear

i 'm not a financial expert in my opinion it might be best to have as much in savings aka being liquid and the funds are insured by the fdic as possible for a couple of reasons if you lose your job your equity line could then get frozen if the bank finds out what you want to avoid is only owing 20 grand on your home because you paid a chunk off with your savings but because you lost your job you ca n't take any money out of your home and suddenly you are equity rich cash poor and jobless that is a potential for big trouble i 'm curious why you borrowed on the heloc since you seem to have a significant amount in savings anyways what you really might want to look into is lowering your mortgage interest rate to around 3.5    i would use the credit card debt as a reality check make sure every month you are making at least a 10 to 15 of the total due payment this dilutes the interest rate charge and lets you see the true drag credit card debt payments really have on your life    i do n't know this for sure but the higher amount credit card payments you make probably reflects well on your credit score and of course never be late with the credit card payments either

as @dilip suggested in the comments the problem is the accountability of the reimbursement plans in order for the reimbursement to be non taxable there has to be a reimbursement plan and policy set up by the employer it has to be done per receipt and accounted for correctly if the employer just cuts you a check the conditions may not be met and as such the reimbursement becomes taxable in your case it seems like the employer has not set up a proper accountable reimbursement plan thus your reimbursements are taxable pointed out that since the employer also does n't withhold taxes as he should you may have an unexpected tax bill on april 15 this article describes the distinction between the accountable and non accountable plans only with the accountable plans the reimbursements are non taxable

most people will never need to pay federal gift taxes the federal gift taxes start after giving away million over the course of your life this number is adjusted annually for inflation there are only two states that i know of which impose state gift taxes connecticut and minnesota in connecticut you need to start paying taxes if the lifetime value of your gifts exceed two million in minnesota it starts at 1 million   the federal tax is paid for by the person making the gift unless other arrangements are made there is an annual exclusion amount of approximately $ 14,000 you can give up to this amount to any number of recipients and it is not considered taxable therefore when you give $ 100 to someone it is not a taxable event   if you do make a gift to an individual in excess of 14k you 'll need to file a gift tax return irs form 709 when you file form 709 you wo n't need to pay taxes until the million is exceeded instead you can claim an exemption since most people do n't exceed that amount its rare to ever pay taxes even when exceeding the annual exclusion amount the annual exclusion amount is adjusted each year for inflation

correct by putting expenses on to a credit card which does not charge interest during the grace period and paying that balance every month in effect you earn interest on money you 've already spent however first savings account interest is something like .05 right now depending on your bank yeah it 's money but seriously that 's 4 cents per month on $ 1000   second two things can make this very wrong if you carry a balance you 'll pay much more in interest than you 'd get from practically any investment you could make with the cash in the meantime second a debit card can be used to get cash you already have from an atm not everyone takes credit you know and it 'll cost you little or nothing use a credit card for the same purpose and you 're paying 40 from the second the money comes out of the machine also correct rewards cards earn you more the more they 're used that 's because the card issuer makes money based on usage they get 3 of each transaction they 're happy to turn 1 of that up to a limit or subject to a spending floor back around to you again check the terms and conditions most cards have a limit on total rewards many of them also have fees either while you hold the card or when you try to redeem the rewards look for a card with high limits or no limits on rewards from spending and with no annual fee or reward redemption fee in addition to the above you build good credit history with good spending patterns however your credit score can fluctuate wildly because on one day you have very low leverage percent of credit limit used and on the next you 've bought $ 200 in groceries and so your leverage went up 20 on a card with a $ 1000 limit leverage under 10 is good leverage under 40 is ok and leverage over that starts looking bad with a $ 1000 limit with you maxing it out and then paying it off your credit score can fluctuate by 30 points on any given day

it 's already gone through a big correction but another crash is a possibility but if the us economy keeps eroding it 's going to become more of a safe haven also goldman sachs sees it as an investment option so that 's a sign financial houses are interested and not a good sign for the dollar

it 's not just u and dems that dislike rauner any politically conscious moderate understands that both madigan and rauner are to blame madigan 's leadership in reckless spending has helped produce a massive deficit but rauner 's my way or the highway attitude has been far more damaging to the state and is the primary root cause of the current now years long budget

in a taxable account you 're going to owe taxes when you sell the shares for a gain you 're also going to owe taxes on any distributions you receive from the holdings in the account these distributions can happen one or more times a year vanguard has a writeup on mutual fund taxation   note for a fund like you linked you will owe taxes annually regardless of whether you sell it the underlying assets will pay dividends and those are distributed to you either in cash or more as additional shares of the mutual fund look into dividend reinvestment taking vfiax 's distributions as an example if you bought 1 share of the fund on march 19 2017 on march 20th you would have been given $ that would be taxable you 'd owe taxes on that even if you did n't sell your share during the year your last paragraph is based on a false premise the mutual fund does report to you at the end of the year the short and long term capital gains along with dividends on a 1099-div you get to pay taxes on those transactions that 's why it 's advantageous to hold low turnover mutual funds in taxable accounts

if the savings rate is the same as the loan rate mathematically it does n't make any difference whether you pay down the loan more and save less or vice versa however if the loan rate is higher than the savings rate it 's better to pay it down as fast as possible the chart below compares paying down the loan and saving equally the gradual scenario versus paying down the loan quickly at 2 x $ and then saving 2 x $   the savings rate for illustration is 2 paying quickly pays down the loan completely by month 51   on the other hand in the gradual scheme the loan ca n't be paid down with the savings until month 54 which then leaves 3 months less for saving   in conclusion it 's better to pay down the higher rate loan first   practically speaking it may be useful to have some savings available

we 're in agreement i just want retail investors to understand that in most of these types of discussions the reality is the retail sector trading the market is this includes the mutual funds you mentioned and even most index funds most are so narrowly focused they lose their relevance for the retail investor   in the retail investment markets i 'm familiar with there are market makers of some sort or another for specified ranges i 'm perfectly fine with no market makers but retail investors should be told the naked truth as well and not sold a bunch of come ons what upsets me is seeing that just as computers really start to make an orderly market possible you are right the classic nyse specialist structure was outrageously corrupt regulators turned a blind eye to implementing better controls for retail investors   the financial services industry has to come to terms whether they want aum from retail or not and having heard messaging much like yours from other professionals i 've concluded that the industry does not want the constraints with accepting those funds but neither do they want to retail investors of how tilted the game is against them them in with marketing and then taking money from those naturally ill prepared for the of the setting is like beating up the downs syndrome kid on the short bus and about it back on the campus about how clever and strong one is if there was as stringent truth in marketing in financial services as cigarettes like this service makes their profit by encouraging the churning of trades there would be a lot of from so called pros as well if all retail financial services were described like dead cold cow meat describes steak a lot of retail investors would be better off as it stands today you 'd have to mighty hard to see the caveat emptor on financial services offerings to the retail sector   note that depending upon the market setting the definition of retail differs i 'm surprised the herd has n't been spooked more by the mf global disaster for example and yet there are some surprisingly large accounts affected by that incident which in a conventional equities setting would be considered pros

i rather like the of money by this comes in several formats there 's a video version a written version and an audio version this book covers the history of financial instruments it covers the rise of money the history of bonds and stocks insurance and hedge funds real estate and the spread of finance across the world it is a great introduction to finance though its focus is very definitely on the history it does not cover more advanced topics and will not leave you with any sort of financial plan but it 's a great way to get a broad overview and historical understanding of money and markets i strongly recommend both the video and the written or audio version

yes especially if you are a value investor the importance and relevance of financial statements depends on the company imo the statements of a troubled too big to fail bank like citibank or bank of america are meaningless in other industries the statements will help you distinguish the best performers if you understand the industry a great retail example was bed bath and beyond vs. linens and things externally the stores appeared identical they carried the same product and even offered the same discounts looking at the books would have revealed that linens and things carried an enormous amount of debt that fueled rapid growth debt that killed the company

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

make money disappear from the economy   but those taxes are used to pay for labor in most cases   the state workers that fix the roads are paid with tax money as are all the supplies and equipment for example   i think i understand the debt bit if i buy a house and default on it that money is gone but the house remains to be sold by the bank later   only the interest is really missing right

drugs and medicine in general are most certainly not inelastic    there is competition from less expensive and unfortunately nothing   there is always an optimum price as long as there is a marketplace   if we want cheaper drugs then we ought to reform patents in a real sense and lower barriers to competition   medical companies are obviously lowering their ethical safeguards for selling drugs cheap when they do n't have to so that ca n't be relied upon anymore
