i and probably most considering trading had a similar thought as you   i thought if i just skimmed the peaks and sold before the perhaps aided by computer i 'd be able to make a 2 here 2 there and that would add up quickly to a nice amount of money   it almost did seem foolproof then i realized that sometimes a stock just slides down and there is no peak higher than what i bought it for   that 's ok i 'd think i 'm sure it will recover and surpass the price i bought it for so now i play the waiting game   but then it continues sliding and my $ 10k is now worth $ 7k   do i sell   did i build a stop loss point into my computer program   if so what is the right place to put that stop   what if there is a freak dip down and it triggers the stop loss but then my stock recovers   i just lost $ 14,000 like this last week luckily only virtually the point is your idea only has half a chance to work when there is a mildly volatile stock that stays around some stable baseline and even then it is not easy   and then you factor in fees as others mentioned people do make money doing this day traders and some claim you can use technical analysis to time orders well so if you want to try that read about technical analysis on this site or elsewhere

there are many ways to trade rules based trading is practiced by professionals you can indeed create a rule set to make buy and sell decisions based on the price action of your chosen security i will direct you to a good website to further your study i have found that is a well written blog informative and not just a big sales pitch you will see how to develop and evaluate trading systems if you decide to venture down this path a good book to read is charles wright 's trading as a business it will get a little technical as it discusses how to develop trading systems using the trading platform which is a very powerful tool for advanced traders and comes with a significant monthly usage fee but you do n't have to have to understand these concepts and with an intermediate level of spreadsheet skills you can run your own backtests   here is a trading system example larry 2 period rsi system see how it is evaluated and this video teaches a bit more about this particular trading system important this is not a recommendation to use this or any specific trading system nor is it a suggestion that using these tools or websites is a path to guaranteed profits trading is a very risky endeavor you can easily lose huge sums of money good luck

the main reason i 'm aware of that very few individuals do this sort of trading is that you 're not taking into account the transaction costs which can and will be considerable for a small time investor say your transaction costs you $ 12 that means in order to come out ahead you 'll have to have a fairly large position in a given instrument to make that fee back and some money most smaller investors would n't really want to tie up 5 6 figures for a day on the chance that you 'll get $ 100 back the economics change for investment firms especially market makers that get special low fees for being a market maker ie offering liquidity by quoting all the time

okay so i am going to break this answer into a couple sections okay so first things first did you get a good deal this is challenging to answer for a number of reasons first a good deal is relative to the buyers goals if you 're attempting to buy an asset that provides passive income then maybe you met your goal and got a good deal if you 're attempting to buy an asset that provides long term growth and you purchased above market i 'm speculating of course then you may have made a bad deal so how do you determine if you got a good deal does your gross rental multiplier equal that or is less than that of the average in your area the lower the better   so how do you use the to determine if you 're getting a good deal divide your purchase price by the average city or area and that will tell you what you should be getting annually in rent   you can also use the to determine if a future purchase is over or under priced just replace purchase price with asking price   alright so these are the tools you can use to decide if you made a bad business deal or not there are many ways to skin a cat so to speak these are the tools i use before i purchase a home many people are penny wise and pound foolish take your time when making large purchases it 's okay to say pass   okay next thing is this new purchase you 're looking at the number one rule when working a franchise is you do n't open a second store until you have a perfect working model to go off of if you 've never had to file a tax return for your current rental then you need to wait if you 've never read your local and state rental laws then you need to wait if you 've never had to leave an event early wake up in the middle of the night or get a text while you 're on a date from one of your tenants then you need to wait give it a year or two just learn the unknown about rental properties use your first as your test bed it 's way more cheaper then if you make a bad mistake and roll it over multiple properties   finally i will leave you with this no one on this site myself included knows everything there is to know about real estate anyone that claims they do send their ass packing this is a complex complex business there is always something to learn and if you do n't have the passion to continue learning then hand it off to someone who does there is tax law rental law city repair law contract law and this does n't even include the stuff that makes you money like knowing how to leverage low or no money down loans   please take some time and go out and learn   good luck

try using technical analysis look at the charts and look for stocks that are uptrending the of an uptrend being higher highs and higher lows use a stochastic indicator and buy on the dips down when the stochastic is in the oversold position below 20 and and crossing over about to turn back upwards or you can also use the stochastic to trade shares that have been ranging between two prices say between $ 10 and $ 12 for a while as the price approaches the $ 10 support and the stochastic is in oversold you would buy as the price rebounds off the $ 10 support and the stochastic crosses and starts back up as the price starts reaching the resistance at $ 12 with in overbought at above 80 you would look to sell and take profits if you were able to do short selling in the competition you could short sell at this point in time and make profits on the way up as well as on the way down there are many more techniques you could use to set up trade opportunities using technical analysis so it may be a subject you could research further before the begins good luck

first off i 'm very sorry for your loss   depending on when the money comes in i would park it and give it some time   after that one of the best investments is paying off debt   right now your net worth is less than 30 k and that is really not even accessible until retirement   if the money is there to pay off the house i would do that   if there is n't enough to pay off the house then i would pay off the automobile and put all or a sizable portion of the remainder into the house   now you have very little risk in your life and most likely much more monthly income to invest in 401 k iras college funds or any other investment life insurance is mostly to replace your income if there are people counting on that income spouse kids etc   normally this would be invested to hopefully replace that income with the growth of the money   in your case it does n't sound like you were relying on your father 's income so this can go to clean up current debt finally depending on your relationship what kind of person your father was and how he was with financials what do you think he would want you to do with it

if you have a single member llc that is treated as a disregarded entity i.e. you did n't elect to be taxed as a corporation and that llc had no activity you 're off the hook for federal reporting the llc 's activity would normally be reported on your personal tax return on a schedule c. if the llc had under $ 400 in taxable earnings no schedule c is needed so an inactive llc does not have a tax reporting requirement if you had taxable income but under $ 400 you include that amount on your 1040 but do n't need a schedule c. in texas you still must file a texas franchise tax report every year even for a single member llc with no activity

lets consider what would happen if you invested $ plus $ 10k down in a property or did the same in a low cost index fund over the 30 year term that most mortgages take   the returns of either scenarios can not be guaranteed but there are long term analyses that shows the stock market can be expected to return about 7 compounded yearly this does n't mean each year will return 7 some years will be negative and some will be much higher but that over a long span the average will reach 7   using a time value of money calculator that down payment monthly additions of $ 1,500 and a 7 annual return would be worth about $ 1.8 m in 30 years if 1.8 m were invested you could safely withdraw $ for the rest of your life do consider of inflation makes this less than today 's dollar   there are long term analyses that show real estate more or less keeps track with inflation at 2 4 annual returns this does n't consider real estate taxes maintenance insurance and the very individual and localized issues with your market and your particular house is land limited where you are increasing your price will new development drive down your price   in 30 years you 'll own the house outright you 'll still need to pay property tax and insurance on it and you 'll be getting rental income over those 30 years you can expect to replace a roof 2 3 hot water heaters concrete work several trees decades of snow shoveling mowing grass and weeding your hvac system windows and doors and probably a kitchen and bathroom you will have paid about 1.5x the initial price of the mortgage in interest along the way   so you 'll have whatever the rental price for your house monthly probably almost impossible to predict for a single family home plus the market price of your house again very difficult to predict but could safely say it keeps pace with inflation minus your expenses   there are scenarios where you could beat the stock market there are ways to reduce the lifestyle burden of being a landlord   along the way should you want to purchase a house for yourself to live in you 'll have to prove the rental income is steady to qualify for a loan having equity in a mortgage gives you something to borrow against in a heloc of course you could easily end up owing more than your house is worth in that situation   personally i 'd stick to investing that money in low fee index funds

if you are just trying to curb impulse spending i 'd suggest the following   1 set up a separate bank account for your savings do not order checks or a debit card for this account 2 get your employer to split your paycheck to put the saving amount in the new account most employers will do this the trick to avoid impulse spending is to make it a chore to get at the money with the above arrangement you would have to physically go to the bank fill out a withdrawal slip and get cash this way you still can access the money in an emergency but it forces you to plan things out better

the crucial question not addressed by other answers is your ability to repay the debt    borrowing is always about leverage and leverage is always about risk   in the home improvement loan case default comes with dire to extinguish the debt you might have to sell your home with a stable job reliable income and sufficient cash flow and of course comfort that the project will yield benefits you 're happy to pay for then the clear answer is go ahead and borrow but if you work in a highly cyclical industry have very little cash saved or for whatever other reason are uncertain about your future ability to pay then do n't borrow   save until you are more comfortable you can handle the loan   that does n't necessarily mean save all the money just save enough that you are highly confident in your ability to pay whatever you borrow

the answer to this question requires looking at the mathematics of the qualified dividends and capital gains worksheet start with taxable income which is the number that appears on line 43 of form 1040   this is after the adjusted gross income has been reduced by the standard deduction or itemized deductions as the case may be as well as the exemptions claimed    then subtract off the qualified dividends and the net long term capital gains reduced by net short term   capital losses if any to get the non cap gains part of the taxable income assigning somewhat different meanings to the numbers in the ops question let 's say that the taxable income is $ 74 k of which $ 10 k is long term capital gains leaving $ 64 k as the the non cap gains taxable income on line 7 of the    since $ 64 k is smaller than $ k not $ k as stated by the op and this is a return $ k $ 64 k = $ 8.5 k of the long term capital gains are taxed at 0 the balance $ 1.5 k is taxed at 15 giving $ 225 as the tax due on that part    the 64 k of non cap gains taxable income has a tax of $ if i am reading the tax tables correctly and so the total tax due is $ + 225 = $   this is as it should be the non gains income of $ 64 k was assessed the tax due on it $ 8.5 k of the cap gains were taxed at 0 and $ 1.5 k at 15 there are more complications to be worked out on the for high earners who attract the 20 capital gains rate but those are not relevant here

the problem is you are trying to qualify for a loan that has a 25 down payment using money you do n't have which defeats the purpose of having a down payment the best thing to do is have your parents buy the house for you you then rent the house from them where your rent is equal to the mortgage + x. your parents then put x into savings account for you and then once you have 25 in that account they gift it to you and you purchase the house from them using that 25 as the downpayment for the mortgage

the difference would be taxes   lets say you have two lots one with a 10 dollar gain and one with a 20 dollar gain   and lets say you decide to sell one lot this year and the other lot in 10 years   and lets say that it turns out the stock price is exactly the same in ten years as it is when you sell the first lot in all likelyhood you 'll have more income and therefore you are likely to be in a different marginal tax rate   if you believe that you 're more likely to pay more taxes in 10 years then sell the lot with the higher gain now   if you believe you 're more likely to pay more taxes now then sell the lot with the lower gain now

the long and short of it is the mortgage company has a significant interest in the resale value of the home in the event of a default   imagine a scenario where you say to yourselves that you 're not going to repair the deck just yet meh we 'll do that next summer and something happens that causes a default on the mortgage the resale value of the home may be harmed by the deck even though you 're willing to live with it   that being the case the mortgage company has every right to insist that you carry out the repairs in order to maintain the property in salable condition so the essence of it is you do n't have much choice but to do the repairs keep in mind too that the insurance company paid for the roof and the deck to be repaired   if they were to learn that you now have no intention of using the money to repair the property you could end up in legal hot water with them   after all you did accept the check for repairs that you 're now not carrying out

people treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace in the hole when it comes to financial difficulty but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize what is an emergency first you have to define what an emergency is   is it a lost job   is it an unplanned event pregnancy perhaps   is it a medical emergency   is it the death of you or your spouse also what does it mean to be unplanned   is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency   is one month of planning an emergency   two only you can answer these questions for yourself but they significantly shape your financial strategy   planning is highly dependent on your cashflow and for some people it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work   for others they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month also you have to consider the length of the emergency   job loss is rarely permanent but it 's rarely short as well   the current average is weeks that 's 7 months money in an emergency there are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency a good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account   some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other   however some of these are correlated for example in 2008 three things happened   the stock market crashed unsecured debt dried up and people faced financial emergency lost jobs cut wages   if you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit you 'd be up a creek because the value of your investments suddenly decreased and you ca n't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit however if you had a one or more of cash savings unemployment income and unemployment insurance you would probably have been ok budgeting for an emergency when you say financial emergency most people think job loss   however the most common cause of bankruptcy in the us is medical debt   depending on your insurance situation this could be a serious risk or it may not be    people say you should have of your monthly income in savings because it 's an easy back of the envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk but it 's not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you to properly budget for an emergency you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency generally having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk mitigation strategy   but it 's not a panacea for every kind of emergency

i have several as well acquired the same way as you and i am happy with the idea   they are very stable and that is the reason they pay so little   i do n't think you can get a low risk and medium or high return   the interest does reset every six months so you do get a bit of the market should the fed set interest rates higher you bonds will eventually reflect that bonds and certificates of deposit are just one element of your investment portfolio   put the money you ca n't lose into bonds the money you can into higher risk stocks bonds are great from our grandparent 's perspective because they are not going to lose value my grandparents were depression era folks who wanted that stability   they are trivial to give as gifts   most other investment forms require a heavy bit more of legal work i would think

it depends on where you live and how you can think out of the box on earning little extra income on the side if   you live in north america and based on the needs in your city you can try out these ideas here is what one of my friend has done   the family has two kids and the wife started a home day care as she was already taking care of two kids anyways of course she had to be qualified and she took the relevant child care classes and got certified which took six months and she is managing 4 kids in addition to her two kids bringing in at least 2000 $ per month in addition and my friend started a part time property management business on the side with one client for example there is always work on real estate whether its going up or going down you have to be involved locally to increase your knowledge on real estate you can be a property manager for local real estate investors if its going down you can get involved in helping people sell and buy real estate be a connector bring the buyers and sellers together

whenever i 'm looking at whether i can afford a new fixed monthly cost i go over my account statement for the last three months or last three normal months in the event that there has been something unusual recently and list the items into four columns on an excel sheet   fixed essentials costs that happen every month and that have to happen stuff like rent utility bills insurance any loans or credit cards etc fixed niceties costs that happen every month but that i could cut if i needed to stuff like netflix spotify etc variable essentials costs that i incur on an basis but are essential i 'm talking things like food fuel etc variable niceties costs that i incur on an basis but could be cut if required things like buying dvds or games etc i sum up the essentials columns and divide by three to get a rough monthly average this is what i have to spend so i subtract this from my monthly income which tells me what i really have available to spend in any given month performing the same sum and divide by three operation on the niceties and subtracting that from my available to spend figure tells me what i have left on in an average month if this is greater than the new monthly cost i 'm considering allowing for some reasonable buffer as well you do n't want to be running to zero each month then i can afford the new cost and then i just have to weigh up whether i think it 's worth it or whether i 'd rather use that for something else if it 's not sufficient and i really want need whatever the new cost is then i can start looking at the fixed and variable niceties to see if i can make savings there if after trimming the niceties where i can i still ca n't afford it but still really want need it then i 'll start looking at the essentials to see if there are ways to reduce them through switching utility supplier or changing my shopping eating habits etc

last week barack obama went to kansas to kick off a more populist phase in his 2012 re election bid this is a make or break moment for the middle class declared the us president who chose the same venue that roosevelt used in 1910 to call for a new progressive era i believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot   saying everyone should get a fair shot always makes political sense particularly at a time when us income inequality rivals that of mark ’s age but it might have been a stretch for mr obama to suggest the american middle class is facing a unique make or break moment in reality the labour force has been for most of the past generation in a trend that has sharply accelerated since 2000   america used to be exceptional it maintained lower unemployment than the europeans and a higher rate of jobs turnover enabling it to get away with more benefits a fair day ’s work for a fair day ’s pay was within the grasp of most that gave america a booming middle class that until recently was the most important engine of global demand   no longer today somewhat remarkably us is higher than in much of europe and the us consumer is mired in high personal debt as the jobs crisis so too does us political allegations of class warfare are a staple of washington debate in contrast to the 1960s dominated by protests for peace and civil rights today ’s battles are economic yet there are few signs that either policymakers or economists are closer to finding answers nothing mr obama has been able to accomplish since 2008 including off a second great depression and pushing through an overhaul of the healthcare system appears to have resolved that underlying structural challenge indeed the signs are that the problem is in the words of david a leading labour economist at harvard university the labour force is suffering from a growing missing middle   in short the middle skilled jobs that once formed the of the world ’s wealthiest middle class are disappearing they are being supplanted by relatively low skilled and low paid jobs that can not be replaced either by new technology or by offshoring such as home nursing and landscape gardening jobs are also being created for the highly skilled notably in science engineering and management for the remainder of the workforce including college graduates it is both increasingly hard to find a secure job and tougher for those who do find jobs to be paid in line with inflation most people know that median us income has declined sharply since the late 1990s fewer are aware that real incomes also fell sharply in the same period for those with degrees only those with qualifications particularly phds saw net gains for some spectacular   the jobs crisis has many worrying of which three are worth highlighting perhaps the most troublesome is the waning of the market people used to describe the us labour market as after the austrian economist who depicted the cycle of creative destruction jobs might be lost rapidly in a downturn but were swiftly to more productive sectors when economic growth that is not now the case

i think the answer depends very much on where you are   i believe the other answer covers north america on contrast in continental europe giving the account and bank number iban and bic is a the most common way to enable someone to send money to you   e.g. in germany you need much more than account number and bank number to withdraw money   to push money to another account wire transfer from your account to someone who gave you the other account + bank numbers you either have to hand sign a certain form or online certain credentials e.g. login password pin + tan are needed i.e. for defrauding you the other would need to get your online credentials for also your mobile phone for a tan generator of your bank easy and your bank card for your tan list or fake your signature there are also ways to allow someone to pull money from your account see e.g. direct debit for that you sign that the other side is allowed to withdraw specified amounts of money at specified dates this is either   between you and the other i.e. your bank can not check and does n't reject withdrawals that are not authorized however the other side needs to have signed a contract with their bank that they 'll only try to withdraw money they 're entitled to   or you sign such a thing with your bank then they do know whether the other side is allowed to withdraw money and you can tell the bank that you wo n't accept any further withdrawals from xyz   in the first case the withdrawal technically still needs your approval in order not to create a huge risk of fraud the rejecting here is really easy   if you tell your bank that you reject the payment   the practical rule is that the payment is approved if you did n't reject within the first 6 weeks after the bank sent the account statement in other words until 4 1/2 months after the withdrawal in case you have a bank that does only quarterly account statements the one to get the money can not be really sure that he actually has the money i think but i 'm not completely sure maybe someone else can comment edit that these two possibilities are also what is used with debit card payments ec card these are much more common here than real credit card payments   end of germany specific example

after the initial public offering the company can raise money by selling more stock equity financing or selling debt e.g. borrowing money   if a company 's stock price is high they can raise money with equity financing on more favorable terms   when companies raise money with equity financing they create new shares and dilute the existing shareholders so the number of shares outstanding is not fixed companies can also return money to shareholders by buying their own equity and this is called a share repurchase   it 's best for companies to repurchase their shared when their stock price is low but american companies have a terrible track record of buying their own shares high and selling them low the management of a company typically likes a rising stock price so their stock options are more valuable and they can justify bigger pay packages

while paying off your debt quickly is obviously desirable it is simply not going to be possible even with tight budgeting i think you will struggle to put more than £ 500 or so per month towards your debt i would keep trying to move the highest interest debt onto something cheaper be it a loan a balance transfer credit card etc   it is also worth looking at your current credit cards more carefully sometimes you may be able to get a balance transfer deal on an existing card by talking to the card issuer then shuffle your debt around to take advantage of it some think it 's taboo but in your position i would also be seriously considering if you have any friends and family who can lend you money at a less crippling interest rate

you do n't have to think it is going down it is currently trending down as on a weekly chart there are lower lows and lower highs until there is a higher low with confirmation of a higher high the downtrend will continue   the instrument you use to profit from a market drop depends on your risk profile the time frame you are looking at and your trading plan and risk management with a put option your loss is limited to your initial premium and your potential profits can be quite large compared to the premium paid however your timeframe is limited to the expiry of the option you could buy a longer dated option but this will cost more in the premium you pay with inverse etf you are not restricted by an expiry date but if you do n't have appropriate risk management in place your potential losses can be large with a leveraged inverse etf again you are not restricted by an expiry date you can potentially make higher percentage profits than with an standard etf but once again your losses can be very large larger than you initial investment if you do n't have appropriate risk management in place

yes i think you will be able to withdraw from your 401(k without penalty normally you need to be age 59½ before you can withdraw without incurring a 10 penalty   however an exception to this rule is described in an irs 401(k resource guide exceptions the 10 tax will not apply if distributions before age 59½ are made in any of the following circumstances what this means is that if you leave the company that you have the 401(k with in the calendar year that you turn 55 or later you can take early distributions from the 401(k without penalty   this year is the year that you turn 55 so it appears that you are eligible for early distributions under this rule

accrued interest generally means interest that is earned but not received   this is the interest that is added on top of the amount that was originally agreed upon because your friend missed some months she will have gained 3 interest on top of the original loan amount for every month that she did n't pay   the interest even applies to the increased loan amount so it will increase exponentially for every month that she does not make a payment   for example if the loan amount was for $ 1,000 and she missed the payment the first month the 3 accrued interest will raise that loan amount to $   if she misses the second month then the loan amount will become $ and so on this means that it will take her more months to pay the loan in its entirety arrears are the overdue payments that she had not made so the sentence with payments paying the arrears before being applied to the current month 's payment means that she must pay the overdue debt from the previous months first before she can even make the payment for the current month

we considered similar big renovations when putting our house on the market the answer turns out to be pretty simple unless you do renovation type work as your day job or have really good friends in the residential contracting business sell as is you will virtually never get back the full price of bringing in a gen con to renovate any space in your home you do that when you want to spend the extra to make your home exactly what you wanted so you can live in it for decades and get the enjoyment out of it if you 're trying to turn a profit with the renovation like house flippers do professionally you look for easy repairs buy good looking but inexpensive materials and do the labor yourself whether you sell to the market or to a specifically interested buyer is your call but i will caution you that a specifically interested buyer is going to be looking for a deal or a steal   when marketing our house we met with three different realtors the first one was very about what we could list for basically assuming that we could get the same price as a fully upgraded version of our same floor plan with a pool out back she also had a to do list a mile long and my wife and i both noticed that she looked very apprehensive about the house when looking around even as she us that selling it would be no trouble we eventually realized why she was so apprehensive and fired her before we got even halfway through her to dos which included major landscaping new kitchen floors and etc which would have cost us thousands and would not have gotten the house price even close to the target the second one took a look at our half finished and told us to stop everything we were doing to update the minor stuff like paint and fixtures saying we were putting on a pig she would market the house to some cash buyers she knew personally for about 80 of the list price our first realtor quoted and implied that we should be kissing her boots for finding us a buyer willing to take the house off our hands at all during the tour she pointed out problems with the house that were n't even there like foundation issues such as sloping floors in an attempt to scare us into going with her strategy we that out pretty quickly showed her the door at the end of the initial consult and never called back this by the way is the kind of thing you want to avoid unless your home is really dilapidated or torn apart with unfinished major it should have decent value on the market and you should n't have to resort to a cash buyer looking for a flip or a rental property on the cheap just like our third choice was just right he saw all the same comparables our house and recommended that we offer about $ 20k less than the fully upgraded version but still about $ 20k more than the second realtor was estimating targeting a real buyer and not an investor or flipper but at a price that would make the lack of upgrades more acceptable we finished the paint and finish projects we started brought in a weekend 's worth of scheduled and our house was under contract for full price within 3 days giving us the extra $ 20k worth of down payment to put into our new house in summary i highly recommend a realtor because the one we eventually listed with worked his butt off on the business side while we fixed up the house however make sure you find the right one realtors are ultimately in business for themselves and their ultimate interest is in getting your house sold and getting you into a new one that is what gets them paid some of them will do it the right way working the deal with other realtors and their prospective buyers to get you what you need others will take the easy way out at your expense either giving you bad advice about how to present and price your home so that you end up on the market for 6 months with no offers or handing your house to their business buddies at a discount

i 'm surprised by all these complicated answers yes @victor you can create a form that asks people to put down their financial information but you want to be careful and not put off potential tenants by asking for too many details depending on the op 's typical tenants an extensive background and credit check may not be necessary for example if i have proof that someone is a graduate student at the local university that 's usually good enough for me because i am willing to bet that they will follow my contract   bidding war does n't sound doable you advertise a price correct you can only be down not up   so my suggestion is to look at other rental advertisements in the area compare what you 're offering location quality of house cleanliness amenities etc to the competition and price accordingly if you 're getting a flood of interest then you 're probably pricing below the average price in your area or you live in an area where demand is just much higher than supply in which case you can also raise your rent

are you kidding   electric cars can be faster than gasoline powered cars    but do you know what the real advantage is   car design is limited by having a big heavy engine and transmission   plus you have to put the gas tank somewhere safe   electric cars do away with all that   it will dramatically change handling and building a safety cage   electric cars will completely outperform gasoline cars   no question   also the electric cars should have many fewer parts and be more reliable   the future is electric   and you ’ll love it

i used to work as a sale support for one of these companies as a sale support i did n't get commission from the sale but a sale manager did and he made good money however i ended up doing a lot of the sales myself and never got any commission for it even though the boss kept promising me that i would get them it 's relatively easy money but i felt like you have to sell your soul a little it 's hard to justify for yourself that a 30 interest for a 6 month term is a great deal so you can get your guests to take the loan most of the clients you will likely get are the ones who 1 have little knowledge about finance and/or 2 can not get a loan anywhere else nobody would get a loan with these companies if they have a better choice i also found it was borderline harassment for my clients because i was forced to constantly call them few times a day to get them into taking our loan offers i did end up leaving the company after three months because the boss was and thought he could do it all himself   back to your question it is not shady mostly because it 's definitely legal but the sales tactics can be that would depend on your management but i would say most companies probably employs similar tactics

in a traditional ira contributions are often tax deductible for instance if a taxpayer contributes $ 4,000 to a traditional ira and is in the twenty five percent marginal tax bracket then a $ 1,000 benefit $ 1,000 reduced tax liability will be realized for the year so that 's why they tax you as income because they did n't tax that income before if a taxpayer expects to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than during the working years then this is one advantage for using a traditional ira vs a roth distributions are taxed as ordinary income so it depends on your tax bracket   update for comment currently you may have heard on the news about the fiscal cliff cnbc at the end of the year this is due to the fact that the bush tax cuts are set to expire and if they expire many tax rates will change but here is the info as of right now dividends from 2003 to 2007 qualified dividends were taxed at 15 or 5 depending on the individual 's ordinary income tax bracket and from 2008 to 2012 the tax rate on qualified dividends was reduced to 0 for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 ordinary income tax brackets after 2012 dividends will be taxed at the taxpayer 's ordinary income tax rate regardless of his or her tax bracket if the bush tax cuts are allowed to expire reference wikipedia capital gains tax rates can be seen here the capital gains tax rate is relative to your ordinary income tax rate for example this year long term gains will be 0 if you fall in the 15 ordinary tax bracket note these rates can change every year so any future rates might be different from the current year

in addition to all the good information that joetaxpayer has provided be aware of this when you sell mutual fund shares you can if you choose to do so tell the mutual fund company which shares you want to sell e.g. all shares purchased on xx plus 10 shares out of shares purchased on ss plus and pay taxes on the gains losses on those specific shares if you do not specify which shares you want sold the mutual fund company will tell you the gains losses based on the average cost basis and you can use this information if you like note that some of your gains losses will be   short term gains or losses if you use the average cost basis or you can use the fifo method usually resulting in the largest gain in which the shares are sold in the order in which they were purchased this usually results in no short term gains losses just so that you know most mutual fund companies will link your checking account in your bank to your account with them a one time paperwork deal is necessary in which your bank manager 's signature is required on the authorization to be sent to the fund company after that the   connection is nearly as seamless as with your current system tell the fund company you want to invest money in a certain mutual fund and to take the money from your linked checking account and they will take care of it   sell some shares and they will deposit the money into your linked bank account and so on   the mutual fund company will not accept instructions from you or someone to be you to sell shares and to send the money to joe blow or to joe taxpayer for that matter the proceeds of redemptions go to your checking account or are used to buy shares in other mutual funds offered by the company called an exchange and not a redemption oh and most fund companies offer automatic investments as well as automatic redemptions at fixed time intervals just as with your bank

so you 're making $ 150,000 per year and you have $ in debts you 're in your late 30s and have $ or less than 1/3 of a year 's pay put away for retirement that 's a bad situation but not disastrous lots of people have recovered from far worse but like the old joke goes when you realize that you 're deep in a hole stop digging the worst thing you could do right now is liquidate the few assets you have and go deeper into debt i do n't know where you live or what the housing market is there but the easy answer is find a cheaper house   i 'm not sure what you mean about affect the resale value yes if you buy a cheaper house it will have a lower resale value so what the days when a house was an investment that would skyrocket in value are over and even in those days it did n't help most people so when you move you get a big profit on the sale of your house but the house you 're moving to probably went up by a similar percentage so you really did n't gain anything even if your house did increase in value unless you sell it that does n't help you make the mortgage payments it 's a paper profit get yourself out of debt step 1 is to stop taking on new debts and if at all possible you should be putting bare minimum 6 into your retirement plan i do n't know where you work but most employers match some percentage of the first 6 you put in if you do n't take advantage of that you 're giving up free money

from the 1st quarter 10q match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to in exchange for cash the issue debt supported by collections on the transferred advances we made these transfers under the terms of our advance facility agreements these transfers do not qualify for sale accounting because we retain control over the transferred assets as a result we account for these transfers as and classify the transferred advances on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as match funded advances and the related liabilities as match funded liabilities we use collections on the match funded advances pledged to the to repay principal and to pay interest and the expenses of the entity holders of the debt issued by this entity can look only to the assets of the entity itself for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against    i 'm not an expert in the accounting of these things but i 'll take a stab from the view of a bond investor   let 's assume the in question have been pooled together and sold into the bond market in the form of a mortgage backed security mbs     when a homeowner falls behind on their payment scheduled principal and interest their monthly mortgage payment amount or is advanced as if the borrower is still current to the person who holds the mbs   this is typically done from the time they first fall behind until either they 1 catch up on their payments or 2 are foreclosed upon and the home is sold to repay the mortgage balance   in either instance the advanced monthly payments are recaptured by the servicer before the holder of the mbs is paid   in this sense the servicer develops a sort of prepaid asset over time by advancing money they are almost certain to recover at a future date usually via foreclosure and liquidation     due to a high number of borrowers falling behind on their payments since the housing crisis and the resulting time it takes to foreclose on a property the etc have built a large balance of advances on the asset side of their balance sheet   to free up this cash prior to liquidation of the home they have sold short term bonds against this asset via an thereby creating the liability you reference   so in essence they have say a home they expect to be liquidated in twelve months that they have advanced on   the short term bonds sold via the offset this asset at an equivalent term thereby making the asset and liability match funded

i think wikipedia offers a very good explanation a dividend reinvestment program or dividend reinvestment plan drip is an equity investment option offered directly from the underlying company the investor does not receive quarterly dividends directly as cash instead the investor 's dividends are directly reinvested in the underlying equity the investor must still pay tax annually on his or her dividend income whether it is received or reinvested this allows the investment return from dividends to be immediately invested for the purpose of price appreciation and compounding without incurring brokerage fees or waiting to accumulate enough cash for a full share of stock so essentially a dividend reinvestment plan is offered by companies directly allowing investors to bypass brokerages and immediately re invests dividends rather than paying them out in cash investopedia also gives a definition a plan offered by a corporation that allows investors to reinvest their cash dividends by purchasing additional shares or fractional shares on the dividend payment date   a drip is an excellent way to increase the value of your investment most drips allow you to buy shares commission free and at a significant discount to the current share price most drips do n't allow much lower than $ 10   i had a hard time finding a comprehensive listing of companies that offered or drips but offers these suggestions   finding a dividend reinvestment plan offers one stop shopping for hundreds of dividend reinvestment plans they offer a searchable list that can be filtered to easily find a dividend reinvestment plan that fits your needs you can also use probably the best way to find out if a company offers a dividend reinvestment plan is to visit the company website most companies have an investor relations area that will highlight the various options available to for example coca cola disney and wal mart hope this helps

just sticking to equities if you are investing directly in a share stock depending on various factors you may have picked up a winner or to your a loser say you just have rs 10,000/- to invest which stock would you buy    if you do n't know then it ’s better to buy a mutual fund now if you say you would buy a few of everything then even to purchase say rs worth of each stock in the nifty index 50 companies you would require at least an investment of when you are investing directly you always have to buy in whole numbers i.e. you ca n't buy 1/2 share or 1.6 share of some stock    the way mutual funds work is they take 10,000 from 250 people and invest in all the stocks there are fund managers who 's job is to pick good stocks however even they can not predict winners all the time normally a few of the picks become great winners most are average and a few are losers this means that overall your returns are average vs if you had picked the winning stock the essential difference between you investing on your own and via mutual funds are    it is good to begin with a mutual fund and once you start understanding the stocks better you can invest directly into the equities the same logic holds true for debt as well

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

is the mortgage debt too high the rental property is in a hot re market so could be easily sold with significant equity however they would prefer to keep it given the current income there is no stress however in absence of any other liquid cash near cash assets having everything locked into mortgage is quite high even if real estate builds assets these are highly illiquid investments have debt on such investments is risky if there are no other investments essentially everything looks fine now but if there is an crisis unwinding mortgage debt is time consuming and if it forces distress sale it would wipe out any gains can they afford another mortgage and in what amount e.g. they are considering $ 50 k for a small cabin which could be rented out i guess they can but should they or diversify into other assets like stocks etc other than setting cash aside what would be some good uses of funds to make sure the money would appreciate and outpace inflation and add a nice bonus to retirement mutual funds stocks 401 k or other such retirement plans they are currently in 's if there is one key strategy or decision they could make today that would help them retire early say 's what should it be this opinion based it depends on what their lifestyle is and what would they want their lifestyle to be when they retire they should look at saving enough corpus that would give an year on year yield equivalent to the retirement expenses

you will be rolling over the proceeds since you can only deposit cash into an ira however this should probably not affect your considerations much since the pre rollover sale is non taxable within the 401k and the period of roll over itself when the cash is uninvested is relatively short so whatever investments you choose in your 401k you 'll just sell them and then buy them or similar investments back after the rollover to the ira if you 're worrying about a flash crash right on the day when you want to cash out that can definitely happen but it is not really something you can prepare for you can consider moving to money market several weeks before the potential date of your withdrawal if you think it will make you feel safer otherwise i do n't think it really matters

asset protection is broad subject in your examples it is certainly possible to have accounts that exist from a spouse and legally inaccessible by said spouse in the us balances in 401k retirement accounts are exempt from in bankruptcy the only trick to secret is that it involves you having any wealth in the first place that you do n't need to access it is more worth it for most people to use all of their access to wealth to get out of debt earn claims to property and save for retirement this takes up all of their earnings making hidden wealth of any significant portion to be an impractical pipe dream but with trust laws corporate laws and marriage property laws being different in practically every jurisdiction there is plenty of flexibility to construct the form of your secret wealth   cryptocurrency makes it much easier at the expense of net asset value volatility

first i 'd like to congratulate you on your financial discipline in paying off your loans and living well within your means   i have friends who make more than twice your salary with similar debt obligations and they barely scrape by month to month if we combine your student loan debt and unallocated income each month we get about $ 1,350   you say that $ per month is the minimum payment for your loans which have an average interest rate of about 3.5   thus you have about $ 1,350 a month to invest making your loan payments is basically the same as investing with the same return as the loan interest rate when it comes down to it   an interest rate of 3.5 is not great all things considered and barely above inflation     however that 's a guaranteed return of 3.5 more or less like a bond   as noted previously the stock market historically averages 10 before inflation over the long run the us stock market is right around its historic high at this point djia is at today april 6th 2017 historic high hit just over on march 1 2017   obviously no one can predict the future but i get the feeling that a market correction may be in order especially depending on how things go in washington in the next weeks or months   if that 's the case again we have no way of knowing if it is you 'd be foolish to invest heavily in any stocks at this point what i would do given your situation is invest the $ in a portfolio that 's 50/50 stocks and bonds where the bonds here are your student loans   here you have a guaranteed return of on the bond portion and you can still hedge the other 50 on stocks continuing their run and also benefiting from dividends capital gains etc over time   i would apply the extra loan payments to the highest interest loan first paying only the minimum to the others   once the highest interest loan is paid off move onto the next one once you have all your loans paid off your portfolio will be pretty much 100 stocks at which point you may want to add in some actual bonds say a or 80/20 split depending on what you want   i 'm assuming you 're pretty young so you still have plenty of time to let the magic of compounding interest do its work even if you happen to get into the market right before it drops well that and the fact that you wo n't really have much invested anyway again let me stress that neither i nor anyone else has any way of knowing what will happen with the market i 'm just stating my opinion and what my course of action would be if i were in your shoes

the most common use of non deductible traditional ira contributions these days as joetaxpayer mentioned is as an intermediate step in a backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira and then immediately convert it to a roth ira which if you had no previous pre tax money in traditional or other iras is a tax free process that achieves the same result as a regular roth ira contribution except that there are no income limits this is something you should consider since you are unable to directly contribute to a roth ira due to income limits also i want to note that your comparison is only true assuming you are holding tax efficient assets ones where you get taxed once at the end when you take it out if you are holding tax inefficient assets like an interest bearing cd or bond or a stock that regularly produces dividends in a taxable account you would be taxed many times on that earnings and that would be much worse than with the non deductible traditional ira where you would only be taxed once at the end when you take it out

individual product prices do not necessarily rise at inflation rates   what inflation means is that the purchasing power of one unit of currency decreases by x% in a year which is typically measured by looking at a broad spectrum of products in an economy and to all products   so for all products across an economy the aggregate price of all goods will on average be x% higher that they were this time last year   some products will be cheaper some will be more expensive but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates for the other part of your question inflation is an annualized percentage so an inflation rate of 12 means prices are 12 higher than they were a year ago so if you extrapolate that linear trend prices will rise again on average 1 in a month

a 25 variance in price in most markets is n't so crazy as to require it be some sort of terrible scam but that does n't mean much else it could be the inclusion of floor plans that are carefully designed to add square footage at minimum cost and thus reduce the average cost per square foot without actually being cheaper otherwise less insulation thinner walls cheap piping minimized wiring or they are just efficient and competitive as you pointed out they do n't have gas so that 's certainly one way you know they cut costs no gas lines to install as the article from cost of constructing a home points out though what this figure includes can vary does it include the finished lot if so then a smaller lot would mean lower square footage building price because the land is smaller and cheaper not the house   is any kind of financing quoted in the price compare also change plan costs any penalties for delays in construction grade of materials floor plans customization costs fees or premiums to pick colors floors counters cabinets fixtures and so on what about central cooling and heating are they quoting an electric furnace how does electrical heating in your area compare to the cost of gas heat relative pricing of electric and gas vary widely by region and climate in short often square footage price is n't the whole story of what it would cost to construct a home ensure you are comparing everything that 's important to you and you are getting a full quote not comparing small isolate sales pitch figures with no clear details if it turns out the price is 25 lower than other builders in your area and they give you what you are wanting and you have the good sense to have a qualified home inspector and/or structural engineer inspect the home thoroughly before you take possession then you might just have found a good builder i 'd encourage you to personally visit some of their past construction work such as houses they build 2 10 years ago and ensure they are in the sort of condition you 'd expect

reading irs regulations section more closely i see that this was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price therefore at the time of filing prior years there was no way of knowing the final contingent payment would not be reached and thus the prior years were filed correctly and should not be amended those regulations go on to give an example of a sale with a stated maximum selling price where the maximum was not reached due to contingency and states that in such cases when the maximum payment amount is subsequently reduced the gross profit ratio will be with respect to payments received in or after the taxable year in which an event requiring reduction occurs however in this case that would result in a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form which turbo tax reports should be a non negative number   looking further in the regulations i found an example which relates to bankruptcy and a resulting loss in a subsequent year for 1992 a will report a loss of $ 5 million attributable to the sale taken at the time determined to be appropriate under the rules generally applicable to worthless debts therefore i used a gross profit ratio of zero on line 19 and entered a separate stock sale not reported on a 1099-b as a worthless stock on form 8949 as a capital loss based upon the remaining basis in the stock sold in an installment sale   i also included an explanatory statement with my return to the irs stating in 2008 i entered into an installment sale of stock the sale was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price the sales price did not reach the agreed upon maximum sales price due to some contingencies not being met according to the irs    regulations section my basis in the stock remains at $ 500 in 2012 after the final payment rather than using a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form i 'm using a zero ratio and treating the remaining basis as a schedule d loss similar to worthless stock since the sale is now complete and my remaining basis is no longer recoverable

it appears that the company in question is raising money to invest in expanding its operations specifically lithium production but that is off topic for here the stock price was rising on the back of perceived increases in demand for the company 's products but in order to fulfil demand they need to either invest in higher production or increase prices they chose to increase production by investing to invest they needed to raise capital and so are going through the motions to do that the key question as to what will happen with their stock price after this is broken down into two parts short term and long term in the short term the price is driven by the expectation of future profits see below and the behavioural expectations from an increase in interest in the stock caused by the fact that it is in the news people who had never heard of the stock or thought of investing in the company have suddenly discovered it and been told that it is doing well and so want a piece of it this will exacerbate the effect of the news broadly positive or negative and will drive the price in the short run the effect of extra leverage assuming that they raise capital by writing bonds also immediately increases the total value of the company so will increase the price somewhat the short term price changes usually back after a few months as the shine goes off and people take profits for investing in the long run you need to consider how the increase in capital will be used and how demand and supply will change since the company is using the money to invest in factors of production i.e. making more product it is the return on capital or investment employed roce that will inform the fundamentals underlying the stock price the higher the roce the more valuable the capital raised is in the future and the more profits and the company as a whole will grow a to ask yourself is whether they can employ the extra capital at the same roce as they currently produce it is possible that by investing in new more productive equipment they can raise their roce but also possible that because the lithium mines or whatever can only get so big and can only get so much access to the extra capital will not be as productive as existing capital so roce will fall for the new capital

first off i do n't know of the nature of the interpersonal relationship between you and your roommate and i do n't really care but i will say that your use of that term was a red flag to me and it will be so to a bank buying a home is a big deal that you normally do not undertake with just a friend or roommate spouses business partners domestic partners etc are the types of people that go in together on a home purchase not roommates going on a house is not something that 's easily contracted you ca n't take out two primary mortgages for half the house 's value each because you ca n't split the house in half so if one of you defaults that bank takes the house leaving both the other person and their bank in the co signing on one mortgage is possible but then you tie your credit histories together if one of you ca n't make their half of the mortgage both of you can be pursued for the full amount and both of you will see your credit tank that 's not as big a problem for two people joined in some other way marriage family ties but for two friends there 's just way too much risk involved second i do n't know what it 's like in your market but when i was buying my first house i learned very quickly that extended haggling is not really tolerated in the housing market you 're not bidding on some trade good the guy bought wholesale for fifty cents and is charging you $ 10 for the seller might be breaking even on this thing an offer that comes in low is more likely to be rejected outright as frivolous than to be countered it 's a fine line if you offer a few hundred less than list the seller will think you 're and stay firm while if you offer significantly less the seller may be unable to accept that price because it means he no longer has the cash to close on his new home and bank owned properties are often sold at a concrete asking price the bank will not even respond to anything less and usually will not even agree to eat closing costs even if it 's for sale by owner the owner may be in trouble on their own mortgage and if they agree to a short sale and the bank gets wind it 's trivial to match a list of distressed mortgaged properties with the mls listings the bank can swoop in foreclose the mortgage take the property and kill the deal they 're the primary lienholder you do n't own your house until it 's paid for and then everybody loses third housing prices in this economy depending on market are pretty depressed and have been for years if you 're selling right now you are almost certainly losing thousands of dollars in cash and/or equity despite that sellers in listing their home must offer an attractive price for the market and so they are in the position of pricing based on what they can afford to lose that again often means that even a seller who is n't a bank and is n't in mortgage trouble may still be losing thousands on the deal and is firm on the asking price to the bleeding your agent can see the signs of a seller backed against a wall and again in order for your offer to be considered in such a situation it has to be damn close to list as far as your agent trying to talk you into offering the asking price there 's honestly not much in it for him to tell you to bid higher vs lower a $ 10,000 change in price which can easily make or break a deal is only worth $ 300 to him either way there is on the other hand a huge incentive for him to close the deal at any price that 's in the ballpark whether it 's $ or $ he 's taking home around $ 11k in commission so he 's going to recommend an offer that will be seriously considered from the previous points that 's going to be the asking price right now the agent 's exact motivations for advising you to offer list depend on the exact circumstances typically around the time the house has been on the market and the offer history which he has access to via his fellow agents and the mls the house may have just had a price drop that brings it below comparables meaning the asking price is a great deal and will attract other offers meaning you need to move fast the house may have been offered on at a lower price which the seller is considering not accepted not rejected meaning an offer at list price will get you the house again if you move fast or the house may have been on the market for a while without a price drop meaning the seller can go no lower but is desperate again meaning an offer at list will get you the house here 's a tip virtually all offers include a buyer 's option for a negotiated price typically very small like $ 100 from the moment the offer is accepted until a particular time thereafter one week two weeks etc you can say no at any time for any reason during this time period you get a home inspection and have a guy you trust look at the bones of the house check the basic systems and look for things that are wrong that will be expensive to fix never make an offer without this option written in if your agent says to forego the option fire him if the seller wants you to strike the option clause refuse and that should be a huge red flag that you should rescind the offer entirely the seller is likely trying to get rid of a house with serious issues and does n't want a competent inspector telling you to lace up your running shoes another tip depending on the the seller may be expecting to pay closing costs those are traditionally the buyer 's responsibility along with the buyer 's agent commission but in the current economy in the for your market that attracts first time homebuyers sellers are virtually expected to pay both of those buyer costs because they 're attracting buyers who can just barely scrape the down payment together $ in my home region dfw is a bit high to expect such a concession for that reason usually those types of offers come in for homes at around the $ range here but in the overall market conditions you have a good chance of getting the seller to accept that concession if you pay list but that is usually an offer made up front not a weapon kept in reserve so i would have expected your agent to recommend that combined offer up front list price and seller pays closing if you offer at list you do n't expect a counter so you would n't keep closing costs as a card to play in that situation

for what its worth i recently closed on a 30 year refinance mortage with an agent i found through zillow   the lender has a perfect reputation score whose office was located within 5 miles of my house and as suggested by justkt on mrchrister 's response i checked out the business on the better business bureau and its online presence prior to going forward with the bank the process was relatively painless and the apr and closing costs were less than my previous loan with a federal credit union which i 've used in the past   i ca n't say if the bank i 'll be using going forward is as good as the one i 've used in the past but overall i 'm quite happy with it i never met the individual in person but this saved both of us a fair amount of time honestly

there are deals out there which allow refinancing up to 125 of appraised value so long as you have a solid payment history you need to research banks in your area working with harp funded mortgages   an alternate method is to find a bank that will finance 80 of the current value at 4 and the rest as a heloc the rate will be higher on the equity line but the average rate will be better and you can pay the line off faster

is your mother still paying the premiums or are you if you 're paying the premiums then just contact the company and say you are no longer willing to pay and want to cancel the policy if she 's paying the premiums why do you care if the issue is the non smoking declaration and you are a smoker or want to take up smoking i do n't know what country you live in but i 'd be surprised if there 's a law anywhere that gives your mother the legal authority to forbid you from smoking when you are over 18 if you are paying the premiums then contact the insurance company and tell them that you are no longer a non smoker the premiums may go up if she is paying the premiums tell her that you are now a smoker and that she should contact the insurance company about changing this clause in the policy if she wants to be sure it remains valid if she declines to do this that 's between her and the insurance company as you 're not a party to the contract it really has nothing to do with you if as you say your mother is not fully capable of managing her affairs you could contact the insurance company for her i do n't see how you could get the policy invalidated unless there is some evidence that the life insurance company made false claims or somehow tricked your mother into buying the policy or that the policy violates local law there is nothing invalid about it just because you 've decided you do n't want the policy does n't make it invalid likewise i do n't see how you could get the premiums refunded the whole point of life insurance is that you pay a monthly premium and if and when you die they pay the beneficiary the face value of the policy life insurance is often described as a kind of gambling game the insurance company is betting that you will live long enough to pay more in premiums than they pay out in benefits you are betting that you will get more in benefits than you pay in premiums if you die young you win if you could wait and see if you die within some time period and if not demand your premiums back well that would be like saying that you want to bet on a spin of the roulette wheel and if you win you take your winnings and if you lose you want to get your original bet back what casino would agree to that you should be able to cancel the policy at any time i suppose there might be some specific commitment in the contract like you pledge not to cancel within x years if you never signed it i do n't see how you could be obligated to pay for it regardless of what commitments your mother made i do n't know where you live or your country 's laws but i doubt your mother can sign a contract legally committing you to pay for something for the rest of your life you say it 's a whole life policy which means it should have some cash value if you cancel it i.e. you get some money back not everything you and/or your mother paid in but something

nothing is guaranteed candlesticks are not crystal balls nor is any part of technical analysis candlestick patterns used correctly and in combination with other western technical indicators can increase the probability of a trade going into the derived direction but they are not a guarantee which is why you should always use stop losses with your candlestick or any trading in saying that another candlestick pattern that can provide high probability trades is the doji or a combination of in a row at a market extreme note that both patterns and work best at price extremes highs and lows and in combination with other technical indicators such as an overbought momentum indicator at a market high or an oversold momentum indicator at a market low edit an example here is a sample trade i placed on the 17th october and am currently in profit on see the chart below as it shows taking the trade on the open of the following day after a bullish pattern appeared at the bottom of a downtrend on the 16th in combination with the slow stochastic crossing over in the oversold region below 20 i would consider this a high probability trade and have placed an initial stop loss at 10 below my open price in case the trade went against me as the price moved up i moved the 10 stop loss up as a trailing stop loss my profit target is set at 25 or $ 4.00

the rev rule allows companies to fully restate transition years but does n't actually require it it allows them to just do a one time adjustment to retained earning instead which is what most companies are doing will do   lots of huge companies have adopted earlier than they had to so they clearly saw some benefit in doing so i think some are absolutely considering the benefits of a superficial bump in the transition year    obviously not a huge shift in long term earnings though

as some others have pointed out it 's key to remember the difference in market value and accounting value   to simplify things book value is the only item that specifically depreciates it happens in the world of accounting to try to time when did i use a long term asset with when did i obtain value from that asset for a house governments usually allow owners to claim depreciation of the building over a set period of time this does not affect your resale value of the house   similarly for a commercial property governments set laws for how an individual or a company can time the use of that asset vs. their accounting some companies can have totally depreciated zero cost assets that are still very productive    market property values are derived from 3 specific sources value in trade is an estimate of the value that others would be willing to pay for a similar asset that 's why you can buy a house today and in a normal market the same house should be worth a similar amount of money in the future value in use can be more interesting this is where a farmer can extract $ 100,000 in value per year from 10 acres of land but as a region develops a manufacturing company can generate $ 300,000 per year from the same 10 acres of land the company can buy out the farmer at a fair price > $ 100,000 per year and still net positive from the investment   income approach tends to be focused on properties that have a cash flow but can be adapted to other property estimates it evaluates the current business case for any property with the cost of money down the overall investment price and the expected value from any returns   remember the market value is very simply the price you could obtain if you sold the asset at a given time it is rarely considered in terms of how much will this go down   book value is an accounting exercise and declines by a set amount every year because it means you can estimate the cost of owning an asset vs the value it generates in a particular time period

should n't withdraw stock investments for at least 5 years would be better re phrased as do n't invest money in stocks if you really need it within next few years the underlying principle is stocks are one of the higher risk investment classes out there   while that 's exactly what you want over a long time horizon longer than the and flow of the broader economy if you know you 'll definitely have to withdraw $ 50k or any large chunk of it within just a few years it 's possible that a great long term vehicle like stocks could actually rob you of money on a shorter time horizon so if you want to start a business 2 years from now you 'll probably want to retain some of that $ 300k initial pile in lower risk investment vehicles e.g. bonds cds certain etfs and mutual funds aimed at capital preservation etc that said interest rates are so low that if you 're flexible with how much money you 'll need to start that business i 'd probably keep as much as you can stomach in diversified stocks per your original plan

funds earned and spent before opening a dedicated business account should be classified according to their origination for example if your business received income where did that money go   if you took the money personally it would be considered either a distribution or a loan to you   it is up to you which of the two options you choose on the flip side if your business had an expense that you paid personally that would be considered either a contribution of capital or a loan from you if you choose to record these transactions as loans you can offset them together so you do n't need two separate accounts loan to you and loan from you when the bank account was opened the initial deposit came from where   if it came from your personal funds then it is either a contribution of capital or a loan from you from the sound of your question you deposited what remained after the preceding income expenses   this would in effect return the loan account back to zero if choosing that route the above would also be how to record any expenses you may pay personally for the business if any in the future because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account you ca n't record them in quickbooks as checks and deposits   instead you can use journal entries   for any income received you would debit your capital loan account and credit your income account   for any expenses you would debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distribution loan account also if setting up a loan account you should choose either current asset or current liability type   the capital contribution and distribution account should be equity type hope this helps

in short yes by forward selling you enter into a futures contract by which you agree to trade euros for dollars us or singapore at a set rate agreed to by both parties at some future time you are basically making a bet you think that the dollar will gain on the euro and thus you 'd pay a higher rate on the spot than you 've locked in with the future the other party to the contract is betting against you he thinks the dollar will weaken and so the dollars he 'll sell you will be worth less than the euros he gets for them at the agreed rate now in a traditional futures contract you are obligated to execute it whether it ends up good or bad for you you can to avoid this buy an option by buying the option you pay the other party to the deal for the right to say no thanks that way if the dollar weakens and you 'd rather pay spot price at time of delivery you simply let the contract expire un executed the tradeoff is that options cost money up front which is now sunk whether you exercise the option or not the other party gets the option price that basically creates a point spread you win if the dollar appreciates against the euro enough that you still save money even after buying the option or if the dollar depreciates against the euro enough that again you still save money after subtracting the option price while you lose if the exchange rates are close enough to what was agreed on that it cost you more to buy the option than you gained by being able to choose to use it

your biggest risk with a vendor like this is not that your credit card number will be stolen in transit it is that it will be stolen from the vendor i agree with that using a one time number is the best plan provided you have a bank that offers such numbers   bank of america calls it shop safe while citibank calls it virtual account numbers   i think discover card has something similar but less useful in that they are n't really one time use and i think american express discontinued their service   afaik no one else offers anything like it   if you ca n't get a one time number then i was going to suggest buying a visa gift card until i put together the fact that you are making a purchase in asia and the gift cards are not authorized for international payments due to patriot act restrictions   visa does offer the service which might help but i doubt your vendor participates or would even be allowed to participate if they do n't offer a secure order form   you can open a pre paid visa card account which is probably what i 'd do you can buy pre paid visa cards the same way you buy visa gift cards the difference being you have to register the pre paid cards thanks patriot act before you can use them   but it 's not that big a deal to register one you just fill out the online form your your ssn etc and you 're good to go load it up with enough money to cover your purchase and the fx fees and then cut it up

you need to understand how various entities make their money once you know that you can determine whether their interests are aligned with yours for example a full service broker makes money when you buy and sell stocks they therefore have in interest in you doing lots of buying and selling not in making you money or no fee financial advisors make their money through commissions on what they sell you which means their interests are served by selling you those investments with high commissions not the investments that would serve you best financial media makes their money through attracting viewers readers and selling advertising that is their business and they are not in the business of giving good advice there are lots of good investments index funds are a great example that do n't get much attention because there is n't any money in them   in fact the majority of wall street is not aligned with your interests so be skeptical of the financial industry in general   there are for fee financial advisors who you pay directly their interests are fairly well aligned with yours there is a fair amount of good information at the motley fool

this answer relies on why you are holding shares of a company in the first place so let 's address that so does this mean you would like to vote with your shares on the directions the company takes if so your reasons for selling would be different from the next speculator who only is interested in share price volatility regardless of your participation in potential voting rights associated with your share ownership a different reason to sell is based on if your fundamental reasons for investing in the company have changed   enhancements on this topic include trade management how to deal with position sizes buying and selling partial positions based on price action while keeping a core long term position but this is not something long term investors generally put too much effort in price targets start your long term investment with a price target in mind derived from a future market cap based on your initial fundamental analysis of the company 's prospects and finally there are a lot of things you can do with a profitable investment in shares

i do n't think there 's any federal law prohibiting them from allowing you to autopay more than your minimum   certainly there are federal laws telling them what to do with payments more than the minimum they must apply the leftover to the principal by default so the law does n't assume you ca n't overpay however federal law does require them to advance your next payment date if you overpay by a multiple of your minimum payment i.e. if your payment is $ 50 and you send them $ 100 you do n't have to make your next payment though interest still accrues of course   it 's possible navient is n't interested in implementing this functionality in their autopay who knows in any event assuming you have a bank that has functionality you may want to consider using that either for the extra or for the whole amount if navient is n't giving you a discount for autopay if so use that at least   your bank is happy to cut a check in any amount and send it on and navient is required to apply it to the principal   though if you do the autopay and billpay and are sending an extra amount less than a whole payment verify that they 're willing to accept amounts less than a full payment first not all lenders are

the short answer is yes paying more towards the loan as soon as a you can will reduce the interest there are calculators or you could work up a spreadsheet using the specialized family of functions pmt my personal view the amount of interest you offset in this manner is going to be fairly small i 'm going to guess less than $ 5 or $ 10 a month but i have n't done the math i would say what is more important is to automate your payments at a comfortable level while making sure your other obligations are taken care of then add an extra payment when you save up a chunk of money to pay towards it make sure you never miss a payment that means making sure you set up emergency fund to cover the payments if you lose your job or need to visit a sick family member for a while or the car breaks down or

the problem with these services is that they resell a random assortment of programs at a pretty high price   buying the programs a la carte adds up quick especially when a sd stream of varying quality costs as much or more than the dvd set when it is released do n't get me started on the hd up charges   that 's per show per season   it makes it really expensive to catch up on a season when you are essentially buying the seasons to stream them when all you want to do it rent them instead   the way this is not like steam and the point i think op is trying to make is that stuff is all over the place   people do n't want to have to jump between hulu itunes netflix amazon etc   plus some places have some things for free some charge a monthly fee some charge per view rent some charge once per show season movie buy etc   some offerings that are free are actually sold for a fee through other services   right now it 's sort of a mess   i 'm not even sure what the right model is buy rent season pass ad supported etc and i 'm sure there will be competing models for the foreseeable future

they can sell a lower price call if they expect the stock to plummet in the near term but they are bullish on the longer term what they are looking to do is collect the call premium and hope it expires worthless   and then again hope that the stock will ultimately turn around so yes a lot of hoping   but can you explain what you mean by my brokerage gives premiums for prices lower than the current price do you mean you pay less in commissions for itm calls

it requires fairly large levels of capital but what about seed funding angel investments in startups this would be before venture capital gets involved so the amounts are relatively low tens of thousands vs. millions of usd but as valuations this early in the game are also low you can get a significant portion of equity in a startup that you feel is being run by good people and is in a promising market paul graham of y has a number of articles about this from both sides of the table that you can take a look at and see if this is for you it 's definitely very high risk but if you can pick successful startups before their valuation shoots up get some equity help them succeed and they eventually go public or get acquired you can stand to bring in some big returns note that this is n't a hands off investment you 'll need to build connections in the startup community and it is n't uncommon for angel investors to become involved in the day to day operations of the businesses in which they invest

first when a debt collector says it 's to your advantage to give me money now i 'd take that with a grain of salt my ex wife declared bankruptcy and when debt collectors could n't find her they somehow tracked me down and told me that i should tell her that it would be to her advantage to pay off this debt before the bankruptcy went through that was total nonsense of course the whole point of bankruptcy is to not have to pay the debt why would you pay it just before it was wiped off the books now that i think of it i 'm surprised that they did n't tell me that i should pay her debts as others have noted this would be controlled by state law but in general when someone dies any debts are payed from the assets of the estate and then whatever is left goes to the heirs if nothing is left or the debts exceed the assets then the heirs get nothing but they do n't have to pay somebody else 's debts i do n't see how you could put the house under your name if he left the house to you in his will then after any debts are settled in accordance with state law the house would transfer to you but you ca n't just decide to put the house in your name outside of the legal inheritance process if you could then people could undermine a will at any time by just deciding to take an asset left to someone else and put it in their name or as in this case people could undermine the rights of creditors by transferring all assets to themselves before debts were paid even if there 's some provision in your state for changing the name on a deed prior to probate to facilitate getting mortgages and taxes paid or whatever i would be quite surprised if this allowed you to shelter assets from legitimate creditors it would be a gaping loophole in inheritance law frankly if your father 's debts are more than the value of his assets including the value of the house i suspect you will not be able to keep the house it will be sold to pay off the creditors i would certainly talk to a lawyer about this as there might be some provision in the law that you can take advantage of i 'll gladly yield on this point to anyone with specific knowledge of new jersey inheritance law

young vs old does n't really make a difference   what 's in play in the roth after tax vs traditional pretax decision is your current marginal tax bracket versus your probable taxation in retirement    since your company matches something on the pretax account it makes sense to max out the pretax contribution match amount before considering roth contributions   if the match is something like 50 of your contribution up to 3 of your salary that 's an instant 50 return on your contribution and you ca n't really beat that

that may become complicated depending on the state laws in some states california for example llcs are taxed on gross receipts so you 'll be paying taxes on paying money to yourself in other states this would be a no op since the llc is disregarded so you need to check your state law i assume the llc is not taxed as a corporation since that would be really stupid of course but if it is then it adds the complexity of the federal taxes on top as well corporate entity will pay taxes on your rent and you 'll pay taxes on your dividends to get the money back the best option would be to take that property out of the llc since there 's no point in it anyway if you 're the tenant

hi amy   thank you for your article   got to say however that i tend to disagree   i 've been through the venture rabbit hole a number of times   each one was an experience i 'll never forget and would n't trade for anything   i learned so much more about how the business world actually works or doesn't than i would have at some more established company     that said i am also quite sour on the whole vc thing and at my most recent startup we 've foregone outside investors and bootstrapped things from the get go   it was probably the best decision we made because it allowed us to be flexible in our strategy and not always beholden to the quick exit that vc money always drives      however i realize that not all businesses can be like ours   we started off as a consulting company and moved into build products as our cash reserve grew   if we had wanted to do something big or fast or perhaps manufacture something we would never have had the capital to get it going   those types of business need outside funding and generally it 's only vcs who are willing to take the 1 in 20 bet that startups usually entail   for that i 'm glad that vcs are there and think they provide a very valuable service and part of our economy   i just do n't ever want to have to deal with them again

well it all kind of depends    the realtor is your pro and you should communicate further with him   is this a neighborhood on the decline   is there a good reason to make such a low offer   are you totally off base when you think 85 k is fair and if so why   is he just working his tail off for you a great thing one thing that is a key to this negotiation is financing   what does your financing status look like   a reasonable cash offer with no contingencies and a quick close might be less than   a person with strong financing can get a better discount then a person that is questionable it could be that the realtor is testing the waters to find the bottom price   the home selling season is closed typically the summer and the home has been on the market for a bit   offering 70 k might mean a counter at 82 k so you can work on an offer between 80 and 82    to me it sounds like this guy is working for you   you should thank him   it is pretty hard to find a realtor that is willing to negotiate his pay down in order to save you money    also he can answer the closing cost question better than us as he is more familiar with your particular market

a suitable mix of index funds is a great option if you do n't want to spend a lot of time and effort micromanaging your money if you find amusement in pushing numbers around you may be able to do better notice may if you have multiple millions you can hire someone of that sort to push the numbers around for you they may do better for you notice may and remember that part of your additional gains have to go to pay them which means they have to do better just to be worth having on staff in the first place if you have more than that there are some options available which smaller investors really ca n't get involved in as one example if you have enough money that you can lose $ 100 k without especially noticing you can get involved in venture capital and the like which require a large commitment and are higher risk but can yield higher returns anyone who 's dismissing index funds as only for beginners is being foolish but recommending them to beginners in particular is a good thing since they let you get into the market with fairly predictable risk benefits without needing a massive investment in education and time

for a non technical investor meaning someone who does n't try to do all the various technical analysis things that theoretically point to specific investments or trends having a diverse portfolio and rebalancing it periodically will typically be the best solution for example i might have a long term growth portfolio that is 40 broad stock market fund 40 large industry specific market funds and 20 bond funds   if the market as a whole tanks then i might end up in a situation where my funds are invested 30 market 35 industry 35 bonds   okay sell those bonds which are presumably high and put that into the market which is presumably low   now back to    then when the market goes up we may end up at say in which case we sell some of the broad market fund and buy some bond funds back to   ultimately ending up always selling high whatever is currently the other two and buying low whatever is underperforming    having the industry specific fund(s means i can balance a bit between different sectors maybe the healthcare industry takes a beating for a while so that goes low and i can sell some of my tech industry fund and buy that    none of this depends on timing anything you can rebalance maybe twice a year not worrying about where the market is at that exact time and definitely not targeting a correction specifically   you just analyze your situation and adjust to make everything back in line with what you want this is n't guaranteed to succeed any more than any other strategy is of course and has some risk particularly if you rebalance in the middle of a major correction so you end up buying something that goes down more   but for long term investments it should be fairly sound

the answer is actually very simple the cost of data seriously call the cboe tomorrow and ask yourself they have two big programs   1 the penny pilot program where options trade at penny increments instead of 5 cent increments this is only extended to a select few symbols because of the amount of data this can generate is too much for the data vendors data vendors store and sell historical data the exchanges themselves often have a big data vending business too 2 the weekly options program where only select symbols get these chains because of the amount of data they will generate liquidity and demand are factors in determining if the cboe will consider enabling those series on new issues although they have to give the list of which symbols are on these programs to the sec

when we speak about a product or service we generally refer to its value currency while neither a product or service has its own value as the value of currency goes down the price of products bought by that currency will go up you could consider the price of a product or service the value of the product multiplied by the value of the currency for your first example we compare two cars one bought in 1990 and one bought in 2015 each car has the same features ac radio abs etc we can say that when these products were new each had the same value however we can deduce that since the 1990 car cost $ 100 and the 2015 car cost $ 400 that there has been 75 inflation over 25 years comparing prices over time helps identify the inflation or devaluation of currency that an economy is experiencing in regards to your second question you can say that there was 7 inflation over five years total keep in mind that these are absolute cumulative values it does n't mean that there was a 7 increase year over year that would be 35 inflation over five years but simply that the absolute value of the dollar has changed 7 over those five years the sum of the percentages over those five years will be less than 7 because inflation is measured yearly but the total cumulative change is 7 from the original value to put that in perspective say that you have $ 100 in 2010 with an expected 7 inflation by 2015 which means that your $ 100 will be worth $ 93 in 2015 this means that the yearly inflation would be about 1.5 for five years resulting in a total of 7 inflation over five years note that you still have a hundred dollar bill in your pocket that you 've saved for five years but now that money can buy less product for example if you say that $ 100 buys 50 gallons of gasoline $ in 2010 you will only be able to afford gallons with that same bill in 2015 $ as you can see the 7 inflation caused a 7 increase in gasoline prices in other words if the value of the car remained the same its actual price would go up because the value stayed the same however it 's more likely that the car 's value will decrease significantly in those five years perhaps as much as 50 or more in some cases but its price would be higher than it would have been without inflation if the car 's value had dropped 50 so $ 50 in original year prices then it would have a higher price 50 value 1.07 currency ratio = $ note that even though its value has decreased by half its price has not decreased by 50 because it was up by inflation for your final question the purpose of a loan is so that the loaner will make a profit from the transaction consider your prior example where there was 7 inflation over five years that means that a loan for $ 100 in 2010 would only be worth $ 93 in 2015 interest is how loans combat this loss of value as well as to earn some profit so if the loaner expects 7 inflation over five years they 'll charge some higher interest say 8 10 or even more so that when you pay them back on time they 'll come out ahead or they might use more advanced schemes like adjustable rates etc so interest rates will naturally be lower when forecasted inflation is lower and higher when forecasted inflation is higher the best time to get a loan is when interest rates are if you get locked into a high interest loan and inflation stalls they will make more money off of you because the currency has more value while if inflation skyrockets your loan will be worth less to loaner however they 're usually really good about predicting inflation so it would take an incredible amount of inflation to actually come out on top of a loan

as mr. money money mustache once said if you have credit card debt you should feel like your hair is on    fire student loan debt is different than credit card debt   rather than having spent the money on just about anything it was invested in improving yourself and probably your financial future   this was probably a good decision however unlike most credit card debt if you ever have to file for bankruptcy your student loans will not be erased   they will follow you forever pay your debts off as quickly as you can   while it may be true that long term return on the stock market is about 7 you can not assume that this will always be the case especially in the short term   what if you had made this assumption in 2007 to assume that your stocks will beat a 6.4 guaranteed return over the next few years is not really investing   it 's gambling

it does n't make a whole lot of sense to save up and wait to make a payment on any of these loans   any dollar you pay today works better than saving it and waiting months to pay it no matter which loan it will be applied to since your lender wo n't let you choose which loan your payment is being applied to do n't worry about it   just make as big a payment as you can each month and try to get the whole thing out of your life as soon as possible the result of this will be that the smaller balance loans will be paid off first and the bigger balance loans later   it is unfortunate that the higher interest rate loans will be paid later but it sounds like you do n't have a choice so it is not worth worrying about instead of thinking of it as 5 loans of different amounts think of it as one loan with a balance of $ and make payments as quickly and as often as possible for example let 's say that you have $ 1000 a month extra to throw at the loans   you would be better off paying $ 1000 each month than waiting until you have $ 4000 in the bank and paying it all at once toward one loan   how the lender divides up your payment is less significant than when the lender gets the payment

1 is this right pretty much though this is a really rudimentary way to think about it 2 if it is why is it that extensive services are provided by high margin companies competing for talent rather then lower margin businesses looking to boost their profits by reducing their expenditures on employees by cutting out the government it 's the polar opposite of that google and companies like that do things like have a day care center on premises   the company staffs a day care center which has costs then lets employees use it for free   this is a business expense for google and in relative terms a considerably large business expense that a lower margin business could no afford employer healthcare is a tax protected expense for employees via section 125 of the tax code   the company portion of the healthcare costs are a deductible business expense to the company as expected   healthcare is different than most other expenses because the employee can forego income before it 's effectively received which negates it from taxable income    this does n't work for something like food purchased at a cafe on a google complex   if employee money is being spent at a corporate cafe it 's taxable income being spent though the cost of running the cafe is a tax deductible business expense to the company there have been discussions in congress to assess a value as income to employees for services like on site child care and no cost employee to address your new example for example suppose john doe makes $ 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20 for a take home pay of $ 80,000 he spends $ 10,000 on food his employer corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense costing them $ 10,000 but now they can pay john doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $ 10,000 $ the company is now spending $ employing john doe for a savings of $ this would be an audit prone administrative nightmare   either you need john to submit receipts for reimbursement up to the $ 10,000 agreed upon amount which would require some kind of administrative staff or after a very short period of time john forgets the abstract value of the food cost arrangement that is only really benefiting the employer in the form of lower payroll expense and is away for more pay somewhere else anyway   the company may be saving $ 2,500 though again there will be an additional administrative expense of some sort but john is only saving $ 500 $ 0.20 $ 100,000 0.20

if you want to keep any consistent standard you need to knuckle down and make those transaction entries honestly this is a lot faster doing in bulk than doing day by day   but change how you account so it is n't annoying   i minimize my transactions   for instance i deposit all income whole for tracking but stop tracking when the money is converted to cash or gift card money i log adding $ 50 to a mcdonalds gift card but not the individual meals   i only use cash for the myriad small things i do not want to track fast food parking meters etc   anything big or that i want to track goes on a credit card   then it 's easy to reconcile credit cards to accounting system    ryan 's law if it was n't written down it did n't happen

one reason this happens is due to dividends if the dividend amount is greater than the time value left on a call it can make sense to exercise early to collect the dividend   deep in the money puts also may get exercised early there 's usually little premium on a deep in the money put and the spread on the bid ask might erase what little premium there is if you have stock worth $ 5,000 but own puts on them that will give you $ 50,000 upon exercise and no spread to worry about the interest you can gain on the $ 50k might be more than the little to no time value left on the position even at several weeks to expiration

it depends on your tax rate multiply your marginal rate including state if applicable by your 3.1 to figure out how much you are saving through the deduction then subtract that from the 3.1 to get the effective rate on the mortgage for example if you are in the 28 bracket with no state tax impact from the mortgage your effective rate on the mortgage is this also assumes you 'd still itemize deductions without the mortgage otherwise the effective deduction is less others have pointed out more behavioral reasons for wanting to pay off the car first but from a purely financial impact this is the way to analyze it this is also your risk free rate to compare additional investing to after taking into account taxes on investments

no it wo n't go on the front page because it uses bullshit math and reveals a deep lack of understanding of how the numbers are calculated the unemployment rate is calculated from the current population survey as well as the participation rate to add to the unemployment rate of one month survey by calculating the participation rate from a different month survey is very problematic   if you are looking to include those who have stopped looking for a job because of poor job prospects you could try using the unemployment estimate the number includes those who have recently stopped looking for a job it only goes back a year for the respondents but at least it is comparable because it is in the same month survey   the author also states that the u6 unemployment estimate should be 20 without explaining why it can be calculated like that i do n't think the participation rate can be used to suggest that the u6 is higher than it is when the u6 already takes into account a large percent of those that have stopped looking for economic reasons

i expected a word or two on the price elasticity of demand here your question needs slight revision in its current form rising prices actually do not mean increased profitability for a company the quantity they sell also pays a huge part and actually is correlated to the price at which they sell the goods and other factors such as the price at which their competitor sells the goods etc but we will ignore it for simplicity   the net profit of sales for any firm is equal to   qty x sale price cogs taxes other expenses where cogs means cost of goods sold means sales general and admin costs e.g. cleaning the inventory storage area daily so that the goods stay fresh etc other expenses include any miscellaneous other costs that the firm incurs to make the sale now if everything in that equation remains same cogs taxes and other expenditures rising prices will only translate into a higher profit if the quantity does not fall by the same margin prices may also rise simply as a response to risking cogs or other expenditures latter may be observed in inflationary environments in such a case the supplying firm can end up losing its profit margin if the quantity falls by more than the price rise

there 's a serious mistake in your analysis granted in the traditional ira you avoid paying taxes on the $ 5000 now but you 're now stuck paying taxes on $ 2.2 million dollars when you withdraw it later obviously you 'll end up paying massively more than $ 1250 in taxes on this in the end as other people have pointed out if you can afford to cut the $ 1250 elsewhere in your budget you could still end up with the $ however let 's say just for argument that you do n't the question then becomes if you 're better off taking the tax hit on the $ 5,000 now or the $ 2.2 million later it also really matters how much money you 'll be withdrawing when you retire as well as how you 'll be doing the withdraws personally my goal is to be able to withdraw as much per year as my highest salary while working so clearly the roth ira is a good deal for me an important consideration here is that most people believe that their expenses will go down when they retire but the majority of retirees in some surveys have indicated that their expenses either stayed approximately the same or actually increased also quick reality check would the fact that you know you 'd be saving $ 1250 on your taxes by contributing to the ira actually cause you to contribute an extra $ 1250 to your retirement even if you personally would i highly doubt that most people with the exception of people who post on this site actually think that way especially given how little most people actually save for retirement

leverage is when you borrow in order to invest mind you most people are n't going to just give you money to gamble on the stock market completely unsecured rather you deposit say $ 10,000 and buy a stock and then you have $ 10k in assets which you can borrow against so you can buy another $ 10,000 of that stock now if the stock goes up you 'll make twice the gain 2x leverage however if it goes down you 'll lose twice as much as well if the value of your stock falls your line of credit will be reduced as well in this case since you used all your credit and are now over your limit your broker will issue a margin call they will demand a deposit of additional funds or they will sell some of your stock at their discretion this protects you from owing more than you invested but it 's still sometimes possible for instance if a company goes bankrupt and becomes worthless and your stock becomes worthless there are also things like leveraged index funds and commodity funds which aim to return some multiple of the market 's earnings these are designed for intraday trading though and usually end up underperforming significantly over the long term edit people who accept borrowed funds should generally accept real cash as well however if you 're trying to short sell i.e. borrow shares and sell them in the hopes you can get them back cheaper later after the stock falls you will need a margin line of credit to do so as well edit 2 clarified margin calls

some of the items required as part of the home buying and mortgage process are traditionally paid prior to closing these are usually the items that the buyer purchases as part of the process home inspection credit check these expenses take place early in the process and if the deal falls through due to the inspection or credit history problems the seller does n't want to get stuck paying for the buyer will frequently have to write a check for these as they occur other items occur later in the process or even at the very end of the process determining which side pays for each item is a combination negotiation and local tradition even for the items that the buyer has to pay for there can be a negotiation between the   buyer and the lender sometimes the lender allows the buyer to roll the closing costs into the loan this does mean that they will be paying interest on the closing costs for years but not rolling in the closing costs mean that you need more cash on hand this is in addition to the down payment and the costs of moving    the closing costs covered by the seller reduce the size of the check they will receive at the end of the process their willingness to kick in this cash is a function of will they still make money on the deal how many other bidders there were and do they need the cash to buy their next house at settlement the forms identify each item involved and who agreed to pay for it then each side is credited for the items they paid for already then each side either writes a check for the balance due or receives a check for their reimbursement keep in mind there are also money exchanges that take place at the closing that are not covered by the buyer real estate commissions there are also items such as interest for the current month and property tax credit that depend on the day of the month and month of the year   sit down with your agent or your lender to get an idea of what you need to pay before closing   though telling everybody that you will have zero cash to pay for these things may make the lender very nervous about approving a loan

i 'm no accountant but i think the way i 'd want to approach this kind of thing in gnucash would be to track it as an asset since it is it sounds like your actual concern is that your tracked asset value is n't reflecting its current market value presumably because it 's risky it 's also illiquid so you 're not sure how much value it should have on your books your approach suggested here of having it as just as expense gives it a 0 value as an asset but without tracking that there 's something that you own the two main approaches to tracking an investment in gnucash are of course both of these approaches do assume that you have some notion of your investment 's current value which is what you 're tracking as the section on estimating valuation of the concepts guide says of valuing illiquid assets there is no hard rule on this and in fact different accountants may prefer to do this differently if you really think that the investment is n't worth anything at the moment then i suppose you should track it at 0 but presumably you think it 's worth something or you would n't have bought it right even if it 's just for your personal records part of a regular maybe annual review of your investments should include coming up with what you currently value that investment at perhaps your best guess of what you could sell it for assuming that you could find a willing buyer and updating your records accordingly of course if you need a valuation for a bank or for tax purposes or the like they have more specific rules about how they are tracking what things are worth but presumably you 're trying to track your personal assets for your own reasons to get a handle on what you currently own so do that take the time to get a handle on the worth of what you currently own and do n't worry about getting the value wrong just take your best guess since you can always update it later when you learn new information about what your investment is worth

he 's misunderstanding buffett 's argument which is that all forms of investment compete and so when interest rates give you guaranteed low returns it makes sense for stocks to give you average low returns   that implies high prices for current stocks because your return on equities is the price tomorrow over the price today   buffett would likely agree with him that this implies slow growth in the future though he may not want to say so for competitive reasons   historical p e norms are a more wrong metric because they do n't capture any fundamental change that might have happened in the economy   what 's likely going on is a surplus of capital as business becomes more efficient i.e. generates more revenue with fewer workers that excess cash flow becomes investable capital but as it becomes more efficient i.e. less of that revenue filters down to workers in the form of wages that they can spend on consumer goods the amount of productive uses where that capital can be effectively deployed in income generating activities declines   more capital + fewer investable opportunities = higher supply + lower demand = the price of securities for the few areas of the economy that are doing well increases   this is why you see insane valuations for tech companies   if we do get a major economic crash it will likely come from a style financial crisis where all the money gets concentrated within emerging new industries focused on new technology who ca n't sell their products because nobody else has any money   we 're on the path to that already but it will likely take a decade or two to play out there 's still a lot of money left in the old economy which can be extracted   also these style of financial crises usually are accompanied by war and a breakdown of the established political order and so all bets are off anyway

no the stock market and investing in general is not a zero sum game   some types of trades are zero sum because of the nature of the trade    but someone is n't necessarily losing when you gain in the sale of a stock or other security i 'm not going to type out a technical thesis for your question   but the main failure of the idea that investing is zero sum is the fact the a company does not participate in the transacting of its stock in the secondary market nor does it set the price this is materially different from the trading of options contracts   options contracts are the trading of risk one side of the contract wins and one side of the contract loses if you want to run down the economic theory that if bought her shares from bob someone else is missing out on 's money you 're free to do that   but that would mean that literally every transaction in the entire economy is part of a zero sum game and really misses the definition of zero sum game poker is a zero sum game   all players bet in to the game in equal amounts one player takes all the money   and hell i 've played poker and lost but still sometimes feel that received value in the form of entertainment

if you are in the money at expiration you are going to get assigned to the person on the other side of the contract this is an extremely high probability the only randomness comes from before expiration where you may be assigned because a holder exercised the option before expiration this can some of your strategies but in exchange you get all the premium that was still left on the option when they exercised an in the money option at expiration has no premium the value of your in the money option is current stock price strike price for a call and strike price current stock price for a put that s why there is no free lunch in this scenario

i just went through this and life insurance money generally does not go into probate however since there was no beneficiary you will have to ask the probate court i would advise you not to spend any of the money yet make a meeting with the probate court in the county where they lived you will need the death certificate and the will if you do not have a will the estate generally does not need to go into probate but if it does then they will definitely let you know what to do with the insurance money just make sure you use the estate accounts to pay off all of his debts before you distribute the left over money the entire process should take an absolute minimum of 6 months

here 's another answer on the topic saving for retirement how much is enough an angle on it this question made me think of a good approach here is to focus on savings rate which you can control rather than the final number which you ca n't plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous for example focus on saving at least 10 of your income annually 15 is much safer   if you focus on the final number the way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can but there are lots of random factors and unknowns some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to others end up able to retire early others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped but the one thing you can often control as long as you have an income and no catastrophes anyway is that you spend less than you make

i think the rise of low quality merchandise in things other than consumer electronics where obsolescence is natural due to moore 's law and the very fast rate of improvement is due to socialist redistribution that has put $ trillions into the hands of people merely for being poor rather than producing for others these people typically still shop based on price rather than quality which creates increased demand and therefore encourages higher production of lower quality items such as plastic versions of things that are actually cheaper if made as metal lower long term cost of use

what determines your profitability is not your time but your trades it is probably a mistake to go into the market and say i hope to make x% today this month this year as a practical matter you can make a lot of money in a short period of time or lose a lot over a long period of time the latter is more likely you 're better off looking at potential trades and saying i like this trade be sure to know why and i dislike that trade if you 're right about your chosen trade you 'll make money probably not on your original timetable because markets react more slowly than individual people do then make only those trades that you genuinely like and understand if you get into a rather few people do your experience might tell you that you are likely to make say x% per month or year but that 's only if the market continues to accommodate your style of trading if the markets change you must change or get lost in the shuffle trading is a risky if sometimes rewarding business the operative motto here is you pay your money and you take your chances not you put in your time and eventually rewards will come

i think a big part of this is sports coverage like he brought up the only programming i miss from cable are live sports events luckily for me my favorite sport the nfl has kept games on non cable television for local markets even when their games are on cable otherwise i might actually buy it    what keeps tv in the game though are the contracts and blackout restrictions i 'm a big wisconsin sports fan i dropped cable in favor of picking up the mlb and nba online options the mlb one streamed game and looked great the hd was spectacular and the service good the nba was n't as great quality but definitely better than a free stream plus i could pick up to 8 teams i wanted to watch however because of blackout restrictions and tv contracts i could never watch a bucks or a game the sole reason i purchased the products was to watch my hometown teams but the tv contracts prevented it the nfl afaik only offers nfl replay you can watch any nfl game 24 hours after it has been played anyone looking for a change in these policies can look elsewhere too the nfl just signed a 10 year deal with television companies unless those channels want to start streaming the games on their websites it 's not going to happen unfortunately    i personally think the leagues are losing profit because they 're losing a large audience there are plenty of customers who stream games illegally online that would happily pay for a higher quality product but television is preventing this    also there has always been the excuse laid out by tv execs that we do n't know how to properly monetize this content on the internet that excuse worked 5 10 years ago i ca n't seem to buy it now anymore

this scheme does n't work because the combination of corporation tax even the lower tax plus the personal income tax does n't give you a tax advantage not on any realistic income i 've ever worked it out on anyway   prior to the 2014 tax year on lower incomes you could scrape a bit of an advantage but the 2013 budget changed the calculation for the tax credit on non eligible dividends so there should n't be an advantage anymore moreover if you were to do it this way by paying corporation tax instead of cpp you are n't eligible for cpp if you sit with a calculator for long enough you may figure out a way of saving $ 200 or something small but it 's a lot of paperwork for little if any benefit and you would n't get cpp i understand the money multiplier effect described above but the tax system is designed in a way that it makes more sense to take it as salary and put it in a tax deferred saving account i.e. an rrsp so there 's no limit on the multiplier effect like i said sit with a calculator if you 're earning a really large amount and are still under the small business limit it may make more sense to use a but that is the case regardless of using it as a tax shelter because if you 're earning a lot you 're probably running a business of some size the main benefit i think is that if you use a you can carry forward your losses but you have to be aware of the definition of an allowable business investment loss

in the uk at least dealers definitely want you to take finance they get benefits from the bank which are not for doing this these benefits translate directly to increased commission and internal rewards for the individual salesman it 's conceivable that the salesman will be less inclined to put himself out for you in any way by your deal as much as you 'd like if he 's not going to get incentives out of it indeed since he 's taking a hit on his commission from you paying in cash it 's in his best interests to perhaps be with you during price negotiation so will the salesman be frustrated with you if you choose to pay in cash yes absolutely though this may manifest in different ways in some cases the dealer will offer to pay off the finance for you allowing you to pay directly in cash while the dealer still gets the bank referral reward so that everyone wins this is a behind the scenes secret in the industry which is not made public for obvious reasons it 's arguably on fraud if the salesman likes you and trusts you then you may be able to get such an arrangement if this does not seem likely to occur i would not go out of my way to disclose that i am planning to pay with cash that being said you 'll usually be asked very early on whether you are seeking to pay cash or credit the salesman wants to know for the reasons outlined above and there is little use lying about it when you 're shortly going to have to come clean anyway

first thing i 'd say is do n't start with investing the foundation of solid finances is cash flow making more than you spend reliably knowing where your money goes having a system that works for you to make sure you make more than you spend until you have that your focus may as well be on getting there because you ca n't fix much else about your finances until you fix this a number you want to know is your percentage of income saved and a good goal for that is about 15 with 10 12 going to retirement savings and the rest to shorter term goals and emergency fund and so forth of course the right percentage here depends on your goals and situation but for most people this is a kind of minimum savings rate to be in good shape focus on your savings rate this is your profitability if you view yourself as a business if it 's crappy or negative your finances will be a mess two ways to improve it are to spend less or to improve your earnings power doing both is even better the book your money or your life by and robin is good for showing how to focus on cash flow even though you may not share their for early retirement a simpler exercise than what they recommend take 3 months of your checking and credit card statements go through each expenditure and put them in a spreadsheet column sum that column then add up 3 months of after tax paychecks divide both numbers by three and compare the 3 months is to average out your spending which probably varies a lot by month after positive cash flow and savings rate the next thing i 'd go through is insurance risk management for what you have this can include checking you have all the important insurance coverages renter 's auto potentially umbrella term life disability and of course health insurance are some highlights and also adjusting all your policies to be most cost effective which usually means raising the deductible if you have a good emergency fund often you can raise the deductible on policies you have and use the savings to add more catastrophe coverage such as term life if you did n't have it or boosting the liability protection on your homeowner 's or whatever remember cover catastrophes as cheaply and comprehensively as possible but do n't worry about reimbursement for non catastrophic expenses i like this book smart and simple financial strategies for busy people by jane because it covers all the main personal finance topics not just investing and because it is smart and simple all the main stuff to think about is in the one book and the advice is solid and investing can truly be dead easy most people would be fine with this advice honestly i do micro optimize and undermine my investing and i 'm guessing most people on this forum do but it 's not something i could defend objectively as a good use of time it probably is necessary to do some reading to feel financially literate and confident in an investment plan but the reading is n't really because a good plan is complicated it 's more to understand all the complicated things that you do n't need to do since that 's how you 'll know not to do them especially when salespeople and publications and tv are telling you over and over and over that you need to know a bunch of crap and do a bunch of things people who have a profitable business of me are the ones who end up with a lot of money not people who spend a lot of time screwing with investments people who get rich investing invest professionally as their business of me they do n't goof around with their 401k after work financial security is all about your savings rate i.e. your personal profitability no shortcuts other than lotteries and rich

i would think that a lot of brokers would put the restriction suggested in in place or something more restrictive so that 's the first line of answer if you did get assigned on your short option then i think the t+3 settlement rules would matter for you   basically you have 3 days to deliver   you 'll get a note from your broker demanding that you provide the stock and probably threatening to liquidate assets in your account to cover their costs if you do n't comply   if you still have the long leg of the calendar spread then you can obtain the stock by exercising your long call or if you have sufficient funds available you can just buy the stock and keep your long call   if you 're planning to exercise the long call to cover the position then you need to check with your broker to see how quickly the stock so obtained will get credited to your account since it also has some settlement timeline   it 's possible that you may not be able to get the stock quickly enough especially if you act on day 3 note that this is why you must buy the call with the far date   it is your insurance against a big move against you and getting assigned on your short call at a price that you can not cover with the ira you have some additional concerns over regular cash account namely you can not freely contribute new cash any time that you want   that means that you have to have some coherent strategy in place here that ensures you can cover your obligations no matter what scenario   usually brokers put additional restrictions on trades within iras just for this reason finally in the cash account and assuming that you are assigned on your short call you could potentially could get hit with a good faith cash liquidation or free riding violation when your short call is assigned depending on how you deliver the stock and other things that you 're doing in the same account   there are other questions on that on this site and lots of information online   the rules are n't super simple so i wo n't try to reproduce them here   some related questions to those rules an external reference also on potential violations in a cash account

i am not sure about transferwise and how they work but generally when i had to transfer money across countries i ended up using a foreign currency transfer company who needed the destination account details i.e. a gbp account in the uk in your case and money from the source account basically that means your father would need to open an eur account probably in an eu country is this an option but may be in the uk is fine too depending on transfer fees and a gbp account in the uk perhaps see if there is a better business account than hsbc around i have used them as well as santander before the only fx transaction done in this straightforward set up is the one performed by the specialised company there are a few and their spread difference between interbank i.e. official and your price is likely to be around 1.0 1.5 the other expenses are transfer fees to the fx company account say a flat fee of $ 25 for the swift payment the full amount less the spread above then goes to your uk gbp account there are still the running costs of both eur and gbp accounts of course but here the advice would be just to shop around for offers free banking periods etc point being given the saving in fx conversion it might still be a better overall deal than just letting hsbc deal with it all

i concur with the other answers about not mixing family and money the one whose loans are paid off second will be taking the credit risk of the other not paying being able to pay there may also be tax implications that said if you do still want to do this i think there 's a fairly straightforward way to account for the payments with your scenario your brother should make you a personal loan at some interest rate 5 and 10 that loan would be tracked independently of the actual student loans any money that your brother transfers to you to pay off your loans add to that personal loan and later on once your loans are paid off you start repaying the loan to him and he uses the proceeds for his own loans the interest rate will determine how the benefit of paying off the 10 loans is shared if the rate is set at 10 then your brother will get all the benefit if 5 you will get all the benefit and 7.5 would roughly share it out this means that you can still manage your own student loans separately your brother can choose how little or much to commit to the snowball rather than his own loans of course he should first make the minimum payments on his own loans anything he does loan you benefits you both if we ignore the credit and tax issues he gets more than the 5 interest on his own loans and you pay less than the 10 interest on your loans you 'll need to track the payments each way on this personal loan and apply interest to it every so often i 'd suggest monthly beware that the monthly equivalent of 5 annual interest is not because of compounding

this sounds a lot like an equity indexed annuity   they date from about 1996 there is a bit of skepticism about them as they are tricky to understand for the typical investor   for instance an equity indexed annuity pays a portion of the gain in an index like s&p 500 when the stock market rises and guarantees you wo n't lose if it falls   in an arbitrage sense it is roughly equivalent to buying a mixture of bonds and index call options there are a lot of complicated tweaks on these such as annual ratchet annual reset interest caps etc there is quite a bit of debate about whether they are too good to be true so i 'd read a few articles with pros and cons before buying one these are also commonly called fixed indexed annuities

scanned or electronic copies of invoices should be sufficient as long as they are accurate and you can deliver them during an audit also if you have an accountant prepare your taxes you would either need to provide them a copy of the invoices or a summary of them with the corresponding amounts to be claimed personally i prefer to print out a paper copy and file that away with that quarter 's and year 's other tax documents i do my own taxes and find paper copies handy as i can go through each invoice receipt and make sure i have entered its information by ticking it i find that when handling a large number of documents that paper copies are more easy to handle than electronic ones in the end you will need to use a system that you feel comfortable with and are able to use effectively

i think you 're doing the right thing one of the benefits of tax deferred account aside of it being tax deferred is that it keeps the money locked from you some people think it 's a bad thing i think it 's a good thing the amount of money locked is not that significant relatively to your income 10 in your case which is a lot relatively to others of your age and shows that you think ahead and plan for your future but it builds up a cushion to fall to when you 're old many people do n't think of the time they 're old or think they 'll be the same or better income wise as they 're now that is not so although during the period of your life your marginal tax will indeed grow in the end it goes back down again for most of the people and that is because your income goes down it is then that you need the money you 're putting aside now and the more you put aside and the earlier you put it aside the more you will have then the fact that it 's locked promises that you will have it then not before when you want to buy a house you ca n't afford or impress a girl with a car you ca n't pay for in my mind that 's the best benefit and the fact that the earlier you start putting the money there the more gains it will acquire until you actually need it so keep up the good work and save for your future lock out that 10 and invest the rest in other channels which may be more risky and with more potential gains

i think this is really two questions dumbcoder has already answered part 1 in a comment either just wire the money from the japanese bank account to the uk bank account either bank should be able to help you with the details of this or if your bank also has a uk operation you may be able to do it within the same bank   as for part 2 if you are looking for a mortgage then many high street mortgage providers banks will want proof of your savings up front they may or may not accept japanese bank statements all you can do is ask the question you would probably also need to ask your japanese bank if they can provide statements in english   if you find that most or all of the high street banks will not accept this as proof of assets or that they demand that the money is in the uk for a period of time first then you might have more luck with a mortgage broker who can deal with the specialist requirement if you do find a mortgage provider who is happy to accept japanese bank statements as proof of assets then you would simply need to wire the money direct from your bank in japan to the uk bank of your solicitor at or shortly before the point when the deposit becomes due usually at exchange of contracts

does it ever make sense yes but almost never   if you 're in a situation where you 're invested in something with low rates think government securities or cash equivalents then you do need to think about rate spread as you mention does the savings over the life over the mortgage beat out the 35 hit now plus all the interest you would earn over those 20 years have you factored in other considerations such as mortgage interest deduction on taxes do n't forget you need to think about how rates will change down the line they ca n't go much lower so potentially you 'll get better rates in the 401(k down the line do n't forget there 's also the impact of inflation again the rates on your savings may go up but your mortgage is a fixed payment so with even a low rate of inflation your payments effectively become less over time if your investments are in something like stocks and bonds then i would say undoubtedly you would want to keep the money in the 401(k time in market and compounding are your best friends over a long time horizon also as mentioned by @johnfx the hit of your 35 now is something you will absolutely feel now hopefully not but your life situation could change where you have an emergency and need to drain your savings or you may not see the end of that 20 years

you should ensure that your broker is a member of the securities investor protection corporation sipc sipc protects the cash and securities in your brokerage account much like the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic protects bank deposits securities are protected with a limit of $ 500,000 usd cash is protected with a limit of $ 250,000 usd it should be noted that sipc does not protect investors against loss of value or bad advice as far as having multiple brokerage accounts for security i personally do n’t think it ’s necessary to have multiple accounts for that reason depending on account or transaction fees it might not hurt to have multiple accounts it can actually be beneficial to have multiple accounts so long as each account serves a purpose in your overall financial plan for example i have three brokerage accounts each of which serves a specific purpose one provides low cost stock and bond transactions another provides superior market data and the third provides low cost mutual fund transactions if you ’re worried about asset security there are a few things you can do to protect yourself i would recommend you begin by consulting a qualified financial advisor about your risk profile you stated that a considerable portion of your total assets are in securities depending on your risk profile and the amount of your net worth held in securities you might be better served by moving your money into lower risk asset classes i ’m not an attorney or a financial advisor this is not legal advice or financial advice you can and should consult your own attorney and financial advisor

with the standard i am not a lawyer disclaimer consider this question if you and your girlfriend split up sometime after purchasing the house but before getting married would you expect her to repay you for the closing costs and downpayment   that is if you write her a check for $ 5k and 6 months after she signs the papers for the house one of you decides to break up with the other would you expect her to write you a check for $ 5k in return    that is the difference between a gift and a loan disguised as a gift   if the answer is no you do n't expect it back then everything is fine and you 're in the clear it 's perfectly legal to give someone money   if the answer is yes you would want to be paid back then it 's not a gift and you run the risk of running afoul of the regulations    with respect to a previous answer about gifting money that is not taxed in the us one person can give another up to $ 14,000 without worrying about gift taxes and even in the event that you exceed that amount the excess would simply eat into the lifetime exemption of $   individual states may have different rules and exempt amounts that would apply to state taxes    please also consider the income issue for your rental agreement   your gf would be expected to declare that amount and pay income tax on it as a business   she might also declare part of that amount as expected income for purposes of securing the loan but that may run into its own issues you 're not a roommate and presumably the home is not a duplex or set up as apartments and presumably she would not offer a similar deal to someone other than you

bigger than the three mentioned above is on time payment and/or collections activity if your report shows you have not paid accounts on time or have accounts in collections that is almost guaranteed decline except for the least desirable cards another factor is number of hard inquiries if you have been on a recent application spree you will get declined for too many recent inquiries wait 12 18 months for the inquiries to roll off your report applications for business cards are a little tricky depending on whether you are applying as an individual or as an employee of a corporation i usually stay away from these as you can be liable for company debts you did not charge under the right circumstances

the reason on line savings accounts ally capitalone american express and many others provide much higher rates than brick and mortar banks is because they 're not brick and mortar they do not need to pay for a huge amount of real estate utilities public facing employees inter office mail security etc etc all that allows them to pay more for your money the back office of these banks is the same as that of chase boa or wells fargo its just that they do n't have the enormous expense of having a branch in every neighborhood while still reaching all the same population of depositors so no its not a scam these are reputable banks some have physical offices for example i know that capitalone has some branches in new york some do n't iirc neither ally nor american express federal saving bank have physical branches but they 're banks nonetheless insured as required by fdic or ncua in case of credit unions and provide all the same services for less or all the same savings for more if you will imho giving 0.01 apr is a scam not the other way around the old style banks want your money for free and you 're worried why would someone else treat you better well that 's why the us has one of the most retarded financial systems in the western world

companies with existing borrowings where borrowings are on variable interest rates or in the case with fixed interest rates companies that get new borrowings would pay less interest on these borrowings so their cost will go down and profits up making them more attractive to investors   so in general lower interest rates will make the share market a more attractive investment than some alternatives as investors are willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns this will usually result in the stock market rising as it is currently in the us edit the case for rising interest rates a central bank 's purpose when raising interest rates is to slow down an economy that is booming as interest rates rise consumers will tighten up their spending and companies will thus have less revenue on top of higher costs for maintaining existing borrowing with variable rates or new borrowing with fixed rates if rates are higher companies may also defer new borrowings to expand their business this will eventually lead to lower profits and lower valuation for these companies another thing that happens is that as banks start increasing interest for saving accounts investors will look for safety where they can get a higher return than before without the risk of the stock market   with lowering profits and valuations and investor 's money flowing out of shares and into the money market so will company share prices drop although this may lag a bit with the share market still booming due to greed but once the boom stops for the crash

i 'm trying to organize my financial papers as well   i have a and it 's tearing through my papers like a hot knife through butter i.e. awesome here 's how i 'm addressing organizing the paper i 'm organizing mine a little bit organically   here are the main parts so anyway all that to say that it 's not necessary to organize the files to the   if you want to that 's fine too but it 's a tradeoff   up front organization for possibly some time savings later   the search function available is decreasing the advantage of organizing your files carefully   if throwing all of your files in a digital pile makes your skin crawl then i wo n't force you otherwise but i 'm not worried about it for the time being what you 're doing with the other tracking sounds fine to me   others may have different insights there

i agree but we should be careful about how we put a value to the digital sales channel it does n't logically follow that 100 of online sales are additional revenue that domino 's would n't have seen otherwise those same customers could have ordered by phone if the online option were n't available although i 'll bet the fraction of people who would do that is small   basically it 's dangerous to value mutually exclusive sales channels by the revenue they generate because not all of that revenue would be lost if the sales channel was

that 's sort of what anti trust law does   the idea of anti trust law is n't to help small companies to compete   it 's to stop big companies from abusing consumers   that 's why you not only need to be a monopoly but you also have to abuse that monopoly position     a good comparison here may be the anti trust concerns with ratings over the years   as recently as just a few years ago though any such suits have been struck down   even though has a near 100 monopoly on the ratings industry there 's no evidence they 've used that monopoly to competition

gt despite the fact that this correlation between immigration and wages is well documented   link does not go to proper documentation link goes to another article on the same site with the title 3 reasons why mass immigration is bad for the economy and subtitle is immigration good for the economy   no not always please make up your minds   gt the evidence suggests otherwise including new data reported by fox   it looks like this bit is the closest thing there to proper data   gt just how bad is it according to the national association of home builders more than 56 percent of developers nationwide are reporting labor shortages    gt says the problems started when the recession hit and domestic construction workers dropped out of the market to find other jobs at the same time immigrant workers went back to their home countries but as the economy has picked up and the construction industry has heated up those workers have remained missing    yeah that 's not even close to as clear as they 're making it out to be   gt in fact according to ted of residential strategies inc. construction costs have risen by 30 this year the majority of which is due to higher wages and increased overtime pay   heh that fox article says wages are about 60 of costs a bit of math says that a 30 increase in costs that was due entirely to wage increases would mean wages had gone up by 50 that 's a missed opportunity by the article writers the headline really should say that wage growth is up to 50   math given $ 100 costs $ 60 would be labor a 30 increase is + $ 30 if that 's all from labor it would have gone from $ 60 to $ 90 and 90 60 = = 1.5 or a 50 increase     also back to the leading paragraph   gt there is a strong correlation between immigration particularly illegal immigration and wages   this should be obvious to anyone familiar with the fundamental principle of supply and demand more supply workers means lower prices wages and vice versa   there 's an example of how it 's nowhere near that simple at   gt many claim that immigrants negatively affect the labour market prospects of native workers in advanced countries this column studies a large change in immigration restrictions in the us the 1965 exclusion of almost half a million mexican seasonal farm workers from the us labour market the exclusion did not increase the employment or wages of native workers and technology adoption was one of the adjustment channels    note i 'm not saying wrong this time the article is specifically about a case where there was existing technology available to replace the lost workers

every austrian student is required to do a bachelor thesis the research is very basic nothing like a master 's thesis where you do proper research on a topic as i said my goal is to be done by the end of september if i can start with research in july a master 's thesis would certainly take significantly longer and more preparation for me it 's whether or not i can tie it into my place of employment

gt and just out of curiosity what do you do to unwind   run go to the gym come on the computer go out with friends watch a movie etc you do n't need a drug to unwind if you need a drug see a psychologist     gt you do n't drink or use tobacco or anything of the like   i drink like once a month socially i have an issue with daily users who complain they ca n't get a job or do n't want to take responsibility for their actions    gt but judging other people for wanting a beer or a cigarette or a joint is no way to go through life   why not if they cost me and everyone else money and cause tons of other problems they cost insurance rates to go higher they cause accidents they kill people the smoke in my face etc   if they were n't losers and were actually responsible it would be a different situation a big difference i see between alcohol and weed is that there are actually restrictions on when where and how you can have alcohol

do new automobiles typically release in low numbers and later you say   the car released 2 days ago i called around and discovered local dealers only have ~10 2018 's total for all so you are calling local dealers and they have ten after two days   let 's say you are in new york city population eight million about 2.5 of the united states population   that would suggest that there are around four hundred produced in two days 10 is 2.5 of 400 or two hundred a day   that would be four thousand a month assuming four weeks each with five   considering that the most sold in a month were in june of 2013 and march 's was the best this year that seems to be a decent pace if a little slow to start    now let 's assume that you are using a local area with a population of only two million   this could still be new york city if you only call dealers in a quarter of the area   their two day pace would put them on a rate to produce sixteen thousand the first month which is more than they can reasonably expect to sell    if your local area is an even smaller portion of the us overall this might not actually be low inventory    do n't forget that some dealers may also still have 2017 vehicles left   they might want to sell those before they order too many new vehicles   particularly as they may not know what feature packages sell best yet   if they 're willing to tell you that they have three and sold a fourth they should be eager to tell you how many they have   a high 2018 price gives them a better chance to sell the at a profit    if you really want to check if they are having production problems ask how long it will be to order a vehicle   for a us manufactured car special order should fall in the five to eight weeks range   if that 's what they 're quoting then there probably are not production problems    when trading with a dealer do your research tell them what you believe a fair price is and then be ready to walk if they wo n't give it to you   be up front   tell them that you 're willing to pay $ x to the first dealer that takes the offer   you 'd prefer that dealer because whatever maybe they 're closest but you are n't paying more than $ x.   if they let you get in your car and drive away then they really think they can get a better price
