i found some uk personal accounts offer up to 3 interest no names here but it is well known bank with red logo you can take out directors loan from your company put the cash into that personal account and earn interest just do n't forget to return this loan before end of financial year so this interest does not become your dividends

the way i see it capitalism only works when you have people with good civic values involved people like carnegie warren buffet etc who not only accumulate wealth but then direct it for the benefit of society as a whole as well as for their own benefit i believe that many capitalists use their wealth to create this leads to aristocracy which is and also spoiled rotten trust fund babies which are the worst people in the world capitalism without values is horrible just like any other system i 'm a business man but i 'm not interested in getting ahead by screwing other people and i certainly give back to my community in my own small way it 's good for business too people like to patronize businesses that give back

a minimum purchase quantity just means that you need to round your result up to the nearest 100 in your example it comes out evenly if we look at an example where it does n't come out even you 'd round up and round that up to 700 due to purchase quantities for a slightly more complex and accurate approach you 'd then evaluate how many of the extras you had to buy due to the minimum purchase quantity would need to be sold so you 'd have to sell of the 700 purchased to break even

your mortgage represents a negative cash flow of $ x for n months the typical mortgage prepayment does n't reduce your next payment but does reduce the length of the mortgage if you look at the amortization table of a 30 year loan you might see a payment of $ 1000 but only $ 50 going to principal so if on day one you send an extra $ 51 or so to the bank you find that in 30 years you just saved that $ 1000 payment in effect it was a long term bond or cd yielding the post tax rate of the mortgage say your loan were 7 at 7 money doubles every 10 years or so 30 years is 3 doubles or if i were to offer you $ 1000 and ask for $ 7500 in 30 years you might accept it with an agreement to buy me out if you refinanced for me that would be an investment just like buying a bond in fact there is a real return as you see the cash flow at the end the payments not made are your payback   those who insist it 's not an investment are correct in the strict sense of the word 's definition but pedantic for the fact in practice the prepayment is a choice to be considered alongside other investment choices when i have a mortgage i am the the bank the mortgagee same as a company issuing a bond the bank holds my bond and i 'm making payments to them they hold my bond as an investment there is no question of that in fact they package these and sell them as groups of mortgages a pre payment is me buying back the last coupon on my mortgage i fail to see the distinction between me buying back $ 10 k in future coupons on my own loan or me investing $ 10 k in someone else 's loans   the real question for me is whether this makes sense when rates are so low at 4 i 'd say it 's a matter of prioritizing any high rate debt and any other investments that might yield more but even so it 's an investment yielding 4   over the years i 've developed the priorities of where to put new money the priorities are debatable i have my opinion and my reasons to back them up in general it 's a balance between risk and return in my opinion there 's something wrong with ignoring a dollar for dollar match on the 401(k in most circumstances others seem to prefer being 100 debt free before saving at all there 's a balance that might be different for each individual as i started the mortgage is a fixed return with no chance to just get it back if needed if your cash savings is pretty high and the choice is a .001 cd or prepay a 4 mortgage i 'd use some funds to pay it down but not to the point you have no liquid reserves

there 's a key assumption made in the calculation of theta that the future price movement of the underlying is a random walk the amount of life left in the option times the volatility of the underlying creates a probability distribution of the price of the underlying at expiration at any given price point you can calculate the theta of the option the at the money values are the most likely the way in or way out of the money values are much less likely theta is constructed mathematically to decay linearly over time so the strikes with the most theta lose the most theta each day if you are looking for a more intuitive answer the otm calls have less theta than the atm calls because while they are both 100 time value the otm calls cost much less so it 's 100 of a smaller number remember decay is linear

gt;i would imagine that given any lack of compulsory regulation that americans are using whatever means of payment that suits them   i 'd agree it 's almost entirely about competition and consumer protections in areas like banking outside of the us rather than compulsory regulation pushing people to use particular approaches   i run a company in the uk processing cheques is expensive and awkward its a manual process it costs money at basically all points of the process and is more likely to result in a failed payment for me compared to almost every other method of payment so i prefer and actively encourage the use of electronic payments instead   i can do that because my bank does n't charge extra for processing electronic payments in fact it 's now cheaper to process them than cheques that also makes sense from the banks perspective given it costs more money for them to maintain offer and process cheque payments to the point that they are already essentially converting them into electronic payments by scanning    it 's not americans being backward it 's us banks   i doubt that if you had safe secure cheap and reliable electronic payment facilities with the same level of protection and control as with a cheque most americans would take the same approach as they do elsewhere after all its convenient

having someone else paying you rent is always going to be the better deal financially the question is what does $ 450k buy in the neighborhood in which you want to live vs $ 800k i 'm going to assume you can afford either option buying a $ 450k home and not selling or an $ 800k home and selling your current one whether someone 's paying you rent or not let 's make up some numbers here a $ 450k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30 years will cost you about $ in p&i payments per year plus escrows such as re taxes pmi and homeowners insurance where applicable an $ 800k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30yr will give you payments of about $ before taxes and insurance so the worst case overall is that you buy a 450k home in the new neighborhood and are not at any given time collecting rent on the old property that would assuming the mortgage terms on both home loans were comparable cost you $ and you 'd be living in a $ 450k home in a neighborhood where 450k may not buy a home as nice as the one you moved out of the question as i stated above is this assuming you had a reliable tenant in your home for the entire remaining life of the loan on your current home which is more acceptable to you buying $ 450k of home which might be a downgrade in sqft or amenities and paying $ 2020 in p&i or paying about a grand more $ for a much nicer home in the new location strictly from a money perspective the renter is going to be the best option if you get reliable tenancy for the entire life of the mortgage on that house you 'll be paying $ for 30 years which is $ to end up with $ of total home value plus adjustments for actual home value appreciation depreciation that 's the only way you 'll come out ahead on any mortgage have someone else pay most of it for you if you do n't rent the $ 800k home will cost you $ while two $ 450k homes will cost you $ the percentage of home value over total payments for the 800k home would be 72 you will have paid 137 of the value of the home while you will have paid of the value of two 450k homes

you 're not going to like this answer   you might be able to get out of the car you probably wo n't be able to get out of the loan   option 1 sell the car privately you 'll get more in a private sale and get a private loan for the difference between the sale price and what you owe   option 2 if you go to a dealership that advertises that they will take any trade no matter how much you owe they will roll your balance less your trade in value into your new loan so for example let 's say you buy a car for and borrow $ 20,000 the dealership gives you $ 6,000 for your trade because that 's what they do that leaves $ 9,000 on your loan and you will end up borrowing $ to buy a $ 20,000 car dealerships can be surprisingly accommodating but a lot of car buyers do n't understand the terms of what they 're getting into i actually knew someone a few years ago who left a dealership with a new car and could n't tell you anything about the deal beyond her monthly payment   option 3 hang on to the car and throw every extra penny at it to get the balance down on the loan until you can get it to the point where you can sell it trade it in or refi it without putting out a big one time cash payment

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

the difference is ordinary income if the price drops and you sell for exactly what you paid you have an income of d and a capital loss of d which usually cancel each other but not always for example if you already have over $ 3000 in losses this loss wo n't help you it will carry forward   the above changes a bit if you hold the stock for 2 years after the beginning of the purchase period if sold between your purchase price and fair market the day you bought the gain is only the difference no gain to fair market + loss    pretty convoluted your company should have provided you with a brief faq q&a to explain this   my friends at fairmark have an article that explains the espp process clearly tax reporting for qualifying of espp shares

this is second hand information as i am not a millionaire but i work with such people everyday and have an understanding of how they handle cash the wealthy people do n't simple definitely not if they do n't have to cash is a tool to them that they use only if they get benefit of it being a cash transaction one of my friends is a re seller and he gets a 10 discount from suppliers for settling lines using cash everything else they place on a line of credit for people who dislike credit cards and pay using atm or debit cards might actually have a very poor understanding of leverage i assure you the wealthy people have a very good understanding of it frankly wealthy people pay less for everything but they deserve it because of the extreme amount of leverage they have built for themselves their aprs are low their credit limits are insanely high they have longer billing periods and they get spoiled by credit card vendors all the time for example when you buy your groceries at walmart you pay at least a 4 markup because that 's the standardized cost of processing credit cards even if you paid in cash a wealthy person uses his credit card to pay for the same but earns the same percentage amount in cash back points and what not i am sure littleadv placed the car purchase on his credit card for similar reasons the even more wealthy have their groceries shipped to their houses and if they pay cash i wo n't be surprised if they actually end up paying much less for fresh organic vegetables than what equivalent produce at walmart would get them i apologize for not being able to provide citations for these points i make as they are personal observations

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

you can be a co borrower on the property that your father owns some banks require that you also be part owner of the property some banks do not require this you can take a home loan for a new property normally banks will ask you of all your current loans auto other home etc to determine the amount they will be ready to lend edit the first loan i believe your father already has a property in his name your father can apply for loan against property if he does not have sufficient income then you can guarantee the loan ie co sign on the loan some banks allow this however there is no tax benefit on this loan      the second is the home loan for the balance amount that you would get it both the loans can be taken from the same bank there would be a overall cap as to the amount of loan a bank would give depending on your income further the finance for this house will only be to the extent of 80 of the value

yes there are several downsides to this strategy you are n't taking into account commissions if you pay $ 5 each time you buy or sell a stock you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts this next point sounds obvious but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this your commissions may eat away all of your profits commissions represent a fixed cost so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade since you 're in the us you 're required to follow the sec rules on pattern day trading from that link finra rules define a pattern day trader as any customer who executes four or more day trades within five business days provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customer ’s total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period if you trip this rule you 'll be required to maintain $ 25,000 in a margin brokerage account if you ca n't maintain the balance your account will be locked do n't forget about capital gains taxes since you 're holding these securities for less than a year your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates you can deduct your capital losses too assuming you do n't repurchase the same security within 30 days because in that case the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss but it 's important to think about gains and losses in real terms not nominal terms the story is different if you make these trades in a tax sheltered account like an ira but the other problems still apply you 're implicitly assuming that the stock 's prices are skewed in the positive direction remember that you have limit orders placed at the upper and lower bounds of the range so if the stock price decreases before it increases your limit order at the lower bound will be triggered and you 'll trade at a loss if you 're hoping to make a profit through buying low and selling high you want a stock that hits its upper bound before hitting the lower bound the majority of the time unless you have data analysis not just your intuition or a pattern you 've talked yourself into from looking at a chart to back this up you 're essentially gambling that more often than not the stock price will increase before it decreases it 's dangerous to use any strategy that you have n't backtested extensively find several months or years of historical data either intra day or daily data depending on the time frame you 're using to trade and simulate your strategy exactly this helps you determine the potential profitability of your strategy and it also forces you to decide on a plan for precisely when you want to invest do you invest as soon as the stock trades in a range which algorithms can determine far better than intuition it also helps you figure out how to manage your risk and how much loss you 're willing to accept for risk management using limit orders is a start but see my point above about positively skewed prices limit orders are n't enough in general if an active investment strategy seems like a no brainer or too good to be true it 's probably not viable in general as a retail investor it 's foolish to assume that no one else has thought of your simple active strategy to make easy money i can promise you that someone has thought of it trading firms have quantitative researchers that are paid to think of and implement trading strategies all the time   if it 's viable at any scale they 'll probably already have utilized it and arbitraged away the potential for small traders to make significant gains trust me you 're not the first person who thought of using limit orders to make easy money off volatile stocks the fact that you 're asking here and doing research before implementing this strategy however means that you 're on the right track it 's always wise to research a strategy extensively before deploying it in the wild to answer the question in your title since it could be interpreted a little differently than the body of the question no there 's nothing wrong with investing in volatile stocks indexes etc i certainly do and i 'm sure many others on this site do as well it 's not the investing that gets you into trouble and costs you a lot of money it 's the rapid buying and selling and attempting to time the market that proves costly which is what you 're doing when you implicitly bet that the distribution of the stock 's prices is positively skewed to address the commission fee problem assuming a fee of $ 8 per trade and a minimum of $ 100 profit per sale commissions are n't your only problem and counting on $ 100 profit per sale is a significant assumption look at point 4 above through your use of limit orders you 're making the implicit assumption that more often than not the price will trigger your upper limit order before your lower limit order here 's a simple example let 's assume you have limit orders placed at + 2 and -2 of your purchase price and that triggering the limit order at + 2 earns you $ 100 profit while triggering the limit order at -2 incurs a loss of $ 100 assume your commission is $ 5 on each trade   if your upper limit order is triggered you earn a profit of 100 10 = 90 then set up the same set of limit orders again if your lower limit order is triggered this time you incur a loss of 100 + 10 = 110 so your net gain is 90 110 = -20 this is a perfect example of why when taking into account transaction costs even strategies that at first glance seem profitable mathematically can actually fail   if you set up the same situation again and incur a loss again 100 + 10 = 110 you 're now down -20 110 = to make a profit you need to make two profitable trades without incurring further losses   this is why point 4 is so important whenever you trade it 's critical to completely understand the risk you 're taking and the bet you 're actually making not just the bet you think you 're making also according to my algorithm a sale only takes place once the stock rises by 1 or 2 points otherwise the stock is held until it does does this mean you 've removed the lower limit order if yes then you expose yourself to downside risk what if the stock has traded within a range then suddenly starts declining because of bad earnings reports or systemic risks to name a few if you have n't removed the lower limit order then point 4 still stands   however i never specified that the trades have to be done within the same day   let the investor open up 5 brokerage accounts at 5 different firms for safeguarding against being labeled a pattern day trader each account may only hold 1 security at any time for the span of 1 business week how do you control how long the security is held you 're using limit orders which will be triggered when the stock price hits a certain level regardless of when that happens maybe that will happen within a week or maybe it will happen within the same day once again the bet you 're actually making is different from the bet you think you 're making can you provide some algorithms or methods that do work for generating some extra cash on the side aside from purchasing s&p 500 type index funds and waiting when i purchase index funds it 's not to generate extra liquid cash on the side i do n't invest nearly enough to be able to purchase an index fund and earn substantial dividends i do n't want to get into any specific strategies because i 'm not in the business of making investment recommendations and i do n't want to start furthermore i do n't think explicit investment recommendations are welcome here unless it 's describing why something is a bad idea and i agree with that policy i will make a couple of points however understand your goals are you investing for retirement or a shorter horizon e.g. some side income you seem to know this already but i include it for future readers   if a strategy seems too good to be true it probably is educate yourself before designing a strategy research fundamental analysis different types of orders e.g. so you fully understand that you do n't have control over when limit orders are executed different sectors of the market if that 's where your interests lie etc personally i find some sectors fascinating so researching them thoroughly allows me to make informed investment decisions as well as learn about something that interests me understand your limits how much money are you willing to risk and possibly lose do you have a risk management strategy in place to prevent unexpected losses what are the costs of the risk management itself backtest backtest backtest ideally your backtesting and simulating should be identical to actual market conditions and incorporate all transaction costs and a wide range of historical data get other opinions evaluate those opinions with the same critical eye as i and others have evaluated your proposed strategy

patience is the key here i hate to say there are five factors to fico credit scores   payment history is adversely affected by late payments so always pay on time otherwise your report will be for seven years credit utilization has to do with how much of your available credit is currently in use lower is better but 0 is n't good either because they want to see that you 're using credit 10 or less is a good goal and try to keep any single card balance to 30 or less when its statement close date rolls around credit history is based on the average age of all of your accounts cards or otherwise the older the better do n't close either of your other cards because that would cause your average account age to fall and make sure to use the store card at least occasionally because lenders sometimes decide to close unused lines of credit credit mix has to do with the different types of credit you hold and is why your bank 's website suggested taking out a loan it also has to do with the number of accounts overall i 've never found a satisfactory answer for what the sweet spot is but i suspect it 's in the 6 12 range you would n't want to get several new ones at the same time because new credit is affected by the credit inquiries hard pulls that occur when you apply for new cards or loans inquiries stay on your report for two years before falling off this is almost certainly where your score dropped you also mentioned not knowing if some hospital bills are still affecting your score you 'll want to review your credit reports and find out plus checking your credit reports regularly is a really great habit to get into because errors and fraud can and do happen there are three credit reporting agencies experian equifax and transunion and you 'll want to review all three you can get one free report from each of them every year it can take a couple of months for a new credit account to show up on your credit report so your score should recover and go even higher once that happens sit tight as annoying as that is

i can only answer about the u.s. for question 2 i believe the answer is no if you are a non resident alien for tax purposes then only income connected to the u.s. is reported as income on the tax return unless there were any non deductible contributions to your pre tax iras when you convert to roth ira the entire amount of the conversion is added to your income so the tax consequence is the same as if you had that much additional u.s. income if you are a non resident alien with no other income in the u.s. then the income you have to report on your u.s. tax return will basically consist of the conversion non resident aliens do not have a standard deduction however all people have a personal exemption if we take 2013 as an example the exemption is $ 3900 per person we will assume that you will file as single or married filing separately non resident aliens can not file as married filing jointly the first $ 3900 of income is covered by the exemption and is not counted in taxable income for single and the next $ of income is taxed at 10 then next $ of income is taxed at 15 and so on so if you convert less than the personal exemption amount every year $ 3900 in 2013 then in theory you do not pay any taxes if you convert a little bit more then some of the conversion will be taxed at 10 etc

a mutual fund has several classes of shares that are charged different fees some shares are sold through brokers and carry a sales charge called load that compensates the broker in lieu of a fee that the broker would charge the client for the service   vanguard does not have sales charge on its funds and you do n't need to go through a broker to buy its shares you can buy directly from them   admiral shares of vanguard funds are charged lower annual expenses than regular shares yes all mutual funds charge expenses for fund that reduce the return that you get and vanguard has some of the lowest expense ratios but admiral shares are available only for large investments typically $ 50 k or so   if you have invested in a vanguard mutual fund your shares can be set to automatically convert to admiral shares when the investment reaches the right level a mutual fund manager can buy and sell stocks to achieve the objectives of the fund so what you are invested in as a share holder in a mutual fund will typically be unknown to you on a day to day basis   on the other hand exchange traded funds etfs are fixed baskets of stocks and you can buy shares in the etf   these shares are bought and sold through a broker so you pay a transaction fee each time but expenses are lower since there is no manager to buy and sell stocks the basket is fixed many etfs follow specific market indexes e.g. s&p 500   another difference between etfs and mutual funds is that you can buy and sell etfs at any time of the day just as if you could if you held stocks with mutual funds any buy and sell requests   made during the day are processed at the end of the day and the value of the shares that you buy or sell is determined by the closing price of the stocks held by the mutual fund   with etfs you are getting the intra day price at the time the buy or sell order is executed by your broker

no income inside an rrsp is sheltered from income tax until you withdraw it that is indeed the major benefit of rrsps note that you will eventually declare this as income consider the following case in 2015 you make $ 1000 in income in 2015 you contribute $ 100 to your rrsps you store this in an account that pays interest rather than investing it in stocks bonds or mutual funds between 2015 and 2025 your money makes an additional $ 100 in interest in 2025 you are retired and pull out the entire amount in your rrsp i.e. $ 200 now between 2015 and 2025 you did not declare the income from interest you 'd have had to do this if the money was in a regular bank account instead of an rrsp or a tfsa indeed your bank would have issued tax forms in that case but you do n't report income sheltered in an rrsp this is good as it increases the power of compounding in 2015 you pay tax on only $ 900 rather than the full $ 1000 in 2025 you pull out the entire $ 200 you report all $ 200 as income or actually as a withdrawal from your rrsp but it 's the same thing you pay tax on the initial $ 100 investment which you did not do in 2015 and you also pay tax on the $ 100 that your investment has made and which you are now pulling out the hope is that your income is now lower as you are retired so you 'll end up paying less income tax plus your investment has had many years of opportunity to compound tax free you do n't pay tax on or report gains in an rrsp account the bank or investment house wo n't even issue tax forms not until you withdraw the money

a company typically goes public in order to bring in additional capital in an ipo the company through its officials will typically do so by issuing additional shares and offering to sell those to investors if they did not do that then there would be no net capital gain for the company if person a sells share in company c to person b then company c does not benefit directly from the exchange by issuing and selling additional shares the total value of all stock in the company can increase being publicly traded also greatly increases the confidence in the valuation of the company as a consequence of the perfect market theory there is nothing in this that says that initial investors cofounders employees etc need to sell their shares in the process they might choose to do so or they might not or they might be prevented from doing so by terms of any agreements that they have signed or by insider trading laws compare what happens to internal stock when a company goes public depending on specifics it might be reasonable for the company to perform a share split prior to the initial public offering that however does n't affect the total value of the shares only the price per share

short answer you 're going to end up paying taxes on it despite the home being your primary residence you do n't meet the ownership test and it is n't noted that you have had a change in employment health or other unforeseen circumstances that are forcing you to sell otherwise you could qualify for a reduced maximum exclusion that might allow you to walk away without owing taxes or with a reduced tax bill you ca n't even do a 1031 exchange to re invest into a new primary residence you should check with a tax professional to see what adjustments you can make to the cost basis of the property to minimize your reported net profits during the 5-year period prior to the sale you must have these periods do not necessarily have to coincide you do n't to live in it as your main house for 2 consecutive years just 2 years worth of time of the last 5

hopefully this $ 1000 is just a start and not the last investment you will ever make assuming that there are a couple of big questions to consider one what are you saving for are you thinking that this is for retirement 40 or 50 years from now or something much sooner like buying a car or a house you did n't say where you live in the u.s. if you put money into an ira or a 401k or some other account that the government classes as a retirement account you do n't pay taxes on the profits from the investment only on the original principal if you leave the money invested for a long period of time the profits can be many times the original investment so this makes a huge difference   like suppose that you pay 15 of your income in state and local taxes   and suppose you invest your $ 1000 in something that gives a 7 annual return and leave it there for 40 years of course i 'm just making up numbers for an example but i think these are in a plausible range and i 'm ignoring the difference between regular income tax and capital gains tax etc etc it does n't change the point if you put the money in a classic ira you pay 0 taxes the year you open the account so you have your full $ 1000 figure that compound interest for 40 years you 'll end up with crunch crunch crunch the numbers $ then you pay 15 when you take it leaving you with $ the end result with a roth ira is exactly the same feel free to crunch those numbers but now suppose you invest in a no retirement account so you have to pay taxes every year your original investment is only $ 850 because you have to pay tax on that and your effective return is only because you have to pay 15 of the 7 so after 40 years you have crunch crunch $ quite a difference but if you put money in a retirement account and then take it out before you retire you pay substantial penalties i think it 's 20 if you plan to take the money out after a year or two   that would really hurt two how much risk are you willing to take the reality of investment is that almost always the more risk you take the bigger the potential returns and vice versa investments that are very safe tend to have very low returns as you 're young if you 're saving for retirement you can probably afford a fairly high amount of risk if you lose a lot of money this year odds are you 'll get it back over the next few years or at least be able to put more money into investments to make up for it if you 're 64 and planning to retire next year you want to take very low risk investments in general investing in government bonds is very safe but has very low returns corporate bonds are less safe but offer higher returns stocks are a little more of course different companies have different levels of risk new start ups tend to be very risky but can give huge returns commodities are much higher risk buying on margin or selling short are ways to really leverage your money but you could end up losing more than you invested mutual funds are a relatively safe way to invest in stocks and bonds because they spread your risk over many companies three how much effort are you willing to put into managing your investments how much do you know about the stock market and the commodities market and international finance and so on and how much are you willing to learn if your answer is that you know a lot about these things or are willing to dive in and learn a lot that you can invest in individual stocks bonds commodities etc if your answer is that you really do n't know much about all this then it makes a lot of sense to just put your money into a mutual fund and let the people who manage the fund do all the work

open an investment account on your own and have them roll the old 401 k accounts into either a roth or traditional ira do not leave them in old 401k accounts and definitely do n't roll them into your new employer 's 401k. why well as great as 401 k accounts are there is one thing that employers rarely mention and the 401 k companies actively try to hide     most 401 k plans are loaded with huge fees you wo n't see them on your statements they are often hidden very cleverly with accounting tricks for example in several plans i have participated in the mutual fund symbols may look like the ones you see on the stock tickers but if you read the fine print they only approximate the underlying mutual fund they are named for that is if you multiply the number of shares by the market price you will arrive at a number higher than the one printed on your statement   the spread between those numbers is the fee charged by the 401 k management company and since employees do n't pick that company and ca n't easily fire them they are n't very competitive unless your company is really large and has a tough negotiator in hr if you work for a small company you are probably getting slammed by these fees also they often charge fees for the automatic rebalancing service they offer to do annually to your account to keep your allocation in line with your current contribution allocations   i have no idea why it is legal for them not to disclose these fees on the statements but they do n't i had to do some serious digging to find this out on my own and when i did it was downright scary in one case they were siphoning off over 3 annually from the account using this standard practice however that is not to say that you should n't participate in these plans especially if there is an employer match there are fees with any investment account and the free money your employer is kicking in almost always offsets these fees my point here is just that you should n't keep the money in the 401 k after you leave the company when you have an option to move it to an account with much cheaper fees

in march the news it shaping up data giving rise new economy did a feature on data and had an interesting take on antitrust rules    as with other laws including tax the statute is woefully behind the market i think the implications of big data require the concept monopolies to be as companies can gather data across the multitude of platforms you 're ok with they are able to better understand consumers the threat is if everyone uses google maps or waze owned by google google could create a monopoly on traffic driving human habits data   an analog to this is thinking about insurance large insurance companies can rely on huge amounts of data to model out their risk reward on policies this will allow them to make better decisions and price themselves better in the market than smaller competitors without this data some governments require large insurance companies to share data with smaller ones as a form of antitrust rules   i agree that sheer size is n't an issue however i think more thought has to be put on the monopoly of data

littleadv has given you excellent general advice but to my mind the most important part of it all and the path which i will strongly recommend you follow is the suggestion to look into a mutual fund i would add even more strongly   go to a mutual fund company directly     and make an investment with them directly instead of making the     investment through a brokerage account   pick an index fund with low expenses e.g. there are s&p 500 index funds available with   expenses that are a fraction of 1 however many also require minimum investments on the order of $ 2500 or $ 3000 except for ira accounts   at this time your goal should be to reduce expenses as much as possible because expenses whether they be in brokerage fees which may be directly visible to you or mutual fund expenses which are invisible to you are what will eat away at your return far more than the difference between the returns of various investments

understandably it appears as if one must construct the flows oneself because of the work involved to include every loan variation first it would be best to distinguish between cash and accrued otherwise known as the economic costs the cash cost is as you 've identified the payment   this is a reality for cash management and it 's wise that you wish to track it however by accruals the only economic cost involved in the payment is the interest   the reason is because the rest of the payment flows from one form of asset to another so if out of a $ 1,000 payment $ 100 is principal repayment you have merely traded $ 100 of cash for $ 100 of house the cash costs will be accounted for on the cash flow statement while the accrued or economic costs will be accounted on the income statement it appears as if you 've accounted for this properly   however for the resolution that you desire the accounts must first flow through the income statement followed next instead of directly from assets to liabilities this is where you can get a sense of the true costs of the home   to get better accrual resolution credit cash and debit mortgage interest expense principal repayment   book the mortgage interest expense on the income statement and then cancel the principal repayment account with the loan account   the principal repayment should not be treated as an expense however the cash payment that pays down the mortgage balance should be booked so that it will appear on the cash flow statement because you were n't doing this before and you were debiting the entire payment off of the loan you should probably notice your booked loan account diverging from the actual   this proper booking will resolve that when you are comfortable with booking the payments you can book unrealized gains and losses by marking the house to market in this statement to get a better understanding of your financial position the cash flow statement with proper bookings should show how the cash has flowed so if it is according to standards household operations should show a positive flow from labor investments less the amount of interest expense while financing will show a negative flow from principal repayment   investing due to the home should show no change due to mortgage payments because the house has already been acquired thus there was a large outflow when cash was paid to acquire the home the program should give some way to classify accounts so that they are either operational investing or financing all income expenses are operational   all investments such as equities credit assets and the home are investing   all liabilities are financing to book the installment payment $ x which consists of $ y in interest and $ z in principal to resolve the reduction in principal as long as the accounts are properly classified gnucash probably does the rest for you but if not to resolve the expense finally net income is resolved my guess is that gnucash derives the cash flow statement indirectly but you can do the entry by simply in this case it happily resembles the first accrued entry but with cash that 's all that is necessary by the direct method

if you have maxed out your ira contribution for 2017 already and it all went into your roth ira then until the 2017 tax day in april 2018 you can remove any part of this contribution and the earnings from your roth ira without any tax consequences or penalties if you discover in early 2018 that you are not eligible or only partially eligible to contribute to a roth ira then of course you must remove all or part of your 2017 contributions and the earnings from your roth ira by the 2017 tax day in april 2018 indeed if you have filed for an extension of time to submit your 2017 tax return then you have until the extended due date to make the withdrawal as 's answer points out for 2017 you and withdraw and re contribute as many times as you like though if you push this idea to excess with the same ira custodian the custodian may start charging fees   note that irs publication 590b says in the roth ira section withdrawals of contributions by due date    if you withdraw contributions including any net earnings on the contributions by the due date of your return for the year in which you made the contribution the contributions are treated as if you never made them if you have an extension of time to file your return you can withdraw the contributions and earnings by the extended due date the withdrawal of contributions is tax free but you must include the earnings on the contributions in income for the year in which you made the contributions now if in the middle of all these transactions you need to take a distribution from your roth ira during 2017 say because you have a cash flow problem then it makes a lot of sense to first withdraw all your 2017 contributions and the earnings if more money is needed than you can take a distribution from your roth ira what the distribution consists of is described in great detail in publication 590b and you might have to pay a tax penalty for a   premature distribution depending on how much the distribution is the first dollars coming are assumed to be previous contributions in the order in which you made them and these are tax free and penalty free after that the rollover and conversion amounts start to come out and are penalized if they have not spent 5 years in the ira etc but you can put the money back into your roth ira within 60 days and avoid penalties   important notes regarding rollover transactions

your 5 8 year time frame is interesting because it is actually a two windows   when people are savings for retirement they tell us how many years or decades they have until they reach retirement age but they also imply that they are planning on spending decades withdrawing the money   but you wanting the money for a house in 5 8 years are needing the money more like somebody who is saving college money for a teenager in fact your plan is similar in time frame as a 13 year old has for their college fund start in 5 years but only have a 4 year spending window take the california 529 program beneficiary age 13 14 beneficiary age 18 + the funding agreement provides a minimum guaranteed rate of return on the > amounts allocated to it by the investment portfolio the minimum effective > annual interest rate will be neither less than 1 nor greater than 3 at > any time so you plan of investing 100 in the s&p with your window is way too risky you should only invest a portion of your down payment in equities and be prepared to only be in that mode for a few years any drop in the market now hurts you but one just before you need the funds would be devastating

as said the way to make money is to be there when large amounts of money are changing hands and take a little for yourself they 'll never notice that 's what transaction costs are when a fund buys or sells stocks a bit of the money goes to the folks who handle the transaction when you personally buy or sell stocks a bit of the money goes to the broker in the form of a fee and no no fee brokers do n't work for free they just hide the fee by not getting you the best possible price so frequent transactions i.e. higher portfolio turnover mean that those little bits of money are going to the intermediaries more often that 's what higher transaction costs refers to the costs are higher than in a fund that buys and sells less often in short those higher transaction costs are a consequence of higher turnover nothing nefarious there

in addition to what others have said i think it is important to consider that government retirement assistance whatever it is called in each instance is basically a promise that can be revoked i talked to a retired friend of mine just yesterday and we got onto that subject she mentioned that when she was young the promise was for 90 of one 's pay paid by the government after retiring it is very different today yes you can gamble that you wo n't need the saved money and thus decide not to save anything what then if you do end up needing the money you did not set aside but rather spent you are just now graduating college and assuming of course that you get a decently paying job are likely going to have loads more money than you are used to if you make an agreement with yourself to set aside even just 10 15 of the difference in income right from the start that is going to grow into a pretty sizable nest egg by the time you approach retirement age then you will have the option of continuing to work maybe part time or quitting in a way you would not have had otherwise now i 'm going to pull numbers out of thin air but suppose that you currently have $ 1000/month net before expenses and can get a job that pays $ net starting out 10 15 of the difference means you 'll be saving around $ 100/month for retirement in 35 years assuming no return on investment pessimistic but works if returns match inflation and no pay rises that will still be over $ that 's somewhere on the order of $ added to your retirement income for 25 years multiply with whatever inflation rate you think is likely if you prefer nominal values it becomes even more if you save a significant fraction of the additional pay if you save 1/3 of the additional money note that you still effectively get a 50 raise compared to what you have been living on before that gives you a net income of $ 1500/month instead of $ 1800 $ 500/month more rather than $ 800/month more which grows into about $ 110 k in 35 years assuming no return on investment nearly $ 400 per month for 25 years $ 100 per week is hardly chump change in retirement and it is still quite realistic for most people to save 30 of the money they did not have before

should i treat this house as a second home or a rental property on my 2015 taxes if it was not rented out or available for rent then you could treat it as your second home but if it was available for rent i.e. you started advertising you hired a property manager or made any other step towards renting it out but you just did n't happen to find a tenant yet then you can not so it depends on the facts and circumstances i 've read that if i treat this house as a rental property then the renovation cost is a capital expenditure that i can claim on my taxes by depreciating it over 28 years that is correct 27.5 years to be exact i 've also read that if i treat this house as a personal second home then i can not do that because the renovation costs are considered non deductible personal expenses that is not correct in fact in both cases the treatment is the same renovation costs are added to your basis in case of rental you get to depreciate the house since renovations are considered part of the house you get to depreciate them too in case of a personal use property you can not depreciate but the renovation costs still get added to the basis these are not expenses but does mortgage interest get deducted against my total income or only my rental income if it is a personal use second home you get to deduct the mortgage interest up to a limit on your schedule a. depending on your other deductions you may or may not have a tax benefit if it is a rental the interest is deducted from the rental income only on your schedule e. however there 's no limit although some may be deferred if the deduction is more than the income if you 're renting at fair market value any guidance would be much appreciated here 's the guidance if it is a rental treat it as a rental otherwise do n't

just how much of the troubled southern eu nations debt is due to the rescuing of private banks   thanks   my answer onto related topics   in short not much while the actual sums involved in bank bailouts are considerable relative to sovereign debts run up by having structural trade deficits for ~10 years they are n't the problem in europe at the moment but they are the tip of an iceberg that could sink parts of the eu and leave the rest struggling to stay above water    an interesting question to ponder with simple answers is   if the of sovereign debt resulting from bank bailouts is so small why does the media and general public throw a fit every time a major eu bank gets into trouble   people are worried about losing their savings that they have with that bank its a visceral fear that is easy to personally relate to   but scratch below the surface and there is a whole buffet of terror for you to on   assuming leverage of on assets held by banks and that true liabilities are n't completely opaque to average joe retail investor the collapse of the right bank could fire the starting gun on a vicious recession trigger bailouts of other institutions exposed to the original and all sorts of nasty events   these bank assets include the mess created by securitization of shitty credit assets and cds commercial paper that relies on never having to be realized as a loss and interference in the money markets and by states   its damn hard to work out what assets and liabilities a bank has these days let alone what any debt they have taken on is worth    euro crisis best crisis    pulled from memory i 'm not sure if this is accurate for europe

never thought about the difference in goals between manufacturers and local businesses   ultimately they have the same goals sale of product services   but they have a hugely different emphasis   john deere wants you to buy john deere brand products and they really do n't care where you buy it   walmart target generally do n't really give a crap what brand you buy so long as you buy it from walmart target   so john deere 's advertising is all about convincing you to only be interested in buying a john deere from where ever   and the retailer aka local business whether a chain or independent advertising is all about getting you to come back to their store to buy well whatever which can be specific or anything and everything they sell   those things can coincide when there is some exclusive relationship so the local john deere dealer is interested in promoting the john deere brand but really only to the extent that you buy a john deere from them and not from some other dealer store   and likewise the local buick dealer wants you to buy a buick but chiefly so that you will buy one from them and/or so that you will come to them to buy parts service which most dealers actually tend to make more money on than they do from the sale of the car itself     your knowledge about the facebook ad model might be able to help me with a personal project i 'm doing    i do n't know that it i would call it knowledge about the facebook ad model it 's more general knowledge about how the advertising marketing world and speculation with back of the napkin style calculations regarding about how far away from reality facebook 's supposed super specific targeting actually is     gt;if you care to take a whack at it read on what interested me before the ipo was the debate about the value of fb 's ad model   this is was kind of my whole point though i 'm coming from a different tack than you my view is that regardless of how effective ineffective fb 's ads prove to be   1 there is only so much commerce in the world granted it can grow but it does so on an incremental basis in real money terms   2 only a certain percentage of it is going to be spent on advertising   3 a lot of that probably 50 or more is local advertising marketing done not by the big players but by smaller more local operations   4 there is no way that facebook will capture anywhere near even 50 of even the big player advertising marketing money competing against all other types of media yeah not gon na happen and they are n't even trying to get any of the local money   5 as a result of the above there is no way for facebook to achieve the revenues much less the profit margins to support anything anywhere near the valuation it at   6 ergo the price of the stock will continue to drop especially as insiders amp previous investors cash in by selling additional stock into the float until it reaches a price that can be supported by a reasonable p e say in the 10 to 20 range that is based on actual achievable revenues which i do n't see any way for the final value of fb to be anything over $ 10 a share more likely the will end up in the $ 4 to $ 5 range and possibly even lower especially if they continue to things as they have recently ultimately especially if they dilute the shares as they seem likely to it will probably end up as a $ 1 to $ 2 stock   as to your questions i think we 're barking up different trees your approach sounds interesting but i would n't have any idea where you could get hard data on any of that at best you i think whatever data you can lay hands on is going to be a lot of highly dubious and speculative bs in no small part because i do n't think anyone really has any harder data maybe gm does and that is why they dropped their use of the stuff

the simple answer is technically bonds do n't have earnings hence no p e. what i think the op is really asking how do i compare stock and bond etfs some mature stocks exhibit very similar characteristics to bonds so at the margin if you are considering investing between 2 such investments that provide stable income in the form of dividends you might want to use the dividend price ratio d p of the stock and compare it to the dividend yield of the bond if you go down to the basics both the bond and the stock can be considered   the present value of all future expected cashflows the cash that accrues to the owner of the stock is future dividends and for the bond is the coupon payments if a company were to pay out 100 of its earnings then the dividend yield d p would be conveniently e p. for a company with p e of 20 that paid out it 's entire earnings one would expect d p = 1/20 = 5 this serves as a decent yard stick in the short term ~ 1 year to compare mature stock etfs with stable prospects vs bond funds since the former will have very little expected price growth think utilities hence they both compete on the cashflows they throw off to the investor this comparison stops being useful for stock etfs with higher growth prospects since expected future cashflows are much more volatile this comparison is also not valid in the long term since bond etfs are highly sensitive to the yield curve interest rate risk and they can move substantially from where they are now

credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

i think everything in your case is just simply missing one important rule of how credit works essentially your mil can not get a loan you can you are making her a large loan that she can not get for herself that is all that is the essence of what this deal is it is not without interest she makes a financial contribution toward your son you get the deal in 2 years assuming she does n't default she will etc imagine it this way you are sitting in the dealership with the dealer and your mil she wants a loan to pay for the car the dealership says you are way not credit worthy so your mil says why does n't my son in law take out the loan instead now the dealership says sure that 's fine from the dealer 's standpoint every other part of your arrangement is irrelevant boring even the only magic trick is in who takes the loan out no other difference you 're letting your mil pull a car out of her sleeve like a and in taking the deal you 're believing her   this sentence i am pretty sure that the ex mil will not let me down i 've loaned her large sums of money before and she always promptly repaid   is everything you 're making a rather large bet that the things that can go wrong in two years including any situation involving your wife 's welfare are rather miniscule and furthermore that the few times she 's paid you back that did not convince banks and dealer she is more creditworthy justifies her good creditworthiness is the interest worth it do you really believe that your mil needs to wring a car out of you before she would consider contributing to her grandson 's well being which is essentially the interest but wait it 's not everything her daughter my ex wife would drive it for 2 years and then turn the car over to our son even if your mil is creditworthy the woman you described as follows her daughter though is a loose will be holding and returning the collateral in this deal things she can do include so i 'm arguing two points obviously my opinion on this is clear i hope i did a decent job of explaining where the components of this deal credit interest collateral play out in the eyes of a dealer or bank and get lost in the mechanics of the rules you worked out with your family

you might try to refinance some of those loans it sounds like you are serious about minimizing interest expense if you think you will be able to pay those loans in full within   five years you might also try a loan that is fixed for five years before becoming variable   if you do not think you can repay the loans in full before that time you should probably stick with the fixed rates that you have it may even be profitable to refinance those loans through another lender at the exact same fixed rate because it gets around their repayment tricks that effectively increase your interest on those two smaller loans

in most countries you are deemed to dispose of all your assets at the fair value at that time at the moment you are considered no longer a resident ie on the day your friend leaves brazil brazil will likely consider him to have sold his btc for $ 1m.   the brazilian government will then likely want him to calculate how much it cost him to mine buy it so that they can tax him on the gain no argument about how btc is n't fiat money matters here tax laws will typically apply to all investments in a way similar to stocks etc   the us will likely be very suspicious of such a large amount of money without some level of including that he paid taxes on any relevant gains in other countries by showing the us that he paid appropriate expatriate taxes in brazil if they exist i am speaking generally and have no knowledge of brazilian taxes he is helping to prove that he does not need to pay any taxes on that money in the us typically the btc then is valued for us tax purposes as the $ 1 m it was worth when he entered the us becoming a resident there this may require tax planning prior to entering the us see additional answer here any attempt to bring the btc into the us without paying appropriate brazilian us taxes as applicable i 'm not 100 on either check with a tax lawyer knowledgeable on both us brazilian tax law because the amount of money is material will likely be considered fraud how to commit fraud is not entertained as valid subject matter on this site

what you aim to do is a great idea and it will work in your favor for a number of reasons first paying down your loan early will save you lots in interest no brainer second keeping the account open will improve your credit score by 1 increases the number of installment trade lines you have open to your positive payment history and 3 varies your credit mix if your paid your car off you will see a drop in your credit score because now you have one less trade line to address other issues as far as credit scoring it does not for your score if you have a $ 1000 car loan or a $ 100,000 car loan what matters is whether or not you pay on time and what your balance is compared to the original loan amount so the quicker you pay down the loans or mortgages the better pay them down not off as far how the extra payments will report one of two things will happen either they will report every month paid as agreed most likely or they wo nt report anything for a few years until your next payment is this wo nt hurt you but wo nt help you either someone posted they would lower the amount you paid every month on your report and thus lower your score this is not true even if they reported you paid $ month the scoring calculations do not care all they care is whether or not you 're on time and in your case you would be months ahead of though your report ca nt reflect this fact either however if you are applying for a mortgage the lower monthly payment would affect you in the sense that now you qualify for a bigger loan because now your debt to income ratio has improved people will argue to just pay it off and be debt free however being debt free does not help your credit and being that you own a home and a car you see the benefits of good credit you can have a million dollars in the bank but you will be denied a loan if you have no or bad credit   nothing wrong with living on cash i 've done it for years but good luck trying to rent a car or getting the best insurance rates and anything in life with poor credit yeah it sucks but you have to play the game i would not pay down do $ 1 though because like someone else said they may just close the account pay it down to 10 or 20 percent and you will see the most impact on your credit and invest the rest of your cash elsewhere

as you 've observed when you 're dealing with that amount of money you 're going to have to give up fdic guarantees that means that keeping the money in a bank account carries some risk with it if that particular bank goes bust you could lose most of your money there are a few options to stretch the fdic limit such as cdars but likely ca n't handle your hypothetical $ 800 million so what 's a lucky winner to do there are a few options including treasury securities money market funds and more general capital investments such as stocks and bonds which are best depend on what your goals are and what kind of risks you find acceptable money in the bank has two defining characteristics its value is very stable and it is liquid meaning you can spend it very easily whenever you want without incurring costs treasury securities and money market funds each focus on one of these characteristics a treasury security is a piece of paper or really an electronic record saying that the us federal government owes you money and when they will pay it back they are very secure in that the government has never missed a payment and will move heaven and earth to make sure they wo n't miss one in the future even taking into account recent political history you can buy and sell them on an open market either through a broker or directly on the treasury 's website the major downside of these compared to a bank account is that they 're not as liquid as cash you own specific amounts of specific kinds of securities not just some number of dollars in an account the government will pay you guaranteed cash on specified dates if you need cash on different dates you will need to sell the securities in the open market and the price will be subject to market fluctuations the other cash like option is money market funds these are a type of mutual fund offered by financial companies these funds take your money and spread it out over a wide variety of very low risk very short term investments with the goal of ensuring that the full value will never go down and is available at any time they are very liquid you can typically transfer cash quickly and easily to a normal bank account write checks directly and sometimes even use online bill pay like features they have a very good track record for stability too but no one is guaranteeing them against something going terribly wrong they are lower risk than a non fdic insured bank account since the investments are spread out across many institutions beyond those two somewhat cash like options there are of course other more general investments such as stocks bonds and real estate these other options trade away some degree of stability liquidity or both in exchange for better expected returns

someone has to hand out cash to the seller even if no physical money changes hands and i 've bought a house i can tell you a lot of money changes hands at closing in at least the form of a personal check and regardless of exactly how the bank accounts for the actual disbursement of the loan the net result is that the buyer has cash that they give the seller and are now in debt to the bank for least that amount but they now have a house now the bank probably did n't have that money just sitting in its vault money sitting in a vault is money that is not making more money for the bank therefore most banks keep only fractionally more than the percentage of deposit balances that they are required to keep by the feds there are also restrictions on what depositors money can be spent on and loans are not one of them the model of taking in money in savings accounts and then loaning it out is what caused the savings and loan collapse in the 80s so to get the money it turns to investors the bank sells bonds putting itself in debt to bond holders then takes that money and loans it out at a higher rate covering the interest on the bond and making itself a tidy profit for its own shareholders banks lose money on defaults in two ways first they lose all future interest payments that would have been made on the loan technically this is n't revenue until the interest is calculated for each month and accrues on the loan therefore it does n't show on the balance sheet one way or the other however the holders of those bonds will expect a return and the banks no longer have the mortgage payment to cover the coupon payments that they themselves have to pay bondholders creating cash flow problems the second and far more real and damaging way that banks lose money on a foreclosure is the loss of collateral value a bank virtually never offers an unsecured signature loan for a house certainly not at the advertised 3 4 interest rates they want something to back up the loan so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money usually that 's the house itself if you default they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money now a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from when the economy goes in the crapper a lot of things we generally consider stores of value lose that value because the value of the any really is based on what someone else would pay to have it when fewer people are looking to buy that demand drops bringing prices with it homes and real estate are one of the real big ticket items subject to this loss of value when the average joe does n't know whether he 'll have a job tomorrow he does n't go house hunting this average joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash increasing supply further decreasing prices economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands as well as homeowners upkeep of their own property by the broken window effect this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle what made this current recession a double whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused in large part by a housing bubble cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon rapidly and then when the money became more expensive such as in sub prime arms a lot of those loans which should never have been signed off on by either side went belly up between the loss of home value a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent that 's the problem with a bubble things never recover to their peak and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan many homeowners found themselves so far underwater and sinking fast that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years now the bank 's in a they have this loan they 'll never see repaid in cash and they have this home that 's worth maybe 75 of the mortgage 's outstanding balance if they 're lucky some homes in extremely distressed areas like detroit are currently trading for 30 40 of what they sold for just before the bubble burst multiply that by say 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value and you 're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses on top of that the guarantor basically the bank 's insurance company against these types of losses is now in financial trouble themselves because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad aig fannie freddie they may very well declare bankruptcy and leave the bank holding the bag even if the guarantor remains solvent as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts the bank 's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them to sell the house thus realizing the loss between what they paid and what they finally got back before the guarantor will pay out but nobody 's buying houses anymore because prices are on their way down the only people who 'd buy a house now versus a year from now or two or three years are the people who have no choice and if you have no choice you 're probably in a financial situation that would mean you 'd never be approved for the loan anyway in order to get rid of them the bank has to sell them at auction for pennies on the dollar that further increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down prices making even the nicer homes the bank 's willing to keep on the books worth less there 's a reason these homes were called toxic assets they 're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell them meanwhile all this price depression is now affecting the people who did everything right even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed are watching years of equity building go down the crapper that 's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time when the bubble was at its peak even without an adjusting arm to contend with these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime even with a fixed mortgage rate they 'll be underwater effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked away from the whole thing moved back into an apartment and waited it out so these guys decide on a strategic default give the bank the house which does n't cover the outstanding balance of course and if they sue file bankruptcy that really makes the banks nervous if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure and bankruptcy to be preferable to their current state of affairs the bank 's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow that makes them very reluctant to sign new mortgages because the risk of default is now much less certain now people who do want houses in this market ca n't buy them further reducing demand further decreasing prices you get the idea that 's the housing collapse in a nutshell and what banks and our free market have been working through for the past five years with only the of a turnaround picking up home sales

there are only two things you can directly do with the money in an amazon gift card you can keep the gift card or you can put the money into your amazon account   there are n't any other options   you ca n't deposit the value into a bank account or anything like that   so as far as safety those are the only options you need to consider because there 's nothing else you can do okay there is one other thing you can do you could sell the card to someone else or barter it for something you want   but you can do that with anything the gift card is just a string of numbers and letters that you put into your amazon account and it credits you with the appropriate amount of money   so yes it can be stolen   if you have n't redeemed it yet someone could find the code by hacking your email or looking over your shoulder or whatever   if they redeem it you wo n't be able to do so as for your edit if i do n't transfer the balance of the amazon card to my amazon account can i transfer the balance to other accounts or use the card to buy other gift cards if you do n't transfer it to your account you can transfer the balance to another account by giving the code to someone else and letting them deposit it in their account   you still wo n't be able to buy other gift cards with it because you ca n't buy anything with it until it 's deposited in an amazon account and once it 's deposited in an amazon account you ca n't buy gift cards with it because of their policy if you do n't want the restrictions imposed by amazon do n't buy amazon gift cards instead just use your actual money to buy things   if you 're worried about the cards being stolen just deposit them into your account right away and you eliminate the risk of them being stolen   if as you say you bought the cards for yourself there 's no reason not to do this presumably you bought them so you could buy things on amazon and you 'll have to deposit them into your account eventually anyway to do that so just put them in right away i do n't know specifically how walmart cards work but i assume they 're the same   in general anything called a gift card offered by a particular retailer works the same way you ca n't do anything with it except buy products at that retailer the only thing that really makes amazon different is that the only way to use your card is to add the money to your amazon account because the only way to pay for things on amazon is with an amazon account   there 's no way to spend just some of the value you have to deposit it all into your account   with gift cards for retailers with physical locations you can usually use the value up piecemeal by actually going to a store and spending just enough to buy something   i assume walmart works this way although i do n't know if you can use an e gift card this way there

i feel that op 's question is fundamentally wrong and an understanding of why is important the stock market as a whole in the usa has an average annualized return of 11 that means that a monkey throwing darts at a board can usually turn 100 k into over three million in thirty five years the analog i 'm drawing is a 30-year old with 100 k randomly picking stocks will be a multi millionaire at 65 so to be good at investing in the stock market you need to be better than a monkey most people are n't why what mistakes do people make and how do you avoid them a very common mistake is to buy high sell low this happened before and after the 08 's recession people rushed into the market beforehand as it was reaching its peak sold when the market bottomed out then ignored the market in years it was getting returns a bogle approach for this is to simply consistently put a   part of your income into the market whether it is raining or shining paying high fees going back to the monkey example if the monkey charges you a 2 management fees which is low by canadian standards the monkey will cost you one million dollars over the course of the thirty five years if the monkey does a pretty good job it is a worthy expenditure but most humans including professional stock pickers are worst than a monkey at picking stocks another mistake is adjusting your plan many people when the market was giving bull returns before the 08 's crash happily had a large segment of their wealth in stocks they thought they were risk tolerant crash happened they moved towards bonds then bonds returns were comically low while stocks soared had they had a plan almost any consistent plan they 'd have done better another genre of issues is just doing stupid things do n't buy that penny stock do n't trade like crazy do n't pay 5 $ commission on a 200 $ stock order do n't fail to file your taxes   another mistake and this burdens a lot of people is that your long term investments are for long term investing what a novel idea you 're 401 k does n't exist for you to get a loan for a home many people do liquidate their long term savings do n't especially since people who do make these loans or say i 'll pay myself back later do n't

i think the real problem here is dealing with the variable income the envelope solution suggests the problem is that your brother does n't have the discipline to avoid spending all his money immediately but maybe that 's not it maybe he could regulate his expenses just fine but with such a variable income he ca n't settle into a normal spending pattern without any savings any budget would have to be based on the worst possible income for a month this is n't a great it means a poor quality of life and what do you do with the extra money in the better than worst months while it 's easy to say plan for the worst then when it 's better save that money that 's just not going to happen no one will want to live at their worst case standard of living all the time someone would have to be a real miser to have the discipline to not use that extra money for something you can say to save it for emergencies or unexpected events but there 's always a way to rationalize spending it i 'm a musician so this new is a necessary business expense or maybe the car is broken surely this is a necessary expense but do you buy a $ 1000 car or a $ 20000 car there 's always a way to rationalize what 's necessary but it does n't change financial reality with a highly variable income he will need some cash saved up to fill in the bad months which is replenished in the good months for success you need a reasonable plan for making that happen one that includes provisions for spending it other than please try not to spend it i would suggest tracking income accurately for several months then you will have a real number not a guess of what an average month is then you can budget on that you will also have real numbers that allow you to calculate how long the bad stretches are and thus determine how much cash reserve is necessary to make the odds of going broke in a bad period unlikely having that you can make a budget based on average income which should have some allowance for enjoying life of course initially the cash reserve does n't exist but knowing exactly what will happen when it does provides a good motivation for building the reserve rather than spending it today knowing that the budget includes rules for spending the reserves reduces the incentive to cheat of course the eventual budget should also include provisions for long term savings for retirement medical expenses car maintenance etc you can do the envelope thing if that 's helpful the point here is to solve the problem of the variable income so you can have an average income that does n't result in a budget that delivers a soul crushing decrease in quality of living

and to answer your other questions about fees there are a number of sites that compare brokers fees google broker fee comparison i like the motley fool although there are a lot of others however do n't go just by the comparison sites because they can be out of date and usually just have the basic fees once you find a broker that you like go to that broker 's site and get all the fees as of now you ca n't sell the shares that are in your charles schwab account using some other broker however you can possibly now definitely eventually see below transfer the shares to another broker and then sell them there but be aware that charles schwab might charge you a fee to transfer the shares out which will probably be larger than the fee they 'll charge you to sell the shares unless you 're selling them a few at a time for example i have a charles schwab account through my previous employer and it 's $ 9.99 commission to sell shares but $ 50 to transfer them out note that your fees might be different even though we 're both at charles schwab because employers can negotiate individual deals there should be somewhere on the site that has a fee schedule but if you ca n't find it send them a message or call them one final thing to be aware of shares you get from an employer often have restrictions on sale or transfer or negative tax consequences on sale or transfer that shares just bought on the open market would n't so make sure you investigate that before doing anything with the shares

the company that sold of the debt does write off the loan and books loss on balance sheet depending on the company 's policy the amount written of as loss varies some companies only show loss on principal for the outstanding period the interest income and charges is not booked some companies would show loss on principal and the accrued unpaid interest so if the total outstanding is say 10,000 and it was sold to collector at say the balance 7,000 is written off as loss there are multiple reasons one they do n't have time or there are only few cases but most of the times when on initial delay in payment it goes to a collection agency for follow up and the loan is not actually sold the agency gets a commission around 10 15 for every successful payment they recover its only after some period it actually gets sold completely to the agency for a heavy discount price often at 10 the actual value the collection agency works on threat technique if they get 50 of face value they may loss that threat perception and everyone would not pay even if they can so it makes more sense for them to get 200 of face value added interest charges and other stuff from one customer rather than get 50 from 4 customers

there are a number of ways you could do this the first step is to work out what a fair price is either make an estimate that you both accept possibly getting a real estate agent to give you a free evaluation or get a professional evaluation from some you both accept once you have a valuation the simplest of course is to pay your brother that value in return for his transferring his ownership to you hopefully you have that much money in savings if you do n't have that money but do have income you may need to take a mortgage which would put your home at risk if the pollution you speak of has n't been fixed a mortgage may be out of the question an alternative if you have income and your brother does n't need the money right now is to make the money you owe him for the house a loan from him to you he transfers his ownership of the house to you you pay him its value but he simultaneously loans you that exact same amount no actual money needs to change hands you would make him a regular payment essentially the interest on that loan and also make an agreement to pay off the principal of the loan i.e. the value of the house when the house is sold or when you pass away while you could do this informally if everyone agrees it would be much better to make a legal agreement so that everybody is exactly sure what they are expecting

an economy produces goods and services and people use money to pay for those goods and services   money has value because people believe that they can buy and sell goods and services with it in that economy how much the value of money is is determined by how much money there is in comparison to goods and services supply and demand in most economies it is the job of the federal national reserve bank to ensure that prices stay stable ie the relationship of goods and services to how much money there is is stable as this is necessary for a well running economy   the federal reserve bank does so by making more printing decreasing interest rates or less increasing interest rates available to the economy to determine how much money needs to be in the economy to keep prices stable is incredibly hard as many factors have an impact if the reserve bank gets it wrong and there is more money compared to goods and services than previous prices will rise to compensate this is inflation if it 's the other way round is deflation since it is commonly regarded that deflation is much more destabilizing to an economy than inflation the reserve banks tend to err on the side of inflation

yes you can rollover as many different 401ks into a single ira account   i have done it personally and it really cuts down on the overhead of keeping up with lots of different accounts   your brokerage or mutual fund company should be able to help you with it   if you are using a company that just gives you forms and those forms do n't mention an easy way to combine   then i suggest rolling over one 401k first then once that 's finished you can rollover the other 401k into that same account

is there any practical reason to hold off on making payments until i receive a billing statement yes a few    as for a zero balance fico consumer affairs manager barry says the idea here is the lower the better in terms of the utilization percentage but something is better than nothing the score wants to see some kind of activity   how low should you go in a recent interview fico spokesman craig watts said if your utilization is 10 percent or lower you 're in great shape as far as utilization goes that being said there are downsides especially if you wind up forgetting to make a payment   the easiest thing to do also from a time management perspective is to get your billing statement once a month verify the purchases on it and at that time you receive the statement schedule an online bill payment so that it will be paid in full before the due date    as aganju points out you do n't have to wait for a paper bill in hand or even an e mail notification you can go online after your statement date to get the statement   this makes sure you wo n't have extra costs related to of mail if you still receive paper mail though it does require remembering to check and/or setting a recurring calendar reminder   paying much in advance of that as is your current practice might be a good idea to free up available balance if you are planning a purchase that would take you over your credit limit but this should be relatively rare and some credit card companies will raise that limit if you have been paying well and ask nicely though find out first if they do a hard pull of your credit report for that

all great answers the only thing i did n't see mentioned was that student loans are not in a bankruptcy so for example if you took money that could have gone to student loans and poured it into other debt then for some reason declared bankruptcy later your student load debt would remain while other debt would be discharged essentially that money would have been better spent on the student loan this is n't to advocate that you should pay down student loans with the intent of declaring bankruptcy or that this makes it a better decision necessarily just a factor that is sometimes forgotten

in the short term what does it matter if she has poor credit   just let it ride and focus on the important things in the long term the most important part is completing the divorce   that is separating all parts of her financial life from her ex husband   this might mean she takes possession of the house and has him off the loan or she gets off the loan and this may mean forcing a sale if there are children or alimony involved she needs to build her income to the point that paying child support or alimony does not impact her budget   if she is on the receiving end then she should budget so those items are bonus money and not counted on she is flat broke and does not need to worry about borrowing money at this juncture   in this case a low credit score is a blessing

a is a promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action every company must do a balancing act while declaring the dividends in terms of companies interest can it use the surplus cash to generate more revenue to shareholders interests giving back to them the profits that due many countries have regulations governing as to when and how much the dividends may be given it also lays out the policy about declaring dividends to protect everyones interest for example if the company has a huge suit pending against it the company is not supposed to distribute the surplus cash as dividends and when the suit goes against it its left when no money to pay or other such examples where the interests of one or the other party is compromised the company law board ensures that all this is to in a fair manner so essentially these covenants include provisions about passing dividends means that due diligence has be exercised by the company in order to arrive at the dividends that are to be paid out

i agree with the other posters that you will need to seek the advice of a tax attorney specializing in corporate taxation here is an idea to investigate could you sell the company and thereby turn the profits that are taxed as ordinary income into a long term capital gain taxed at 15 plus state income tax if any you can determine the value of a profitable business using discounted cash flow analysis even if you expect that the revenue stream will dry up due to product obsolescence or expiry of licensing agreements   to avoid the capital gains taxes especially if you live in a high tax state like california you could also transfer the stock to a charitable remainder trust the crt then sells the shares to the third party acquirer invests the proceeds and pays you annual distributions similar to an annuity the flip side of a sale is that now the acquiring party will be stuck with the taxes payable on your company 's profits while being forced to amortize the purchase price over multiple years 15 if i recall correctly which will factor into the valuation however it is likely that the acquirer has better ways to mitigate the tax impact e.g. the acquirer is a company currently operating at a loss and therefore can cancel out the tax liabilities from your company 's profits   one final caveat do n't let the tax tail wag the business dog in other words focus your on extracting the maximum value from your company rather than trying to find convoluted tax saving strategies you might find that making an extra dollar in profits is easier than saving fifty cents in taxes

littleadv 's answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan in broad terms the balances of your accounts and your future benefit wo n't change it 's only the source of these benefits that 's changing the bloomberg article describes the changes this way the state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state run social security system the state will assume control of percent of pension fund assets including bonds guaranteed by the government and other non stock assets after the change polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state run pension system the balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits should n't change but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements the effect this change will have on future benefits is n't clear because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt not solve it the government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds less money went into the government 's fund which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities   the government 's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt but in exchange the government is increasing its future pension liabilities years down the road the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they 're taking on today in other words they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road and it 's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time

even if you 're paying a lot of taxes now you 're talking marginal dollars when you look at current contribution and average tax rate when making withdrawals   ie if you currently pay 28 on your last dollar and assuming your contribution is entirely in your marginal rate then you 're paying 28 on all of the roth contributions but probably paying a lower average tax rate due to the lower tax rates on the first many dollars    look at the overall average tax rate of your expected retirement income if you 're expecting to pull out $ 100k a year you 're probably paying less than 20 in average taxes because the first third or so is taxed at a very low rate 0 or 15 assuming things do n't change in our tax code   comparing that to your 28 and you have a net gain of 8 by paying the taxes later nothing to shake a stick at at minimum have enough in your traditional ira to max out the zero tax bucket at least $ 12k   realistically you probably should have enough to max out the 15 bucket as you presumably are well above that bucket now   any roth savings will be more than eliminated by this difference 28 tax now 15 tax later   yes please a diversified combination is usually best for those expecting to have a lot of retirement savings enough in traditional to get at least $ 35k or so a year out say and then enough in roth to keep your comfortable lifestyle after that the one caveat here is in the case when you max out your contribution levels you may gain by using money that is not in your ira to pay the taxes on the conversion   talk to your tax professional or accountant to verify this will be helpful in your particular instance

you could buy options i do not know what your time horizon is but it makes all the difference due to theta burn there are weekly monthly quarterly yearly and even longer duration options called leaps you have decided how long of a time frame you also have to see what the implied volatility is for the underlying because if you think hypothetically that the price of the spy is 100 dollars currently today is hypothetically a thursday and you buy a weekly option expiring on friday the next day of strike and the call option is priced at cents and you buy it this means that the underlying has to move .5 dollars in one day to be considered in the money but at time 0 the option should only be worth its intrinsic value which is the underlying say the spy moved 55 cents up from 100 to minus the strike = 5 cents so if you payed 55 cents and one day later at expiration its worth 5 cents you lost almost 91 of your money rather with buying and holding you lose a lot less the leverage is on a 10x scale typically that is why timing is so important anyone can say x stock is going to go up in the future but if you know when you can make a killing if it is not already priced into the market another thing you can do is figure out how much msft contributes to the spx movement in terms of points what does a 1 move in msft spx if you can calculate that and you think you know where msft is going you can just trade the spy options synthetically as if it were microsoft you could also buy msft stock on margin as a retail investor but be careful like said look into an etf that has microsoft the nasdaq has a which microsoft is in called the triple q. the ticker is qqq qqq ™ formerly known as qqq or the 100 index tracking stock ® is an exchange traded fund based on the index ® best of luck and always understand what you are buying before you buy it

there have been many interesting and correct answers but to give a direct answer to your first question dividend yield is simply dividend over current share price so if the share price drops your dividend yield increases proportionately dividend yield is not something one should use as the only source of information of whether a stock is a good bad buy it does not show many important factors the riskiness of the company business its financial position profitability ability to generate cash furthermore dividend yield is just a snapshot of an income gain at a given point in time it does not mean that this very dividend policy is going to continue in the future especially not so if the company finances this dividend payments using not its own cash reserves but outside capital by issuing debt securities which is unsustainable

my suggestion would be to ask the planner as an initial question as there could be a couple possible explanations for a free meeting initial consultation within some industries there will be that first meeting which is free to see how well do two people work together   in canada there are some lawyers that will give a half hour of their time and i 'd imagine some financial planners may have a similar practice   this would be where that first meeting is a half hour or hour to see what is your situation and what expertise do you want that the planner would have straight commission there is also the possibility that the planner is compensated by the products you purchase through him   in this case the mutual fund companies insurance companies and other institutions that he recommends will be handling his compensation   while this does present a conflict of interest you have to decide whether you want a fee only planner which would n't have this issue though you 'd have to pay out of pocket something to consider is what are you bringing to this meeting and how long is it intended to be   if you are bringing a lot of paperwork then it is definitely worth asking upfront while if it is an informal chat for a half hour then things may be different

if you want to deposit checks or conduct business at a window you should look at a local savings bank or credit union generally you can find one that will offer free checking in exchange for direct deposit or a minimum balance some are totally free but those banks pay for interest if you do n't care about location i would look at charles schwab bank i 've been using them for a couple of years and have been really satisfied with them they provide free checking atm fee reimbursement free checks and pre paid deposit envelopes you also can easily move money between schwab brokerage or savings accounts other brokers offer similar services as well

me too the guy who wrote this article is the same as me i never watch commercials and it 's extremely rare if they ever cause me to go buy something i really do n't see the point in commercials anymore any commercials i do remember are the funny ones and i 'll remember the characters better than the actual product if it was n't for comcast bundling cable with our internet for a low price we would n't even have cable      edit i understand that commercials want brand awareness as well my point is that this really does n't apply to me because 95 of the products i clothes and electronics currently do n't have any commercials on tv if ever i 'm a frugal shopper and if a commercial with me it 's because it 's a great deal and not because it 's a brand name

why would you trade a lower interest rate over a higher one   i would n't use the mortgage to pay off the car   also you should have loan lease payoff on your auto insurance which if the car is totaled means your loan would be paid by insurance   i do n't think you 'd be able to take advantage of that if your car payments become one with the mortgage   finally not all mortgage interest may be deductible also i ca n't think of any way you 'd be able to use the car loan to pay off the mortgage   you would n't be able to borrow more than the car is worth and for a new car it loses quite a bit of value immediately

i like nathan 's answer some but am horribly curious as to why you have not made payments on a $ 3500 student loan   if you are wealthy enough to afford a new car this should be paid off next week   imho above all else your financial goals should dictate if you buy a new car   what are they for you   if the goal is to build wealthy quickly then nathan 's advice may be to for you    if your goal is to impress people with the car you drive and accumulate very little real wealth then purchasing or leasing a car should be a top priority so to answer your question correctly one must understand your goals    for 2016 the average car payment is $ per month   if you invested that in a decent growth stock mutual fund in 40 years you 'll have around 2.6 million   however you do need something to drive now   if you can cut your car expense to $ 200 per month and save the other $ you will still end up with about 1.5 million in that same 40 years    personally i attempt to shoot for $ 200 ownership cost per car per month   its a bit difficult as i drive a lot   also i would not purchase a new car until my net worth exceeded 2 million   at that point my investments could mitigate the steep depreciation costs of owning a new car

how safe is my money as safe as it can get most banks would be registered under fdic see the list here if a specific bank is covered or not bank of america is covered how does this work and is there something i need to do so i am covered by it should i be getting a certificate or boa under the scope of this deposit insurance it only covers if the bank fails i.e. goes bankrupt the fdic steps in and either oversees a merger of the failed bank with another bank or in the worst case pays the depositors upto $ 250,000   does it cover me if someone steals my money the fdic does not cover if someone steals your money if someone hacks my computer and transfers all my money this will be determined on a case to case basis if the loss of money is because of your negligence i.e. you gave your password etc to someone else or did not take enough precautions to including allowing someone to hack you computer in such cases it is a crime and you would need to file police complaint and the bank will on best effort basis try and reverse the transfer if this was due to the bank 's error i.e. bank did not ensure right controls security was in place resulting in loss of your money the bank is liable and will pay you back so cases like someone forged your signature on a check etc are the bank 's responsibility

there 's an ideological psychological aspect of this too apart from the practical problems eurozone leaders keep saying the mantra conversion to the euro is irreversible there are analogies of this in recent history it reminds me of the soviet leaders and their belief that communism is where history ends they genuinely thought that once a communist system is built up in a country it would stay forever they believed in the superiority of their system among other things this lead to the isolation of the soviet union from the west and the start of the cold war then in 1956 they were proven wrong with the hungarian revolution and while they tried to clean up the situation as fast as they could and forget about it their downhill inevitably started   back to the present you can easily see the importance of keeping greece in the ez if greece exits the illusion of the of the euro is gone and it would start to fall apart

gt the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth      a1 misleading infrastructure is useful to those who use it more independently of classifying it as fixed vs wiki take the faa for example the poor who can not afford a plane ticket and/or order things via next day air derive very little benefit from the faa compared to a person who owns their own aircraft and can fly out at a moments notice knowing full well they can file a flight plan and communicate with a network of airports to ensure their plane will not crash into any other jets    gt;a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else    a2 but a person with more net worth has more to lose than a person with low net worth therefore even independent of a1 above your statement is false those examples protect those with more property net worth etc more so than those with less    gt b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals   it depends on the infrastructure but there is far more infrastructure protecting the wealthy than the poor your example is the stock market why should the vast majority of people pay for sec and rules and regulations to require enforce honest filings when they can not afford stock who benefits from sec infrastructure you and i do    value to poor as a percentage of income = 0 value to rich gt 0   your roads argument as an example of poor using more infrastructure than the rich is a bad one the poor are more likely to take public transportation and/or work    within 5 miles of their residence the rich are more likely to have multiple cars live in areas far from work and take long road trips staying at home to work is a function of more than just owning stock there are at home parents it professionals programmers voip operators etc all working from home and completely independent of road use    gt c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   personal utility you are mixing corporate and personal taxes and yet calling out personal utility unless you are talking about business owners flowing income to personal income e.g. s corp the mixing of terms is unfortunate because both business and people use infrastructure and both should pay for it    far outweigh not true see examples a1 and a2 above and i 'll go one more taxes on businesses are on net revenue not gross revenue ignoring things like ss and fica you probably invest in businesses with dividends and there is an incentive to keep a net revenue that can be distributed to stockholders but in the private world there is no such motivation in fact there is an anti motivation to show profit as low as possible to limit tax liability this has led to many hacks of the tax code expenses to make sure that businesses end up with negative tax liability or an effective rate that is close to 0 how many poor people can claim negative tax liability again 0 gt not zero     society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   d1 wat vague not all commercial efforts have a positive impact on the community   irrelevant since we are talking about use vs cost etc

it depends on the exact level of risk that you want but if you want to keep your risk close to zero you 're pretty much stuck with the banks and those rates do n't look to be going up any time soon if you 're willing to accept a little more risk you can invest in some index tracking etfs instead with the main providers in australia being vanguard street state and   a useful tool for for an overview of the australian etf market is offered by the index funds reduce your level of risk by investing in an index of the market e.g. the s&p 200 tracked by   if the market as a whole rises then your investment will too even though within that index individual companies will rise and fall this limits your potential rate of return as well and is still significantly more risky than leaving your cash in an aussie bank after all the whole market can fall but it might strike the right balance for you if you 're getting started hsbc and westpac were all offering a couple of months of free trades up to a certain value   once the free trades are done you 'll do better to move to another broker you can migrate your shares to the others to take advantage of their free trades too or to a cheaper broker like cmc markets

this depends on the involved us citizen resident giving gifts is required to pay a gift tax the recipient of the gift however pays nothing the value of the gift at the time of the gift giving is used to determine the tax and an exclusion of $ 14000 per person per year as of 2013 is available to allow smaller gifts to be given without too much of a red tape there 's also a lifetime exemption which is shared between the gift tax and the estate tax this exemption is $ 5.25 m in 2013   the reason the gift tax exists in the us is because the us tax code is very aggressive this is basically double taxation similarly to estate tax gifts estates are after tax money i.e. income tax has been paid on them yet the government taxes them again why the excuse is to disallow shifting of income if one person has high income tax brackets he may give some of his income producing property to another person with lesser brackets who would then pay less income taxes for example parents would transfer property to children similarly capital gains could be shifted generation skipping tax is yet another complication to disallow people use gifts to avoid estate taxes a grandparent would gift stuff to grandchildren thus skipping a level of estate taxes the parents in between in other countries the tax codes may be less aggressive and not tax gifts inheritance as this money has been taxed before this is a more fair situation imho yet it means that wealth moves from generation to generation without the general public benefiting from it so if you 're a us person and considering giving or receiving a gift you need to consult with a tax adviser about the consequences similarly with other countries if you are subject to their tax laws

as out by inflation figures are almost always quoted as a comparison of prices last month and prices a year ago last month   so 10 inflation in august means that things cost 10 more than they did in august a year ago   this can lead to some perverse conclusions consider an imaginary economy where prices stay constant over years   annualized inflation is zero then something happens on january 2nd 2018   some crop fails a foreign cheap source of something becomes unavailable whatever   prices rise permanently as more expensive sources are used this is the only disruption to prices nothing else goes wrong so in february 2018 the authorities find that prices in january 2018 rose by 1 over january 2017 inflation politicians pontificate economists wring their hands etc in march again prices for february 2018 are found to be 1 higher than for february 2017   more this goes on for months   every month inflation year over year is unchanged at 1   everyone has a theory as to how to stop it finally in february 2019 there 's a change   prices in january 2019 were the same as in january 2018   zero inflation   everyone takes credit for bringing down inflation

in my experience even with such pos machines there is a display that asks you to confirm your total as a very last step even if they ask if you want a receipt as a first step by this manner it would be nearly impossible for the teller to change the total without you noticing so long as you read the total given to you by the device   the scam in question is more likely to happen in a restaurant with the additional tip segment allowing someone to give themselves more of a tip than you initially wrote onto the receipt this is the only way i believe you would have a feasible chance of being cheated like this

i think what those articles are saying is if you want to leave some money to charity and some to relatives do n't a roth to charity while taxable accounts to relatives   in other words it 's not bad to leave a roth ira to charity it 's just not as good as giving it to humans if there are humans you want to give money to in your situation the total amount you want to leave to relatives is less than the value of your roth   so it sounds like the advice as it applies to you is do n't leave your relatives $ 30 k from your taxable funds while leaving the whole roth to charity   instead leave $ 30 k of your roth to your relatives while leaving all the taxable funds to charity along with the leftover $ 20 k of the roth   in other words the roth is a last resort for charitable giving only give away roth money to charity if you already gave humans all the money you want to give them   i 'm unsure of the details of how you would actually designate portions of the roth for different beneficiaries but some googling suggests it is possible

theoretically this concept makes sense   however as recent numbers have shown i do not have the source handy but one can simply obtain this information via the ecb 's website banks have tapped this something in the likes of 500 billion or so and instead of buying sovereign debt they instead prefer to park this money with the ecb paying something like 25 bps on deposits   so instead of using this money to buy sovereigns or perhaps lend to other banks easing the strain on libor banks have just parked this money back with the ecb as the ecb has seen its deposits once again reach record amounts again see the ecb website for proof   just this speaks volumes about the carry trade and how it is evidently not going to achieve its long term goal of bringing spreads down in europe   perhaps in the short run yes but if you look at the fundamentals eurusd the eur basis swap and the libor spread they show how the situation in europe is far from over and the is nothing close to a long term and stable solution

gt the attempt at nation building was a military venture   no it really was n't that was a u.s. government venture with a significant portion of it run out of the state department and alone had some 50k+ contractors i.e. about 1/3 of all contractors in iraq working for it at one point due to the fucking retarded nature of funding i would not be surprised at all to find out that those contractors were counted as dod despite having nothing to do with the   over how many carry guns versus wash dishes is n't the point really   it is relevant and here is why a lot of the base services provided by those contracted personnel either were not truly required and in the absence of cheap contracted labor would not have been done at all like having other people to do your laundry for you or to scrub down the bench at the gym whenever you walked away from it or would have required a lot less people if done by americans skilled labor specifically those numbers are artificially inflated by labor that was non essential and by inefficient labor   so while it certainly represents outsourcing i do n't think that the raw body count is a fair representation it takes a dozen guards to do what 2 soldiers would normally do at a

it 's not like bankers and politicians forget what happened then and the biggest causes of the 2008 crash began in the mid 90 's and early 2000 's nobody went to prison for the crisis because there was no one who actually committed criminal acts people were just stupid and figured debt would be forever cheap and the market would never decline and the regulations that are being rolled back actually made big banks more powerful because only they could afford the compliance costs   just like after 2008 your best bet in dealing with a crash is just hold everything you own because if you sell into a decline you have less money to buy when the market rebounds

a kid can lose everything he owns in a crap shoot and live but a senior citizen might not afford medical treatment if interest rates turn and their bonds underperform in modern portfolio theory is measured by beta and you get more return by increasing risk risk adjusted return is measured by the sharpe ratio and the efficient frontier shows how much return you get for each level of risk for simplicity we will assume that choosing beta is the only investment choice you make you are buying a house tomorrow all cash you should set aside that much in liquid assets today return = who cares beta = 0 your kids go to college in 5 years so you invest funds now with a 5 year investment horizon to produce with a reasonable level of certainty the needed cash then beta = low you wish to leave money in your estate invest for the highest return with a horizon of your lifetime return = maximum beta = who cares in other words you set risk based on how important your expenses are now or later and your portfolio is a weighted average on paper let 's say you have sold yourself into indentured servitude in return you have received a paid up front annuity which pays dividends and increases annually for someone in their twenties this adds up to a present value of $ 1 million when young the value of lifetime remaining wages is high it is also low risk you will probably find a job eventually in any market condition if your portfolio is significantly smaller than $ 1 million this means that the low risk of future wages pulls down your beta and therefore youth invest aggressively with available funds because they compensate large low risk future earnings to meet their desired risk appetite

dealerships make a lot of money in the finance department   one of the thing they play upon is your emotional reaction of purchasing a new vehicle new to you in this case   they perform all sorts of shenanigans like adding selling gap insurance or extended warranties   they entice you with a promise of a lower interest rate but really what they are trying to do is back you into a payment    so if you can fiance 20,000 but the car you are buying is 16,000 then they will try to move that figure up to the 20 k mark   in your case it sounded like some borderline at the least illegal activity they used to fool you into paying more   it sounds like you regret this decision which puts you a step ahead of most   how many people brag about the extended warranty or gap insurance they got included in the sale    as mentioned in another answer the best bet is to go into the dealership with financing in place   say you were able to get a 3 loan on   the total interest would be   if you avoid the finance room you might avoid their dubious add ons that would probably cost you more then the 1600 even if you can get 0    if you are going to buy a car on time my advice would be to not fill out a credit app at the dealership   the dealership people through a fit but hold your ground   if need be get up and walk out   they wo n't let you leave one thing i must mention is that one feels very wealthy without that monthly pain in the payment for a car   you may want to try and envision yourself without a car payment and make steps to making that a reality for the rest of your life

in market cap weighted index there is fairly heavy concentration in the largest stocks the top 10 stocks typically account for about 20 of the s&p 500 index   in equal weight this bias towards large caps is removed the market cap method would be good when large stocks drive the markets however if the markets are getting driven by mid caps and small caps the equal weight wins historically most big companies start out small and grow big fast in a short span of time thus if we were to do market cap one would have purchased smaller number of shares of the said company as its cap weight would have been small and when it becomes big we would have purchased the shares at a higher price however if we were to do equal weight then as the company grows big one would have more share at a cheaper price and would result in better returns there is a nice article on this also gives the of the returns over a period of 10 years where equal weight index has done good it does not mean that it would continue

i think that westerners often overestimate how much influence the west has over developing countries like those in africa and that there are a million other factors that most of the western public simply does n't see    yes agricultural production has increased significantly because of western and eastern demand which calls more children into laboring in those fields because that 's just how it 's always been done in those cotton producing countries of course more business also means more income for those farmers who you can bet your bottom dollar would ask consumers to buy more of their cotton and not less   higher incomes leads to many other positives for the local and national economy families individuals and yes those children that 's not to say that schooling would n't be preferable to child labor but 1 that 's not ultimately our decision and 2 that makes a quite questionable assumption that decent affordable accessible schooling even exists there    so my assessment is that western demand for cotton is a positive for the kids in what 's more i will guarantee you that even with all the failings and unpleasant parts of the world cotton commodity trade cotton farmers would agree

does the 457(b plan allow for the rollover of other retirement funds into it and do you have very specific reasons for wanting to roll over your sep ira into the 457(b plan instead of into some other ira plan with a different custodian for example if you already have a traditional ira is there any reason why your sep ira should not be rolled over into the traditional ira with regard to the question about separate accounts once upon a time rolling over money from an employment retirement plan e.g. 401k into a traditional ira required establishing a separate account called a rollover traditional ira so that the rolled over money and the earnings were not commingled with standard traditional ira money resulting from personal contributions this was so that the account owner had the option of rolling over the separately kept money into a new employer 's retirement plan if such a rollover was permitted by the new 401k plan if one did not want to ever roll over money into a new employer plan one had to write a letter to the custodian telling them that commingling was ok you never wanted to put that money into another 401k plan the law changed some time later and the concept of rollover iras holding non commingled funds has disappeared   with that as my answer to your question is that perhaps the law did not change with respect to 457(b plans and so the money that you want to rollover into the 457(b plan needs to be kept separate and not commingled with your contributions via payroll deduction to the 457(b plan in case you want to ever roll over the sep ira money into another sep ira hence separate accounts are needed one to hold your sep ira money and one to hold your contributions via payroll deductions

both the ps3 and the ps4 allows the user to swap the for an ssd without the warranty and step by step details can be found in their respective instruction manuals and online their examples assume you are merely swapping between different but and ssd is equally suited for these systems   only problem if you can call it that is that these consoles and their games are already designed so that the storage drive is nt a massive bottlenecks but you still see a few seconds of speed improvements like instead of 15 second load time you see 13 14 probably noticeable but its not a mind blowing difference and a casual user would probably not notice if we were talking about 50 reductions it would be something most people would notice   its also worth mentioning that all old cart based system are ssd systems and work by you switching to play different games these systems had extremely fast loading times but also far smaller storage when compared to disc based systems    ssd and hybrid ssd speed tests by on ps4     guides from sony on how to swap storage drives

imo this means one of two things the bank thinks that 3 months from now the interest rates it plans to offer will be lower than 1 after 180 days it will go up again the bank needs more short term cash than mid term cash right now so it offers you a better deal in either case it is unlikely that your 90 day intrest rate will be available 90 days from now and most likely it will be below 1 unless the bank yet again needs short term cash from its customers with those proposed rates i would go for half in 90 days and half in 270 days disclaimer am no economist just spent a lot of time the past year over the same kind of questions   feel free to tell me where i 'm wrong if you think i am

what the automation mostly does is make short term trading that much more difficult day trading is a zero sum game so if they win more everyone else wins less   long term trading years to decades is a positive sum game the market as a whole tends to move upward for fairly obvious reasons at its basis it 's still investing which in turn is based on lending and as long as folks make fairly rational decisions about how much return they demand for their investment and the companies are mostly producing profits there will be a share of the profit coming back to the investors as dividends or increased share value or both day to day churn in individual stocks gets averaged out by diversification and time and by the assumption that if you 've waited that long you can wait a bit longer if necessary for to settle out time periods between those will partake of some mix of the two

the estimated approach puts more burden on you to get it right   depending on when in the year you make the sale it may or may not have advantages to you in addition   other than the responsibility of ensuring that you make the payment on time the pros and cons seem to be either strategy is legitimate   it depends on when in the year you have the sale how sure you are of the sale and just your personal preference on how to get this done   your total tax due for the year will not be different as long as you pay in such as way that you do n't incur late penalties in any quarter

here is my personal opinion   please take what i say with a grain of salt   i 've been in your position before so i had to myself     with that said all your poor decisions were made in the past   certainly today there are consequences that you are facing for the decisions you made but still they were in the past   so you can eat and you can live   perhaps not to your liking but this is a rare opportunity   you see i am assuming your american we americans often feel that more in life means more happiness   but being in debt like you can show you that there is another path   just having enough     things like enjoying every bite of the meal you just ate or enjoying every moment while you 're not thinking about the poor decisions you 've made in the past will help you greatly in the future   i found that because of my debt problems living in the present moment was the only way i could stop myself from loosing all sanity   in fact because of that i started to not focus on how to get out of debt but how to live with debt   it became much easier once i was able to naturally accept that there is debt and it will be paid someday but this is how life is and it does n't bother me   i found that by letting it go eventually not only the mental problem but the debt began to solve itself     i know it sounds like jumbo but doing everything as a small step for example when you get in the shower today feel the hot water   i mean like really feel it   you have hot running water   think about the hot water and how good it is   this is the moment   maybe tomorrow you wo n't have hot running water but that 's ok because it 's not tomorrow it 's today   doing it like that with everything saved me from most likely something horrible   hth you a bit

it 's all about risk these guidelines were all developed based on the risk characteristics of the various asset categories bonds are ultra low risk large caps are low risk you do n't see most big stocks like coca cola going anywhere soon foreign stocks are medium risk subject to additional political risk and currency risk especially so in developing markets and small caps are higher risk more to gain but more likely to go out of business   moreover the risks of different asset classes tend to balance each other out some when stocks fall bonds typically rise the recent credit crunch being a notable but temporary exception as people flock to safety or as the fed adjusts interest rates when stocks soar bonds do n't look as attractive and interest rates may rise a bummer when you already own the bonds is the us economy with the dollar in the dumps while the rest of the world passes us by your foreign holdings will be worth more in dollar terms if you 'd like to work alternative asset classes real estate gold and other commodities etc into your mix consider their risk characteristics and what will make them go up and down a good asset allocation should limit the amount of down that can happen all at once the more conservative the allocation needs to be the less down is possible at the expense of the up as for what risks you are willing to take that will depend on your position in life and what risks you are presently are exposed to including your job how stable your company is and whether it could fold or do layoffs in a recession like this one whether you 're married whether you have kids where you live for instance if you 're a realtor by trade you should probably avoid investing too much in real estate or it 'll be a double whammy if the market crashes a good financial advisor can discuss these matters with you in detail

i think it is clear that this has a lot to do with keeping salaries down     the company has a maximal possible salary limit i.e. the most they would be willing and able to pay for what you do   you have a minimal possible salary   both of you know that the current salary is in between the two figures   for negotiations it would be very useful for you to know the maximal possible salary i.e. the utmost the company would be willing to pay you to stay and continue the company on the other hand is obliged to keep costs low and hence would like to know your new minimum acceptable salary so they wo n't make an offer too high     but if you knew all salaries of people around you you could make a better guess about your own maximal possible salary   you probably would over estimate it because we all tend to over estimate our own relevance and competence but it would be a better informed guess at least   the company would hence give up an informational advantage which could lead them to have higher costs   so they will ask you how much you were offered at the competitor i.e. they will be close to your new minimum acceptable salary while trying to prevent you from learning anything about the maximal possible salary

the reason a company creates more stock is to generate more capital so that this can be utilized and more returns can be generated it is commonly done as a follow on public offer typically the funds are used to retire high cost debts and fund future expansion what stops the company from doing it    are small investors cheated    it 's like you have joined a car pool with 4 people and you are that you own of the total seats so when most of them decide that we would be better of using minivan with 4 more persons you can not complain that you now only own 1/8 of the total seats even before you were having just one seat and even after you just have one seat overall it maybe better as the ride would be good

metals and mining is an interesting special case for stocks   it 's relationship to u.s. equity spx is particularly weak correlation compared to most stocks so it does n't behave like equity   however it is still stock and not a commodities index so it 's relation to major metals gold for instance is not that strong either correlation metals and mining stocks have certainly underperformed the stock market in general over the past 3 vs 9.8 annualized so this does n't look particularly promising   it did have a spectacularly good 8 year period though 66 annualized   it 's worth remembering that it is still stock   if the market did not think it could make a reasonable profit on the stock the price would decrease until the market thought it could make the same profit as other equity adjusted slightly for the risk   so is it reasonable to expect that it would give the same return as other stock on average   yes   though as has been shown in the past 25 years your actual result could vary wildly both positive and negative all numbers are from monthly over the last 25 years using as a proxy

using a simple investment calculator to get a sense of scale here to have 70k total including the 500 a month invested after ten years you just need returns of 2   to earn 70k on top of the money invested you would need returns over 20   to do that in five years you would need over 50 annual return that is quite a big difference   annualized returns of 20 would require high risk and a very large amount of time invested skill and luck   2 returns can be nearly guaranteed without much effort i would encourage you to think about your money more if you get very unlucky with investments and do n't make any money will you not go on the vacations even if your income allows   that does n't make a lot of sense   as always spend all your money with the current and future in mind   investment return euros are no different from any other euros at that point the advice is the same for all investors try to get as much return as possible for the risk you are comfortable with   you seem to have a high tolerance for risk   generally for investors with a high risk tolerance a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks with maybe a small amount of bonds other investments will give the most return over the long term for the risk taken after that generally the next most useful way to boost your returns is to try to avoid taxes which is why we talk about 401(k)s so much around here   each european country has different tax law but please ask questions here about your own country as well as you mention could use more ex us questions

you do n't want to do that don't lie to the irs we live overseas as well and have researched this extensively you can not make $ 50k overseas and then say you only made $ 45k to put $ 5k into retirement   i have heard from some accountants and tax attorneys who interpret the law as saying that the irs considers foreign earned income as not being compensation when computing ira contribution limits regardless of whether or not you exclude it publication what is compensation scroll down a little to the what is not compensation section those professionals say that any amounts you can exclude not just ones you actually do exclude then there are others that say the can is not implied so be careful trying to use any foreign earned income to qualify for retirement contributions i have n't ran across anyone yet who has gotten caught doing it and paid the price but that does n't mean they are n't out there an alternative in certain cases there are two things you can do that we have found to have some sort of taxable income that is preferably not foreign so that you can contribute to a retirement account we do this by using capital gains from investments as income since our agi is always zero we pay no short or long term capital gains taxes as long as we keep short term capital gains lower than $ 45k   another way to contribute to a roth ira when you have no income is to do an ira rollover of course you need money in a tax deferred account to do this but this is how it works i always recommend those who have tax deferred ira 's and no agi due to the feie to roll over as much as they can every year to a roth ira that really is tax free money the only tax you 'll pay on that money is sales tax when you spend it =)

assuming united states answer may be different elsewhere the best instructions i have seen for this were on the webpage of one of the law firms making an organized business out of intra family loans but any lawyer who can deal with normal bank loans should be able to help you set this up and get it filed with the appropriate authorities to make it a legally binding mortgage should n't cost you much in legal time to do it you will have to charge interest your lawyer can tell you what the minimum and interest rates would be where you are your interest income will be taxable the borrower may or may not be able to deduct the interest paid from their taxes of course if the borrower has any sense they 'll want to get their own lawyer to review the terms of the agreement and to tell them whether they can deduct it from taxes or not

is that an fha loan you have and you 're wanting to do one of those low cost fha re fi 's right the answer is that in between when you first got that loan and now the government 's changed the rules on pmi for fha loans it more than doubled the amount of monthly pmi you have to pay   the new rates april 18th 2011 as as follows it used to be 0.50 per year for the 30 year so that 's why the pmi would go up   there is another rule in play too specific to that no cost fha refi the government requires that the combined monthly payment after the refi is at least 4 lower than the current payment note that the no cost refi does not require a new appraisal   some options present themselves but only if you can show some equity in a appraisal 1 if an appraisal shows at least 10 equity you can go refi to a standard mortgage you might even be able to find one that does n't require pmi at that level if you have 20 equity you 're golden no pmi 2 see what the monthly payment will be if you refi to the 15 year fha mortgage between the much lower pmi and the much lower interest rates 15 year is usually about 0.75 less than a 30 year it might not be much more than what you 're paying now and you 'd save a huge amount of money over time and get out from that pmi much earlier it stops when your principal drops below 80 of the loan amount this would require that

there is a significant tie between housing prices and mortgage rates   as such do n't assume low mortgage rates mean you will be financially better off if you buy now since housing prices are inversely correlated with mortgage rates   this is n't a huge correlation it 's r squared is a bit under 20 at a 1.5 2 year lag but there is a significant connection there   particularly in that era see chart at end of post for details in 1979 1982 there was a dramatic drop in housing price growth that with high interest rates there is a second major factor here though one that is likely much more important why the interest rates are at 10   interest rates are largely set to follow the federal funds rate the rate at which the federal reserve loans to banks   that rate is set higher for essentially one purpose to combat inflation   higher interest rates means less borrowing slower economic growth and most importantly a slower increase in the money supply all of which come together to prevent inflation those 10 and higher rates you heard about   those were in the 70 's and early 80 's   anyone remember the jimmy carter years   inflation in the period from 1979 to 1981 averaged over 10   inflation in the 70s from 1973 to 1982 averaged nearly 9 annually   that meant your dollar this year was worth only $ 0.90 next year which means inevitably a higher cost of borrowing    in addition to simply keeping pace with inflation the fed also uses the rate as a carrot stick to control us inflation   they were n't as good at that in the 70s they misread economic indicators in the late 1970s significantly lowering rates dramatically in 1975 from ~12 to ~5   this led to the dramatic double digit inflation of the 1979 1981 period requiring them to raise rates to levels nearly 20 at one point   yeah i hope nobody bought a house on a fixed rate mortgage from 1979 1981 the fed has gotten a lot more careful over the years alan greenspan largely was responsible for the shift in policy which seems to have been quite effective from the mid 1980s to the present though he 's long gone from his spot on the fed board   despite significant economic changes in both directions inflation has been kept largely under control since then and since 1991 have been keeping pretty steady around 6 or less   the current rate around 0 is unlikely to stay around forever that would lead to massive inflation eventually but it 's reasonable to say that prolonged periods over 10 are unlikely in the medium term    further if inflation did spike and with it your interest rates salaries tend to spike also   not quite as fast as inflation in fact that 's a major reason a small positive inflation around 2 3 is important to allow for wages to grow more slowly for poorer performers but still at 10 inflation the average wage will climb at a fairly similar pace   thus you 'd be able to buy more house or perhaps a better idea save more money for a house that you can then buy a few years down the road when rates drop ultimately the advice here is to not worry too much about interest rates buy a house when you 're ready and buy the house you 're ready for   interest rates may rise but if so it 's likely due to an increase in inflation and thus wage growth and it would take a major shift in the economy for rates to rise to the 10 11 level   if that did happen housing prices or at least growth in prices would likely drop significantly some further references

let me add another consideration to the company 's side of the equation   not only is a 401 k a tool for the company to make them competitive when recruiting employees among other companies that offer that benefit it is also a good retention tool most company 's 401 k plans include a vesting period of at least 3 years sometimes more an employee that leaves the company before they are vested in the plan will have to give up some of the employer matched funds in the account this gives employees incentive to stick around longer and the company reduces the risk of turnover which can be costly in terms of training and recruiting this also factors into the reason why employers would rather give matching on the 401 k than a simple pay raise some of those employees are going to leave during the vesting period anyway and when that happens the employer got the benefit of motivating the employee but in the end got to keep some of the money

my husband made a similar car loan decision when he was younger and did n't have an established credit history favourable credit rating   as a result he ended up paying triple what the car was worth because of the interest when we consolidated our finances this ugly loan was first on our list of priorities to change convert eliminate but unfortunately in our case the terms of the loan were such that only the lender benefited   there was no incentive to pay off the loan early in fact we would have to have paid all the future interest at once without saving a penny so check the terms of your loan hopefully you 're better off than we were   in our case the only upside we could figure was the lesson of live and learn

ditto nate in many ways but let me add some other thoughts btw there are not four types of account but five you 're forgetting equity also called capital would it be possible to design an accounting system that does not have 5 types of accounts maybe is simpler in other ways and is internally consistent and logical i 'm sure it is but what 's the advantage   as nate points out the existing system has been in use for hundreds of years lots of people know how it works and understand it   i 'd add people have long since worked out how to deal with all the common situations and 99 of the odd cases you 're likely to hit if you invent your own system you 're starting from scratch you 'd have to come up with conventions to handle all sorts of situations how do i record buying a consumable with cash how do i record buying a capital asset with credit how do i record paying off debts how do i record depreciation etc etc if you worked at it long and hard enough and you 're a reasonably bright guy maybe you could come up with solutions to all the problems but why   if you were approaching this saying i see these flaws in the way accounting is done today i have an idea for a new better way to do accounting i 'd say good luck you have a lot of work ahead of you working out all the details to make a fully functioning system and then others to use it but if you really do have a better idea maybe you can revolutionize the world of accounting but the present system is too much trouble and i do n't want to bother to learn it i think that 's a mistake the work involved in inventing your own system is going to end up being way more than what it would take to learn the existing system as to are n't liabilities a lot like assets well in a sense i suppose a credit card is like a checking account in that you can use it to pay for things but they 're very different too from an accounting point of view with a checking account you buy something and then the money is gone so there 's one transaction reduce cash and increase office supplies or whatever but with a credit card there has to be a second transaction when you pay off the charge so step 1 increase debt and increase office supplies step 2 decrease debt and decrease cash credit cards charge interest well you do n't pay interest to use your own cash etc one of the of double entry book keeping is that every transaction involves a debit and a credit of equal amounts or a set of debits and credits where the total of the debits equals the total of the credits if you combine assets and liabilities into whatever you call it balance accounts say then some transactions would involve a matching debit and credit while others would involve a positive debit and a matching negative debit and no credit i 'm sure you could make such a system work but one of the neat built in protections against error is lost there 's a very logical distinction between things that you have or that others owe you and things that you owe to others it makes a lot of sense to want to list them separately and manage them separately i think you 'd pretty quickly find yourself saying well we have two types of balance accounts those that represent things we have and which normally have positive balances which we list on chart a and those that represent things we owe and which normally have negative balances which we list on chart b and before you know it you 've just assets and liabilities

in addition to d. stanley 's very fine answer the price of stocks change as a result of changing market conditions and the resulting investor estimation of its effect on the company 's future earnings take these examples right now in the usa there is a housing shortage that is there are fewer houses available for purchase than there are willing buyers investors will correctly assume that the future earnings of home builders will be higher than they were say ten years ago seeking to capitalize on these higher earnings they will try to buy the stocks however the current owners of the stock potentially the sellers know the same thing as the investor buyer and therefore demand a premium to entice a sale the price of the stock has risen the reverse is true also brick and mortar retailers are declining as more consumers prefer on line retail shopping the current owners of these stocks will probably want to sell their stock before it is worth even less the investor buyer also knows the same facts that future earnings will most likely be less for these companies the potential buyer offers a very low price to entice a sale the price of the stock has fallen finally the price of stocks rise and fall with general market conditions as an example assume that next months jobs report is released showing that 350,000 new jobs were created in july investors will believe that if companies are hiring then the companies are doing well they are selling products and services at a higher than expected rate requiring that they add new employees they will also conclude that those 350,000 new employees will be spending their salaries to buy not just food clothing and shelter but also a few luxuries like a newer car a tv perhaps even a new home please see paragraph 2 all of these companies will have more business more earnings and likely a higher stock price

if you sell your shares for more than their value at the time you received them i.e. you make a profit then you will be liable for capital gains tax but only if the profit exceeds your annual allowance £ in tax year 2015 16 this is unrelated to how you came by the shares in the first place note that there are certain exemptions to this which includes some employer share schemes
