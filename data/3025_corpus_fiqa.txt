perhaps the real question you are asking is how can the tax code be fixed to make it simple for everyone including me and what would it take to effect those changes there are really two causes for the complexity of the tax code many of those who enter government hold a desire for power and government uses the tax code as one lever of power to distribute to their supporters and to nudge everyone to behaviors which they favor the current system enables incumbents to spend taxpayer money to reward those they favor and thus they accumulate power and security those who enter government also love to spend money especially other people 's money and their behavior recognizes no boundaries they will spend money without control until the taxpayers them to a brutal stop they enact complex rules which are used to ease the tax burden for some which buys their support with taxpayer money and they spend money to benefit those which they favor the system of lobbyists and contributors exists to entice government to treat them and the causes they support favorably this system enables incumbents to spend taxed money to reward those they favor and to tax those they thus their greed is satisfied and their power is increased the freedom you seek is not available although you can minimize the effort required for compliance you can take the standard deduction and use nothing but the w-2 provided by your employer and unless you are subject to the alternative minimum tax you will find that the tax software will do most of the work for you do you want to approach the of minimal effort to appease your tax collectors avoid starting your own business charitable donations investment income 1099 income and you will need minimal paperwork avoid earning enough to risk the amt alternative minimum tax refuse to take the mortgage interest deduction tax credits for electric vehicles tax credits for high efficiency appliances and air conditioners tax credits for residential solar panel installations do not own investments which pay interest or own stocks where you need to track the basis purchase price of the stocks nor buy and then sell valuable items that might gain value where you would need to track the purchase price the basis avoid owning and leasing a rental home for income deducting businesses expenses and mileage for business purposes contributions to a retirement plan outside an employer plan all complicate your tax filing the solution you truly desire is either a flat tax or the fair tax these solutions would effect either a single tax rate with no deductions or adjustments to income yeah right or a national retail sales tax which would tax the money spent in the economy regardless of the source of the money legal gifts crime and there would be no need to report income or classify it the largest objection to either is that the tax code might become less progressive increasing tax rate with increasing income good luck

in a word no if your income is high enough to have to file a return you have to file a return my accountant has a nice mindset for making it more palatable i 'll paraphrase our tax system is complicated as a result it is your duty as an american to seek out and take advantage of every deduction and credit available to you if our politicians and leaders put it into the tax code use it to your advantage a friend of mine got a free golf cart that way it was a crazy combination of credits and loopholes for electric vehicles that loophole has been closed and some would say it 's a great example of him exercising his patriotic duty

currently the answer is no you can not get out of filing a tax return   as noted in the comments if you want to pay more to get out of the of working on your return you can pay an accountant to do it for you you are not alone in thinking that the current income tax system in the u.s. is overly complicated   what you are essentially describing is a flat tax a system where there would be a simple tax rate that is paid with no deductions loopholes etc and minimal reporting requirements besides flat tax proposals others have proposed eliminating the income tax altogether and switching to a national sales tax such as the proposal each of these proposals has pros and cons over the current system and if you have questions about them feel free to ask a new question   but what they have in common is that they would drastically simplify the system of taxation in this country   if that sounds good to you you can learn more about these proposals and support organizations and candidates that advocate these reforms

actually if you do n't care about paying a bit more either hire an accountant and dump the paper on them or may be cheaper but a bit more work spring for tax software modern tax programs can often download most of your data directly if you do n't care about claiming deductions you can skip a lot of the rest i 'm perfectly capable of doing my taxes on paper or in a spreadsheet but i spring for tax software every year because i find it a lot more pleasant   remember that most of the complexity does come from policies intended to reduce your taxes when you call for simplification you may not like the result it 's better than it was a decade or two ago i used to joke that the battle cry of the next revolution would be no taxation without proper instructions

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

your question is best asked of a tax expert not random people on the internet such an expert will help you ask the right questions   for example you did not point out the country or state in which you live   that matters    first point is that you will not pay tax on 60 k its expensive to transact real estate so your net proceeds will be closer to   also you can probably the deduct the costs of improvements you implied that you really like this rental property   if that is the case why would you sell ever   this home could be a central part of your financial independence plan   so keep it until you die   iirc when it passes to your heirs a new cost basis is formed thereby not passing the tax burden onto them assuming the property is located in the us

the rich pay more in taxes it would be hard to cut taxes in a way that did nt help the rich i 'm more concerned with what it does for the middle and lower classes i do n't care that much if it helps the rich   edit okay so let 's say you give the top third of the population by income a 1 income tax cut the middle third got a 5 cut and the bottom third got a 10 cut in dollar value the rich are still getting a larger cut simply by virtue of how much they pay in taxes   someone made a point about property tax speaking very generally poor people rent and rich people own so a property tax inherently benefits the wealthy because they own more property certainly any kind of corporate or capital gains cut would benefit the wealthy since they own the corporations and are more heavily invested even a sales tax cut would benefit the wealthy more than the non wealthy simply because they spend more money   but what frustrates me is how hung up people get on the fact that something is good for the wealthy such as with the headline of ops article as if we should actively try to avoid helping anyone rich as i stated above i do n't care that it helps the rich as long as it 's helping the rest of us too and if the rich are getting a bigger benefit than i am by virtue of being rich i 'm not bothered because i can do math

netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows e.g. debits credits payments receipts income expense by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows creating one transaction    for example if you make two trades in one day with your broker one to buy a security for $ 100 and one to sell it for $ 110 rather then you sending your broker $ 100 and them sending you $ 110 the transactions are netted meaning they will send you the net amount of $ 10 $ 110 inflow $ 100 outflow in a more general sense netting of instructions it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the net effect e.g. one step forward two steps back would combine to a net one step back   most likely it will apply to the exchange of money but it could be applied more broadly note that there does n't have to be both inflows and outflows you can also net multiple inflows or outflows into one transaction by just adding them all up but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows

to keep it simple i will keep the focus between a trad ira and a normal taxable account roth 's and 401(k add more complications that make another problem   i will also assume based on the question that you are n't able to deduct the ira contributions also a roth is better in every way than a non deductible trad ira so the backdoor roth mentioned in other answers is probably the way to go and this is more of an academic exercise   ok so why bother with the ira if you 're taxed anyway   because you are n't taxed as you go with a normal non tax advantaged account you have to pay taxes every year on any realized capital gains and dividends including fund distributions because of the compounding nature of savings delaying paying taxes is in your best interest   simple example   taxable account ira account now this is a very simplified example if you 're more tax conscious i.e. more buy and holding you can delay paying some of the long term cap gains in the taxable account but any short term cap gains including distributions from the underlying funds will be at your marginal income tax rate   a few other observations edit i set up a spreadsheet where each year i deposited $ 1000 for 35 years each year the balance in the ira account grows by 5 but the taxable only by 0.15 = 4.25 due to the effect of taxes at the end of 35 years my simulation assumes you pay 15 on all the gains in the ira which would likely not be the case but easier than forecasting through retirement and demonstrates what i 'm trying to show here 's plot showing the balance in the various accounts the blue is the ira account orange the taxable account and grey is the effective balance of the ira after paying taxes on the gains    and here 's a plot of the advantage of the ira after paying taxes on the gains vs the taxable account   whether that 's worth it to you or anyone depends on some the assumptions in the simulation especially effective tax rates and growth rates as well as any personal issues some people may be less likely to raid an ira account for example than a normal account conversely if you have a project coming up you may need something a bit more liquid than an ira

you may have to both save your windfall in a savings account and use it to pay down your mortgage almost every mortgage has some sort of pay down option that allows you to pay off a percentage of the original principal without penalty any amounts above that will be penalized most likely by the amount of interest the lending institution would have collected ask your lender what the penalties are and what penalty free pay down options you have knowing that and how much you will receive each quarter by selling the company stock will tell you how much of your money you need to put against your house and your savings account

it has little to do with money or finance   it 's basic neuroscience   when we get money our brains release read your money and your brain and receiving dividends is getting money   it feels good so we 're more likely to do it again what you often see are because the above explanation sounds irrational so many people want to make their behavior look more rational   ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends in value investing terms dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low underpriced   however as you realize you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same assuming you 're using a free brokerage like robin hood you can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a    stream of cash like dividends that presents no problem whatsoever    so this can not be the explanation to why some people think it is    smart to be a dividend investor yes if you 're using a brokerage like robin hood there may be others but i think this is the only one right now then you are right on

when you itemize your deductions you get to deduct all the state income tax that was taken out of your paycheck last year not how much was owed but how much was withheld if you deducted this last year then you need to add in any amount that you received in state income tax refunds last year to your taxes this year to make up for the fact that you ended up deducting more state income tax than was really due to the state   if you took the standard deduction last year instead of itemizing then you did n't deduct your state income tax withholding last year and you do n't need to claim your refund as income this year also if you itemized but chose to take the state sales tax deduction instead of the state income tax deduction you also do n't need to add in the refund as income   for whatever reason illinois decided that you do n't get a it might be that the amount of the refund was too small to warrant the paperwork it might be that they screwed up but if you deducted your state income tax withholding on last year 's tax return then you need to add the state tax refund you got last year on line 10 of this year 's 1040 whether or not the state issued you a form or not   take a look at the line 10 instructions   starting on page 22 of the 1040 instructions to see if you have any unusual situations covered there that you did n't mention here for example if you received a refund check for multiple years last year then check your tax return from last year to verify that you deducted your state income tax withholding on schedule a. if you did then this year add the refund you got from the state to line 10 of this year 's 1040

it is unlikely that buying 100 shares will have any effect on a stock 's price unless the stock 's average trading volume is incredibly low   that being said no matter how many share you buy there 's no way to know what the impact on the price will be because that 's only one factor in how shares are priced   if anyone could figure out the answer to your question then they 'd be extremely rich because they 'd simply watch for big share trades and then buy those stocks on the way up the market makers who actually execute the trades are the ones who set the prices and most stocks have multiple market makers trading the stock so the bid ask you see is the highest bid and lowest ask   the market makers set the price based on what the trend of the stock is   if for instance there 's a large number of sell orders against a stock the market makers will start dropping the bid prices as they fill execution orders and as they see buy orders increase they 'll raise ask prices as they fill execution orders   the market makers earn the difference between what they paid to buy someone 's stock who was selling and what they get from someone else who buys it this is a simplified explanation so pro traders do n't beat me up grin so basically it takes quite a bit of share volume in one direction or another to affect a stock 's price   i can guarantee a trade would n't even be noticed by market makers i hope this helps good luck

when you pay off a loan early you pay the remaining principal and you save all of the remaining interest so you do save on interest but it 's the interest you would have paid in the future not the interest you have paid in the past your remaining balance when you pay off the loan only includes the principal not the projected interest interest is a factor of the amount borrowed the interest rate and the amount of time you borrow the money the sooner you repay the money the less interest you pay imagine if you had taken a 30 year loan at 4 interest but were allowed to make no payments until the loan term ended if you waited 15 years to make your first payment you would n't owe the same money as if you 'd made payments every month no instead of owing you 'd owe because you had borrowed $ 100k for 15 years plus the interest due rather than borrowing a declining sum so that 's why you do n't get a refund on interest for previous months if you had started with a 16 year loan then you would have been paying more principal every month and your monthly amount due would have been higher to reflect that as you paid the principal off faster the interest each month would drop faster paying a huge portion of the principal at the end of the loan is not the same as steadily paying it down in the same time frame you will pay a lot more interest in the former case and rightfully so it might help to consider a credit card payment in comparison if you run up a balance and pay only the minimum each month you pay a lot of interest over time because your principal goes down slowly if you suddenly pay off your credit card you do n't have to pay any more interest but you also do n't get any interest back for previous months that 's because the interest accrued each month is based on your current balance just like your mortgage the minimum payments are calculated differently but the interest accrued each month uses essentially the same mechanism

i suggest that you 're really asking questions surrounding three topics 1 what allocation hedges your risks but also allows for upside 2 how do you time your purchases so you 're not getting hammered by exchange rates 3 how do you know if you 're doing ok allocations your questions concerning allocation are really what if questions as points out only you can really answer those i would suggest building an excel sheet and thinking through the scenarios of at least 3 what ifs   a what if you keep your current allocations and anything in local currency gets cut in half in value could you live with that b what if you allocate more to stable economies and your economy recovers so stable items grow at 5 per year but your local investments grow 50 for the next 3 years could you live with that missed opportunity   c what if you allocate more to stable economies and they grow at 5 while sa continues a gradual slide remember that slow or flat growth in a stable currency is the same as higher returns in a declining currency i would trust your own insights as a local but i would recommend thinking more about how this plays out for your current investments   timing you bring up concerns about timing of buying expensive foreign currencies you ca n't time the market if you knew how to do this with forex trading you would n't be here   read up on dollar cost averaging for most people and most companies with international exposure it may not beat the market in the short term but it nets out positive in the long term   rebalancing for you there will be two questions to ask regularly is the allocation still correct as political and international issues play out have any returns or losses thrown your planned allocation out of   alignment   put your investment goals in writing and revisit it at least once a year to evaluate whether any adjustments would be wise to make   and of course i am not a registered financial professional especially not in sa so i obviously recommend taking what i say with a large dose of salt

boomers have also bid up the prices of a lot of things everything from stocks to housing simply because they as a bulge were all attempting to in the aggregate buy basically the same things at essentially the same time   basically a lot of demand chasing and driving a supply this often made the previously acquired assets i.e. the early boomer contingent who got there amp bought in first appear to increase quickly in price   the opposite effect will happen as they retire die off either they or their heirs will choose or need to sell off their various accumulated assets   then suddenly the supply will begin to bulge instead selling off portfolios of stocks even required as pensions need to be paid or as boomers reach + 70 1/2 and are mandated by law to begin selling off amp cashing in specific 's of their 401 k and ira holdings and likewise with housing aging boomers will downsize selling off the which they never really needed and which in retirement will be burdensome to maintain and trying to move into or selling off the several second amp third vacation homes   end result will be a big dump of supply of housing onto the market a supply that genx does not have the demographic numbers to consume and which it does not appear the frugal minded genx even want to buy at anything like the same rates the boomers did even if they were capable of paying the price which it also appears they can not having been in career amp salary gains by the bulge of boomers in positions above before them and then the echo boomers which while larger than x are not the equivalent of the original boomers and who are carrying an huge house sized debt load but minus the house and in many cases as debt which can not be erased as it is in student loan form from the beginning of their careers in which they are being paid significantly less than previous generations and who are delaying and then limiting the formation of households as a result   and that is just how demographic play out it was all entirely predictable and was in fact predicted by many

there are a number of ways to get out of debt first stop spending on that card you could apply for a 0 apr credit card and if you qualify with a credit limit equal or higher than what you have now then you could transfer the balance and start on paying that down you could also work out a payment plan with chase they would rather have some of the money vs. none of it but you need to reach out sooner rather than later to avoid having it sent to collections   since your cash flow is terrible you could also pick up a second or third part time job deliver pizzas work at the mall whatever to help increase your cash flow and use that money to pay down your debts   the federal trade commission has some resources on how to cope with debt

i think the key to intrinsic value is that if you have something with intrinsic value you can derive some direct benefit from it without trading   for example a house has intrinsic value because without trading it you can use it to stay warm and dry and use it to store your stuff money whether it 's federal currency or bitcoin has a very low intrinsic value what can you do with cash without trading it maybe make some paper art or patch a leaking boat but a $ 20 bill has very little practical intrinsic value until you trade it for goods or services the same with bitcoin you ca n't play it like a video game or drink it if you 're all you can do is trade it for things that you can use directly

i think you 're looking at the picture in an odd way when each of you made your initial investments and determined what portions you owned that gave the company capital that they could use to finance its operations in return you are entitled to the future profits of the company in proportion to your ownership any future investment by either of you is at your own discretion your company now faces a situation where it would like to pursue a potentially lucrative opportunity but needs more capital than it has to do so so you need to raise more capital that capital can come from one or both of you or from an outsider since that investment would be discretionary what the investor gets is a negotiation the company negotiates with the investor how much equity in the form of new shares to award in exchange for the new investment or whatever other compensation you decide on if not equity

the best predictor of mutual fund performance is low expense ratio as reported by morningstar despite the fact that it produces the star ratings you cite most of the funds you list are actively managed and thus have high expense ratios even if you believe there are mutual fund managers out there that can pick investments intelligently enough to offset the costs versus a passive index fund do you trust that you will be able to select such a manager most people that are n't trying to sell you something will advise that your best bet is to stick with low cost passive index funds i only see one of these in your options which is fidelity spartan 500 index fund fidelity advantage class with an exceptionally low expense ratio of 0.05 do you have other investment accounts with more choices like an ira if so you might consider putting a major chunk of your 401(k money into and use your ira to balance your overall with and medium cap domestic stock international stock and bond funds as an aside i remember seeing a funny comment on this site once that is applicable here something along the lines of do n't take investment advice from coworkers unless they 're warren buffett or bill gross

paypal forbids using their credit card service to give yourself a cash advance or help others to do so for small you may get away with it but pushing $ 10 k through a paypal account is going to raise red flags in the usa it seems that some cards allow balance transfers from other types of loan while others are restricted to credit cards only so that is a possibility another option can be to find a card with a good deal on purchases then move your regular purchases to the card and use the money you would normally have spent on purchases to pay off the other loan remember credit cards can be either a very cheap way to borrow or a very expensive way which one they are depends on how good you are at negotiating the traps they set up for you if you do use a credit card deal make sure you   is it overall a viable option that depends on the details which are not specified in your hypothetical scenario the persons credit rating what the interest is like on the existing loan and what the expected time to repay the debt is

i 'm another programmer i guess we all just like complicated things or got here via obligatory tedious but accurate point investing is not personal finance in fact it 's maybe one of the less important parts of it see this answer where to start with personal finance   obligatory warning for software developer type minds getting into investing because it 's complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective   or see behavioral finance research on how analytical professional creative type people are often terrible at investing while even tempered practical people are better the thing with investing is that inaction is better than action tried and true is better than creative and simple is better than complicated so if you 're like me and many programmers and like creative complicated action not good for the wallet you 've been warned that said stuff i read in general i hate reading too much financial information because i think it makes me take ill advised actions the actions i most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns so i try to focus on reading about software development for example or i answer questions on this site which at least might help someone out and i enjoy writing for basic financial news and research i prefer especially if you get the premium version the writing has more depth it 's often from qualified financial analysts and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks instead of a small number as with motley fool newsletters i do n't follow morningstar regularly anymore instead i use it for research when i need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever another caveat on morningstar is that the star ratings on funds are dumb look at the analyst picks and the analyst instead i just flipped through my rss reader and i have 20 30 finance related blogs in there collecting posts it looks like the only one i regularly read is which is sort of random but i find david very thoughtful and interesting he 's also a conservative without being a partisan hack and posts frequently i read the weekly market comment at as well most weeks it says the market is overvalued so that 's predictable but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about i read a lot of software related blogs and there 's some bleed into finance especially from the vc world blogs like or or whatever anyway i spend most of my reading time on career related stuff and i think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective if you were a doctor you 'd be better off reading about too i read finance related books fairly often i guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front i prefer books about principles rather than a of daily financial news and questionable ideas other than that i keep up with headlines just reading the paper every day including business related topics is good enough if there 's some big event in the financial markets it 'll show up in the regular paper take a class i initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the cfp course and the first cfa course both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus you can just do the class and take the exam if you like without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications i did n't go on to do that this sounds like a crazy thing to do and it kind of is but i think it 's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material if you 're a normal person and do n't have time to take finance courses you 're likely better off either keeping it super simple or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money   when it 's inevitably complex e.g. as you approach retirement then an advisor is best my mom is retiring soon and i found her a professional for example i like having a lot of knowledge myself because it 's just the only way i could feel comfortable so for sure i understand other people wanting to have it too but what i 'd share from the other side is that once you have it the conclusion is that you do n't have enough knowledge or time to do anything fancy anyway and that the simple answers are fine check out investing for fun is n't investing for profit many people recommend motley fool i see two on this question already the site is n't evil but the problem in my opinion is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that is n't objectively justifiable for practical reasons essentially i do n't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun very well if investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or then motley fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money wise see behavioral finance research again talking to others is n't compatible with ice in your decision making also motley fool tends to make it sound like active investing is easier than it is there 's a reason the chartered financial analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience rather than reading blogs practical investing just buy the target date fund can be super easy but once you go beyond that it 's not i do n't really agree with the anyone can do it and it 's not work premise any more than i think that about or or computer programming after 15 years i 'm a programming expert after some courses and a lot of reading i 'm not someone who could professionally run an actively managed portfolio i think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages or just do something else for fun besides investing morningstar has this problem too and and bloomberg i mean they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to they all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference when they do n't bottom line i do n't think personal finance changes very quickly the details of specific mutual funds change and there 's always some new twist in the tax code but the big picture is pretty stable i think going in depth say read the chartered financial analyst curriculum materials would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently the most important things to work on are income career and spending to maximize income minus spending that 's where time investment will pay off i know it 's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering but i did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there

for questions 1 and 2   1 if you are packing the loans into a cdo they are being sold on the open market once it achieves a aaa rating as most did even though they were mostly subprime alt a or arm it is sold and shipped off the originator 's books while the originator of the cdo collects x% in fees   basically how the originator makes their money is by x amount of cdos they sell there was no incentive to pick and choose the best borrowers to sell a loan to because how the cdos were sold they achieved the best rating regardless of the borrowers credit risk   due to this model people are going to try and get as many people into the homes and sell the cdo asap this caused questionable lending practices to result ninja no income no job no assets loans manipulating borrowers income assets etc    things that could be changed to help not have this occur again   a feds monetary policy was pretty meh during this period due to low interest rates the banks had pretty much an endless supply of money and when all the reasonable ventures dried up they had to explore other opportunities to lend   b ratings agencies need an overhaul in how they receive their commission preferably they should be being paid by the investor not the person issuing the security this will help to eliminate the bias that results   c having x% 2 5 remain on the institutions books who created the cdo will help to make them responsibly lend this is because if they are required to have it remain on their books they will make better longer term decisions in who to lend to   i 'm pretty sure all of these issues are discussed in roubini 's book crisis crisis economics course future finance   another great book already mentioned in this thread is by michael lewis the big big short inside doomsday machine = sr_1_1?s = books&amp;ie = 1   if your interested in the european crisis michael lewis also just came out with travels new third world = sr_1_1?s = books&amp;ie = 1

the reason is stores want customers to use cash    by giving us cash we are more likely to use cash next time i feel a little guilty when using my bank card at the store because i know i 'm giving about 2 3 of the sale to the bank   unless i do n't really like where i 'm shopping ie walmart i try to use cash if i have it   i doubt these large stores pay extra for supplying the cash portion   they just need to keep the cash in other countries do they not mind paying banks a percentage of each transaction   that 's a huge loss for retailers   i also heard tipping is n't popular in some countries maybe the lack of regard for vendors is related somehow oh plus it 's a value added service   a customer is more likely to return to a store if they provide this service

a possibility could be real estate brokerage firms such as or although a brokerage commission is linked to the sale prices it is more directly impacted by sales volume if volume is maintained or goes up a real estate brokerage firm can actually profit rather handsomely in an up market or a down market   if sales volume does go up another option would be other service markets for real estate such as real estate information and marketing websites and sources i.e. furthermore one can go and make a broad generalization such as since real estate no longer requires the same quantity of construction material other industries sensitive to the price of those commodities should technically have a lower cost of doing business but be careful in the us much of the wealth an average american has is in their home in this case this means that the economy as a whole takes a dive due to consumer uncertainty in which case safe havens could benefit may be things like gamble gold or treasuries side note you can always short builders or someone who loses if the housing market declines this will make your investment higher as a result of the security going lower

something that 's come up in comments and been alluded to in answers but not explicit as far as i can tell even if your marginal tax rate now were equal to your marginal tax rate in retirement or even lower a traditional ira may have advantages   that 's because it 's your effective tax rate that matters on withdrawls based on ty 2014 single person but applies at higher numbers for other arrangements you pay 0 taxes on the first $ of income and then pay 10 on the next $ then 15 on $ then 25 on the total amount over that up to $ etc   as such even if your marginal rate is 25 say you earn $ 80k your effective rate is much less for example $ 80k income you pay taxes on $   that ends up being $ for an effective rate in total of let 's say you had the same salary $ 80k from 20 to 65 and for 45 years saved up 10k a year plus earned enough returns to pay you out $ 80k a year in retirement   in a roth you pay 25 on all $ 10k   in a traditional you save that $ 2500 a year because it comes off the top the amount over $ and then pay during retirement your effective tax rate because it 's the amount in total that matters    so for roth you had while for traditional the correct amount is n't but   you make the difference between .75 and back even with the identical income   of course if your $ 10k would take you down a marginal bracket then it also has an effective tax rate of something between the two rates thus roth makes sense if you expect your effective tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now   this is very possible still because for people like me with a mortgage high property taxes two kids and student loans my marginal tax rate is pretty low even with a reasonably nice salary i still pay 15 on the stuff that 's heading into my ira   sadly my employer has only a traditional 401k but they also contribute to it without requiring a match so i wo n't complain too much   since i expect my eventual tax rate to be in that 18 20 at a minimum i 'd benefit from a roth ira right now this matters more for people in the middle brackets earning high 5 figure salaries as individuals or low 6 figure as a couple because the big difference is relevant when a large percentage of your income is in the 15 and below brackets   if you 're earning $ 200k then so much of your income is taxed at 28 33 it does n't make nearly as much of a difference and odds are you can play various tricks when you 're retiring to avoid having as high of a tax rate

's answer is spot on with the advice to avoid repeated conversions but i 'd like to provide some specifics on the fees involved each time you round trip canadian dollars cad through a u.s dollar usd priced security at td waterhouse and leave your proceeds in cad you 're paying a total foreign exchange fee implied in their rate   spread of about 3 give or take that 's ~3 per buy sell combination or on each end you can imagine if you trade back forth frequently you can quickly lose a lot of money   do it back and forth ten times in a year and you 're out ~30 on the fees alone the td u.s. money market fund that td waterhouse is referring to has no direct commission to buy or sell but it does have a management expense ratio mer of 0.20 per year basically a fee which is deducted from the fund 's returns which today are also close to zero   practically speaking that 's a very slim fee to hold some usd in your canadian dollar tfsa while 0.20 is cheap a point to keep in mind is if you maintain a significant usd balance you are maintaining currency risk   you can lose money in cad terms if the cad appreciates vs. usd additional references canadian capitalist describes td waterhouse and the use of and wash trades at how to wash your trade   he 's referring to rrsps but the same applies to tfsas which came out after the post was written canadian couch potato has two relevant articles are us listed etfs really cheaper and lowering your currency exchange fees

if you owned a bank how would you invest the bank 's money   typically banks are involved in loaning out money to businesses people and government at a higher interest rate then what they are paying to depositors   this is the spread and how they make money if the bank determines that the yields on government bonds is more attractive then loaning the money out to businesses and people then the bank will purchase government bonds   it can also decide the other way   in this manner the mortgage and bond markets are always competing for capital and tend to offer very similar yields certain banks have the unique privilege of being able to borrow money from the fed at the federal funds rate and use this money to purchase government debt or loan it out to other banks or purchase other debt products in this manner you see a high correlation between the fed funds rate mortgage rates and treasury yields     other political factors include legislation that encourages mortgage lending see community reinvestment act where banks may not have made the loans without said legislation in short keep your eye on the fed and ask yourself does the fed want rates to rise and can the us government afford rising rates   the answer to these two questions is no   however the fed may be pressured to stop the presses if inflation becomes unwieldy and the fed actually starts to care about food and energy prices   so far this has n't been the case

i read the book and i 'm willing to believe you 'd have a good chance of beating the market with this strategy it is a reasonable rational and mechanical investment discipline i doubt it 's overplayed and to the point that it wo n't ever work again but only if you stick to it and doing so would be very hard which is probably why it is n't overplayed and already this strategy makes you place trades in companies you often wo n't have heard of with volatile prices the best way to use the strategy would be to try to get it automated somehow and avoid looking at the individual stocks i bet to take your behavior out of it there may well be some risk factors in this strategy that you do n't have in an s&p 500 fund and those could explain some of the higher returns for example a basket of companies could be more vulnerable to economic events the strategy wo n't beat the market every year either so that can test your behavior strategies tend to work and then stop working as the book even mentions this is related to   whether other investors are piling in to the strategy and pushing up prices in part   but also outside events can just happen to line up poorly for a given strategy for example a bunch of the fundamental index etfs that looked at dividend yield launched right before all the high dividend financials investing in high dividend stocks probably is and was a reasonable strategy in general but it was n't a great strategy for a couple years there anytime you do n't buy the whole market you risk both positive and negative deviations from it here 's maybe a bigger picture point though i happen to think beating the market is a big old distraction for individual investors what you really want is predictable adequate returns who cares if the market returns 20 as long as your returns are adequate and who cares if you beat the market by 5 if the market 40 so i 'm not a huge fan of investment books that are structured around the topic of beating the market whether it 's index fund advocates saying you ca n't beat the market so buy the index or greenblatt saying here 's how to beat the market with this strategy it 's still all about beating the market and to me beating the market is just irrelevant nobody ever bought their food in retirement because they did or did not beat the market to me beating the market is a game for the kind of actively managed mutual fund that has a r squared correlation with the index often called an index hugger these funds are just trying to out a little bit better result than the market and often get a little bit worse result and overall are a lot of effort with no purpose just get the index fund rather than these if you 're getting active management involved i 'd rather see a big deviation from the index and i 'd like that deviation to be related to risk control hedging or pulling back to cash when valuations get rich or avoiding companies without a moat and margin of safety or whatever kind of risk control but something in a fund like this you are n't trying to beat the market you 're trying to increase the chances of adequate returns you 're optimizing for predictability i 'm not sure the magic formula is the best way to do that focused as it is on beating the market rather than on risk control sorry for the extra but i hope i answered the question a bit too

it sounds like the postage amount was paid to you rather than returned   if it had been returned and the payment originated on the card they would have to return it to the card   if it was processed as a payment it looks like someone is giving you money   paypal ca n't credit it to the card as the sender could request a refund   if paypal put the money on the card against a previous payment then they would n't be able to refund    if they add money to your bank account then they can withdraw it if a refund is required    one reason that you might get a payment is if you were being reimbursed for spending money outside of paypal   if the amount is more than you originally paid they ca n't put it on your card   they can only refund to the card   they ca n't deposit to it    if you do n't want to give them your bank account information you can just wait until the next time you use paypal and use your balance to pay   then you can bill the remainder to your credit card    if you do n't normally use paypal and just want your money back you can process a chargeback through your credit card   note that this would probably annoy paypal as it costs them and potentially money   to do this you must have paid the postage with your credit card originally   if you spent money outside paypal and were reimbursed through paypal then there 's nothing to chargeback   in that circumstance you 'd have to accept one of their options   pay with balance or deposit to bank account

yes by paying double the amount each month you would have in effect paid the loan off in less than half the time for $ at 3 over 60 months your monthly repayments would be $ if you double your monthly repayments to $ you would end up paying the loan off by the end of the 29th months more than halving your loan term as long as there are no penalties for paying the loan off early

the thing to recall here is that auto pay is a convenience not a guarantee auto pay withdrawals notices that a bill is due all of these are niceties that the lender uses to try to make sure you consistently pay your bill on time as all businesses enjoy steady cash flows now what all of these quality of life features do n't do is mitigate your responsibility as outlined when you first took out the loan to pay it back in a timely manner and according to the terms and conditions of the loan if your original contract for the loan states you shall make a payment of $ each calendar month then you are required to make that payment one way or another if auto pay fails you are still obligated to monitor that and correct the payment to ensure you meet your contractual obligation it 's less than pleasant that they did n't notify you but you were already aware you had an obligation to pay back the loan and knew what the terms of the loan were any forgiveness of interest or penalties for late fees is entirely up to the csr and the company 's internal policies not the law

i was active in prosper when it started up it was very easy to get attracted to the high risk loans with big interest rates and i lost about 14 after all my loans ran their course there 's 10 still active but it wo n't change the figure by much prosper has wider standards than lending club so more borrowers with worse credit scores could ask for loans lenders could also set interest rates far lower so they could end up having loans with rates lower than the risk implied   this was set up with the idea of a free market where anyone could ask to borrow and anyone could loan money at whatever interest rate they wanted   it turns out a lot of lenders were not as smart as they thought they were aside it 's funny how people will for a free market but when they lose money will suddenly be against the free market they said they wanted this seems to apply to both individual p2p lenders up to massive multinational banks   since then prosper has tightened their standards on who can borrow and the interest rates are now fixed so i expect going forward it will be less easy to lose a bunch of money   the key is that one bad loan will erase the return of many good ones so it 's best to examine the loans carefully and stick with the high quality   simplified example if you have 10 1 yr loans of $ 100 each paying 10 interest year you get 10 return at the end of the year so $ 100 10 of $ 1000 but if one loan goes bad at the start you have lost money so a 90 success rate in picking borrowers leads to a loss you want to diversity over quite a few loans and you want to fund quality loans   i think really enjoyed investing through prosper because it gave me an insight into lending and loss ratios that i had not had before it also caused me to look at the banks with even more when the case of the no doc loans and am loans came to light

investopedia has this note where you 'd want the point the interest rate commonly about by the media has a wide and    varied impact upon the economy when it is raised the general effect    is a lessening of the amount of money in circulation which works to    keep inflation low it also makes borrowing money more expensive    which affects how consumers and businesses spend their money this    increases expenses for companies lowering earnings somewhat for those    with debt to pay finally it tends to make the stock market a    slightly less attractive place to investment as for evidence i 'd question that anyone could really take out all the other possible economic influences to prove a direct co relation between the federal funds rate and the stock market returns   for example of the dozens of indices that are stock related which ones would you want that evidence total market large cap small cap value stocks growth stocks tech utilities reits etc   this is without considering other possible investment choices such as direct real estate holdings compared to reits that is precious metals and collectibles that could also be used

first off high five on the paycheck   there are a few retirement issues to deal with 401k issues at that income level you will probably fall into the highly compensated employee category which means things get a little more complicated both for you and your employer   wikipedia link ira issues as you already realized you make too much to directly open and contribute to a roth ira   you can open a traditional ira however   your income is already over the limit for traditional ira deduction bummer so it would seem there is little point to opening an ira at all however there is a way to take advantage of a roth ira even at your income level   it is possible to convert a traditional ira into a roth ira   there used to be income limits on the ability to do the conversion which would have normally made this off limits to you   starting in 2010 the income limit is removed so you can do this basically you open a traditional ira max it out then convert it to a roth   since there was no income deduction you should n't have to pay any more taxes   link disclaimer i 've never tried this nor do i know anyone who has so you might want to research it a bit more before you try it yourself

are you obligated to do what they ask probably not with one big caveat discussed below your employer sent your money and their money after every paycheck to the 401 k management company then after a while the 401 k management company followed your instructions to roll it over into an ira now the ira management company has it pulling it out of the ira would be very hard and the ira company would be required to report it to the irs as a withdraw here is the caveat if the extra funds you put in allowed you to exceed the annual contribution amount set by the law or if it allowed you to put more than 100 of your income into the fund then this would be an excess contribution and you and your employer would have to resolve or face the excess contribution penalties though if the 401 k company and hr allowed you to exceed the annual limit they have a much more complex problem with their payroll system the bigger concern is why they want you to pull out your $ 27.50 and their $ 27.50 unless you were hitting the maximum limit your $ 27.50 could have been invested by adjusting the percentage taken out of each check   you could have picked a percentage to reach a goal that money is yours because you contributed it and unless you exceed the irs set limits it is still pre tax retirement money the return of matching funds may be harder to calculate the returns for 2013 were very good each $ 1.06 of matching funds each paycheck purchased a fraction of some investment that investment went up and down ok mostly up if it was invested in the broad market i guess you should be glad they are n't asking for more due to the increase in value   it would be very hard to calculate what happened if you have moved it around since then which of course you did when you moved it into an ira if the average employee was also given a $ 55 gift last year then the suggestion to the employer is that the tax complexity you and your fellow employees face would exceed the cost of the extra funds they should chalk it up to an expensive lesson and move on

curious why are you interested in building improving your credit score is it better to use your card and pay off the bill completely every month yes how is credit calculated     is it average utilization over the month or total amount owed per month it depends on how often your bank reports your balances to the reporting agencies it can be daily when your statement cycle closes or some other interval how does credit utilization affect your score   closest to zero without actually being zero is best this translates to making some charges even $ 1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off this shows as active use if you pay off your balance before the statement closes then it can sometimes be reported as inactive unused is too much a bad thing   yes is too little a bad thing depends being debt free has its advantages but if your goal is to raise your credit score then having a low utilization rate is a good metric less than 7 utilization seems to be the optimal level   last year we started using a number not as a recommendation but as a fact that most of the people with really high fico scores have credit utilization rates that are 7 percent or lower watts said read more remember that on time payment is the most important factor second is how much you owe third is length of credit history maintain these factors in good standing and you will improve your score

would make sense that the higher liquidation cost and transaction costs are driving the share price down    higher and transaction means higher investors would require higher return driving down the share price the other possibilities i can think of off the top of my head based on looking at the firm for five minutes   1 in transaction costs did you include tax disclaimer math below done on the back of the envelope in between meetings   so nav says they are at liquidating that entire portfolio means about 22 capital gains tax rate which means after tax value is about $ add in any fees you 'd incur from trying to sell this stuff and it 's not unreasonable to assume you 'll only get about $ 55 m once all is said and done which is pretty close to the actual market cap    if you have accounted for the above consider   2 bulk of their investments seem to be in private assets which implies that they have some discretion in how they mark the value of those investments and there is the chance that the market does n't have confidence in these guys what 's their performance been like in recent years especially with a private asset portfolio i 'd be weary    if i was to invest in them i 'd want a higher return for the opaque portfolio

they said the expected returns from the stock market are around 7   emphasis added the key word in your quote is expected   on average the market gains in the 7 9 range more if you reinvest dividends but there 's a great deal of risk too meaning that in any given year the market could be down 20 or be   up 30 your student loan on the other hand is risk free   you are guaranteed to pay lose 4 a year in interest   you ca n't directly compare the expected return of a risk free asset with the expected return of a risky asset   you can compare the risks of two assets with equal expected returns and the expected returns of assets with equal risks but you ca n't directly compare returns of assets with different risks   so in two years you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan or you might be much worse off   in ten years your chances of coming out ahead are better but still not guaranteed what 's confusing is i 've heard that if you 're investing you should be investing in both stocks and bonds since i 'm young i would n't want to put much in bonds though so how would that factor in   bonds have lower risk uncertainty than stocks but lower expected returns   if you invest in both your overall risk is lower since sometimes not always the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds   so there is value in diversifying since you can get better expected returns from a diversified portfolio than from a single asset with a comparable amount of risk   however there it no risk free asset that will have a better return than what you 're paying in student loan interest

the main difference between a bull market and a bear market is due the the leverage effect the leverage effect refers to the observed tendency of an asset ’s    volatility to be negatively correlated with the asset ’s returns    typically rising asset prices are accompanied by declining    volatility and vice versa the term leverage refers to one possible    economic interpretation of this phenomenon developed in black 1976    and 1982 as asset prices decline companies become    mechanically more leveraged since the relative value of their debt    rises relative to that of their equity as a result it is natural to    expect that their stock becomes riskier hence more volatile more volatile assets in a bear market are not such good investments as less volatile assets in a bull market

so you do n't want to know about a gas leak in a building if that leak has n't caused the building to explode for the last 6 years    and when he is talking explosion he 's not talking the once every 10 year recession   he 's talking 1929 1937 1945 and specifically says bigger than say 1974 or 2008   where are you getting the 10 year crap   seriously is that what you 're saying   or are you saying that you just do n't believe there is a gas leak   i 'm addressing the former   the ignition source will probably not be within the us unless long term bond yields increase substantially   the ignition source will be from a recession in china or from japanese yields increasing from currency risk or default risk   the japanese crisis has been 20 years in the making     however with the current debt gdp of japan and the structure of chinese total debt govt + corporate + personal and the recognition that these are the top two gdp 's in the world the dangers for the world are undeniably larger than ever

it 's not a question with a single right answer   other answers have addressed some aspects my case may provide some guidance as to one way of looking at some of the issues when i had student loans the interest rate was and i could get more than that as the return on a savings account   at the time i could get a whole year 's worth of loan at the start of the year save it and draw from the savings partly because i had a little working capital saved already   importantly in my case the loans were use it or lose it if i did n't take the loan out by about halfway through each academic year it was no longer available to me the difference in interest rates was probably similar to what you can get with a careful choice of savings account and 0 on the loan i did this in the 90s when interest rates were higher over a four year degree the interest i earned this way added up to no more than about £ 100 which went towards offsetting the fact i would be paying interest after graduation if you can clear the loan before you pay any interest it would give you a return but a small one that could easily be eroded by rate changes or errors on your part like not keeping on top of the paperwork   it still may be beneficial to take out the loans depending on your capital needs in my case it made buying a house after graduating much easier as we still had money for the deposit downpayment and student loan rates were much lower than mortgage rates 100 mortgages were also available then but expensive stands for retail price index a measure of inflation

from the way you frame the question it sounds like you more or less know the answer already yes you can make a non deductable contribution to a traditional ira and convert it to a roth ira here is wikipedia 's explanation regardless of income but subject to contribution limits contributions can be made to a traditional ira and then converted to a roth this allows for backdoor contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the roth ira there is no limit to the frequency with which conversions can occur so this process can be repeated indefinitely one major caveat to the entire backdoor roth ira contribution process however is that it only works for people who do not have any pre tax contributed money in ira accounts at the time of the backdoor conversion to roth conversions made when other ira money exists are subject to pro rata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter 9 do note the caveat in the second paragraph this article explains it more thoroughly the irs does not allow to specify which dollars are being converted as they can with shares of stock being sold for the purposes of determining taxes on conversions the irs considers a person ’s non roth ira money to be a single co sum hence if a person has any funds in any non roth ira accounts it is impossible to contribute to a traditional ira and then convert that account to a roth ira as suggested by various pundits and the wikipedia piece referenced above conversions must be performed on a pro rata basis of all ira money not on specific dollars or accounts say you have $ 20k of pre tax assets in a traditional ira and make a non deductable contribution of $ 5k the account is now 80 pre tax assets and 20 post tax assets so if you move $ 5k into a roth ira $ 4k of it would be taxed in the conversion the traditional ira would be left with $ 16k of pre tax assets and $ 4k of post tax assets

having worked in insurance i can give you a few pointers firstly state that you may have to complain insurers hate complaints because they really complicate matters are loads of work and must be tracked i would advise not actually escalating it to a complaint until later as this may cause a delay as the actual process is quite convoluted mentioning the possibility of complaint sometimes makes people a bit more active try and resolve the issue and if you are n't getting anywhere then make a complaint maintain a friendly polite if you get angry and aggressive you 'll not likely get far remember that the people on the end of the phone are both human and more knowledgeable about insurance than you you want them on your side not against you make notes if you can record calls if you are recording calls you will likely legally need to give them the option of not being recorded so make sure you mention that you 're recording each individual call as soon as you start speaking to the handler   refer to your notes and make sure you carry out actions you say you will if you spend a few days sending something you said you 'd email over that day and you then chase them a few days after that they may not have had the document through their workflow yet it also urgency if you 're acting promptly and suggests that you do n't really care if you 're taking your time   get names this is an important step as this gives the handler someone to talk to who may be familiar with your case you may end up speaking to the same people more than once so try and build a rapport if you do i like this guy may lead to a bit more effort being put in and a potentially better outcome in my experience can be a bit slow to respond to things so you 'll likely have to chase them up if you chase them up and say i called on x date discussing y with z and z said they would do a b and c. has this been done yet it looks better than saying i called about a week ago and spoke to one of your colleagues who said he 'd do something for me he 's not done it what 's going on as to a plan of action i would split this into two points mis sold policy and definition of commuting mis sold policy if they truly gave your wife two options then they messed up the standard 3 offered by are social domestic and pleasure and and business use other companies sometimes roll commuting into as standard on the comparison sites however there are usually the three separate options and if you used one to set the policy up and clicked only then you may be in trouble   social domestic and pleasure only does not include commuting whilst it is your responsibility to thoroughly check any documentation that comes through it could be argued that if given two options between business use and then a reasonable person could be considered to assume that definition of did include commuting therefore they need to prove to you that there were three options offered and that your wife specifically excluded commuting if they ca n't then you should be able to argue that only two were offered and that commuting could have reasonably been assumed to be included use that term reasonable person btw it 's used in a lot of internal literature at least at the insurer i worked at not commuting firstly clarify their definition of commuting if your wife was on her way to work afterwards then they may well consider she was commuting for instance at present i drive from my house to my son 's then to my wife 's work and finally to mine my commute could be argued to be 1 minute my workplace is probably a minutes drive from my wife 's but i ca n't park in her car park but if i were to have an accident between my house and my son 's ~15 mins drive the insurers would probably consider that commuting   if she was not on her way to work afterwards and assuming your wife arranged her visit via text or whatsapp fb messenger or similar you should easily be able to show that your wife had driven from a friends house to the if she was on a holiday day or was not working on that day then that 's also something you should be able to prove either with proof of her working pattern or proof of her holiday if she does n't have a job at all then again that 's something that 's provable proof reigns king in claims so if you can prove certain key facts then you should be on to a winner

this is an answer grounded in reality not advice most states have no means of enforcing their foreign business entity registration statutes some states never even codified consequences california is a notable exception some states have business licenses that you need in order to defend your entity in court but will retroactively apply the corporate veil when you get the license the do i have to register question is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut but this does n't absolve you of looking in the mirror doing your research registration and income taxes are different stories if a state calls their fee a franchise tax and it is applicable and there are real consequences for not then you will have to pay that tax anyway this is n't advocating breaking the law but since it describes ignoring state chartered agencies then there are people that will disagree with this post despite being in line with business climate in the united states hope that helps

etiquette or not it is hurting the seller the transaction fees have usually minimums so if the actual transaction is below the minimum they 'll pay larger fee on the transaction relatively as an example assume minimum fee for a debit card swipe is 20 cents or 2 of the transaction for a transaction of $ 10 and above the fee will be 2 of the transaction but for $ the fee becomes 12 of the transaction 6 times more expensive for the seller basically the sale was most likely at a loss for them they usually have very low margins especially for a dollar store so take that into account as well

the principal of the contribution can definitely be withdrawn tax free and penalty free however there is a section that makes me think that the earnings part may be subject to penalty in addition to tax in publication under traditional iras > when can you withdraw or use assets > contributions returned before due date of return > early distributions tax it says the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59½    does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions    however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported    on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to    the age 59½ rule it will be subject to this tax this section is only specifically about the return of contributions before the due date of return not a general withdrawal as you can see from the first sentence that the penalty does n't apply to contributions which would n't be true of general withdrawals therefore the second sentence must be about the earnings part of the withdrawal that you must make together with the contribution part as part of the return of contributions before the due date of the return if the penalty it is talking about is only about other types of withdrawals and does n't apply to the earnings part of the return of contribution before the due date of the return then this sentence would n't make sense as it 's in a part that 's only about return of contribution before the due date of the return

gt if you are a corporation residing in canada you still pay canadian taxes on worldwide income even if that income is sourced in another country   for corporate tax that 's not exactly true see the foreign accrual property income rules only for what is considered investment business income does the company have to pay canadian taxes on worldwide income active business income which would but pretty much everything bk is doing is repatriated tax free like any other inter company dividend in the us that active business income would be subject to a tax

the home owner does not start foreclosure the bank decides when to foreclose   therefore you can not really decide a time to foreclose if you are trying to time the decision the process you miss payments and the banks will send you a late notice for the missing payments   expect many notices the bank will call you at home on your cell phone and at work   they will mail you letters regarding the missing payments if you continue to miss payments the bank will probably demand the loan be paid in full   you will owe the bank the full balance of the principle all past due interest all past due late charges and junk fees   the bank wo n't even take a normal monthly payment from you should you try to pay your regular payment again some law enforcement will notify you on the bank 's intent to foreclose   the bank has begun legal proceedings legal notices are published in the local newspaper soon the notices and the legal waiting period will expire   court proceedings happen   the court will then allow the bank to foreclose notices to into the paper again about the updated status of the foreclosure the house is sold at auction money from the auction is used to pay taxes owned then mortgages then other liens or creditors who file further debt for the home owner taxes when sold if the mortgage debt exceeds the home 's fair market value us federal tax rules say the selling price as the fair market value the fair market value can still be higher than the tax basis which i think is the value of the house at the time of original purchase plus improvements    if the fair market value is higher you will own taxes on sale   however tax rules in the us say if you have owned the home more than two years and make less than $ 250,000 in the transaction $ 500,000 if married you will not owe any tax   state taxes can be different additionally if the mortgage lender the debt and does n't create a deficiency that income is taxable as well   this is more an more common these days   there are exceptions if the home is your primary residence this whole process an take several months to occur but depends on where you live   if you continue to live in the home after the auction the new owner must evict you from the property which is another set of legal proceedings your credit and ability to buy are home will be damaged for the next several years i am not so sure on how pmi works for the banks but i know they are getting some money back

in addition to what has been said gift cards with a credit card logo which is what i am assuming you mean here do not have an address associated with them that means that if you try to use one at a merchant that users address verification common in online purchases the transaction will fail   in my experience with an american express branded gift card i was able to call the number on the back and they added an address to the card so that it would work it seemed like this was a common and well known issue   because the gift card is not associated with any person no verification is needed to add that address you can give them any address you want   also i believe that the card numbers in use for gift cards are specific that is you could tell that a card is a gift card based on the number alone that means it is likely possible for a merchant to reject those gift cards while still accepting other cards from that network   this is likely for certain transactions for example   a hotel or car rental agency requires a credit card for and it 's likely that the system itself will outright reject a gift card even if it has enough on it for the initial hold   as for debit cards i think there are far fewer issues with acceptance other than the aforementioned hold issues described in another answer

bitcoin prices are likely rising as a result of the simple issue of supply and demand   supply is constrained as there are n't much in the way of new bitcoins coming into existence and demand is high right now as a result of various events for example this reuters article goes into some detail as to some current influences   mostly crypto hedge funds are buying a lot of bitcoins as a speculative move i.e. believing the price will continue to rise    the evidence suggests that few of the users are buying bitcoin to use it as a means of exchange but are speculating to increase their capital many describe the bubble as similar to the tulip craze in century from the same reuters article it ’s got all the of your tulip bubble chart but that tells you nothing about where that price line could go depending on the number of people who wish to own it standard life ’s head of investment strategy andrew said on wednesday who is to say it does n’t reach $ 100,000 you can see in the volume chart from that the trading volume for bitcoins has really increased and if you look at the market price you see a very similar movement however if you look at the number of transactions per day that number is basically constant meaning the actual uses of bitcoins by people just buying or selling goods or services is n't really changing much but the dollar amount is   that 's indicative of a speculation caused bubble below is a graph i made from the data from above that price with trading volume you can see clearly the increase in volume and increase in price are nearly simultaneous   bitcoin itself has some actual utility mostly for black market sellers and similar people participating in activities that are less than legal not ethically bad for example people in nations with oppressive regimes that limit contact with the outside world or try to restrict foreign currency purchases   it 's unlikely that the degree of adoption so far however has driven it to this level and the fact that bitcoin can be broken up into very small chunks means that the big boom in price of individual bitcoins causes the demand side pressure from the actual use of bitcoins to be as there is now 1/10th the demand for bitcoins from people who use them for non speculative reasons

note that an index fund may not be able to precisely mirror the index it 's tracking if enough many people invest enough money into funds based on that index there may not always be sufficient shares available of every stock included in the index for the fund to both accept additional investment and track the index precisely   this is one of the places where the details of one index fund may differ from another even when they 're following the same index ideally they ought to deliver the same returns but in practical terms they 're going to diverge a bit personally as long as i 'm getting market rate of return or better on average across all my funds at a risk i 'm comfortable with i honestly do n't care enough to try to optimize it further pick a distribution based on some stochastic modelling tools rebalance periodically to maintain that distribution and otherwise ignore it that 's very much to the taste of someone like me who wants the savings to work for him rather than vice versa

the best thing to do right now is track your spending you know you 're saving 1k a month and you know you 're spending 1k a month on rent that 's 24k so far i presume you 'll have some income tax taken out let 's assume it 's another 6k to round us neatly up to 30k since you earn 80k and you 've spent 30k so far you have another 50k unaccounted for if you 're in the usa i 'd recommend using mint.com or a similar service to automatically track your transactions or even just a spreadsheet if you do n't like handing out your bank details and you should n't after that i agree with 's answer write a budget and try to figure out where the fat can be trimmed when i started tracking i saw i was spending almost a hundred bucks every week on fast food due to poor planning and laziness i decided to cook more and plan better and now i 'm spending less than half that in the last year i 've saved almost three thousand dollars if you want to save up for your future and good on you if you do then there 'll be some choices to make ahead if you 're spending a few hundred bucks on going out drinking every weekend or you grab two coffees every day or you buy fifty a month do people still buy you 'll have to ask yourself will i be happier spending money here than saving for my future

definitely get a lawyer to write up all the details of the partnership in a formal agreement if your ex does not want to do this that is a bad sign you both need to be clear about expectations and responsibilities in this partnership and define an exit strategy in the case one of you wants out this is the most fair to both parties generally what is common is that property is split cleanly when the relationship ends i would strongly recommend you both work towards a clean split with no joint property ownership how this looks depends on your unique situation to address your questions 2 and 3 you have two roles here tenant and owner   as a 50 owner you are running a business with a partner   that business will have assets home income expenses and profit you basically need to run this partnership as a simple business   all the rent income your rent and the other tenant 's should go into a separate account the mortgage and all other housing expenses are then paid from only this account any excess is then profit that may be split 50/50 all expenses should be agreed upon by both of you either by contract or by direct communication you should see a financial professional to make sure accounting and taxes are set up properly under this system your ex could do work on the house and be paid from the business income however they are responsible to you to provide an estimate and scope of work just like any other contractor if you as a joint owner agree to his price he then could be paid out of the business income this reduces the business cash flow for the year accordingly you can probably see how this can get very complicated very fast there is really no right or wrong answer on what both of you decide is fair and best for the sake of simplicity and the least chance of a disaster the usual and recommended action is to cleanly split all property good luck

the limit order are matched based on amount and time the orders are listed highest to lowest on the buy side the orders are listed lowest to highest on the sell side if there are 2 sell orders for same amount the order which is first in time fractions of milliseconds is first   the about is the example as to how the orders would look like on any exchange   now the highest price the buyer is ready to pay is 20.21 and the lowest price a seller is ready to sell for is 20.25 hence there is no trade now if a new buy order comes in at 20.25 it matches with the sell and the deal is made if a new buy order comes in at it still matches at 20.25 similarly if a sell order come in at 20.21 it matches and a deal is made if a sell order come in at it still matches 20.21    incase of market order with the above example if there is a buy order it would match with the lowest sell order at 20.25 if there is not enough quantity it would match the remaining quantity to the next highest at and continue down similarly if there is a sell market order the it would match to the maximum a seller is ready to buy ie 20.21 if there is not sufficient buy quantity at 20.21 it will match with next for    if say there are new buy order at and sell orders at these will sit first the the above queue to be matched in your above example the lowest sell order was at at time t1 and hence any buy order after time t1 for amount or greater would match to this and the price would be however if the buy order was first ie at t1 there was a buy order for 20.21 and then at time later than t1 there is a sell order for say amount less than or equal to 20.21 it would match for 20.21 essentially the market looks at who was the first to sell at lower price or who was the first to buy at higher price and then decide the trade   edit to clarify xyz say if there is an sell order at $ 10 qty 100 there is a buyer who is willing to pay max $ 20 and is looking for qty 500 your key assumption that the buyer does not know the current sell price of $ 10 is incorrect now there are multiple things the buyer knows the lowest sell order is at $ 10 he can put a matching buy order at $ 10 qty 100 and say $ 11 qty 100 etc this is painful second lets say he puts a buy order at $ 10 qty 100 by the time the order hits the system someone else has put the trade at $ 10 and his order is fulfilled so this buyer has to keep looking at booking and keep making adjustments if its a large order it would be extremely difficult and frustrating for this buyer hence the logic of giving preference the later buy order says the max i can pay is $ 20 match at the current price and get the required shares

prior to having children we did exactly what you describe   we would visit my mother in law about four to six times a year a each way trip for a weekend   we 'd simply rent a car drive down drive back return it out $ 150 or so for the weekend a total of under $ 1000 a year far cheaper than owning you should factor in whether you will save money though on things you might not immediately consider   will you spend less on groceries in particular if you can drive to costco or sam 's club or even just to a regular grocery store   i doubt you 'll save the cost of the car $ as you say but it 's possible it will factor into the mix i definitely would discourage purchasing a new car if you 're considering the financial side primarily   i suspect you can get a used car maybe the $ 10k car you would've sold and spend more like $ 1000 a year on it or less   i do n't know if i 'd go to the $ 5000 level as those in comments suggested as if you 're doing long trips you want something with higher than average reliability but even a car like a 5 year old mid level sedan easily costing you less than $ 10k would be fine and likely sell in 5 years for $ 5k itself while hopefully not having too much maintenance especially if you choose something with lower mileage shop around   but even with those assumptions 20 days a year of rental which you can probably get less than $ 50 rates on particularly if you look at some of the car sharing options and enterprise both allow you to do longer term rentals for reasonable prices seems like a fine deal compared to the hassle of owning

unfortunately we do n't know your country but i 'd guess not us with the hint being your use of the word in a comment   realized profits are taxed by all tax authorities i 'm aware of i.e. the tax man in every country annually so that you can let the profits run during the year and offset by the losses during that year   the exception is within a qualified retirement account many countries offer accounts that will let you do just what you 're suggesting start with xxx number of in your account trade for decades and only take the tax hit on withdrawal in some cases there 's an opportunity to fund the account post tax and never pay tax again but to repeat this is with a retirement account not the usual trading accounts

i ca n't find a decent duplicate so here are some general guidelines first of all by stocks the answers generally mean equities which could be either single stocks or mutual funds that consist of stocks unless you have lots of experience that can help you discern good stocks from bad investing in mutual funds reduces the risk considerably if you want to fine tune the plan you can weigh certain categories higher to change your risk return profile e.g. equity funds will have higher returns and risk than fixed income bond funds so if you want to take a little more risk you can put more in equity funds and less in fixed income funds lastly do n't stress too much over the individual investments   the most important thing is that you get as much company match as you can   you can not beat the 100 return that comes from a company match the allocation is mostly insignificant compared to that   plus you can probably change your allocation later easily and cheaply if you do n't like it disclaimer   these are general guidelines for 401(k investing in general and not personal advice

gt could you discuss why the lack of restrictions on these subjects would make hedge funds more attractive to wealthy investors as opposed to mutual funds   well just think about it this way    you have two soccer players they both know the game extremely well they both have similar styles of plan and similar strategies they 're very good players    now you change the rules for one of the players he has to wear a 20 pound weight vest on him at all times and can only kick the ball with his right foot when shooting but his left when passing    who do you think would win in a one v. one     mutual funds are offered to the general public most of them anyways which works under certain assumptions about possible investors while investments with these funds are still considered risky the restrictions placed on mutual funds are designed to promote safety of principle for instance mutual funds are restricted in short selling and trading on margin mutual funds must also clearly state what securities they 're going to get into what strategy they 'll follow etc and deviations from this can get them into trouble   hedge funds have no such restrictions therefore they can pursue any type of investment they want hedge funds have invested or tried to invest in everything from stocks to private equity to bitcoin to art to rare to property to contracts to get boats to and from the statue of liberty to water rights to lawsuit settlements to    this relative freedom gives them much more flexibility and thus they can earn above average returns these lack of restrictions also makes them much riskier and additionally the way they 're legally set up means only a specific type of investor called an accredited investor in the u.s. can invest    what does it take to be an accredited investor basically either be rich in income $ 200k a year if single $ 300k if married or be rich in wealth net worth of $ 1mm not counting primary house

general advice is to keep 6 months worth of income liquid in your case you might want to leave 1 year liquid since even though your income is stable now it is not static i.e. you 're not drawing salary from an employer    the rest of it   if you do n't plan on using it for any big purchases in the next 5 or so years invest it   if you do n't you will probably lose money in the long term due to inflation how 's that for a risk   there are plenty of options for the risk averse many of which beat inflation though without knowing your country of residence it 's hard to say   in all likelihood though you 'll want to invest in index funds such as etfs that basically track industries rather than individual companies   this is basically free portfolio diversity they lose money only when an entire sector loses value   though even with funds of this type you still want to ensure you purchase multiple different funds that track different industries   do n't just toss all of your funds into an it index for example    before buying just look at the history of the fund and make sure it has had a general upward trajectory since 2008 i 've bought a few etfs that remained static not what we 're looking for in an investment   if the brokerage account you choose does n't offer commission free trades on any of the funds you want personally i use schwab and their etf portfolio try to buy in bulk   that way you 're not spending so much on trades    there are other considerations many indexed funds have high management costs but if you go with etfs they do n't and there 's the question of dividends etc but that is getting into the weeds as far as investing knowledge is concerned    beyond that just keep in mind it 'll take 1 2 weeks for you to see that money if you need it and there 's obviously no guarantee it 'll be there if you do need it for an emergency

gt;every single grocery store is consumerist i 've been shopping at whole foods for almost 30 years and the reason is because whole foods has put its research into discovering what and how to serve me and then delivering the experience of shopping in a safeway 's or the like is ugly uncomfortable cold and smelly they are too big and take forever to get from one item i want to another they are filled with junk they are trying to trick me into thinking is nutritious   and they 've tricked you into thinking they are n't   i mean if your biggest problem in life is the appearance of your store fine but underneath all the faux wood and fake ass decor designed to make you think it 's rustic and natural every last trick in the retail book is being used on you   they do sell junk it 's just packed differently    gt;what makes you think whole foods is in any way more deceptive than walmart publix costco etc because they responded to a market that wanted quality food that could be traced back to it 's source why would n't they respond to that    because despite being pretty much the same thing they make a lot of noise about not being the same so they can charge you a premium   i could trace back food in just about any store i go into why should wf get a cookie for this   the packages come with labels and even if they do n't the case that held those items did which means that knowing where your food came from never gets more complicated than asking the staff   to me those things are deceptive because they 're marketing things that everyone does as though it 's a unique selling point   even walmart has farm to table sourcing   it 's in a code on their salads      gt;i'm thrilled that it is that means i can access food that i want and enjoy and it costs less than it would otherwise i can buy sugar free bacon at whole foods yay i feel great about that i ca n't get that at safeway    ever read the label on bacon   there 's not a lot of sugar there to start with    gt;do you think commercial food producers and other grocery outlets do n't collectively far whole foods to promote less nutritious food that is as inexpensive as possible to produce that they do n't sacrifice quality for profits    not really i think whole foods has a whole bunch of millennials into believing the hype that just because they have a farmers market decor that somehow they 're better and more pure than other stores   almost every business in a capitalist economy sacrifices quality for profits   that 's how it works   i do n't like whole foods because they 're tricking gullible people like you into thinking that they give a single shit about you or your health   they do n't they care about the money in your wallet   it 's all commercial food it comes from the same fields

e i disagree with your logic the ipo clearly did n't go well not relative to other ipos   were it not for the stocks underwriters stepping in late in the trading day facebook would likely have closed below their opening price this story and others indicate that institution investors were given negative information by an analyst for the underwriters that other investors did n't have   this inside knowledge is certainly contributing to the drop in the stock   it 's fair to argue that many individual investors were suckered into buying the stock at the ipo price because of this incomplete disclosure it would n't surprise if what 's happens has a negative impact on future trading volume and creates reluctance to invest in the firm which would certainly be an additional negative outcome beyond the dropping stock price edit dilip mentioned a lawsuit   here 's a link to an article about it

i would not be concerned about the impact to your credit rating   you already have an excellent credit score and the temporary change to your utilization will have minimal impact to your score if you really need to make this $ 2500 purchase and you have the money in the bank to pay for it i would not recommend borrowing this money   only put it on the credit card if you plan on paying it off in full without paying interest let me ask you this why do you want to keep this $ 2500 in the bank   it certainly is n't earning you anything significant   my guess is that you 'd like to keep it there for an emergency   well is this $ 2500 purchase an emergency   if it is necessary then spend the money   if not then save up the money until you have enough to make the purchase   it does n't make sense to keep money for an emergency in the bank but then when one comes up to leave the money in the bank and pay interest on your emergency purchase if you make this emergency purchase and another emergency comes up you can always if necessary borrow the money at that time   it does n't make sense to borrow money before you need it that having been said i would encourage you to build up your emergency fund so that you have enough money in there to handle things like this without completely depleting your savings account   3 to 6 months of expenses is the general recommendation for your emergency fund   then if something unplanned comes up you 'll have the money in the bank without having to borrow and pay interest

if we postulate that there is at least some element of truth to the phrase a does not change his spots   and then consider this he conveniently forgets to mention his 1.5 million dollar fraud fine    from the sec over investment advice he sold through a news letter    the sec claimed and the judge agreed that the report was with    lies i think that gives you just about all you might need to know regarding the man behind the video and the nature of it 's content   oh and it 's purpose   to sell you the same said newsletter i guess it 's natural for stansberry to feel as he does after all if the us gov had just busted me for and lying to folks and fined me i 'd be having some pretty intense fantasies about it going down in flames and trying to hide any money i had left offshore also    a huge amount of his argument hinges on the us no longer being the world 's reserve currency   firstly while i 'll admit i 'm none too happy with the way the national debt has been managed for oh around 30 years how which includes i will note going from a pretty much balanced budget to around an 80 increase in the debt from 2001 through 2008 when times were good and there was little need to spend money we did n't have when compared to a lot of other countries we still do n't look that bad   you have to ask yourself this first if not the us then who   are the governments of the world going to trust china could the yen handle the load   is the euro any better off especially considering problems in greece ireland etc   do countries like switzerland have enough liquidity and available ways to invest there   in order for the us to stop being the world 's reserve currency you must have something to replace it with and really can we realistically think of one country currency with the capability to become a new world reserve currency   secondly even then should such a shift actually happen it does n't mean people will all just magically stop buying us debt   yes the demand would go down but it would not go to zero   there are after all a of other countries who 's money is right now not the world reserve currency and yet they are able to sell bonds and people and even other countries invest there china for example does not invest exclusively in the us so yeah we might have to start paying more interest to get people to buy us debt but it 's not like the demand will go away    save your money save your time do n't buy into this

in addition to the two options in your question pay off the entire loan depleting your emergency fund or continue as you are today there is a third middle ground option that might be worth considering since you currently have an emergency fund zero credit card debt and you stated we can afford these expenses i think i 'd be correct to assume that you 're currently making regular contributions to either the emergency fund itself or to another savings account etc temporarily stop making those contributions and divert those funds to make larger payments towards the upside down loan the additional amount will all be applied to the loan principal reducing the interest you 'll have to pay but you 'll avoid the risk of depleting the emergency fund additionally the insurance premium may possibly be avoided as in many places in the world it 's possible to de register the car for example in california usa you can submit an affidavit of non use then terminate the insurance on it however the car will likely have to be parked off street or in a location such as a private road governed by rules that do not include legal registration requirements

credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

your biggest risk with a vendor like this is not that your credit card number will be stolen in transit it is that it will be stolen from the vendor i agree with that using a one time number is the best plan provided you have a bank that offers such numbers   bank of america calls it shop safe while citibank calls it virtual account numbers   i think discover card has something similar but less useful in that they are n't really one time use and i think american express discontinued their service   afaik no one else offers anything like it   if you ca n't get a one time number then i was going to suggest buying a visa gift card until i put together the fact that you are making a purchase in asia and the gift cards are not authorized for international payments due to patriot act restrictions   visa does offer the service which might help but i doubt your vendor participates or would even be allowed to participate if they do n't offer a secure order form   you can open a pre paid visa card account which is probably what i 'd do you can buy pre paid visa cards the same way you buy visa gift cards the difference being you have to register the pre paid cards thanks patriot act before you can use them   but it 's not that big a deal to register one you just fill out the online form your your ssn etc and you 're good to go load it up with enough money to cover your purchase and the fx fees and then cut it up

first i 'm not a cpa or international tax accountant my entire understanding of the french tax system is entirely from what i 've read in places like the wsj wapo etc    however my understanding is that french tax law works something like this let 's say france has a tax rate of 35 first it must be assessed where the controlling entity is in this case if the majority of production and labor or if the corporation is primarily based in france it would proceed as follows taxes are initially paid based on transfer pricing to the original local entity this avoids double taxation so in the example above you would pay 10 to india on the $ in profits $ 300,000 you would then reduce the 35 french tax rate by the 10 already paid this means you would pay an additional 25 to france $ 750,000 the premise is that you have an effective minimum tax threshold for being in france in the case above companies like ge would have to pay the difference this does n't get into tax breaks shelters on previously recorded losses etc    again i am not sure on this is my basic understanding and am by no means a tax accountant lawyer etc from what i understand however this has n't necessarily been a good thing for france either california is likely a similar case study with the return requirement the fact is the world is very global nowadays its easier and cheaper for the companies to just leave instead of being forced to pay higher taxes   imo germany hit it right on the head low corporate tax rates with high personal tax rates this maintains a very business friendly environment business move there because of the skilled labor and low corporate taxes but they effectively pass the burden on to individuals who also benefit from the pro business environment you 'd be hard pressed to find an economist that does n't think germany 's economy has been very strong over the past decade very good soros speech that was recently posted about his analysis of the euro and germany 's unfair benefits but that 's a whole different gear    what i find the issue to be is the whole concept is complex enough that 's difficult to explain to the average person with a 2 second attention span that 's why i like writing posts like this to try to help people understand how finance and businesses operate behind the scenes

so if i understand your plan right this will be your situation after the house is bought total debt here 's what i would do wait until your house sells before buying a new one   that way you can take the equity from that sale and apply it towards the down payment rather than taking a loan on your retirement account    if something happens and your house does n't sell for as as you think it will you 'll lose out on the gains from the amount you borrow which will more than offset the interest you are paying yourself at worst pay off the 401(k loan the instant your sale closes take as much of the remaining equity as you can and start paying down student loans   there are several reasons why they are a higher priority than a mortgage some are mathematical some are not should i look to pay off student loans sooner even if i refi at a lower rate of 3.5 or so or the mortgage earlier    my thoughts are that the student loans follow me for life but i can always sell and buy another home so you want this baggage for the rest of your life   how will it be when you get that off your back   how much investing are you missing out on because of student loan payments   what happens if you get lose your license   what if you become disabled   student loans are not but you can always sell the asset behind a mortgage or car loan   they are worse than credit card debt in that sense   you have no tangible asset behind it and no option for forgiveness unless you decide to practice in a high need area but i do n't get the sense that that 's your path the difference in interest is generally only a few payment worth over 15 years is the interest amortized the same as a 15 year if i pay a 30 year mortgage in 15 years   yes however the temptation to just pay it off over 30 years is still there   how often will you decide that a bigger car payment or a vacation or something else is more important   with a 15-year note you lock in a plan and stick to it some other options

first off you generally want to park your emergency fund somewhere that is safe meaning something that is not subject to market fluctuations   your emergency fund is something you need to be able to count on when times are tough   that rules out things like stock market investments secondly you need to think about how quickly you will need access to the money   if you have an emergency odds are you do n't want to be waiting around for weeks months years for the money to become available   this rules out most fixed term investments bonds traditional cds etc if you are concerned that you will need near instant access to your emergency money then you probably want to keep it in a savings or money market account at the same bank as your checking account   most banks will let you transfer money between local accounts instantly unfortunately your local bank probably has pitiful interest rates for the savings mma far below the inflation rate   this means your money will slowly lose value over time   be prepared to keep contributing to it for most people being able to draw the cash from your fund within a few days < 1 week is sufficient   worst case you charge something on your credit card and then pay down the card when the emergency fund withdrawal arrives if money within a few days is okay for you there are a few options money market mutual funds not to be confused with a money market account this is the traditional place to keep an emergency fund   these are investment funds you can buy with a brokerage account   an example of such a fund would be fidelity cash reserves   are not fdic insured so they are not exactly zero risk   however they are considered extremely safe   they almost never go down in value only a few times in the past few decades and when they have the fund manager or the federal govt stepped in to restore the value   they usually offer slightly better return than a local savings account and are available in taxable and non taxable varieties online high yield savings or money market account these are a relatively new invention   it 's basically a the same thing as what your local bank offers but it 's online only   no local branch means low overhead so they offer higher interest rates 2.0 vs 0.5 for your local bank   some of them used to be over 5 before the economy tanked   like your local bank it is fdic insured one bit of caution   some of these accounts have become lately   they have started to do things like promo rates for a few months only offering the high interest rate on the first few $ k deposited limiting the amount that can be withdrawn etc   be sure to read the details before you open an account no penalty cds certificates of deposit usually offer a better rate than a savings account but your money is locked up until the cd term is up e.g. 36 months   if you need to cash out before then you pay a penalty   some banks have begun to offer cds that you can cash out with no penalty at all   these can offer better rates than the savings account   make sure it really is no penalty though   also watch what your options are for slowly adding money over time   this can be an issue if you want to deposit $ 100 from every paycheck rewards checking accounts these are checking accounts that will pay a relatively high interest rate 3 or more provided you generate enough activity   most of them will have requirements like you must have direct deposit setup with them and you must do a minimum number of debit card transactions from the account per month   if you can stay on top of the requirements these can be a great deal   if you do n't stay on top of it your interest rate usually drops back to something pitiful though personally we use the online high yield savings account for our emergency fund   i 'm not going to make a specific recommendation as to which bank to use   the best deal changes almost week to week   instead i will say to check out bankrate.com for a list of savings accounts and cds that you can sort   the bank deals blog is a good place to follow rate changes

mutual funds that are not exchange traded funds often need to sell some   of their securities to get cash when a shareholder some shares such transactions incur costs that are paid proportionally by all the shareholders in the fund not just the person requesting redemption and thus the remaining shareholders get a lower return exchange traded funds are traded as if they are shares of common stock   and a shareholder seeking a redemption pays the costs of the redemption for this reason many mutual funds do not allow redemptions for some period of time after a purchase or purchases for some period of time after a redemption the periods of time are chosen by the fund and are stated in the prospectus which everyone has acknowledged has been received before an investment was made

it is possible to pay down debt including interest without issuing new debt money to pay for it i think this is the heart of your question let me present a highly contrived example in which society has four people and one bank here is a bank with $ 100 in initial deposits total money supply in this society is $ 100 we assume there is no currency circulating since you 're interested in debt money this bank lends out $ 90 to bob at 1 year maturity and 10 apr bob spends this $ 90 with charlie to buy raw materials charlie deposits $ 90 in the bank the money supply just grew from $ 100 to $ 190 bob does something with the raw materials and adds some kind of value eventually selling the finished goods for $ 110 in our little silly economy the only people who have money are adam and charlie so we must assume that between the two of them they buy $ 110 worth of goods from bob let 's say adam buys $ 60 and charlie buys $ 50 the actual amounts do n't matter bob deposits this money at the bank still $ 190 of money supply at the end of 1 year bob instructs the bank to transfer payment from his deposit account to his loan account the bank wipes clean his debt and the money remaining in bob 's account represents his return who is this david guy he 's the owner of the bank he $ 9 in interest from the loan to bob and he pays $ 5 to adam as interest on adam 's deposit the remaining $ 4 is the profit to the bank 's owner money supply decreased from $ 190 to $ 100 after bob pays off his loan i realized after writing this the one thing i left out is where does adam get $ 100 to start with presumably adam starts off with some kind of currency either fiat money or commodity money iow debt money ca n't be created out of nothing it has to be expanded on top of some kind of currency

i 'm going to post this as an answer because it 's from the gofundme website but ultimately even they say to speak with a tax professional about it   am i responsible for taxes us only while this is by no means a guarantee donations on gofundme are    simply considered to be personal gifts which are not for the most    part taxed as income in the us however there may be particular    case specific instances where the income is taxable dependent on    amounts received and use of the monies etc      we 're unable to    provide specific tax advice since everyone 's situation is different    and tax rules can change on a yearly basis we advise that you    maintain adequate records of donations received and consult with your    personal tax adviser      additionally wepay will not report the funds    you collect as earned income it is up to you and a tax professional    to determine whether your proceeds represent taxable income the    person who 's listed on the wepay account and ultimately receives the    funds may be responsible for taxes      again every situation is    different so please consult with a tax professional in your area en us i responsible for taxes us and here 's a blurb from which adds to the confusion but enforces the speak with a professional idea crowdfunding services have to report to the irs campaigns that total    at least $ 20,000 and 200 transactions money collected from    crowdfunding is considered either income or a gift this is where things get a little tricky if money donated is not a    gift or investment it is considered taxable income even a gift could    be subject to the gift tax but that tax applies only to the gift    giver non taxable gifts these are donations made without the expectation of getting something    in return think of all those fans who gave money to    gofundme to help the cost of tom ’s nfl fine    for those fans are n’t expecting anything in return    except maybe some satisfaction so their donations are considered    gifts under irs rules an individual can give another individual a    gift of up to $ 14,000 without tax implications so unless a fan    is particularly generous his or her gofundme gift wo n’t be taxed taxable income now consider that same fan donating $ 300 to a business    venture if the fan receives stock or equity in the company in return    for the donation this is considered an investment and is not taxable    however if the business owner does not offer stock or equity in the    company the money donated could be considered business income and the    recipient would need to report it on a tax return

even if you can get a credit card with a $ 0 limit that does n't necessarily mean that the charges wo n't succeed some of my credit cards have gone over limit by a significant amount e.g. 140 of limit without any transactions being declined the limit just means that the bank is allowed to decline the transaction but they are also allowed to approve it anyway so basically what you would have is a credit card where any transaction can always be declined or approved

automation is definitely closing the cost gap but for reasons that go well beyond automation alone you have to look at the entire supply chain not just your in plant cost of adding value to products even something as simple as waiting days or weeks to get parts for something that broke that can multiply the $ 1k a year labor cost many times you ca n't just call the local hardware store in many places to solve even relatively simple problems then you have to worry about the logistics of getting your finished product transported to external markets especially when much of the transport is done over poorly maintained or even roads full of pot holes and rain how much durable capital both coming and going gets damaged in the process this is even before taking the uncertainty cost of corruption and bribery into account even just simple problems can easily cost you a week labor out of each month and the supply chain issues add up   as the factory itself becomes more automated the cost of these supply chain issues just keeps increasing relative to other cost even as the supply chain cost remains constant hence the supply chain cost as a ratio of total cost actually goes up faster than the rate at which automation itself is increasing which requires a fully infrastructure and business environment to address something that is extraordinarily expensive to build from scratch

i would say similar rules apply in the us   if you have a net loss from rental property you certainly can claim that loss against your personal income there are various rules around this though that make it a bit less clear cut   if you are a real estate professional which means you spend at least 750 hours per year working on your rental properties or related activities then all losses are deductible against any other ordinary income you have if you are n't a real estate professional then your rental income is considered a passive activity and losses you can count against regular income are limited to $ 25,000 per year with a carry forward provision and begin to phase out entirely if your income is between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000 so the law here is structured to allow most small time investors to take rental real estate losses against their ordinary income but the income phase out provision is designed to prevent the wealthy from using rental property losses to avoid taxation

if a company is doing well it seems less likely to go bankrupt   if a company is doing poorly it seems more likely to go bankrupt   the problem is where is the inflection point between well and poorly   when does a company start to head into oblivion   sometimes it is hard to know   but if you do n't call that right and hold onto your shares when a company is tanking others who call it before you do will sell off devalue the share price and now you 've missed your chance to get out at a good profit   if you hang on too long the company may just go bankrupt and you 've lost your investment entirely a healthy profitability of the company therefore has to bolster investor confidence in avoiding this very unpleasant scenario   therefore the more profitable a company is the more shareholder confidence it and the more willing to pay for it in the form of increased share price   and this then has a meta effect in that each shareholder thinks all other investors think this way too and so each feels good about holding the stock since he knows he can likely easily liquidate it for good cash if he needs to either now or in the next year or sometime hence

if you are in an economy which has a decent liquid debt market corporate bonds etc then you may look into investing in aa or rated bonds they can provide higher returns than bank deposits and are virtually risk free though in severe economic downturns you can see defaults in even very high rated bonds leading to partial or complete loss of value however this is statistically quite rare you can make this investment through a debt mutual fund but please make sure that you read through the offer document carefully to understand the investment style of the mutual fund and their expense ratio which directly affect your returns in any case it is always recommended to reach out to an investment adviser who is good with local tax laws to minimize taxes and maximize returns

i doubt that this exists but it could theoretically after all a share is kind of an option to a company 's future success and so a call is already a second level on the better approach would be to create your own put puts by investing less money a in the put you wanted to invest into and put the smaller rest b in the share itself or a call that way if the original put is successful at max b is lost and if it is unsuccessful the loss on a is covered by a gain on b potentially if you do the math you can reach a mathematical equivalent situation to a put put by buying the right amount and kind of calls however we know already that buying a put and a call is a poor strategy so that would mean a put put would also be a poor strategy

i think your approach of looking exclusively at usd deposits is a prudent one here are my responses to your questions 1 it is highly unlikely that a usd deposit abroad be converted to local currency upon withdrawal the reason for offering a deposit in a particular currency in the first place is that the bank wants to attract funds in this currency 2 interest rate is a function of various risks mostly supply and demand central bank policy perceived risk etc in recent years low interest rate policy as led by u.s. european and japanese central banks has led particularly low yields in certain countries disregarding their level of risk which can vary substantially thus e.g. eastern europe has very low yields at the moment in spite of its perceived higher risk some countries offer depository insurance   3 i would focus on banks which are among the largest in the country and boast good corporate governance i.e. their ownership is clean and transparent and they are true to their business purpose thus ownership is key then come financials country depository insurance low external threat low war risk is also important most banks require a personal visit in order to open the account thus i would n't split much further than 2 3 banks assuming these are good quality

since this is a cooperative i 'm guessing your partners may want to be able to view the books so another key point you may want to consider is collaboration   quickbooks desktop has all of these same issues because it is meant to be used on a single desktop we 're in an age of mobile devices and especially in a business like landscaping it would be nice if certain aspects of record keeping could be done at the point and time where they are incurred   i 'd argue you want a software as a service saas accounting package as opposed to accounting software which might come on a cd in the form of quickbooks sage and others additionally most of these will also have guides to help make sure you are properly entering your records most of these saas products also have customer success teams to help you along should you need assistance depending on the level of your subscription you may get more sophisticated handling of taxes customized invoices or integrated payroll your goal is to keep accurate records so you can better run your business and maintain obligations like filing taxes you 're not keeping the records just to have them keep them in a place where they will work for you and provide the insights and functionality that will help your business grow and become successful accounting software will always win in this scenario over a spreadsheet full disclaimer i work for a simple cloud accounting product designed for small businesses but the points i mention above are true for xero quickbooks online and wave as well as and if you really want expertise to go with the actual software consider service providers with a platform like bench or liberty accounting

with my current limited knowledge see end i understand it the following way are share prices really described as memoryless   yes   is there a    technical meaning of the term what does it really mean the meaning comes from markov models think of the behavior of the stock market over time as a markov chain i.e. a probabilistic model with states and probabilistic transitions a state is the current price of all stocks of the market a transition is a step in time memoryless means that transitions that the stock market might make can be modelled by a relation from one state to another i.e. it only depends on the current state the model is a markov chain as opposed to a more general stochastic process where the next state depends on more than the current state so in a markov chain all the history of one stock is encoded already in its current price more precisely in all stock 's prices   the of stocks is the main statement of the efficient market theory emt if a company 's circumstances do n't change then a drop in its share price is going to be followed by a rise later   so if the emt holds your statement above is not necessarily true i personally belief the emt is a good approximation only large corporations e.g. renaissance technologies have enough hundreds of mathematicians billions of $ to be able to leverage tiny non random movements that stem from a not completely random mostly chaotic market   the prices can of course change when the company 's circumstances change but they are n't memoryless either a company 's future state is influenced by its past in the emt a stock 's future state is only influenced by its past as much as is encoded in its current price more precisely the complete market 's current state whether that price was reached by a drop or a rise makes no difference   the above is my believe but i 'm by far no finance expert i am working professionally with probabilistic models but have only read one book on finance kommer 's mit und etfs it 's supposed to contain many statements of malkiel 's a random walk down wall street

it depends completely on the car   some cars retain their value much better and others drop in value like a rock no pun intended   the mileage and condition on a car also has a huge impact on value    according to this site cars on average lose 46 of their value in three years so seeing one that drops 62 in roughly 3 years does not seem impossible that value could also have been trade in value which is significantly lower than what you could get with a private party sale or what you 'd pay to get that same car from a dealer one example a new ford lowest model has a kelly blue book value of $ 28,000   a 2014 lowest model with average mileage and in fair condition has a private party value of about $ 12,000 for a 57 drop in value note i picked because it 's a car that should not have exceptional resale value unlike bmw trucks suvs not to make any kind of judgement of the quality or of the car

the simplest way to consolidate the funds your old 401(k plans is by doing what 's called a direct rollover whereby the funds go directly into the new plan and skips you completely from each of the old plans into either an ira that you establish with a provider of your choice or even into your current employer 's 401(k plan if that is available that way the funds are in one central account and available to invest plus it eliminates the mandatory 20 withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan it is important to bear in mind that you have 60 calendar days from the date of distribution to get the full amount into the new plan and a rollover is considered a tax reportable but not necessarily a taxable event provided you deposit the funds within the time frame allotted

look as my final comment   you 're overthinking this   companies routinely have more cash on their books than they need because they keep a rainy day fund   yes there are extreme examples like apple that has about 60 billion more than they need but practically all companies are going to maintain excess cash for emergencies acquisitions etc   as i said in another comment the common theme between a dcf and an ev multiple is that they are both capital structure independent     even here there are going to be differences companies with a really shitty capital structure read too much debt will trade publicly at a lower enterprise value multiple because of the risk that they go bankrupt   in an acquisition this probably would not be the case   in the case of a dcf you would probably raise your discount rate to account for the risk of bankruptcy

i agree with this argument finance legal and tax compliance industries are bogus and add dubious value at best the creation of more wealth helps those that created the wealth the most but it oftentimes also does help everyone else as well think steve jobs amp his company 's many creations   but i also believe that if you had a full day and redistributed all the wealth in the us so that each of us had the same amount of money we 'd each roughly have $ if my math is correct then within 1 generation you 'd already see a similar wealth distribution to what we have now most would consume rather than and it would only be a temporary fix   it 's a rarity to find people advocating for changing the system that creates inequality the fed currently being the biggest instead of simply trying to redistribute the results of that system

you should always invest if your investment rate of return is higher    than your interest rate your next line about standard deviation is dead on   there are too many variables to give an exact answer here in my opinion the main reason is that one variable is n't easy to quantify one 's risk tolerance   clearly there 's one extreme the 18 credit card unless you are funding type rates of it 's safe to say that 18 debt should take priority over any investments except for the matched 401(k deposits   what i think you 're talking about is something we 've addressed here in multiple threads   do i prepay my sub 4 mortgage or invest in this case and to noah 's comment the question is whether you can expect a post tax return of over 3 during your time horizon i look at the return for 15 years from 1998 2013 and see a 6 cagr for the s&p. i chose 15 years as the choice is often one of paying a 30 year mortgage faster as fast as 15 the last 15 years offer a pretty bad scenario 2 crashes and a mortgage crisis 6 after long term gains would get you 5.1 net   you can pull the data back to 1871 and run cagr numbers for the timeframe of your choosing i have n't done it yet but i imagine there 's no 15 year span that lags the 3 target i cite   what makes it more complex is that the investment is n't lump sum it may not be obvious but cagr is a dollar invested at t=0 and returns calculated to t = final year it would take a bit of to invest the extra funds every month year over your period of analysis   in the end there are still those who will choose to pay off their 4 mortgage regardless of what the numbers show even if the 15 year result showed worst case 3.5 almost no profit and an average 10 the feeling of risk is more than many will want

not for the tax break no as others have said that still costs you money however with rates being low right now and brought a bit lower by the tax break this is an opportunity for the safest form of leveraged investing you will ever find if you invest that money the returns on investment will probably be better than the mortgage rate and that leaves you with a net profit there is some risk if the market collapses but it 's less risk than any other form of borrowing to invest that also leave you with more flexibility if you need cash in a hurry you can draw down the investments rather than taking another loan if the risk bothers you you can do what i did and split the difference i put 50 down and financed the rest i sometimes regret not having pushed it harder since it has worked out well for me but that was the level of risk i was comfortable with

i used to think that paying off ahead of time made sense but i no longer do at least in most cases   the upside is that you can get a return on your money equal to the mortgage interest rate it 's less than that in the us where mortgage interest is deductible so it 's roughly the mortgage interest rate 1 your marginal income tax rate   there are a few downsides the biggest is that cash is the most liquid asset you can have you can get at it with no restrictions if you put that cash into your house you are converting that into an asset with a lot of restrictions you ca n't get at it without fees nor can you get at it if you do n't have a job which is when you would need it most   so you are putting your money in a hard to get at place for a small interest rate i do n't think it is worthwhile edit one complication is pmi if you are currently paying pmi it may make sense to put money towards the mortgage until you get to 20 and can get rid of the pmi
