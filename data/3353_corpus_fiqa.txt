i 'd add this is actually the way any stock opens every day i.e. the closing price of the prior day is what it is but the opening price will reflect whatever news there was prior to the day 's open if you watch the business news you 'll often see that some stock has an order imbalance and has not opened yet at the normal time so as geo stated those who were sold shares at the ipo price paid $ 38 but then the stock could open at whatever price was the point where bid and ask balanced    i snapped a screen capture of this chart on the first day of trading the daily charts are n't archived where i can find them this is from yahoo finance you can see the $ 42 open from those who simply wanted in but could n't wait the willingness of sellers to grab their profit right back to what they paid and then another wave of buying but then a sell off it closed virtually unchanged from the ipo price

the ipo price is set between the underwriters and the specialist in the nasdaq there are a lot of complexities on how to get to this price everyone is trying to pull to their own side in the facebook example the price was $ 38 for all ipo participants then once the ipo went to the secondary market the bid ask drove the pricing   at the secondary market the price is driven by the demand and offer of the stock   that is people who wanted to buy right after the ipo likely drove the initial price up

in gambling the house also takes a cut so the total money in the game is shrinking by 2 10 percent   so if you gain $ 100 it 's because other people lost $ 105 and you do this for dozens of plays so it up   the market owns companies who are trying to create economic value take nothing and make it something they usually succeed and this adds to the total pot and makes all players richer regardless of trades    gambling is transactional there 's a pull or a roll or a hand and when it 's over you must do new transactions to continue playing    investing parks your money indefinitely you can be 30 years in a stock and that 's one transaction and given the long time virtually all your gains will be new economic value created at no one else 's expense i.e. nobody loses   now it 's possible to trade in and out of stocks very rapidly causing them   to be transactional like gambling the extreme example is day trading   when you 're not in a stock long enough for the company to create any value paid in dividends or the market appreciating the value then yes for someone to gain someone else must lose and the house takes a cut e.g. etrade 's $ 10 trading fee in and out   in that case both players are trying to win and one just had better info on average    another case is when the market drops for instance right after brexit i dumped half my domestic stocks and bought euro index funds i gambled euro stocks would rebound better than us stocks would continue to perform   obviously others were that american stocks will still grow more than euro will rebound   who won that gamble   certainly we will all do better long term but some of us will do better er and that 's what it 's all about

i think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan a heloc accrues interest like a credit card so if you make a large principal payment using a heloc you will be able to retire those chunks of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments i have n't worked out the numbers but i suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead making even one extra payment per year will take 7 9 years off of a 30 year loan i think that the advantage of the heloc approach is that if you borrow enough you may be able to recalculate lower the payment of the mortgage

etfs are a type of investment not a specific choice in other words there are good etfs and bad what you see is the general statement that etfs are preferable to most mutual funds if only for the fact that they are low cost an index etf such as spy which reflects the s&p 500 index has a annual expense vs a mutual fund which average a full percent or more   is n't wrong i just have a different spin to offer you given a long term return of say even 8 note this question is not a debate of the long term return and i purposely chose a low number compared to the long term average closer to 10 and the current cd rate of < 1 a 1 hit for the commission on the buy side does n't bother me the sell wo n't occur for a long time and $ 8 on a $ 10 k sale is no big deal i 'd not expect you to save $ 1k yr in cash cds for the years it would take to make that $ 8 fee look tiny not when over time the growth will this   one day you will be in a position where the swings in the market will produce the random increase or decrease to your net worth in the $ 10s of thousands do you know why you wo n't lose a night 's sleep over this because when you invested your first $ 1 k and started to pay attention to the market you saw how some days had swings of 3 or 4 and you built up an immunity to the day to day noise you stayed invested and as you gained wealth you stuck to the right rebalancing each year so a market crash which took others down by 30 only impacted you by 15 20 and you were ready for the next move to the upside and you also saw that since mutual funds with their 1 fees never beat the index over time you were happy to say you lagged the s&p by or 1 over 11 year 's time vs those whose funds had some great years but lost it all in the bad years   and by the way right until you are in the 25 bracket roth is the way to go when you are at 25 that 's the time to use pre tax accounts to get just below the   last welcome to se     edit see 's answer below i agree i missed the cost of the bid ask spread going with the lowest cost index funds may make better sense for you   to clarify points out that etfs trade like a stock a commission and a bid ask both add to transaction cost so agreeing this is the case an indexed based mutual fund can provide the best of possible options reflecting the s&p for example less a small expense .1 or less

high interest checking savings accounts are often a better choice than cds today for three reasons   at the time this question was asked cds were probably a better answer as rates were much higher   since cd rates have plummeted in recent years and because a cd is only semi liquid i.e. even if you ladder cds an early withdrawal fee often means foregoing the interest on that particular cd which you withdrew 1 on the other hand high interest checking and/or savings accounts are very viable options these days there are several options available that earn apy it 's not quite that simple and there are a few gotchas if you run into the balance cap problem of course nothing is stopping you from having multiple accounts across different banks 2 the high interest bank accounts are fully liquid able to be liquidated at anytime without foregoing interest 3 a minor benefit is that the high yield savings account is low maintenance whereas cd laddering is pretty hands on and may require physical trips to your bank   if you know of a way to automate the process more please comment or edit

commonly get good payouts from these things   first when companies are in some of bankruptcy or financial distress they are forced to pay more to retain certain personnel due to the nature of the situation if the executives left then nobody would be willing to come in and wind up the assets of the company it would end up costing even more money in the long run because you wo n't get talented people and you will have to bring in people with little to no knowledge of your company or your industry   second bankruptcy law provides very clear guidelines for the priority of different creditors and this is tied into the incentives that we want to encourage if secured creditors did not get priority then they would never lend and we would not have economic growth the reason equity shareholders are last in priority is because they took on the risk of owning the company

at the most basic level of financing a business you are trying to acquire capital as cheaply as you can to invest in your projects   the measure for how expensive your capital is to acquire is weighted average cost of capital     the formula for wacc   equity ratio cost of equity + debt ratio cost of debt 1 tax rate this is also your discount rate when you 're making a dcf model   debt tends to be cheaper than equity when you do n't already have any and is also advantaged by tax rates since you do n't pay taxes on interest   in the real world banks and lenders will ratchet up rates the more debt you acquire or shut you out once you 've taken on too much and your debt service coverage is too low for them   in a classroom though most teachers are too lazy to make a formula for borrowing and will just state a rate for borrowing so you can load up on debt so long as you do n't fall below being able to service your debt cash flow to make your debt payments   this will ultimately juice the returns on equity   realistically you would find lenders would let you have ~20 equity in the business and debt without raising your teacher 's   if you have n't taken accounting yet be careful about the difference between cash and revenue in your analyses   revenue is recognition for work done not cash in hand   you can have all the revenue in the world but if no one 's paid you for it yet you ca n't pay anyone

ponder this suppose that a reputable company or government were to come out and say hey we are going to issue some 10 year bonds at 6.4 anyone interested in buying some assume that the company or government is financially solid and there is zero chance that they will go bankrupt think those bonds would sell would you be interested in buying such a bond well i would wager that these bonds would sell like despite the fact that the long term stock market return beats it by a half percent heck vanguard 's junk bond fund is hot right now it only yields 4.9 and those are junk bonds not rock solid companies see vanguard high yield corporate bond fund every time you make an extra principal payment on your student loan you are effectively purchasing a investment with a rock solid guaranteed 6.4 return for 10 years or whatever time you have left on the loan if make no extra payments on top of that paying off a loan early builds your credit reputation improves your monthly cash flow once the loan is paid may increase your purchasing power for a house or car and if nothing else it frees you from being a slave to that debt payment every month   edit improved wording based on ross 's comment

duffbeer703 covers most everything the entire point of an emergency fund is for it to be liquid   now i do understand if you feel your situation requires over 6 months of living expenses that is a lot of money to have sitting in a statement savings account under no circumstances should you take any sort of risk with an emergency fund however you could do this invest some of the assets in a six month 1 year or 2 year cd if returns were enough to be worthwhile   if you do n't need the money then fine great but if you do you can break a certificate of deposit before maturity there will be a penalty fee you might lose interest too but you 'll have access to your money no liquidity risk so maybe you could put most say 60 of your rainy day funds in truly liquid assets the remainder could be in longer term cd 's which you hopefully wo n't need because you 'll be back to non rainy day living again

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

the answer to your question is no unless you specifically ask to receive paper share certificates then brokers will hold your shares with a custodian company in the broker 's own nominee account   if you are able to receive paper certificates then the registrar of the company whose shares you own will have a record of your name however this is exceptionally rare these days   using a stockbroker means that your shares will be held in the broker 's nominee account a nominee company is a custodian charged with the safekeeping of securities it should be a separate entity from the broker itself in essence the nominee is the legal owner of the securities while you retain actual ownership as the beneficiary your broker can move and sell the securities on your behalf and gets to handle all the lovely paperwork but the assets still belong to you they ca n’t be claimed by the broker ’s creditors if things get messy the main reason for this kind of set up is cost and this is why brokers are able to offer relatively low dealing costs to their clients you can if you wish ask your broker for an account that deals with paper share certificates however few brokers will offer such an account and it will mean that you incur much higher dealing costs and may mean that you can not sell you shares without first submitting the paper certificates back to your stock broker    note that the stock exchange plays no role in recording ownership   nor does your broker 's account with the clearing house

why should a bank get into construction specifically lots of business opportunities require capital conceivably banks could build factories develop consumer electronics complete with spacex etc it 's all capital in profits out with varying levels of risk and returns there 's nothing special about constructing apartments the reason banks do n't run businesses is because there are plenty of private firms that compete with each other for business what 's the chance that a bank with all its bureaucracy can deliver cheaper apartments than an apartment developer pretty low in fact and that 's why they would rather lend to an apartment developer rather than building the apartments themselves banks are in the business of competing with other banks the main work they do is to sort out good investments from poor ones and if they can do that just a bit more efficiently than their competitors they make big bucks for example it might only take a few additional hours to better vet a deal worth millions whereas with an apartment building you would n't be able to make that amount of money per hour even if the materials and labor cost you nothing

here i thought i would not ever answer a question on this site and boom first ten minutes   first and foremost i am in the automotive industry specifically one of our core is finance department management consulting and the sales process both for the sale of the care as well   as   the financial transaction first and foremost new vehicle gross profits are nowhere near 20 for the dealership   in an entry level vehicle like say a toyota corolla there is only a   few hundreds of dollars in markup from invoice to   there is also something called that dealers get for achieving certain goals such as sales volume these are usually pretty easy to hit as a matter of fact i have never heard of a dealer not getting the hold back on a deal   this hold back is there to cover overhead for the car the cost of getting it ready to sell having a lot to park it on making it ready for delivery offset some of the cost of sales labor   etc   most dealerships consider the portion of the invoice to not be part of the deal when it comes to   negotiations   certain brands such as kia and chrysler have something called dealer cash these payouts are usually stepped according to volume and vary by dealer location past history how the guys at the factory feel that day and any number of combinations   then there is csi or customer service index payments these payments are usually made every 1/4 are on the parts statement not the sales doc and while they effect the dealers bottom line they almost never affect the sales managers or sales persons payroll so they are not considered a part of the cost of the car   they are however extremely important to   the dealer and this is   why after you have your new car they want you to bring in your survey for a free oil change or something   if you are going to give a bad survey they want to throw it away and not send it in if you are going to give a good survey they want to   make sure you fill it out correctly   this is because lets say they ask you on a scale of 1 10 how was your sales person and you put a 9 that is a failing score dumb i know but that is how every factory csi score system i have seen worked   according to nada the average new vehicle gross profit including hold back and dealer cash is around $   no where near 20   dealerships would love it if they made 20 on your new diesel at around $   one last thing there is something on the invoice called wholesale finance reserve   this is the amount of money the factory forwards to the dealership to offset the cost of financing vehicle on the floor plan so they can have it for you to look at before you buy   this is usually equal to around 3 months of interest and while you might buy a vehicle that has been on the lot for 2 days they have plenty that have been there much longer so this equals out in a fair to run store general that know what they are doing can make this really pad their net profit to statement on to incentives there are basically 3 kinds   cash to customer in the form of rebates dealer cash in the form of incentives to dealerships based on volume or the of a vehicle and incentive rates or leases   the rates are pretty self explanatory as they advertised as such example 0 for 60 months   leased are harder to figure out and usually not disclosed as they are hard to explain and also a source of increased profit   leases are usually powered by lower cost of money called a money factor think of it as an interest rate that is discounted from the lease company or a subsidized residual   subsidized are virtually on domestic vehicles due to their poor resell values   a subsidized residual works like this you buy a toyota camry and the automotive lease guide says it has a residual at 36 months of 48   well toyota motor credit says we will give you a residual of 60 basically subsidizing a 2 increase in residual   since they do not expect to be able to sell the car at auction for that amount they have to set aside the 2 as a future expense   what does this mean to you it means a lower payment   also a good rule of thumb if you are told a money factor by your salesperson to figure out what the interest rate is just multiply it by 2400   so if a money factor is give of you know your actual interest rate is a little bit lower than illustration purposes only money factors are much lower than that right now so how does this save you money well a lease is basically calculated by multiplying the msrp by the residual and then subtracting that amount from the capitalized cost which is the price paid for the car trade in + payoff + rebate down payment   that is the depreciation   then you divide that number by the term of the loan and you have the depreciation amount   so if you have 20 k cc and 10 k r your d = 10 k 36 = monthly payment   for the rest of the monthly payment you add i think been a long time since i did this with out a computer the residual plus the cc for $ 30,000 mf of = 107 for a total payment of 404 ish   this is not completely accurate but you can use it to   make sure a salesperson finance person is not trying to do one thing and   say another as so often happens on leases 0 how the   heck do   they make money at that well its simple   first in 2008 the fed made all the captive lenders into actual banks instead of whatever they were before   so now they have access to the fed 's discounting window which with todays monetary policies make it almost free money   in the past these lenders had to go through all kinds of hoops to raise funds and   securitize loans even for super prime credit   those days are essentially over   now they get their short term money just like bank of america does   eventually they still bundle these loans and sell them   so in the short term you pay for the 0 by giving up part or all of your rebate   this is really important do not give up your rebate for 0 unless it makes sense to do so   when you can get the money at 2.5 and get a $ rebate customer cash on that or 0 take the cash   first of all make the finance guy gal show you the the difference in total cost they can do do this using the federal truth in lending disclosures on a finance contract   secondly how long will you keep the vehicle   if you come out ahead by say $ 1500 by taking the lower rate but you usually trade out every three years this is not going to work   also and this is important if you are involved in a situation with a total loss like a stolen car or even worse a bad wreck before the breakeven point you lose that price break   finally on judging what is right for you just know that future value of the vehicle on for resell or trade in will take into effect all of these past rebates and value the car accordingly   so if a vehicle depreciates 20 a year for the first 3 years the starting point will essentially be $ less than you actually paid   using rough numbers how does this help the dealers and car companies   well while a dealer struggles to make money on new cars the factory makes all of their money on the   new cars and the new car financing   while your individual loan might lose money that money is offset by the loss of rebate and i think ford does actually pay ford motor credit company the difference in the rate   the most important thing is what happens later now has 2500 loans with people with perfect credit   they can now use those loans to with people with not so perfect credit that they financed at and buy that money with interest rates in the range   well that is a hell of a lot of profit   how does it help the dealership well the more super prime credit they have in their portfolio the more subprime credit the banks will buy for them   this means they have more loans originated that are more profitable for them   say you come in for the 0 but have 590 credit score they get to buy the deal because they have a good portfolio and you win because the dealer gets to buy the money at say 9 and sell it to you at say 12 making the spread   you win there because you actually qualified for a rate of around 18 with a subprime company like santander or capital one yes that capital one so   you save a ton on your overall cost of the car any dealership that is half way well run makes as much or money in the finance and insurance office than the rest of the dealership   when you factor in what a good director can do to get deals done with favorable terms that really goes up   think about that the guys sitting a desk drinking coffee making more than the   service department guys all put together well that was long winded but there i broke down the car business for whoever read this far

from your question i am guessing that you are intending to have stoploss buy order is the stoploss order is also a buy order   as you also said you seems to limit your losses i am again guessing that you have short position of the stock to which you are intending to place a buy limit order and buy stoploss order stoploss helps when when the price tanks and also i sense that you intend to place buy limit order at the price below the market price is that the situation   if you place two independent orders one limit buy and one stoploss buy please remember that there will be situation where two orders also get executed due to market movements add more details to the questions it helps to understand the situation and others can provide a strategic solution

gt;i'm playing devil 's advocate mostly   i should hope so because it seems disingenuous to suggest that viewing tons of photos is equivalent to seeing and touching something in real life particularly shoes or clothes   also say for example you go to your local shoe store and try on a pair of shoes your usual size is 9.5 so you try that on first but it feels big and a 9 fits you better if you 'd gone to amazon without going to the store first even though they offer free exchanges you 'd still have to deal with the costs of printing out a return label boxing them up going to the post office waiting two days for them to arrive at amazon and waiting two days for the new pair but going to the store first saved you that cost and the store does n't get any reward for it   i 'm not condemning you or anyone else for doing this but i would feel guilty about it and i 'm trying to explain why

a bank needs to make sure they wo n't lose money by cashing a check when you have an account with a bank and you cash a check if the check ends up not getting paid the bank will take the money back out of your account this could happen for a number of reasons the check could bounce not enough money in the check writer 's account it could be a fraudulent fake check or the payment could have been stopped on that check   treasury checks are more problematic for banks than private checks the government has given themselves more power to refuse to pay a check than the average person has as a result banks are already overly cautious about cashing treasury checks the fact that you have a big check increases the risk for the bank   you 'll have to ask around at different banks to see what they will do for you and what type of fee if any they will charge some banks might cash it for a fee others might require that you open a savings account and wait a certain number of days after depositing the check before withdrawing your money

this all depends on your timeline and net worth   if you 're short on time before you plan to start spending it or have a large net worth parking some of your money in cds is a good idea if you have lots of time or not much net worth then index funds are a better bet equity or dividend index funds are the way to go when you have 10 + years before you reach your goal cds major downside is that they do n't beat inflation 1 3 a year this is why you only use them when it 's absolutely critical you hold onto every penny of the principal the reason is because with cds your 10k is actually losing its value not the principal the longer you leave it in cds i generally would n't recommend cds unless you are in or approaching your 60s or have assets over 500k even still i would limit the use of cds to no more than 20 i would view them as catastrophic loss protection

there are two scenarios to determine the relevant date and then a couple of options to determine the relevant price if the stocks were purchased in your name from the start then the relevant date is the date of the purchase if the stocks were willed to you i.e. you inherited them then the relevant date is the date at which the person who willed them to you had died you can check with the company if they have records of the original purchase if it was in street name they may not have such records and then you need to figure out what broker it was to hold them once you   figured out the relevant date contact the company 's investor relationships contact and ask them for the adjusted stock price on that date adjusted for splits mergers acquisitions whatever that would be the cost basis per share you would be using alternatively you can research historical prices on your favorite financial information site google yahoo bloomberg or the stock exchange where the company is listed if you can not figure the cost basis or it costs too much you can just write cost basis as $ 0 and claim the whole proceeds as gains you 'll pay capital gains tax on the whole amount but that may end up being cheaper than conducting the investigation to reveal the actual numbers

you are presuming that after the transfer the cash is still sitting in a western union register but no that cash may have already been taken by the fraudster to refund the victim western union would have to 1 pay the victim back the amount of money lost and then 2 pursue the fraudster to reclaim the lost funds because the fraudster at the other end can simply show id to get the money ie they do not have an account with western union the cost to pursue that person to reclaim the lost funds would be substantially higher than for your bank because your bank can simply ding your account in the event that your account goes into overdraft because there were insufficient funds to reclaim the full amount the bank at least has a framework in place to pursue you for penalties

putting debt out long means to borrow a sum of money paid back over a longer period of time than you could reasonably pay it back it should be important to note that this advice only applies for fixed rate loans meaning your rate ca n't change for the life of the loan without you explicitly changing it   the logic is that if you can borrow money when interest rates are really low there is a good chance you can find an investment that has a return higher than the interest rate on the loan it also means that when if interest rates go up in the future a simple savings account may even have a greater return than your loans interest the advice suggests to borrow over a long period so you are paying less interest per payment and gives you time to find a proper investment without having to pay too much interest during that time

from my experience it is much easier to start as a self employed rather than a limited company you almost have no paperwork and self assessment can be done online in as little as 20 minutes from personal experience   on the other hand having a limited company grants you a pile of papers to fill in from the start and almost certainly needing an accountant to do your taxes   regarding the income tax if you have no profits you will pay no tax and that will leave you only with national insurance that is only about £ 70 for 3 month better check with hmrc for the exact figure so if you do n't have a good enough reason to do a ltd start as a self employed you can always change to limited company later

just to clarify short team goals long term goals long term goals are for something in future your retirement fund children ’s education etc short term goals are something in the near future your down payment for car house and holiday being planned first have both the long and short terms goals defined of you would need to review both these goals on a ongoing basis to meet the short term goals you would need to make short term investments having arrived at a short term goal value you would now need to make a decision as to how much risk you are willing also how much is required to take to take in order to meet your goal for example if you goal is to save rs 100,000 by for the car and you can easily set aside rs 8,000 every month you do n't really need to take a risk a simple term fixed deposit would suffice you to meet your goal on the other hand if you can only save rs 6,000 a year then you would need to invest this into something that would return you around 35 you would now need to take a risk stocks market is one option there are multiple types of trades day trades shorts options regular trades that one can do however the risk can wipe out even your capital as you do n't know these types of investments suggest you start with dummy investing using quite a few free websites is one such site you get pseudo money and can buy sell and see how things actually move this should teach you something about making quick gains or losses without actually gaining or loosing real money once you reach some confidence level you can start trading using real money by opening a trading account almost every other bank in india offers online trading linked to bank account never lose sight of risk appetite and revise if every now and then when you do n't have dependents you can easily risk money for potential bumper however after you have other commitments you may want to tone down   edit is one such site there are quite a few others as well that offer you to trade on virtual money try this for few months and you will understand whether you are making right or not

if you 're losing money or breaking even you own a bad investment   the problem you have is that you are emotionally invested in your tenant that is n't a bad thing in general but it 's costing you money and unless interest rates fall enough to justify a refi or property taxes go down in your area that 's kind of unlikely to change   option 1 tell your wife that you are willing to accept a loss up to a certain level because of your long term relationship with your tenant in a perfect world the two of you would then discuss what the magic number would be where you got out and come to a compromise for example if you are comfortable losing up to $ 3,000 per year and she is unhappy with any loss you may agree on selling the house when your losses climb to $ 1,500 in a less perfect world it would cause an argument as she has already told you what she wants you to do   option 2 raise the rent to the break even point from what you 've said this will likely result in the loss of your tenant but you could then rent to someone else for significantly more   option 3 sell the house it 's an investment property which means it 's supposed to make money for you it can do that very quickly by way of a sale and then it 's no longer your problem option 4 sell the house to your tenant you bought it for $ 50,000 and it 's currently worth $ 150,000 roughly the problem you face is that property taxes have gone up and caused your mortgage to increase past your tenants ability to pay my guess is after 15 years your payoff is somewhere in the high $ 20 's to mid 30 's assuming you got a 30 year loan and have n't refinanced if you sell to her for say $ 75,000 or even up to $ 90,000 you will still make a profit wife is happy she will get a mortgage she can afford and be able to stay in the house you and the tenant are happy added bonus is that her property taxes would be lower assuming a different rate for investment property in your area i would discuss this at length with your wife as well before making such an offer   option 5 get a property management company as mentioned above they will keep a percentage but will remove your emotions from the equation altogether and turn the situation into a winner   i do n't know if your wife is right in saying you do n't have the stomach for this but i do think your heart is getting in the way in this particular situation i get the feeling that if your tenant was 25 years old and had only been renting from you since last october you would have no problem raising the rent to market levels at every renewal

h.r. basically publication 15 this is the link to 2015 to determine how much to hold based on filing status exemptions and pay amount what 's described here is a form of estimation or in other words h.r. withholds what would be your actual taxes dividing across the number of paychecks you receive assuming your gross pay and exemptions do not change this usually results in a zero sum for taxes owed you will receive nothing and owe nothing as you can see from the charts the year is basically broken down into equal tax units that reflect how much you would owe if you worked at that bracket all year this estimation works best when you have steady hours from check to check in other words your taxes are based on the estimate of what you 'd make if you earned that much all year scaled down to the time frame e.g. if you are paid weekly or if you paid biweekly they do not go up near the end of the year because they 're estimated in advance you do n't move up a tax bracket but are instead taxed at a particular bracket every paycheck there 's also other forms of estimation mentioned there but basically follow the same scheme note that all estimation forms are just estimates it 's best to use a calculator and compare your current taxes whenever a significant change a raise a new child getting married or divorced etc you 'll want to be able to alter your exemptions so that enough taxes are coming out that 's also the reason for the withhold extra box so that you can avoid owing for example if you 're making $ 44 a week for the first 26 weeks and then you make $ a week for the second 26 weeks of the year you 'll end up with an actual tax liability of $ but end up paying only $ you would owe $ of course the actual math is a lot more complicated if you 're an employee paid by the minute for example or you have a child go to college etc paychecks that vary wildly like $ 10,000 one week and $ 2,000 the next tend to have the hardest to predict estimates e.g. jobs with big commission payouts you should avoid living check to check with jobs that pay this way because you 'll probably end up owing taxes conversely if you 've done your estimates right and you 're paid salary or exactly the same number of hours every week you 'll find that the taxes are much easier to predict and you can usually easily create a refund situation simply by having the correct exemptions on your check so in summation if your check falls in the 25 category which is of course 25 above the tax bracket break point you 're already paying the correct amount and no further drop in your check would be expected

so if i understand the investment program here you have $ 100 of tax withheld from your salary at the end of jan feb mar until december   this withholding is in excess of the expected tax for the year you use the appropriate h&r block product to file your taxes and h&r block gets your refund of $ 1200 on march 1st   h&r block adds 10 and give you e cards for $ on the face of it this represents a return of per year compounded monthly however there are a few wrinkles that might make the scheme less inviting you 'll get a receipt for miscellaneous income from h&r block and pay tax on the earnings the quoted return is only realized if you can use the e cards immediately   if they sit around for a while then they are n't earning any interest   if you sell them for cash at a discount if you even can   then this reduces the return   if you do n't cash them at all they 're a total loss this offer was announced on jan 15 2015   so you ca n't go back and put it in place for 2014   and if you set it up for withholding in 2015 is there any guarantee that it the same offer will be in place when filing in 2016

i used to be the sort of person who would tell you that i 've left money for you somewhere and in fact not have done so and i also used to be the last person you 'd expect to do something like that i 've not done this exact thing but i 've done similar not gon na go into detail but at that time i was in a state of poverty barely able to buy food and drink and the money i saved by people in similar ways was spent on food and warmth   personally i think she 's going through a very hard patch financially and as such has done exactly that me i 'm not a landlord and i 'm probably far too generous i would explain that i think she 's lying but let it slide this month clearly a property owner is more financially capable of up this expense than a tenant   on the other hand you do n't become a property owner and landlord by letting people get away without paying their rent   all in all i would probably push for a 50/50 decision she pays half rent this month which her finances a bit if she is genuinely in trouble and has lied and you still get something for your efforts if you 're lucky when you suggest it she will come clean i would make it clear if you do or do n't believe her as she may well confess if you express your doubts if she does i would n't hold her to paying the full amount unless she offers to do so also make it very obvious that this can and will not happen again next time she gives you cash or uses a banking service goes without saying i guess   you should note that legally speaking by accepting anything other than full payment you could be acknowledging that she did attempt to make a payment and any future legal cases will not consider that favorably for you i would strongly recommend discussing this with a solicitor before agreeing to anything other than full payment

key point here is to remember that gbp is nt falling a lot it has fallen a lot already   if you have nt liquidated your position in pounds by now at a higher rate i would personally not bother switching to another currency right now   the pound is near its 10 year 2008 capital c crisis levels and despite what fear may short the market for the sun will shine after brexit as well britain has a solid economy and that has nt fundamentally changed so even if the pound has nt seen the absolute periodic lowest point may still come as brexit talks become more prevalent near their end it will eventually pull back up   in essence you have more to lose acting in panic now than waiting to exchange for a better than today 's rate at some point until the eventual in march 2019 or at any point you wo nt be needing those savings when you move

before doing anything else you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves seriously you 'll both be safer and happier if it 's all explicit how much you should put on the house is not the right question houses do n't sell instantly and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange you need to have enough operating capital for normal finances plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses there are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions after that the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all it is n't always a better option than renting and again as discussed in answers to other questions there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance if you 're just thinking about the financials it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market the time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income plan not to move for at least five years really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs which will absorb more money   as far as how much to put down vs. finance you really want a down payment of at least 20 anything less than that and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance which is a significant expense whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get this is a good time in that regard versus how much return you are getting on your investments combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment you 're comfortable committing to if you 've got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing if you 're comfortable with that if the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable   this might not be a good answer for you it 's a judgement call i waited until i 'd been in out of school about 25 years before i was ready to buy a house since i 'd been careful with my money over that time   i had enough in investments that i could have bought the house for cash or i could have gone the other way and financed 80 of it for maximum leverage i decided that what i was comfortable with was financing 50 you 'll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with but i say again if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved it may be absolutely the right thing to do but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out and you 'll also want appropriate terms written into your wills being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights but even then it 's safer to make it all explicit edit yes making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan you 'll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you

like dheer said the demand for shorter term money is greater than for longer term money precisely because the banks do n't want to have to pay big interest rates for long periods banks borrow short term and lend long term so they take money from you for one year and lend it away as a 20 year mortgage after a year they take money for another year since short term rates tend to be higher than longer term rates they make money off the spread or the different between the rate they lend and the rate they borrow in this scenario banks should pay higher for longer term deposits but overall banks realize that interest rates will go up and down and they do n't want to lock the up for a longer term since banks believe that rates will come down in the 1 2 year period they offer good rates only till the 1 year period and longer term deposits by offering lower rates if you look at the interbank or money markets trading of very short term bulk money shows that for the 10 15 day periods the interest rates being offered are 10 or so while for one year it 's just 9.5 the market believes that interest rates will go down in the one year time frame but you never really know since this is just a bunch of people that believe so eventually if rates continue to go up the demand at the longer term will also go up because it will become obvious that the rate pressure continues to be strong   if you do want higher rates for the long term check out state bank of india bonds that are currently trading on the nse you can buy them if you have a brokerage account they are just about as safe as sbi fixed deposits and the rate being offered is around for a 10 15 year term hope that helps

if psychologically there is no difference to you between cash and debit you should test this over a couple of months on yourself and spouse to make sure then i suggest two debit cards one for you and spouse on your main or separate checking account if you use mint you can set budgets for each category envelope and when a purchase is made mint will automatically categorize that transaction and deduct that amount from the correct budget   for example if you have a fast food budget set at $ 100 per month and you use the debit at mcdonalds mint should automatically categorize it as fast food and deduct the amount from the fast food budget that you set   if it ca n't determine a category or gets it wrong you can just select the proper category mint has an iphone also android and windows phone app that i find very easy to use many people state that they do n't have this psychologically difference between spending cash and debit credit but i would say that most actually do especially with small purchases   it does n't have anything to do with intellect or knowing that you are actually spending money   it has more to do with and the physical act of handing over cash   you may not add that soda and candy bar to your purchase if you have visible cash in your wallet that will disappear more quickly   i lived in germany for 2 years before debit cards were around or common   i 'm a sharp guy and even though i knew that i paid $ 100 for the 152 it still kind of felt like spending monopoly money especially considering that in the us we are used to coins normally being 25 cents or less and in germany coins are up to 10 almost $ 10 and are used more frequently than paper

what you 're describing is called timing the market   that is if you correctly predict when the market will drop you can sell before the drop wait for the drop then buy after the drop has occurred   sell high buy low the fundamental problem with that though is what ends up happening on average is you end up slightly behind   there 's quite a lot of literature on this see betterment 's explanation for example   forbes click through ad first also has a detailed piece on the matter now we 're not really talking hft issues here and there are some structural things that some argue you can take advantage of restrictions on some organizational investors for example similar to a blackjack dealer who has to hit on 16   however everyone else knows about these too so it 's hard to gain much of an edge plenty of people say they can time the market right and even yourself perhaps you timed a particular drop accurately   this tends to lead to false confidence though how many drops that you timed badly do you remember ultimately most investors end up slightly down when they attempt to time the market because of the transaction costs if you guess two drops one right and one wrong and they have exactly opposite gains losses before commissions you will lose a bit on each due to commission and because of the overall upward trend in the market ie if you picked at random one month a year to be out of the market you 'd lose around 10 annualized gains from doing that same applies here all of that aside there is one major caveat risk tolerance   if you are highly risk tolerant say a 30 year old investing your 401(k then you should stay in no matter what   if you 're not say you 're 58 and retiring in a few years then knowledge that there 's a higher risk time period coming up might suggest moving to a less risky portfolio even at the known cost of some gains

that argument is an argument for investing generally not peer to peer lending per se and the argument as phrased thus you should invest your money at a peer to peer loan platform is a false dichotomy that said as soon as one is investing as opposed to just getting a small but guaranteed return then risk comes into play   in that sense any savings account is fundamentally different from any investment and in that reading the two should n't be compared as different approaches to investing   peer to peer lending as an investment could be compared with stock market investing for one

sounds to me like you 're describing just how it should work   ask is at 30 bid is at 20 you offer a new bid at 25   either depending on liquidity one or the other may be more likely this article on the subject describes what you 're seeing and recommends the strategy you 're describing precisely instead of a market order take advantage of the fact that the options world truly is a marketplace one where you can possibly get a better price just by asking how does that work if you use a limit order instead of a market order when opening a position you can tell your broker how much you are willing to pay to enter a trade for example if you enter a limit price of $ 1.15 you can see whether the market maker will bite you will be surprised at how many times you will get your price i.e. $ 1.15 instead of the ask price of $ 1.30 if your order at $ 1.15 is not filled after a few minutes you can modify your order and pay the ask price by entering a market order or limit order at the ask price that is you can tell your broker to pay no more than $ 1.30

i think you are a little confused if you have 10.000 € in cash for a car but you decide instead to invest that money and take out a loan for the car at 2,75 interest you would have to withdraw sell € each month from your investment to make your loan payment if you made exactly 2,75 on your investment you would be left with 0 € in your investment when the loan was paid off   if your investment did better than 2,75 you would come out ahead and if your investment did worse than 2,75 you would have lost money on your decision having said all that i do n't recommend borrowing money to buy a car especially if you have that amount of cash set aside for the car   here are some of the reasons sometimes people feel better about spending large amounts of money if they can pay it off over time rather than spending it all at once   they tell themselves that they will come out ahead with their investments or they will be earning more later or some other story to make themselves feel better about overspending   if getting the loan is allowing you to spend more money on a car than you would spend if you were paying cash then you will not come out ahead by investing you would be better off to spend a smaller amount of money now i do n't know where you are in the world but where i come from you can not get a guaranteed investment that pays 2,75   so there will be risk involved if the next year is a bad one for your investment then your investment losses combined with your withdrawals for your car payments could empty your investment before the car is paid off   conversely by skipping the 2,75 loan and paying cash for your car you have essentially made a guaranteed 2,75 on this money comparatively speaking i do n't know what the going rate is for car loans where you are but often car dealers will give you a low loan rate in exchange for a higher sales price   as a result you might think that you can easily invest and beat the loan rate but it is a false comparison because you overpaid for the car

i wondered about this problem too so i looked into the maths and made this app it uses the free document format player if you try it out you can see what conditions favour renting vs buying   my own conclusion was to aim to buy a property outright upon reaching retirement age if not sooner example this example compares buying a £ 400,000 house with renting for £ 1,000 a month while depositing equivalent amounts in savings to total the same monthly outgoings as the buyer   mortgage rate deposit rate property appreciation and rent inflation can be specified   the example mortgage term is 20 years   as you can see the buyer and renter come out about even after the mortgage term but the buyer comes off better after that having no more mortgage to pay   of course the rent to live in a £ 400,000 house would probably be more than £ 1,000 but this case shows an equivalence point

first as others have commented the idea that getting a mortgage to buy a house is always a good idea is false   it depends on a number of factors including the current interest rate what you think the future interest rate will do over the life of your mortgage the relative cost of renting vs. buying and how long you would stay in the house that you bought to the extent that a mortgage for a house is more often recommended than buying other goods on credit it is for these reasons except for 1 above you could and can find other situations where taking a loan makes more sense than buying in cash   this more true if you have the resources and the skill to invest money at a rate that beats the interest rate you pay to the creditor   the general advice not to try this rests in the fact that most people do n't have the resources or the skill to actually make this pay off especially on high interest rate loans or over short time periods

cd laddering is funding a few cds in succession for instance for 6 months each month you open up a 6 month cd rather than   opening up one big one doing this will give you monthly interest payments as each month a cd will reach maturity after 6 months at that time you can choose to roll over the principal in a new cd and keep the interest reinvest all etc etc etc you still get the benefits higher rates that cds offer but with greater flexibility and more frequent interest payouts the only downside that i 'm aware off is that you may end up with a slightly lower overall interest rate

i think the best way to handle her fears is to explain the income and expenses of the household overall then explain the savings and investment strategies retirement projections and then finally explain a concrete number for allowable monthly or annual discretionary expenses including charity entertainment vacations etc   you may have delicate relationship reasons for not doing this but if you want a reasonable discussion i would leave it this way please do not open with the question how much do you think we make or anything similar because that comes off as a trick or a quiz   it sounds very condescending and highlights how much more you know about finances than she does   it also highlights subconsciously how little mental control she has over the finances which is likely to make her feel greater anxiety you should emphasize how secure things are and explain why all the savings and investments you 're using are conservatively likely to keep her financially secure   this sets the ground for her to be comfortable with the fact that she now has money in contrast to perhaps a less financially secure personal history after that charitable expenses come out of the expense budget same as vacations recreation etc   if it does not financial security then it 's not dangerous to spend on charity the alternate approach is to avoid the big financial talk and just propose a few small contributions this year then increase it every year incrementally that may be easier to swallow once there 's a psychological track record of donating without incident please go into the discussion remembering three things but above all please do not open up with a quiz   have a simple discussion with her   give her time to consider the expenses budget relative to the savings budget as a proportion of income   and then allow for the fact that she may place a strong premium on savings and a strong discount on charity

my knee jerk reaction was no they are not worth it but i took a little time to look up what some of the trusted names in consumer electronics reviews had to say about extended warranties service contracts a writer said that your decision should consider the price of the service contract relative to the price of the item you 're buying as well as the amount of hassle you 're willing to endure should something go wrong consumer reports believes that the warranties that come with your products are almost always enough and they say that electronics and appliances are so well built nowadays the likelihood of you needing extra service before you upgrade are slim to none and the folks over at offer the same maybe yes maybe no advice as the guys depends on your appetite for risk and the options available to you so i would suggest that the answer be no most of the time but consider it anyway

is listed on a stock exchange in paris is listed on the otc other exchange is listed on the otc pink sheets   a company can be listed on multiple exchanges they are known as a dual listed company it 's a corporate structure in which two corporations function as a single operating business through a legal equalization agreement but retain separate legal identities and stock exchange listings pretty much all are cross border and have tax advantages for the corporations and their stockholders when a dlc is created in essence two companies are created and have two separate bodies of shareholders but they agree to share all the risks and rewards of the ownership of all their operating businesses in a fixed proportion laid out in a contract called an equalization agreement the shares of a dlc parents have claim to the exact same underlying cash flows so in theory the stock prices of these companies should move exactly the same however in practice there can be differences between these prices more info on otc exchanges can be found here keep in mind this info is from the company that runs these listings over the counter stocks are held to a far lesser regulation standard i would recommend doing further interdependent research before pursuing any action

corporations exist to generate profit and reduce risk for investors   this is a socially good and useful function that benefits us all   a corporation that did n't seek to lower its tax bill to the lowest legally allowed would be breaking the law   rather than show up at random times and whatever they could grab ahold of governments have discovered through trail and error that having clear consistent rules about how much they demand nets them more revenue   thus tax law and why it is important   over time governments have used tax law for social engineering purposes and as a mechanism for attempting to control their local economy because of this tax law has tended towards higher and higher complexity   throw territorial into the mix and tax law can be also used as a sort of economic weapon   all of this yields a complex tax code which mandates that businesses pay more and more attention to following it 's arcane rules if they want to remain in business   gaming the system is n't morally wrong it is what governments expect businesses to do otherwise they would n't spend so much time setting up such complex rules for business to follow   i suspect that there will be public outcry for more rules making the tax system even more complex because evil businesses are attempting to follow the rules   in a sane world governments would step back refrain from social and economic manipulation which they have shown themselves to be incompetent at anyway and create as simple a tax code as possible so that the tax code is no longer where businesses seek to gain advantage but rather focus their time and energy into creating better products services every dollar spent on tax lawyers accountants is a dollar not spent on making the business better   creating more rules to punish people for following the rules is insanity

when you are investing for 40 years you will have taxable events before retirement   you 'll need to pay tax along the way which will eat away at your gains for example in your taxable account any dividends and capital gain distributions will need taxes paid each year   in your 401(k or ira these are not taxable until retirement in addition what happens if you want to change investments before retirement   in your taxable account taxes on the capital gains will be due at that time but in a retirement account you can change investments anytime you like without having to pay taxes early finally when you do pull money out of your 401(k at retirement it will be taxed at whatever your tax rate is at retirement   after you retire your income will probably be lower than when you were working so your tax rate might be less

here 's another way to think about   let 's assume it is 2011 and we have a married couple who are 25 and make a combined salary of $ net   a suitable first house in their area is $ 300,000 six times their annual net salary   assuming they could scrimp so that 1/2 of take home went toward saving for their home they could save enough to buy the house using cash in 12 years at the age of 37   onerous but they could do it but now let 's allow salaries to increase by 3 a year and homes at 10%/yr as in your question and let 's run things out for 20 years now a 25 year old couple at the same sort of jobs would be making $   but the houses in that town would be worth not $ 300k but $   instead of six times their salary a house is now nearly 21 times their salary   this means that if they saved 1/2 of take home to save up for a house they could afford to buy the house using cash when they were 67 years old it gets worse quickly   if you run it out for just ten more years to 30 years a couple would be able to buy the house at $ 4.8 million or a year 's salary in cash when they were 105 years old   let 's hope they ate brown rice mortgages ca n't save them since even if they could put down ten years worth of savings on the house that 'd be 14 down they 'd still carry a $ 4.1 million mortgage with a $ annual net salary

i 'm glad that you feel like being fair and equitable to your party other are of course correct that being fair and equitable to your girlfriend is not in your best interests but that 's not what you 're trying to do here and i commend you for it there is nothing that stops you drawing up a simple legal contract giving your girlfriend a share of the value of your house in return for her payments just get it signed and witnessed and checked over by a legal representative you can include reasonable terms for the money to be paid back if you separate perhaps when you sell the property or within two years of the breakup that do n't put you in immediate danger of losing the property just make clear that this contract is between you and her for a sum of money linked to the value of your house it does not establish any legal claim on your house itself a reasonable level for her to claim the property would be one half of the change in equity between when you start joint paying and when you separate should that happen

two reasons many people make lots of financial decisions and other kinds of decisions without actually running any numbers to see what is best or even possible   they just go with their gut and buy things they feel like buying without making a attempt to assess the impact on their finances   i share your at this but it is true a example that has stuck with me can be found in this los angeles times story from a few years ago which describes a family spending $ 1000 more than their income every month while defaulting on their mortgage and dipping into their old daughter 's savings account to cover the bills but still spending $ 275 a month on beauty products and services and $ 200 a month on pet expenses even to the extent that people do take finances into account finances are not the only thing they take into account   for many people driving a car that is new looks nice and fresh has the latest features etc is something they are willing to pay money for   your question why do n't people view a car solely as a means of transportation is not a financial question but a psychological one   the answer to why do people buy new cars is because people do not view cars solely as a means of transportation i recently bought a used car and while looking around at different ones i visited a car lot   when the dealer heard which car i was interested in he said so i guess you 're looking for a transportation car   i thought to myself duh   is there any other kind   but the fact that someone can say something like that indicates that there are many people who are looking for something other than a transportation car

when i first purchased my home six years ago i was able to get into a bank of america first time homebuyer program that required no down payment and no pmi while i hope you find a lower initial payment the banks have tightened their requirements so that buyers have more skin in the game so to speak exotic loan options coupled with the subprime mortgage crisis caused the housing bubble to burst now banks are being very selective about who they provide a mortgage the other things you need to look at are interest rate and terms do you feel you will be in the home for the next 30 years have you considered a 15 year mortgage shop around pmi used to have a bad connotation at least it did when i bought my home six years ago but i feel now that it would have been worthwhile for the banks and the economy in the long run had banks required buyers to utilize pmi

gt they specifically say that is not true there is no genetic explanation   you really ca n't read huh they specifically say that they have n't found the specific genetic explanation yet because the genome is still too complex to link specific to specific parts of nervous system development that does n't mean there is n't one differences in gene inheritance absolutely affect intelligence the brain is part of biology just like how black people are genetically more prone to obesity after controlling for diet metabolism despite the fact that we do n't understand the precise genetic mechanism yet even grade school nature vs. nurture nobody argues for pure nurture the iq metric holds up fine as it correlates with nearly every broad measure of socioeconomic success and many other lifestyle measures as shown above it 's your shitty reading comprehension and misconceptions about the scientific research process that is preventing you from understanding and accepting the basic concept that people of very different have a correspondingly different cognitive makeup

we can also all sit back and bitch about how there are no jobs   no one is willing to pay for services anymore because everything is   the internet   you have billions of dollars flowing to startups with employees   monetizing the internet outside of advertising would be a boon to the economy and jobs people just ca n't see it   if everyone paid for things you know like pre internet we would probably have better quality stuff   for example news has suffered laying off all the real journalists google would be forced to actually compete with companies vs. giving everything away free   that creates employment opportunities for other startups to compete in a fair environment vs. trying to acquire millions of users on no revenue

this is not a direct answer to your question but you might want to consider whether you want to have a financial planner at all would a large mutual fund company or brokerage serve your needs better than a bank you are still quite young and so have been contributing to iras for only a few years also the wording in your question suggests that your ira investments have not done spectacularly well and so it is reasonable to infer that your ira is not a large amount or at least not as large as what it would be 30   years from now at this level of investment it would be difficult for you to find a financial planner who spends all that much time looking after your interests that you should get away from your current planner presumably a mid level employee in what is typically called the trust division of the bank is a given   but to go to another bank or even to a different employee in the same bank where   you will also likely be towards investing your ira in cds annuities and a few mutual funds with substantial sales charges and   substantial annual expense fees might just take you from the pan into the fire you might want to consider transferring your ira to a large mutual fund company and investing it in something simple   like one of their low cost meaning small annual expense ratio index funds the couch potato portfolio suggests equal amounts invested in a no load s&p 500 index fund and a no load bond index fund or a split favoring the stock index fund in view of your age and the fact that the ira should be a long term investment   but the point is   you can open an ira account have the money transferred from your ira account with the bank and make the investments on line all by yourself instead of having a financial advisor do it on your behalf and charge you a fee for doing so not to mention possibly screwing it up you can set up automated investment too the mutual fund company will gladly withdraw money from your checking account and invest it in whatever fund(s you choose   all this is not complicated at all   if you would like to follow the couch potato strategy and rebalance your portfolio once a year you can do it   by yourself too if you want to invest in funds other than the s&p 500 index fund etc most mutual fund   companies offer a portfolio analysis and advice for a fee and the fee is usually waived when the assets increase above certain levels varies from company to company   you could thus have a portfolio analysis done each year and hopefully it will be free after a few more years   indeed at that level you also typically get one person assigned as your advisor just as you have with a bank once you get the recommendations you can choose to follow them   or not but you have control over how and where your ira assets are invested   over the years as your ira assets grow you can branch out into   investments other than index funds but right now having a financial planner for your ira might not be worth it later when you have more assets by all means if you want to explore investing in specific stocks with a brokerage instead of sticking to mutual funds only but this might also mean phone calls urging you to sell stock a right now or buy hot stock b today etc so one way of improving your interactions and have a better experience with your new financial planner is to not have a planner at all for a few years and do some of the work yourself

does your employer provide a matching contribution to your 401k   if so contribute enough to the 401k that you can fully take advantage of the 401k match e.g. if you employer matches 3 of your income contribute 3 of your income   it 's free money take advantage of it next up max out your roth ira   the limit is $ 5000 currently a year after maxing your roth revisit your 401k   you can contribute up to 16,500 per year you savings account is a good place to keep a rainy day fund do you have one but it lacks the tax advantages of a roth ira or 401k so it is not really suitable for retirement savings unless you have maxed out both your 401k and roth ira once you have take care of getting money into your 401k and roth ira accounts the next step is investing it   the specific investment options available to you will vary depending on who provides your retirement account(s so these are general guidelines generally you want to invest in higher risk higher return investments when you are young   this includes things like stocks and developing countries as you get older > 30 you should look at moving some of your investments into things that less volatile   bond funds are the usual choice   they tend to be safer than stocks assuming you do n't invest in junk bonds but your investment grows at a slower rate now this does n't mean you immediately dump all of your stock and buy bonds   rather it is a gradual transition over time   as you get older and older you gradually shift your investments to bond funds a general rule of thumb i have seen 100 your age = percentage of your portfolio that should be in stocks someone that is 30 would have 70 of their portfolio in stock someone that is 40 would have 60 in stock etc as you get closer to retirement you will want to start looking at investments that are more than bonds   start to look at fixed income and money market funds

does this make sense i 'm concerned that by buying shares with post tax income i 'll have ended up being taxed twice or have increased my taxable income the company will then re reimburse me for the difference in stock price between the vesting and the purchase share price sure   assuming you received a rsu for shares worth $ 10 and your marginal tax rate is 30 all made up numbers either or so you 're in the same spot either way   you paid $ 300 to get $ 1,000 worth of stock taxes are the same as well   the full value of the rsu will count as income either way and you 'll either pay tax on the gains of the 100 shares in your rsu our you 'll pay tax on gains on the 70 shares in your rsu and the 30 shares you bought   since they 're reimbursing you for any difference the cost basis will be the same although you might get taxed on the reimbursement but that should be a relatively small amount this first year i wanted to keep all of the shares due to tax reasons and because believe the share price will go up i do n't see how this would make a difference from a tax standpoint you 're going to pay tax on the rsu either way either in shares or in cash   how does the value of the shares going up make a difference in tax additionally i 'm concerned that by doing this i 'm going to be hit by my bank for exchange fees foreign money transfer charges broker purchase fees etc   that might be true if that 's the case then you need to decide whether to keep fighting or decide if it 's worth the transaction costs

hmm this would seem to be impossible by definition   the definition of an index fund is that it includes exactly the stocks that make up the index once you say except for then what you want is not an index fund but something else it 's like asking can i be a vegetarian but still eat beef umm no there might be someone offering a mutual fund that has the particular combination of stocks that you want resembling the stocks making up the index except with these exclusions that would n't be an index fund at that point but etc there are lots of funds out there with various ideological criteria i do n't know of one that matches your criteria i 'd say search for the closest approximation you can find you could always buy individual stocks yourself and create your own pseudo index fund depending on how many stock are in the index you are trying to match and how much money you have to invest it may not be possible to exactly match it mathematically if you would have to buy fractions of shares if the number of shares you had to buy was very small you might get killed on broker fees and i 'll upvote 's answer for being a pretty close approximation to what you want

if you plan to keep this asset for ten years then you can take the of its cost over that time period for simplicity lets treat that as 120 monthly payments so at a purchase price of $ 60,000 you are committing around $ 500 per month not including vehicle maintenance i typically allocate around 20 percent of the purchase price of my vehicles for future maintenance costs since you have the cash to purchase this outright you have an option not afforded to most people this adds for additional consideration here is an example   you purchase a $ 60,000 car and put $ 10,000 down you finance $ 50,000 at over 60 months your total finance cost is $ if you do not miss any payments the question here is can you make more than $ on the $ 50,000 that you would retain in this situation over a five year period i know that i most certainly can and is an excellent example of why i finance my vehicles obviously this all goes out the window if you do not have the credit for top rates   i have also negotiated a vehicle maintenance plan with the dealership at the time of my vehicle purchases most dealerships offer this service the key here is negotiating on my last truck i was able to get an all inclusive maintenance policy for 72 months for 8 of the purchase price your mileage will vary with manufacturer and dealership as described in the comments above it is never beneficial for an individual to lease you end up paying more for the newer models i consider that to be a lifestyle choice as it is most certainly not a sound financial decision

i 've spent enough time researching this question where i feel   comfortable enough providing an answer   i 'll start with the high level fundamentals and work my way down to the specific question that i had so point 5 is really the starting point for my answer we want to find companies that are investing their money   a good company should be reinvesting most of its excess assets so that it can make more money off of them if a company has too much working capital then it is not being efficiently reinvested   that explains why excess working capital can have a negative impact on return on capital but what about the fact that current liabilities in excess of current assets has a positive impact on the return on capital calculation   that is a problem period   if current liabilities exceed current assets then the company may have a hard time meeting their short term financial obligations this could mean borrowing more money or it could mean something worse like bankruptcy   if the company borrows money then it will have to repay it in the future at higher costs   this approach could be fine if the company can invest money at a rate of return exceeding the cost of their debt but to favor debt in the return on capital calculation is wrong that scenario would skew the metric the company has to overcome this debt anyways this is my understanding as the amateur investor my credibility is not even comparable to greenblatt 's credibility so i have no business calling any part of his calculation wrong but in defense of my explanation greenblatt does n't get into these gritty details so i do n't know that he allowed current liabilities in excess of current assets to have a positive impact on his return on capital calculation

i find it somewhat doubtful that the us economy will grow by less than 16 billion in the next 33 years 33 years ago the us had a gdp of just 4 trillion yes i know that growth has slowed down considerably but i just do n't see how the us economy will fail to double in such a long period of time    hell from 2015 to 2016 the us economy grew billion dollars to trillion dollars assuming growth stopped and we simply increased our gdp by that much every year we 'd increase by that much in 33 years but that 's unlikely to happen over the long period and since growth is compounding i see us easily staying ahead of india china only gets past us on ppp seeing as their nominal economy was practically flat last year due to a slump in the

i 've seen target stores with some strange layouts in buildings that they did n't build themselves and those stores have succeeded so i would n't necessarily blame the reuse of existing buildings in and of itself as a factor   my local target is a former ward store and has a somewhat bi level layout because of this especially when compared to two bi level stores that target built themselves in nearby towns   but all three stores are successful   target 's problem with buying out the leases was that they had too large of a store footprint before they were ready to service it   if they had started small with one or two locations and then built up gradually they would have probably been fine working the bugs out on a few stores vs. 100 + stores   a acquisition could have happened later on

scenario 1 is typically the better description if commercial banks were allowed to simply create money they would n't be in the mess they 're in now in the u.s. the central bank is the federal reserve or fed and is the only entity not the government not the banks not the people that is allowed to create money out of thin air it does this primarily by buying government debt the government spends more than it takes in and so to come up with the deficit it issues bonds the fed buys a certain amount of these bonds and simply prints the money or more realistically authorized the electronic transfer of $ x to the treasury which the government then spends that places money in the hands of corporations and the people who turn around and spend it however long term the interest charges on money borrowed from the fed will actually remove money from the economy the central banks therefore have to constantly make marginal changes to various monetary policy tools they have when the economy is just along if they do nothing then too much of a short term increase in money supply will result in there being too much money which makes an individual monetary unit worth less inflation while making money too hard to get will reduce the rate at which it 's spent reducing gdp and causing recessions the exact scenario you describe is typically seen in cases where the government is running with a balanced budget and the central bank thus ca n't give its new money to the government to spend when it wants to increase the money supply in that situation the central bank instead lowers its lending rate the percentage interest that it will charge on loans made to other banks thereby encouraging those banks to borrow more of the money created by the central bank those banks will then use the money to make loans invest in the market etc etc which puts the money in the economy   in the u.s. the fed does have this tool as well but increases or decreases in the federal funds rate are typically used to influence the rate that banks charge each other to borrow money thus encouraging or discouraging this lending a lowering in the interest rate makes banks more likely to borrow from each other and from the fed but the amount of money created this way is a drop in the bucket compared to current quantitative easing and thus increases the turnover of the existing money in the economy how many times a theoretical individual dollar is spent in a given time period

the only real consideration i would give to paying off the debt as slowly as possible is if inflation were much higher than it is now   if you had a nice medium to low interest fixed rate loan like yours and then inflation spiked to 7 8 for example then you 're better off not paying it now because it 's effectively making you money and then when inflation back down you pay it off with your gains however with a fairly successful and active federal reserve being careful to avoid inflation spikes it seems unlikely that will occur during your time owing this debt and certainly is n't anywhere near that point now   make sure you 're saving some money not for the return but for the safety net put it in something very safe and otherwise pay off your debt

while the us tax code does not directly impose an obligation to pay estimated taxes it does impose a penalty on individuals for failure to pay enough taxes either through withholding or estimated tax anyone can choose how s he wants to pay their taxes but they better deal with any consequences of not paying them instead of just complaining about it like most people do most people get the hatred towards the irs but most complaints are and should be directed towards congress who creates and messes around with the us tax code some people actually do not make estimated payments and pay any possible taxes with their returns knowing that there may be underpayment penalty for those people the penalty is relatively small compared to what they can do with the cash over a year 's time i.e. investing or paying down debt it 's their choice

yes a diversified portfolio can generate greater returns than the s&p 500 by going outside it for instance small stocks on average generate higher returns than the large caps found in the s&p 500 so if you own a diversified portfolio of stocks some of which are smaller in market cap than the typical s&p 500 stock you have a chance to outperform you might also outperform by owning other asset classes than stocks such as gold real estate and timber among others at appropriate times you may also be able to get the relevant exposure by owning gold and timber stocks and reits this was a lesson that david of the yale endowment taught us

a share is more than something that yields dividends it is part ownership of the company and all of its assets if the company were to be liquidated immediately the shareholders would get a proportion of the net value assets liabilities of the company because they own it if a firm is doing well then its assets are increasing i.e. more cash assets from profits therefore the value of the underlying company has risen and the intrinsic value of the shares has also increased the price will not reflect the current value of the firms assets and liabilities because it will also include the net present value of expected future flows working out the expected future flows is a science on par with and reading chicken so do n't expect to work out why a company is trading at a price so much higher than current assets liabilities or so much lower in companies that are expected to fail this speculation is in addition to price speculation that you mention in the question

the problem would not only be that of kyle but also that of american express when kyle pays by credit card american express pays the bills out of their pockets on his behalf and then forwards the bill to kyle the issuer of a credit card takes the risk that the holder of the card wo n't pay the credit card bill in practice there are safeguards in place which prevent a company like ae to pay such huge sums in one day through an automated process credit card companies have sophisticated algorithms to determine unusual spending patterns and block any transactions which appear unusual also after a few billions their bank will likely block them and prevent them from paying any more bills but let 's play along and pretend these safeguards would n't exist that means after kyle 's spending spree american express will be trillions in debt with their main being a 10 year old boy who wo n't ever be able to pay kyle will have to declare personal bankruptcy there are various variants of in the us but they basically all boil down to him paying everything he can pay not much considering that he is 10 and then defaulting on his debt afterwards he is debt free that means the debt is now that of american express american express will not be able to pay that debt with their bank(s either so they will have to declare bankruptcy and default on their debt too this domino effect passes the burden on to the banks which can not carry a trillion level debt either a bank going bankrupt is a serious issue because it means they can not pay back any of the money in the saving accounts hold by companies or private people with them so the problem would return to those people kyle wanted to help in the first place also the collapse of one bank will often result in the collapse of further banks resulting in a collapse spiral destroying the whole world wide finance system nothing would be gained

remind yourself that markets recover usually within a few years if you believe this and can remind yourself of this you will be able to see the down cycles of the market as an opportunity to buy stock on sale no one knows the future so many people have found investing on a regular schedule to be helpful by putting in the same amount of money each period you will end up buying fewer shares when the market is up and more when it is down as long as your time horizon is appropriate you should be able to wait out the ups and downs stocks are volatile by their very nature so if you find that you are very concerned by this you might want to consider whether you should adjust the amount of risk in your investments since over time most people lose money by trying to time the market however if your investment goals and requirements have n't changed there likely is n't any need to change the types of assets you are investing in as what you are choosing to invest in should depend on your personal situation edit i am assuming you want to be a long term investor and owner making money by owning a portion of companies profits and not by trading stocks and/or speculation

for a non technical investor meaning someone who does n't try to do all the various technical analysis things that theoretically point to specific investments or trends having a diverse portfolio and rebalancing it periodically will typically be the best solution for example i might have a long term growth portfolio that is 40 broad stock market fund 40 large industry specific market funds and 20 bond funds   if the market as a whole tanks then i might end up in a situation where my funds are invested 30 market 35 industry 35 bonds   okay sell those bonds which are presumably high and put that into the market which is presumably low   now back to    then when the market goes up we may end up at say in which case we sell some of the broad market fund and buy some bond funds back to   ultimately ending up always selling high whatever is currently the other two and buying low whatever is underperforming    having the industry specific fund(s means i can balance a bit between different sectors maybe the healthcare industry takes a beating for a while so that goes low and i can sell some of my tech industry fund and buy that    none of this depends on timing anything you can rebalance maybe twice a year not worrying about where the market is at that exact time and definitely not targeting a correction specifically   you just analyze your situation and adjust to make everything back in line with what you want this is n't guaranteed to succeed any more than any other strategy is of course and has some risk particularly if you rebalance in the middle of a major correction so you end up buying something that goes down more   but for long term investments it should be fairly sound

i find that hard to believe because when compared to the other engineering professions software is already extremely highly paid the problem is that the tech industry has continued to grow massively since 2001 and yet the number of computer science has dropped precipitously since that time according to the computing research uploads documents resources the number of cs graduates fell by more than half between 2001 and 2009   furthermore the jobless seattle blog for software developers is at 4.4 3.6 for web developers and 3.6 for computer programmers these are well below the national averages   so when companies like microsoft complain that they 're finding a shortage of engineers i 'm inclined to believe them the statistics seem to back it up so for the past decade software engineers have experienced high demand low supply and consistently high pay this leads me to believe that further increasing pay is n't going to help the situation what we need is more investment in stem education which is precisely what this $ 10k per visa fee is supposed to go towards it seems like a pretty good idea to me

i feel like this has nothing to do with income and as such rmds will not really help or harm you after a person passes credit card companies are unlikely to collect any outstanding balance   debts can not be inherited however assets can be made to stand for debts   many assets pass to heirs without the probate process and in some cases all of them pass this way   this leaves creditors with nothing and having to write off the balance even if assets do pass through probate heirs may dispute the creditors   in that case credit card balances may not be high enough justify hiring a lawyer to fight for payment or if they do the judge may be and offer nothing or pennies on the dollar     the bottom line is that they probably see you or your demographic as a poor credit risk and reduced their exposure by lowering your limit   while that is not what they told you they probably have to carefully structure what they say to avoid any discrimination claims

i wrote an article about this a while ago with detailed instructions so i 'll link to it here here 's a about how to use the roth ira loophole and report it properly you do n’t have any traditional rollover ira at all you deposit up to the yearly maximum currently $ 5500 into a traditional ira in your case you re characterized which means you essentially deposited the fact that it lost money may help you later if you have extra amounts in traditional ira you convert your traditional ira to become roth ira $ 5500 change designation from traditional ira to roth ira   you fill irs form 8606 and attach it to your yearly tax return no tax due you have   a fully funded roth ira account if you have amounts in the traditional ira in excess to what you contributed last year it becomes a bit more complicated and you need to prorate see my article for a detailed example on the form 8606 you fill the numbers as they are you deposited to ira 5500 you converted your $ 400 loss is lost unless you have more money in ira from elsewhere if you completely distribute your ira you can deduct the $ 400 on your schedule a if you itemize

tax liability in us you would need to determine if you are a resident alien or non resident alien resident alien are taxed normally as per us citizens for the annual remuneration you have quoted it would be in the range of 25 refer   to determine if you are resident alien or non resident alien you need to be present for certain period in us there is also an exemption even if you meet this you can still be treated as non resident alien if your tax home is outside us india in this case refer to the link for details to determine your category the durations are for number of days in financial year hence it matters when you are in us and the exact durations also note that if you are assessed as resident alien even the income from india will be taxed in us unless you declare there is no income in india tax liability in india the tax liability in india would be depending on your nri status this again is tied to the financial year and the number of days you are in country while the year you are going out of india you need to be away for atleast 183 days for you be are nri so if you are treated as indian resident you would have to pay tax in india on entire income in the worst case depending on the period you travel and the dates you travel you could get classified as citizen in us as well as india and have to pay tax at both places india and us do not have a dual tax avoidance treaty for individuals its there for certain category like small business and certain professions like teacher research etc

the different things in each calculator are showing you a bunch of different things in the roth ira calculator it is comparing what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a roth ira with what you would have in the end with a taxable account i.e. an investment outside of any iras in the traditional ira calculator the ira after taxes shows you what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a pre tax traditional ira the ira before taxes simply shows the same amount before you pay the taxes on withdrawal which is not a useful number so if you want to compare roth ira vs. traditional ira you want to compare the roth ira from the roth ira calculator and the ira after taxes from the traditional ira calculator but there are some things you need to be aware of to make a fair comparison because if you just plug in the same numbers you are going to get a very unfair comparison it will look like roth ira is a lot better even though it 's not the roth ira contribution is after tax whereas a pre tax traditional ira contribution is pre tax and an after tax dollar is much more than a pre tax dollar so if you put in the same nominal contribution amount you are actually contributing much more from your wallet in the roth ira case to make a fair comparison you would need to start with the same pre tax amount and put in a roth ira contribution amount that corresponds to the equivalent amount after taxes so for example a $ 5000 pre tax amount with 25 taxes is equivalent to $ 5000 0.75 = $ so you would put in $ 5000 for traditional ira contribution vs. $ for roth ira contribution note that if you have the same flat tax rate at contribution and at withdrawal pre tax traditional ira and roth ira are exactly the same and you can see this by putting in 25 for the retirement tax rate in the traditional ira calculator we already assumed 25 tax rate for roth ira when calculating the contribution you will see that traditional ira would be better in a lower retirement tax rate e.g. 15 whereas roth ira would be higher in a higher retirement tax rate

some options see if the seller will sell to you on contract   with a significant down payment the seller may be willing to sell you the condo on contract   this fill in the year or so you will probably need to go from contractor to full time employee with enough time on the job to get a mortgage    keep shopping   be up front with the lenders with the problems you are running into and see if any of them can find you a solution   you may need to take a higher rate in the short term but hopefully you can refinance in a few years to a more reasonable rate check with a local bank or credit union   many times local banks or cu 's will finance high demand properties that may be out of favor with the super banks that have no ties to your community   these banks sometimes realize that just because the standard spreadsheet says this is a bad risk the reality is the specific property you are interested in is not the risk that it appears on paper   you will have to find a bank that actually retains its mortgages as many local banks have become agents that just sell mortgages to the mortgage market talk to a realtor   if you are not using one now it may be time to engage one   they can help you navigate these bumps and steer you towards lenders that are more amenable to the loan you need

as others have said if the dealer accepted payment and signed over ownership of the vehicle that 's a completed transaction while there may or may not be a cooling off period in your local laws those protect the purchaser not as far as i know the seller the auto dealer could have avoided this by selling for a fixed price instead they chose to negotiate every sale having done so it 's entirely their responsibility to check that they are happy with their final agreement failing to do so is going to cost someone their commission on the sale but that 's not the buyer 's responsibility they certainly would n't let you off the hook if the final price was higher than you had previously agreed to he who lives by the fine print shall die by the fine print this is one of the reasons there is huge turnover in auto sales staff few of them are really good at the job if you want to be kind to the guy you could give him the chance to sell you something else or perhaps even offer him a $ 100 tip but assuming the description is correct and assuming local law does n't say otherwise if in any doubt ask a lawyer i do n't think you have any remaining obligation toward them on the other hand depending on how they react to this statement you might want to avoid their service department just in case someone is unreasonably stupid and tries to make up the difference that was

as long as you paid 90 of the taxes you owed you are good and there will be no negative consequences these calculations are supposed to help you find the right amount not to bind you to it so you do n't need to worry too much about the most common problem is that people underpay and not come up to the 90 limit and do n't have the cash to pay when tax day comes if you happen to come in under 90 which will come out when you file taxes you will owe interest for the underpayment as you should have paid it some time ago typically 0.5 per month also up to 10 in addition depending on the situation this is expensive so you should avoid it and playing to hit is dangerous better try to hit about 100 and use the 90 limit as safety margin as intended

as dilip said if you want actual concrete based in tax law answers please add the country and if applicable state where you pay income tax also knowing what tax bracket you 're in would help as well although i certainly understand if you 're not comfortable sharing that so assuming the us if you 're in the 10 or 15 tax bracket then you 're already not paying any federal tax on the $ 3k long term gain so purposely taking losses is pointless and given that there 's probably a cost to taking the loss commission sec fee you 'd be losing money by doing so also you wo n't be able to buy back the loser for 31 days without having the loss postponed due to the wash sale that would result state tax is another matter but going by the table in this article even using the highest low end tax rate tennessee at 6 the $ 50 loss would only save you $ 3 which is probably less than the commission to sell the loser so again you 'd be losing money and if you 're in a state with no state income tax then the loss would n't save you anything on taxes at the state level but of course you 'll still be paying to be able to take the loss on the high end you 'd be saving 20 federal tax and state tax using the highest high end tax state california and ignoring because i do n't know whether they tax long term capital gains at the same rate as regular income or not you 'd be saving $ 50 20 + = $ 50 = $ so for taxes you 're looking at saving between nothing and $ and then you have to subtract from that the cost to achieve the loss so even on the high end which means assuming a single filer you 're making > $ 1 million you 're only saving about $ 10 and you 're probably actually losing money so i personally do n't think taking a $ 50 loss to try to decrease taxes makes sense however if you really meant $ 500 or $ 5000 then it might although if you 're in the 10 15 brackets in a no income tax state even then it would n't so the answer to your final question is it depends the only way to say for sure is based on the country and state you 're in calculate what it will save you if anything as a general rule you want to avoid letting the tax tail wag the dog that is your financial goal should be to end up with the most money not to pay the least taxes so while looking at the tax consequences of a transaction is a good idea do n't look at just the tax consequences look at the consequences for your overall net worth

on june 30 2015 the value of a key should be exactly the expected revenue from selling the chest contents owing to the fact that the next day the keys become worthless   looking at the steam community market it seems like the value of a key is higher than this but lower than 2.50   if that 's true then since the price of a key is higher than the expected revenue from selling the chest contents as you say then you can see that at some point the value of a key will have to go down   and as you get closer to the cutoff date the price will fall faster   it 's not quite the same but this pattern is usually what you see in the ticket resale market on say   if there 's something about keys that keeps their worth above the expected value of selling chest contents some value to the flexibility that keys offer over other tradable items maybe then in the short run that wo n't change due to this distant deadline just because it 's so far off   people will still want the flexibility keys offer   orthodox economics might suggest sell sooner rather than later but certainly do n't wait too long   different people react differently though   if there are a lot of people who sell their keys after hearing this news it might be a good time to buy   of course it 's a gamble but if you trust in whatever force keeps keys priced above the expected value of the loot they can buy then that force should win out in the medium term and you could turn a profit

excellent explanation upvote to you sir i would like to add something   how do we know how many bushels of apples is worth a chunk of deer meat    you did not touch on the concept of value   the way i see it value is related to the human energy required to procure a specific good    for example it takes a man all day to find a nugget of gold while it take another man all day to pick 20 bushels of apples because gold is scarce it is worth a lot of apples it has a high value    at it 's core value is assigned based on the amount of human labor required to acquire a good or service    for example many years ago there may have been an equal number of bears and however it would take many brave hunters with and to kill a bear while any hunter could kill a solo thus even though they had the same scarcity a bear hide would be more valuable because the human labor required was greater    many economics classes simply say value depends on supply and demand however if something is in low supply and high demand it is because it takes so much human effort to procure if it did not take large amounts of human labor everyone would sell said item and the value would drop    what is your take on this do you have a better explanation for value

the example you give would clearly be illegal and so unenforceable in court   if a contract contains a clause which is deemed legal but so unreasonable completely unfair it is unenforceable by the court then the court can replace that cause with a more reasonable clause   i think it would be a fairly expensive and likely losing argument to convince a court that this particular contract was unfair   but if you did it would probably mean only a change in the penalty clause to make it reasonable

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

speaking as a cfa charter holder in an alternative asset class the cfa designation is beneficial to any role in finance not only does it provide a framework for understanding economics accounting financial instruments and markets etc the real value to me is the signal it provides to others for me the cfa signals a level of intellectual sophistication and work ethic that employers prospects etc maybe asset management jobs are n't as in demand as previously but i 'm sure a cfa charter holder   has a better chance of finding a retaining that role

i think the math is wrong note that in scenario 1 you are only out of pocket $ 1000 while in scenario 2 you are out of pocket $ 1250   the contribution and the tax you paid with respect to it a better concept than tax rate is retention rate   this is the fraction of your money that the feds let you keep   and growth factor is the how much the investment grows so in scenario 1 you multiply $ 1000 by the investment growth factor and then by the retirement retention rate and in scenario 2 you multiply the same $ 1000 by the current retention rate and then by the growth factor since in your approximation the two are the same there is no saving

one common rule of thumb you can probably get 4 or better returns on your investments typical market rate of return is 8 to allow for inflation and off years figure out what kind of income you will want in retirement and divide by 0.04 to get the savings you need to accumulate to support that    this does n't allow for the fact that your needs are also going to increase with inflation you can make a guess at that and use an inflated needs estimate   not sophisticated   not precise but it 's a quick and dirty ballpark estimate and sometimes it 's surprisingly close to what a proper model would say

assuming you are executing your order on a registered exchange by a registered broker your order will be filled at the best bid price available   this is because brokers are legally obliged to get the best price available for example if the market is showing a bid of 49.99 and an offer of and you submit an order to offer 1000 shares at 5.00 your order will be filled at 49.99   this is assuming the existing bids are for enough shares to fill all of the 1000 shares being offered   if the share you are offering lacks the necessary liquidity to fill the order i.e. the 49.99 bid is for less than 1000 shares and the level two bids are not enough to fill the remaining shares then the order would be posted in the market as an offer to sell the balance 1000 shares filled at 49.99 and those filled at level two bids at 5.00    i 'm pretty sure that the scenario you are describing would be described as market manipulation and it would be against the law

just a quick reminder to everyone    infant mortality rates are actually measured differently from country to country and by measured i mean they have different metrics as to what constitutes as infant mortality    america has the highest degree of scrutiny wherein once the baby is out of the it is now eligible to be counted if it passes dies in almost every other country perhaps all the metrics are given a leeway such as hours days or weeks after   comparing country to country is disingenuous unless you look at how they are actually measured essentially the data would be similar to looking at amount of deaths per county but not taking the per capita so the more populous county looks more dangerous

having just purchased an upcoming samsung phone using their 0 interest i can tell you that the justification is to give you credit i have the same with best buy which is 0 for a specific initial purchase the bank in the samsung case is td bank establishes a credit line for you the apr after is well established at the very high side of nobody in their right mind should want to pay that much interest on any purchase my last car purchase was below 3 apr additionally the introductory rate will still calculate their interest as if it existed since the first day of credit and will be applied to your balance should you ever be late on any single payment at that time the interest is factored in as if it were always there and payments are adjusted accordingly you see the bank wants you to pay their high interest rate so they entice you with the 0 and hope you either finance more on that credit line exempt from the promotional rate or miss a payment and they can hit you with a whammy specifically the question asks how this offer benefits samsung to answer that portion it ensures a sale at full retail price of the phone samsung is just an agent between you and the bank the bank takes on the risk for a potential high reward

personally i solve this by saving enough liquid capital aka checking and savings to cover pretty much everything for six months but this is a bad habit a better approach is to use budget tracking software to make virtual savings accounts and place payments every paycheck into them in step with your budget the biggest challenge you 'll likely face is the initial implementation if you 're saving up for a semi annual car insurance premium and you 've got two months left that 's gon na make things difficult in the best case scenario you already have a savings account which you among your various expenses this does mean you need to plan when it is you will actually buy that shiny new macbook pro and stick to it for a number of months much more difficult than buying on credit especially since these retailers hate dealing in cash

matt levine 's first point here is very interesting as a lens for understanding why so many large hedge funds seem to have difficulty beating the market while the ones that do tend to be either smaller operations or more independent groups within the giants   if you look at the best firms in the world like or you see a trend where they typically stop taking in outside capital and effectively convert to family offices at least for the most profitable strategies levine 's point here is particularly applicable to it has famously incredible returns via medallion but not so much the other funds unsurprisingly the medallion fund is entirely employee and owner capital   as extremely profitable strategies scale up to their capacity constraints fund managers naturally decide to pool greater amounts of their own capital into the firm therefore skin in the game is not only effective as an intuitive heuristic for skill this manager believes in the fund enough to put most of their personal net worth into it but it 's also practically effective for showing how likely the firm is to perform based on how much you 're able to participate   as the percentage of skin in the game increases the likelihood of outside investors being able to participate decreases because the fund managers know they no longer need to share risk and do n't want to waste allocations on the way to capacity constraints if a firm is soliciting capital it 's highly suspect and managers who go on to become the next jim simons or seth klarman will mostly be on the market for relatively short periods of time

i was going to ask do you feel lucky punk but then it occurred to me that the film this quote came from dirty harry is 43 years old   and yet the question remains the stock market as measured by the s&p has returned   compounded over the last 100 years but with a standard deviation just under 20 there are years when you 'll do better and years you 'll lose and i 'd not ignore the last decade which was pretty bad a loss for the decade   there are clearly two schools of thought one says that no one ever lost sleep over not having a mortgage payment the other school states that at the very beginning you have a long investing horizon and the chances are very good that the 30 years to come will bring a return north of 6 the two decades prior to the last were so good that these past 30 years were still pretty good compounded   there is no right or wrong here my gut says fund your retirement accounts to the maximum build your emergency fund you see if you pay down your mortgage but lose your job you 'll still need to make those payments once you build your security think of the mortgage as the cash side of your investing i.e. focus less on the relatively low rate of return 4.3 and more on the eventual result once paid your cash flow goes up nicely    edit in light of the extra information you provided your profile reads that you have a high risk tolerance low overhead no dependents and secure employment combine to lead me to this conclusion at 23 i 'd not be investing at 4.3 i 'd learn how to invest in a way i was comfortable with and take it from there   disclosure updated i am older and am semi retired i still have some time left on the mortgage but it does n't bother me not at 3.5 i also have a 16 year old to put through college but her college account i fully funded

most funds keep a certain amount in cash at all times to satisfy outflows   net inflows will simply be added to the cash balance while net outflows subtract   when the cash gets too low for the manager 's comfort level depends on the typical pattern of net inflows and outflows as well as anticipated flows based on recent performance the manager will sell some of his least favorite holdings and when the cash gets too high he will buy some new holdings or add to his favorite existing holdings   a passive fund works similarly except the buys sells are structured to minimize tracking error

for this the internal rate of return is preferred in short all cash flows need to be discounted to the present and set equal to 0 so that an implied rate of return can be calculated you could try to work this out by hand but it 's practically hopeless because of solving for roots of the implied rate of return which are most likely complex it 's better to use a spreadsheet with this capability such as 's calc the average return on equity is 9 so anything higher than that is a rational choice example using this simple tool the formula variables can easily be input for instance the first year has a presumed cash inflow of $ because the insurance has a 30 discount from $ that is assumed to be otherwise paid a cash inflow of $ 40,000 to finance the a cash outflow of $ 40,000 to fund the a $ 400 outflow for inspection and an outflow in the amount of the first year 's interest on the loan this should be repeated for each year   they can be input as they are for each year and the calculator will do the rest

correcting keith 's answer you should have read about these details in the terms and conditions of your bank broker orders are like a soft limit order and meaningless without a validity which is typically between 1 and 5 days if you buy silver at an price above market price say x when the market offer is m then parts of your order will likely be filled at the market price   for the remaining quantity there is now a limit the bank broker might fill your order over the next 5 days or however long the validity is at various prices such that the overall average price does not exceed x. this is different to a limit order as it allows the bank broker to partially buy silver at higher prices than x as long as the overall averages is x or less   in a limit set up you might be partially filled at market prices first but if the market moves above x the bank broker will not fill any remaining quantities of your order so you might end up after a day or 5 days with a partially filled order also note that an price below the market price and with a short enough validity behaves like a limit price the 4th order type is sort of an opposite side limit price a stop buy means buy when the market offer quote goes above a certain price a stop sell means sell when the market bid quote goes below a certain price paired with the principle this might mean that you buy sell on average above below the price you give i do n't know how big your orders are or will be but always keep in mind that not all of your order might be filled immediately a so called partial fill   this is particularly noteworthy when you 're in a pro rata market

the most important lesson is never lend money to friends unless you are willing to forget the lent amount if the need arises to save your friendship money and relations friendship is a dangerous cocktail your friend may assume as you are his friend he may get lenient treatment while treating the money and if you about the money your friendship may suffer so be careful while lending money to friends if you make up a contract your friend may ask why if he is n't reasonable as you are his friend from personal experience i forget about the lent money but it down somewhere and when i am repaid i strike it off i never discuss about the money or bring it up people do n't like to be reminded by a friend that they owe them money   but refusing also is n't a viable option either you probably have to take a middle path

which hedge fund outperforms consistently year after year   hedge funds are over rated and few truly outperform nor do many actually provide a hedge as they were originally intended to do   some funds have great years but only because most hedge funds take much bigger risks via derivatives and thus they have huge down years as well   btw being very well funded is a disadvantage not an advantage   it 's tremendously more difficult to make large percentage gains on $ 1 billion than it is to make gains on $ 1 million

since you want to know exactly what yield means let 's get all the details of the security down first treasury bills are 0 1 year and do not pay interest coupons the yield comes from buying the t bill at a discount for example you buy a t bill for $ 99 and it pays $ 100 when it matures and the yield over that holding period is when people talk about yield they are generally talking about annualized yield unless stated otherwise   treasury notes are 2 10 years they pay interest semi annually treasury bonds are 20 30 years and they also pay interest semi annually again yield is typically the annualized yield or the two semi annual interest payments added together without compounding these have interest payments so they are typically sold at par they may trade a premium discount afterwards   tips pay a constant coupon rate but the principal is adjusted up and down with inflation

it depends on how long it will take you to pay off the personal loan the rate for the personal loan the refi rate you think you can get how much principal you will have to add to get the refi may have gone up since then since you did not provide all the necessary details the general answer is to sketch out your total payments mortgage + personal loan with and without the refi over the life of the mortgage and see if you end up with more money in your pocket with the refi my overall impression based on the details you did provide is that you will probably find it worthwhile to do the refi

if you want to close the card close it   the impact on your credit score will be minimal if any and the impact on your life will likely be even less   first as you noted the history from your card does not disappear when you close the card it will stay on your credit report for as long as 10 years by that time you 'll have many years of on time payments from your other cards and the loss of this one card wo n't be significant   because the card has a low credit limit it wo n't have much effect on your credit utilization numbers either   finally your credit score might just be high enough that a small drop will have no impact on your financial life whatsoever   in my opinion hanging onto a credit card you do n't want just to try to attain some type of high score is pointless close the card

you may want or at least be thinking of the annualized method described in pub 505 also downloadable in pdf and referred to in why are estimated taxes due early for the 2nd and 3rd quarters only this does n't prorate your payments as such instead you use your income and deductions etc for each of the quarters to compute a prorated tax for the partial year and pay the excess over the amount already paid if your income etc amounts are nearly the same each month then this computation will result in payments that are of 90 of your whole year tax but not if your amounts vary over the year if you do use this method and benefit from it you must file form 2210 schedule ai with your return next filing season to demonstrate that your quarterly computations and payments met the requirements you need to keep good per period or per month records of all tax relevant amounts and do n't even try to do this form by hand it 'll drive you nuts use software or a professional preparer who also uses software but i 'd expect someone in your situation probably needs to do one of those anyway but partnership puts a wrinkle on this as a partner your taxable income and expense is not necessarily the cash you receive or pay it is your allocated share of the partnership 's income and expenses whether or not they are distributed to you a partnership to operate a business like lawyers as opposed to an investment partnership probably distributes the allocated amounts at least approximately rather than holding them in the partnership i expect this is your year end draw technically a draw can be any allowed amount not necessarily the allocated amount in other words your husband does earn this money during the year he just receives it at the end if the year end distribution or allocation if different is significant say more than 5 of your total income and the partnership is not tracking and reporting these amounts promptly for the irs quarters and i suspect that 's what they were telling you affects other partners you wo n't have the data to correctly compute your quarterly taxes and may thus subject yourself to penalty for not timely paying enough if the amount is reasonably predictable you can probably get away with using a conservative high side guess to compute your payments and then divide the actual full year amounts on your k-1 over 12 months for this wo n't be exactly correct but unless the partnership business is highly seasonal or volatile it will be close enough the irs wo n't waste its time on you the quarters are much closer to weeks but it 's months that matter

alright irs publication 463 travel entertainment gift and car expenses business and personal use if you use your    car for both business and personal purposes    you must divide your expenses between business    and personal use you can divide your expense    based on the miles driven for each purpose example you are a sales representative    for a clothing firm and drive your car 20,000    miles during the year 12,000 miles for business    and 8,000 miles for personal use you can    claim only 60 12,000 ÷ 20,000 of the cost of    operating your car as a business expense obviously nothing helpful in the code   so i would use option 1 weight the maintenance related mileage by the proportion of business use   although if you use your car for business a lot and perhaps have a spouse with a car an argument could be made for 3   so i would consider my odds of being audited even lower this year due to irs budget cuts and choose 1 or 3 and of course never throw anything away until you 're room temperature

credit history is local so when you move to the us you start with the blank slate credit history length is a huge factor so in the first year expect that nobody would trust you and you may be refused credit or asked for deposits i was asked for deposits at cell phone company and refused for store cards couple of times my advice get a secured credit card that means you put certain sum of money as a deposit in the bank and you get credit equal to that sum of money and if you have something like a car loan that helps too of course you should n't buy a car just for that but if you 're buying anyway just know it 's not only hurting but also helping when you pay once you have a year or two of the history and you 've kept with all the payments you credit score would be ok and everybody would be happy to work with you in 4 5 years you can have excellent credit record if you pay on time and do n't do anything bad if you are working it the us a lot of help at first would be to take a letter from your company on an official letterhead saying that you are employed by this and that company and are getting salary of this and that that can serve as an assurance for some merchants that otherwise would be reluctant to work with you because of the absence of credit history if you have any assets overseas especially if they are held in a branch of international bank in us dollars that could help too in general do n't count too much on credit for first 1 2 years though you 'd probably could get a car loan for example but rates would be exorbitant easily 10 percentage points higher than with good credit but it will get better soon

i think it is the debate here   the functional use case is that it takes seconds to plug in   even if you added all the time i 've spent on the go charging which is very little then the amount of time i 've spent charging has been less than the amount of time i would have spent filling up on gas over the course of several years   also like i said in the comment this is not just my use case   you can ask other drivers about it the vast majority will say they prefer charging now that they have experienced it   look at volts most of their miles are done on electricity and there are a lot of volt drivers who use the term gas anxiety because they do n't want to fill up with gas so they do everything they can not to let the engine turn on at all   and for another car example tesla installed a battery which made the filling up experience more gas like in that it took minutes and cost about $ 50   nobody used it   they instead plugged in at the free supercharger nearby got out to stretch their legs went to eat lunch and came back to their cars and drove off   heck i 've heard plenty of tesla owners that their car charged too quickly which meant they had to get up in the middle of lunch to go unplug it   very few people will regularly need to charge en route in something like a bolt model 3 or model s.   those very few people who routinely drive 300 miles in a day one way or with very little stop at their destination with which they could charge are a niche customer who does not need to be catered to at this moment in time   however and i get this all the time everyone on reddit thinks they 're part of that niche   on a website full of people who talk about spending all their day on reddit somehow these people get the time to spend driving 400 miles a day   not saying you 're doing that right now but lots of people do it here   of charge events will be normal day to day charges where it takes no time the on the go cases are few and far between   ev motorcycles are pretty reasonably priced but it sounds like you 've probably already done some research on them   check out zero if you have n't heard of them   cool thing about them is the battery is small so you can charge it on in a reasonable amount of time overnight and i 've heard from motorcycle drivers that they even feel more safe on an ev because all those brain cycles you spend on shifting and are freed up to spend on paying attention to the road which is full of cars that are trying to kill you   also the bolt is a fantastic car   highly recommend it   edit oh and with your name you should check out the lightning 's results at 's peak a few years ago   beat the by 20 seconds

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

to me it looks pretty good 10 per year is a pretty good return lagging behind the indexes is normal it is hard to beat the indexes over a long period of time the longer the period the lesser the chances to succeed however half a year is a relatively short period of time and you should check your investments a little bit deeper i 'm assuming you 're not invested in one thing so you should check per investment how it is performing if you have funds check each fund against the relevant index for that fund if you have stocks check against the relevant industry indexes etc also check the fees you pay to each fund and the plan they come out of your pocket lowering the return

with regards to the stock market there are actually two markets involved here primary market value is created in the primary market where capital is exchanged for a residual interest in an opportunity   as a theoretical example if a person operating solo or with a small team were to discover or create a breakthrough product such as an retro aging pill that person likely would n't have the financial means to fully capitalize on his new found idea   others with more capital may also soon discover his idea or improve upon it and exploit it before he has a chance to for a real life example a person studying at a california university during the 1990s discovered a method to index internet webpages and was approached by some students after a talk on the subject   he returned to his native southern europe country seeking funds to develop the web indexing business and failed to do so   two of the students that approached him found capital readily available from investors in their campus sphere their business is today one of the biggest in the world   they had exchanged part of their residual interest for capital to develop their business the primary market of the stock market works mostly same in creating value   it is also dependent upon the secondary market secondary market the secondary market indicates the day to day value of an enterprise   that market allows shareholders to manage their risk appetites and the enterprise 's operators to execute their shareholders interest for gains   in most cases a secondary market reference will be used for pricing a primary market issuance   without that reference capital would be allocated less efficiently creating additional costs for all involved issuers and investors consider what would happen if you sought to purchase a house and the mortgage lenders had no indication what the property was worth   this would make capital very expensive or possibly deny you access to credit   by having an indication all involved are better off   that is value creating there are some large developed economies equity markets such as that in germany where many large enterprises stay privately held and credit financing mostly from banks is used   the approach has proven successful as well so why do some nations financial markets still rely on capricious stock markets when private credit financing may do just fine in many cases   it 's largely a matter of national culture   countries such as the netherlands the uk and the us have long had active equity markets in continuous use that investors have trusted for centuries conclusion when leaders of an enterprise wish to grow the business to a large size with investment from the stock market they are n't limited by the size of their banks capital   those leaders and their prospective investors will rely on the secondary market to determine values   in addition if the leaders raise equity instead of debt capital they are usually accorded more flexibility to take risks since shareholders usually have their own flexibility to transfer those risks to other investors if for any number of reasons they choose to do so stock markets create value in many other ways   the above are the main ways

having lived in a couple of my perspective on this is do apartments gain value or lose value in your area over time i 've lived in areas where the age of the building vs the inflation of home values has meant apartments steadily lose value and in other areas where they keep up with or beat inflation for most of the life of the building   have your real estate agent take a look at the market and see how much a similar apartment in an older building goes for   if it seems like apartments rapidly depreciate then it may be a good time to take a win   if age is n't a huge factor in price then it probably does n't make sense to get rid of a cash generator to put the money into other investments

it depends on the market that you participate in stock markets are not zero sum as joetaxpayer explained on the other hand any kind of derivative markets such as options or futures are indeed zero sum due to the nature of the financial instruments that are exchanged those markets tend to be more i do n't have evidence for this but i believe one of the reasons that investors so often lose their money is psychology the majority of us as humans are not wired to naturally make the kinds of rigorous and quick decisions that markets require especially if day trading some people can invest time and energy to improve themselves and get over that those are the ones who succeed

two points someone has mentioned do n't do the starbucks coffee thing try not to pay for fast food either they might not like you having cooking equipment in your dorm but things like sandwiches and cereal do n't require that and often there is a common kitchen did you know is so cheap it 's basically free also dirt cheap and ridiculously nutritious beans there 's certainly the ramen noodles stereotype but even beyond that if you can learn how to cook a few decent things for yourself you can do quite well oh did i mention rice on a related note skip the bottled water and the sodas especially the sodas which can do you little good snack on vegetables carrots etc they 're not always cheaper than the cheapest of the cheap snacks that exist but they 're actually good for you a big bag of carrots will give you a lot to and is reasonably cost effective besides i know you need more of them in your diet really finally consider a summer job internship not only will it earn you money now but it might land you a much nicer job straight out of college saving you years of earning less this goes triple for anyone studying computer science engineering by the way if that does n't work out consider summer session classes sometimes they can work out cheaper than the regular kind

you have multiple issues buried within this question first we do n't know your tax bracket for my answer i 'll assume 25 this simply means that in 2016 you 'll have a taxable $ 37,650 or higher   the interesting thing is that losses and gains are treated differently a 's long term gain is taxed at 15 yet losses up to $ 3000 can offset ordinary income this sets the stage for strategic tax loss harvesting in the linked article i offered a look at how the strategy would have resulted in the awful 2000 2009 decade producing a slight gain 1 not great of course vs the near 10 loss the s&p suffered over that time this was by taking losses in down years and capturing long term gains when positive and not using a carried loss   back to you a 's long term gain tax is zero so using a gain to offset a loss makes little sense just as creating a loss to offset the gain the bottom line enjoy the loss up to $ 3000 against your income and only take gains when there 's no loss this advice is all superseded by my rule do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog for individual stocks i would never suggest a transaction for tax purposes you keep good stocks you sell bad ones sell a stock to take a short term loss only to have it recover in the 30 day waiting period just once and you 'll learn that lesson learn it here for free do n't make that mistake at your own expense

here 's another thing to consider do you go to a top school if not do you have top grades and the desire to send thousands of cold networking emails to strangers if not and in this economy even if you do fulfill those criteria it will be difficult to break into fields like investment banking and sales and trading which are typically the most desired destinations in finance after college    those jobs can lead to a very financially career in that you can leave after 2 years and work at hedge funds and private equity firms however very few people can get to that point if you 're good at cs you could actually make a lot more money going that route or you could also do a programming job for a financial institution like someone in the comments was talking about which would likely pay well

starting and running a business in the us is actually a lot less complicated than most people think you mention incorporation but a corporation or even an s corp is n't generally the best entity to start a business with most likely you are going to want to form an llc instead this will provide you with liability protection while minimizing your paperwork and taxes the cost for maintaining an llc is relatively cheap $ a year depending on your state and you can file the paperwork to form it yourself or pay an attorney to do it for you generally i would avoid the snake oil salesman that pitch specific out of state llcs nevada delaware etc unless you have a specific reason or intend on doing business in the state   with the llc or a corporation you need to make sure you maintain separate finances if you use the llc funds to pay personal expenses you run the risk of loosing the liability protection afforded by the llc piercing the corporate veil with a single member llc you can file as a pass through entity and your llc income would pass through to your federal return and taxes are n't any more complicated than putting your business income on your personal return like you do now if you have employees things get more complex and it is really easiest to use a payroll service to process state and federal tax with holding   once your business picks up you will want to file quarterly tax payments in order to avoid an under payment penalty   generally most taxpayers will avoid the under payment penalty if they owe less than $ 1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits or if they paid at least 90 of the tax for the current year or 100 of the tax shown on the return for the prior year whichever is smaller even if you get hit by the penalty it is only 10 of the amount of tax you did n't pay in time if you are selling a service such writing one off projects you should be able to avoid having to collect and remit sales tax but this is going to be very state specific if you are selling software you will have to deal with sales tax assuming your state has a sales tax one more thing to look at is some cities require a business license in order to operate a business within city limits so it would also be a good idea to check with your city to find out if you need a business license

i will expand on bacon 's comment when you are married and you acquire any kind of property you automatically get a legal agreement   in most states that property is owned jointly and while there are exceptions that is the case most of the time    when you are unmarried there is no such assumption of joint acquisition   while words might be said differently between the two parties if there is nothing written down and signed then courts will almost always assume that only one party owns the property   now unmarried people go into business all the time but they do so by creating legally binding agreements that cover contingencies   if you two do proceed with this plan it is necessary to create those documents with the help of a lawyer   although expensive paying for this protection is a small price in relation to what will probably be one of the largest purchases in your lives however i do not recommend this   if clayton can and wants to buy a home he should   emma can rent from clayton   that rent could any amount the two agree on including zero   if the two do get married well then emma will end up owning any equity after that date   if they stay together until death it is likely that she or her heirs will own half of it anyway   also if this house is sold the equity pass into larger house they buy after marriage then that will be owned jointly if they do break up the break up is clean and neat   presumably she would have paid rent anyway so nothing is lost   many people run into trouble having to sell at a bad time in a relationship that coincides with a weak housing market   in that case both parties lose    so much like bacon 's advice i would not buy jointly   there is no upside and you avoid a lot of downside do n't play house by buying a home jointly when you are unmarried

if one takes a slightly more expansive view of the word saving to include most forms of durable asset accumulation i think the reason some do and most do n't is a matter of a few factors i will include the three that seem obvious to me education most schools in the us where i live do not offer personal finance courses and even when they do there is no opportunity for a student to practice good financial habits in that classroom setting i think a simple assignment that required students to track every penny that they spend over the period of a few months would help them open their eyes to how much money is spent on trivial things that they do n't need perhaps this would be more effective in a university setting where the students are usually away from home and therefore more responsible for the spending that occurs on their own behalf beyond simple education about personal finances most people have no clue how the various financial markets work if they understood they would not allow inflation to eat away at their savings but that 's a separate topic from why people do not save culture since much of the education above is n't happening children get their primary financial education from their parents this means that those who are wealthy teach their children how to be wealthy and those who are poor pass on their habits to children who often also end up poor erroneous ideas about consumption vs. investment and its economic effects also causes some bad policy encouraging people to live beyond their means and use credit unwisely but if you live in a country where the average person expects to eat out regularly and trade in their automobiles as soon as they experienced their highest rate of depreciation it can be hard to recognize bad financial behavior for what it is collective savings rates reflect a lot of individuals who are each other 's bad behavior discipline even when someone is educated about finances they may not establish good habits of budgeting regularly tracking spending and setting financial goals for me it helps to be married to someone who has similar financial goals because we budget monthly and any major purchases over $ 100 or so must be agreed upon at the beginning of the month with obvious exceptions for emergencies this eliminates any impulsive spending which is probably 90 of the battle for me some people do not need to account to someone else in order to spend wisely but everyone should find a system that works for them and helps them to maintain some financial discipline

companies straddle the line between being public and private given that people in our society are basically required to have jobs to survive and those are largely provided by companies   i do n't think they should be treated exactly the same as a private individual   gt;let the whiny left begin their foolishness   oh wait   you did n't actually want to have a conversation   never mind

your freelance income will not qualify you for the work from home deductions for that you would need a form signed by your employer but you are allowed to be self employed as a sole proprietorship while still being an employee of another company if you take that route you 'll be able to write off even more expenses than those you linked to things like a portion of your internet bill can be claimed for example but note that these deductions would only apply to offset the self employment income so if you 're not earning very much from the freelance work it might not be worth all the hassle filing taxes when self employed is definitely more complicated and many people will get professional tax preparation help at least for the first time

usps is in debt because they have a pension system where they have to guarantee and pre pay pensions for the next x years where x is large   also shipping is part letters and part packages   letters are hard to make profitable   fedex ups and dhl get the sweet deal of shipping mostly packages they pretty much get to only play the profitable part of the game while usps has to play both   they can be competitive since they do n't have the low margin job of shipping letters and in turn they can eat into the profitable part of usps while leaving the unprofitable part untouched

i work in the fsa hsa industry and just wanted to point out that if your wife has a medical fsa you can not contribute to an hsa whether or not you are covered by her medical insurance plan the only exception to this per the rules is if your wife 's employers plan limits the medical fsa benefit to the employee your wife which i can say from experience is extremely rare it 's possible but i 've never personally seen an employer with this in their plan document so better check first to be sure the fsa is restricted to your wife only you have to understand the fsa to know why this is true unless restricted your wife can use her medical fsa for herself her spouse and any tax dependents meaning whether or not she uses the fsa for your eligible expenses you still have 1st dollar coverage from the fsa making you in eligible to open and contribute to an hsa until the end of the plan year and possibly grace period if her employer has one in place and she does not spend her funds by the end of the plan year hope this helps if your still not sure talk to a tax professional which i am not but do advise employers and participants on both hsas and fsas

the logic the interest rate on the mortgage was so low it did n't make sense not to buy is one reason the housing bubble happened the logic was that it made the house affordable even at high prices once the prices collapsed people still had affordable payments but were unable to sell because they were upside down on the mortgage if you can refinance to a 15-year mortgage or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage it can make sense you can save on the monthly payment and on the total cost of the mortgage but do n't buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity these can be false economies or things that ca n't be of course if nobody spends money the economy will stay poor as to hidden details only purchase housing you want to own for the long haul if you expect to flip it in a few years you might not be able to you might end up stuck as a long distance landlord

before investing absolutely follow the advice in mbhunter 's answer there is no safe investment unless you count your mattress and even there you could find or simple inflation taking a chunk out of your change   there is only maximizing your reward for a given level of risk and there is always risk this question should be somewhere on the q&a site for its comprehensive list of sources for information on asset allocation   the tag is also going to have tons of good information for you to answer your question on what slice of the pie is devoted to what you can check out some common portfolios given by u. s. experts for u. s. investors these should be convertible into australian funds another portfolio that is like all those above loosely based on modern portfolio theory for maximizing reward for a given level of risk is the gone portfolio a common denominator amongst these portfolios is that they emphasize index funds over mutual funds for their long term performance and preference lazy management yearly rebalancing is a common suggestion as the maximum level of involvement over active management   you can see more lazy portfolios

one other consideration is that by paying off your mortgage early versus for example investing that capital in a mutual fund is that you are reducing your net liquidity to some degree that is if you find yourself needing an emergency infusion of cash it is easier to sell a stock fund than to sell your house or get a equity loan   i suppose if you were planning to need a lot of cash to start a business or invest in real estate then maybe it would make sense to keep your cash more liquid however in your situation i agree with joe pay it off it feels really good to write that last check

your house is not an asset it is a liability assets feed you eat you robert kiyosaki from a cash flow perspective your primary residence ie your house is an investment but it is not an asset if you add up all the income your primary residence generates and subtract all the expenses it incurs you will see why investment gurus claim this perform the same calculations for a rental property and you 're more likely to find it has a positive cash flow if it has a negative cash flow it 's not an asset either it 's a liability a rental property with a negative cash flow is still an investment but cash flow gurus will tell you it 's a bad investment while it is possible that your house may increase in value and you may be able to sell it for more than you paid will you be able to sell it for more than all of the expenses incurred while living there if so you have an asset   some people will purchase a home in need of repair live in it and upgrade it sell it for profit exceeding all expenses and repeat these people are flipping houses and generating capital gains based on their own hard work in this instance a person 's primary residence can be an asset how much of an asset is calculated when the renovated house is sold

wants a solution so i will provide one the us government should simply cancel the $ 230 trillion in derivative bets declaring them null and void   i proposed this ages ago i do n't really see how they can be anything else but null amp void i can not fathom any court actually being capable of enforcement of these side bets and there are plenty of legal provisions statutory and case law as well as common law principles that could would likely cause them to be unenforceable not to mention bankruptcy proceedings and the fact that gambling has long been considered a prohibited controlled if not criminal activity and with only specific provisional exceptions being enforceable   they are really just self delusional piled upon like children playing and saying i 'll bet you a dollars and then paying it off with check iou 's utter nonsense and some day it will end

does he need to file a tax return in this situation will the irs be concerned that he did not file even if he received a 1099 no however if you do n't file the irs may come back asking why or make up a return for you assuming that the whole amount on the 1099-misc is your net earnings so in the end i suspect you 'll end up filing even though you do n't have to just to prove that you do n't have to bottom line if you have 1099 income or any other income reported to the irs that brings you over the filing threshold file a return
