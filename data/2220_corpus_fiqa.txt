auto loans are secured the car   signature loans from a bank that knows and trusts you are typically unsecured unsecured loans other than informal ones or these are fairly rare most lenders do n't want to take the additional risk or balance that risk with a high enough interest rate to make the unsecured loan unattractive

unsecured loan is any loan that you do n't provide an asset as a collateral for auto loans are usually secured by the auto if you do n't pay off the car it will be repossessed credit cards are a good example personal business loans are also usually unsecured and you 've pretty much covered it majority of loans especially for large amounts are usually given for a specific purpose usually purchase of a large asset and are secured

disclosure was at a financial blogger conference i attended last month i had the chance to briefly meet a couple people from this company also i recognize a number of the names of their financial backers this does n't guarantee anything of course except the people behind the scenes are no the same way prosper and lending club have created a market for personal loans this is a company that offers real estate loans   the too good to be true aspect is what i 'll try to address i 've disclosed in other answers that i have my real estate license earlier this year i sold a house that was financed with a hard money loan not a bank but a group of investors they charged the buyer 10 let me state i represented the seller and when i found out the terms of the loan it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal i felt sick for days after that sale   there are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20 down for 25 the same way there 's a business local to my area that offered a 10 loan is doing something similar but in a crowd sourced way it seems to me that since they show the duration as only 6 24 months the buyer typically manages to refinance during that time i 'm guessing that these may be people who are selling their house but have bad timing i.e. they need to first close on the sale to qualify to buy the new home or simply need the time to get their regular loan approved   as a final side note i recalled the 10 story in a social setting and more than one person responded they 'd have been happy to invest their money at 6 i could have saved the buyer 4 and gotten someone else nearly 6 more than they get on their cash

the standard is actually 30 hours a week over a given period of time 3 12 months of the previous taxable year    the interesting problem for the employer who wants to offer benefits to as few employees as possible is erisa sec 510 according to the above poster companies want to avoid hiring full time positions however based on employer needs only hiring part time workers will not be feasible for many businesses furthermore if employers restrict hours for the purpose of denying access to benefits they may be violating erisa sec 510 which would lead to a major lawsuit for that business as erisa is an opt in class action statute as well as a generous attorney fee statute it 's easier for plaintiff 's lawyers to make the defense pay their legal fees see erisa v. it would be unwise for employers to simply refuse to hire any more full time employees   of course companies will be looking to avoid overpaying for benefits in any way they can but simplistic conclusions such as gave that they will not hire full time workers fails to grasp both the complexity of ppaca and the consequences of a given employer 's actions

you can try paper trading to your investing stocks to invest how much money to allocate and stuff but nothing compares to getting beaten black and blue in the real world when virtual money is involved you may n't care because you do n't loose anything but when your hard earned money disappears or grows no paper trading can those feelings in you so there is no guarantee that doing paper trading will make you a better investor but can help you a lot in terms of learning secondly educate yourself on the ways of investing it is hard work and realize that there is no substitute for hard work india is a growing economy and your friends maybe safe in the short term but take it from any investor not in the long run and moreover as all economies are recovering from the recession there are ample opportunities to invest money in india both good and bad calculate your returns and compare it with your friends maybe a year or two down the lane to compare the returns generated from both sides maybe they would come trumps but remember selecting a good investment from a bad investment will surely pay out in the long run   not sure what you do not understand what buffet says it can not get more simpler than that if you can drill those rules into your blood you may n't become a billionaire but surely you will make a killing but in the long run read and read as much as you can buy books browse the net this might help one more guy like you

from a pure monetary point of view paying 5 to earn 1   does n't make sense though there is also the question of retaining enough immediately available emergency funds which may make the loan worth considering anyway on the other hand if you consider putting the funds into the stock market rather than a bank account you have quite   decent odds of earning more than 5 in that case this becomes an opportunity for leveraged investment i 'm doing exactly that with my mortgage

a stock exchange is a marketplace where people can bring their goods shares to be traded there are certain rules stock exchange does not own any shares of the companies that are trading in   the list of who owns with stock is with the registrar of each company the electronic shares are held by a financial institution securities depository so even if the exchange itself goes down you still hold the same shares as you had before it went down one would now have to find ways to trade these shares possibly via other stock exchange this leaves the question of transactions which again would be recorded and available think of it similar to ebay what happens when ebay goes bankrupt nothing much all the seller still have their goods with them all the buyers who had purchased good before have it when them so the question remains on goods where the buyer has paid the seller and not yet received shipments

whilst it is true that they do not have a conference call every time a rating is produced the parameters of a natural oligopoly do indicate that there are negative effects of too much from the other members of an oligopoly    there are instances of rating agencies moody 's giving lower ratings to punish the issuer for going elsewhere re but usually a slightly lower rating may be acceptable and is usually corrected to be in line with the competitor shortly afterwards the power arguably is with the issuer in this sense because they can take their business to the 3rd member fitch if the rating is too low from one of the big two the preservation of the big two for so long is arguably testament to the s&amp;p and moody 's understanding of these parameters   if the answer is not micromanaging what do you think it is out of interest

yes on taxes it depends on the other point as you already see from ben 's comment if you 're both very western in your culture you may want to consider ben 's advice because while you will save money it may not be considered a healthy way to start a relationship   western culture tends to see marriage as more of a do it for love whereas other cultures may view marriage more pragmatically and take economics and finance as a major consideration for instance a friend of mine married his spouse and it was 100 pragmatic considering taxes and laws driving most of his family insane because it does n't sound very loving these were the exact words   unfortunately this created tension later on because family on both sides kept telling both of them that the other did n't love the partner and they used how their marriage started as proof   as surprising as it is to me non western many americans are horrified at people at the or other pragmatic ways even if it saves them thousands answering questions about relationships is very difficult because often the issue is less about money and more about culture   if you 're both from pragmatic cultures where economics and finance weigh strongly and you do n't see possible issues with family and really be honest on this point then consider the financial advantages

in a comment on this answer you asked   it 's not clear to me why the ability to defer the gains would matter since you never materially benefit until you actually sell but the estate step up in basis is a great point could you describe a hypothetical scenario utilizing a wash sale in a little more detail   this sounds like you still have the same question as originally so i 'll take a stab at answering with an example    i sell some security for a $ 10,000 profit   i then sell another security at a $ 10,000 loss and immediately rebuy   so pay no taxes without the rule   assuming a 15 rate that 's $ 1500 in savings which i realize immediately   next year i sell that same security for a $ 20,000 profit over the $ 10,000 loss basis so a $ 10,000 profit over my original purchase   i sell and buy another security to pay no taxes   in fact i pay no taxes like this for fifty years as i live off my investments and a pension or social security that uses up my tax deductions   then i die   all my securities step up in basis to their current market value   so i completely evade taxes on $ 500,000 in profits   that 's $ 75,000 in tax savings to make my heirs richer   and they 're already getting at least $ 500,000 worth of securities    especially consider the case where i sell a privately held security to a private buyer who then sells me back the same shares at the same price    do n't think that $ 10,000 is enough   remember that you also get the original value   but this also scales   it could be $ 100,000 in gains as well for $ 750,000 in tax savings over the fifty years   that 's at least $ 5 million of securities    the effective result of this would be to make a 0 tax on capital gains for many rich people    worse a poorer person ca n't do the same thing   you need to have many investments to take advantage of this   if a relatively poor person with two $ 500 investments tried this that person would lose all the benefit in trading fees   and of course such a person would run out of investments quickly    really poor people have $ 0 in investments so this is totally impractical

the essential difference b n adr and a common share is that adr do not have voting rights common share has   there are some adr that would in certain conditions get converted to common stock but by and large most adr 's would remain adr 's without any voting rights if you are an individual investor this difference should not matter as rarely one would hold such a large number of shares to vote on general meeting on various issues the other difference is that since many countries have regulations on who can buy common shares for example in india an non resident can not directly buy any share hence he would buy adr thus adr would be priced more in the respective market if there is demand for example technologies an india company has adr on nyse this is more expensive around 1.5 times the price of the common share available in india at current exchange rate thus if you are able to invest with equal ease in hk have broker trading account etc consider the taxation of the gains in hk as well the tax treatment in us for overseas gains then its recommended that you go for common stock in hk else it would make sense to buy in us

you should absolutely have a contract between you and your client stipulating the quid pro of the arrangement they get the product you get the money first off this contract should specify what you must do and what they must do for the contract to be satisfied this is n't necessarily just product for money your client may be under deadlines to approve the product in various stages of work in process depending on the product the client may be required to provide starting materials like existing logos slogans for advertising marketing graphics information on or access to computer systems for software or infrastructure consulting or accounting auditing etc second if you provide a tangible product like graphics or software the contract should clearly state that intellectual property transfers on satisfaction of contract they do n't own what you have made until they have accepted it and paid you accordingly if they try to stiff you by taking what you made them and using it before you 've been paid you can take them to the cleaner 's for copyright violations third you should structure a payment schedule do n't do too much for free you can get the money in thirds for instance a third up front a third at some defined halfway point and a third on final delivery and acceptance lastly you should stipulate that the client is responsible for all expenses incurred by you as a result of their failure to pay as stipulated up to and including attorney 's fees definitely have a lawyer draft these agreements contract law is a many layered area of law with hundreds of years of case law and slightly different nuances in every state a competent lawyer will know things that can and ca n't be stipulated in a contract and if you try to do it alone you 'll wish you had n't when the contract 's tossed out by a judge because of some technicality if they refuse to pay get the lawyer on the phone and file suit a well written contract drafted by a competent lawyer which you have lived up to on your end will give your client no loopholes to slip through as far as recovering damages it should n't matter whether he 's in the u.s. or not if he does business in the u.s. then he very probably has money in banks that have to listen to u.s. courts or at least court orders

update unfortunately citibank have removed the standard account option and you have to choose the plus account which requires a minimum monthly deposit of 1800 sterling and two direct debits absolutely there is   i would highly recommend citibank 's plus current account   it 's a completely free bank account available to all uk residents there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements to maintain   almost nobody in the uk has heard of it and i do n't know why because it 's extremely useful for anyone who travels or deals in foreign currency regularly in one online application you can open a sterling current account and deposit accounts in 10 other foreign currencies when i opened mine around 3 years ago you could only open up to 7 accounts at any one time citibank provide a visa card which you can link to any of your multi currency accounts via a phone call to their hotline unfortunately not online which frequently annoys me but i guess you ca n't have everything   for usd and eur you can use it as a visa debit for usd eur purchases for all other currencies you ca n't make debit card transactions but you can make atm withdrawals without incurring an fx conversion best of all for your case a free usd cheque book is also available you can fund the account in sterling and exchange to usd through online banking   the rates are not as good as you would get through an fx broker like xe.com but they 're not terrible either you can also fund the account by usd wire transfer which is free to deposit at citibank but the bank you issue the payment from will likely charge a swift fee so this might not be worth it unless the amount is large enough to justify the fee if by any chance you have a citibank account in the us you can also make free usd transfers in out of this account subject to a daily limit

the benefit of paying into a pension is that the payment is effectively made from pre tax money either you pay from your own pocket and then you get income tax relief on the payment i.e. your gross salary is reduced by the gross pension contribution and income tax is recalculated with the excess either refunded to you or put in your pension the details are a bit more complicated depending on your marginal tax rate but the end result is the same or your company pays and then you are never charged tax on the payment in the first place from the company 's point of view the two are roughly the same either it pays you who then pays into your pension or it pays straight into your pension either way the money going out from the company is treated as a cost that is offset against the company 's revenue reducing the amount of corporation tax the company has to pay there are some national insurance advantages to paying directly into the pension neither you nor the company gets relief on ni if the payment goes via you but no ni is paid in the first place if it goes direct from the company edit your question is actually worded to suggest that you want to lend your company money from your own pocket and then have that loan directly discharged by the company paying into your pension that 's no different to you just paying into your pension directly and would n't have any better tax implications for the rest of my answer i assume that the idea is actually to lend your company money that it uses to make an immediate contribution to your pension as part of your pay from that company and then the company will repay the loan later by returning the money to you personally your pension and you are two separate entities legally however in your case what you 're proposing is that the company should effectively make a loss paying into your pension it 's going to end up with more costs than revenue so there wo n't be any immediate tax saving because there was n't revenue to pay corporation tax on in the first place you also wo n't save tax because the loan will be made from previously taxed income or whatever   however there will be a tax loss that can be carried forward and offset against future profits so if you expect the company to make money in future to repay the loan you might end up saving some corporation tax you can also sometimes carry a tax loss back one year so if your company had profits last year you could get some corporation tax back immediately the repayment of the loan itself wo n't be subject to income tax as it 's not income so unless you can carry the loss back you wo n't get any immediate tax relief by doing this but it might give you a way to carry forward your annual allowance to future years i.e. use it now and get the tax advantage later however the annual allowance can already be carried forward by up to three years so this is only worthwhile if you expect that future revenue to repay the loan to arrive more than three years later also this is only worthwhile if you 'll continue to max out the annual allowance for paying into your pension in future years otherwise you might as well just make the pension payment using that same revenue in future years however even if this beneficial tax wise i 'm not sure if it 's actually allowed this might be viewed as an artificial transaction to avoid tax and that could lead to hmrc the future tax relief you might need to ask hmrc or an accountant about that if you do make the loan make sure it 's clearly documented so you can show in future why the repayment should n't be treated as income

i held shares in bind a small biotechnology company on the nasdaq that was liquidated on the chapter 11 auction block in 2016 there were sufficient proceeds to pay the debts and return some cash to shareholders with payments in 2016 and 2017 some payments have yet to occur the whole process is counter intuitive and full of both for tax preparation planning and receiving payments landmine 0 some shareholders will sell in a panic as soon as the chapter 11 is announced   this would have been a huge mistake in the case of bind because the eventual liquidation payments were worth 3 or so times as much as the share price after chapter 11   the amount of the liquidation payments was n't immediately because the company 's intellectual property had to be auctioned landmine 1 the large brokerages vanguard fidelity tda and others the distributions to shareholders on form 1099 distributed to both shareholders and the irs the bankruptcy trustee considered this to be their responsibility according to the tax code and to the irs website the liquidation is taxed like a sale of stock rather than a dividend on the shareholder level a complete liquidation can be thought of as a sale of all outstanding corporate stock held by the shareholders in exchange for all of the assets in that corporation like any sale of stock the shareholder receives capital gain treatment on the difference between the amount received by the shareholder in the distribution and the cost or other basis of the stock the distributions as dividends makes them wrongly ineligible to be wiped out by the enormous capital loss on the stock   vanguard 's error appeared on my own 1099 and the others were mentioned in an investor discussion on   however l the bankruptcy trustee stated on twitter that while the payments are not dividends the 1099s were the brokers responsibility landmine 2 many shareholders will wrongly attempt to claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 or they may have failed to understand the law in time for proper tax planning for tax year 2016 it does not matter that the company 's shares were cancelled in 2016   according to the irs website when a shareholder receives a series of distributions in liquidation gain is recognized once all of the shareholder 's stock basis is recovered a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received in particular shareholders who receive the 2017 payment will not be able to take a capital loss for tax year 2016 because the liquidation was n't complete   late discovery of this timing issue no doubt resulted in an end of year of 2016 overall capital gains for many causing a failure to preemptively realize available capital losses elsewhere i 'm not going to carefully consider the following issues which may or may not have some effect on the timing of the capital loss landmine 3 surprisingly it appears that some shareholders who sold their shares in 2016 still may not claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 because they will receive a liquidation distribution in 2017 taken at face value the irs website 's statement a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received appears to apply to shareholders of record of august 30 2016 who receive the payouts even if they sold the shares after the record date   however to know for sure it might be worth carefully parsing the relevant tax code and treasury regs landmine 4 some shareholders are completely cut out of the bankruptcy distribution the bankruptcy plan only provides distributions for shareholders of record aug 30 2016   those who bought shares of afterwards are out of luck landmine 5 according to the discussion on many shareholders have yet to receive or even learn of the existence of a form more secure link showing brokers served here required to accept 2017 payments   to add to confusion there is apparently ongoing legal over whether the trustee is able to require this form worse shareholders report difficulty getting brokers required cooperation in submitting this form landmine 6 hopefully there are no more boom disclaimer i am not a tax professional consult the tax code treasury regulations irs publications when preparing your taxes   they are more trustworthy than accountants or at least more trustworthy than good ones

if you are already invested in a particular stock i like joetaxpayer 's answer think about it as if you are re buying the stocks you own every day you decide to keep them and do n't set emotional anchor points about what you paid for them or what they might be worth tomorrow these lead to two major logical fallacies that investor 's commonly fall prey to loss aversion and sunk cost both of which can be bad for your portfolio in the long run to avert these natural tendencies i suggest having a game plan before you purchase a stock based on on your investment goals for that stock for example a combination of one or more of the following i 'm investing for the long term and i expect this stock to appreciate and will hold it until specific event time at which point i will sell it all sell it gradually over a fixed time period right around the time i need the money i 'm going to bail on this stock if it falls more than x from my purchase price i 'm going to cash out all half some of this investment if it gains more than x from my purchase price to lock in my returns the important thing is to arrive at a strategy before you are invested and are likely to be more emotional than rational   otherwise it can be very hard to sell a hot stock that has suddenly jumped in price 25 because it has momentum gambler 's fallacy conversely it can be hard to sell a stock when it drops by 25 because i know it will bounce back eventually sunk cost loss aversion fallacy   also remember that there is opportunity cost from sticking with a losing investment because your brain is saying i really have n't lost money until i give up and sell it when logically you should be thinking if i move my money to a more promising investment i could get a better return than i am likely to on what i 'm holding

this is great thanks so just assuming a fund happened to average out to libor plus 50 for a given year would applying that rate to the notional value of the index swaps provide a reasonable estimate of the drag an etf investor would experience due to the cost associated with the index swaps   for instance applying this to the hypothetical i linked to in the original question they assumed fund assets of $ 100 m with 2x leverage achieved through $ 85 m of s&amp;p500 stocks $ 25 m of s&amp;p500 futures and a notional value of the s&amp;p500 swaps at $ so the true costs to an etf investor would be expense ratio + commissions on the $ 85 m of s&amp;p500 holdings + costs associated with $ 25 m of futures contracts + costs associated with the $ 90 m of swaps and the costs associated with the $ 90 m of swaps might be roughly libor plus 50

i believe i have to pay taxes in us since it is a us broker no not at all the fact that the broker is a us broker has nothing to do with your tax liabilities you should update the banks and the broker with your change of status submitting form w8-ben to them consult a tax professional proficient with indo us tax treaty as to what you should put in part ii the broker might withhold some of your income and remit it as taxes to the irs based on what you put in w8-ben and the type of income but you can have it refunded if it exceeds your liability by submitting a tax return form you do have to pay tax in india based on the indian tax law for your profits in the us consult with an indian tax accountant on that if i 'm not mistaken there are also currency transfer restrictions in india that you should be aware of

the biggest problem is what happens when you make a withdrawal if an emergency occurs if the money was a contribution from a past year you will not be able to put those funds back into the fund until a later date assume the following scenario the limits regarding maximum annual contribution and windows when you can contribute make this an inefficient way to operate the emergency fund retirement fund   retirement and emergency funds are both important do n't co mingle them it leads to double counting the money when you where you are regarding your financial goals

real interest rates are so low because governments want people to use their money to improve the economy by spending or investing rather than saving their idea is that by consuming or investing you will help to create jobs that will employ people who will spend or invest their pay and so on if you want to keep this money for the future you do n't want to spend it and interest rates make saving therefore you ought to invest that was the why now the how inflation protected securities mentioned in another answer are the least risk way to do this these are government guaranteed and very unlikely to default on the other hand deflation will cause bigger problems for you and the returns will be pitiful compared with historical interest rates so what else can be done investing in companies is one way of improving returns but risk starts to increase so you need to decide what risk profile is right for you   investing in companies does not mean having to put money into the stock market either directly or indirectly through funds although index tracker funds have good returns and low risk the corporate bond market is lower risk for a lesser reward than the stock market but with better returns than current interest rates investment grade bonds are very low risk especially in the current economic climate and there are exchange traded funds etfs to diversify more risk away since you do n't mention willingness to take risk or the kind of amounts that you have to save i 've tried to give some low risk options beyond buy something inflation linked but you need to take care to understand the risks   of any product you buy or use be they a bank account tips bond investments or whatever avoid anything that you do n't fully understand

in finance form is function and while a reason for a trade could be anything but since the result of a trade is a change in value it could be presumed that one seeks to receive a change in value stock company there may have been more esoteric examples but currently possession of a company total ownership of its assets actually is by percentage or a glorified frequently called a share   percentage companies are usually sole proprietorship and partnerships but partnerships can now trade in units   share companies are usually corporations with shares a company can be divided into almost totally indistinguishable units   this allows for more flexible ownership so individuals can trade them without having to change the company contract considering the ease of trade it could be assumed that common stock contract provisions were formulated to provide for such an ease motivation to trade this could be anything but it seems those with the largest ownership of common stock have lots of wealth so it could be assumed that people at least want to own stocks to own wealth shorting might be a little harder to reason but i personally assume that the motivation to trade is still to increase wealth social benefit of the stock market assuming that ownership in a company is socially valuable and that the total value of ownership is proportional to the social value provided the social benefit of a stock market is that it provided the means to scale ownership through convenience speed and reliability

cfd 's are highly speculative so they should represent a very small proportion of your asset or less if you need the 100 for food or rent then definitely not   however if you have some money spare that you could afford to will definitely need more than 100 and you are prepared to put the time and effort it to learn and manage your risks carefully then there is no reason why you should n't try it   i would advise against trading on a demo account for learning most of what you need to learn is how to stick to your plan while under emotional pressure i also would n't call it gambling but managing risk the best traders only win half of their trades so they might have a losing streak of 5 10 or 20 trades if they are trading 5 of their capital with each trade then poof they 're out their winning trades might make 10 100 times the amount risked so they know that it is more profitable to always only risk around 1 sticking to that requires discipline    this page has a pretty comprehensive introduction

banks worry that the large gift might be a loan that is ultimately expected to be repaid if so that affects the cash flow of the recipient and makes it more difficult to make the mortgage payments to the bank   in some cases of course it is an informal loan dad advances a large $ x to son to use as a but does not charge interest and the expectation is that the money will be returned in smaller chunks as and when the son can afford to repay dad    in some cases dad truly means it as a gift but son feels an obligation to repay the money if not explicitly then by paying for the first few months of dad 's nursing home stay etc   so banks like to have an explicit document such as a copy of a letter from dad saying that this money is a gift and some assurance that this is on the up and up    if the amount is larger than the maximum gift that can be given each year without having to file a gift tax return then some assurance that a gift tax return will be filed is helpful mentioning this in the letter is good it indicates that there are no secret or secret agreements to the effect that this is in fact a loan with or without regular repayments

most financial advisors are actually financial product salesmen   their job is to sweet talk you into parting with as much money as possible either in management fees or in commissions kickbacks on high fee investment products which come from fees charged to you inside the investment   this is a cutthroat business for the salesmen themselves   realistically that is how they feed their family and i empathize but i ca n't afford to buy their product   i wish they would sell something else these people prey on people 's financial lack of knowledge   for instance you put too much importance on returns   why   because the salesman told you that 's important   it 's not   the market goes up and down that 's normal   the question is how much of your investment is being consumed by fees   how do you tell that and generally if you 're invested well   you compare your money 's performance to an index that 's relevant to you   you 've heard of   the s&p 500 that 's an index relevant to us investors   take 2015 the s&p 500 was $ on january 2 2015   it was $ on december 31 2015   so it was flat   it dropped 0.7 if your us investments dropped 0.7 you broke even   if you made less that was lost to the expenses within the investment or the investment performing worse than the s&p 500 index   i lost 0.8 in 2015 the extra 0.1 being expenses of the investment try 2013 s&p 500 was $ on december 28 2012 and $ on dec. 27 2013 that 's growth   that 's amazing but it also means is holding even with the market   if your salesman proudly announced that you made 18 problem all this to say when you say the investments performed poorly do n't go by absolute numbers find a suitable index and compare to the index   a lot of markets were down in 2015 16 and that is not your investment 's fault   you want to know if were down compared to your index    because that reflects either a lousy funds manager or high fees    this may leave you wondering where can i invest that is safe and has sensible fees   i do n't know your market but here we have discount brokers which allow self selection of investments charge no custodial fees and simply charge by the trade commonly $ 10   many mutual funds and etfs are index funds with very low annual fees 0.20 1 in 500 or even less     how do you pick investments look at any of numerous books starting with john bogle 's classic common sense on mutual funds book which is the seminal work on the value of keeping fees low   if you need the cool confident professional to hand hold you through the process a fee only advisor is a true financial advisor who actually acts in your best interest   they honestly recommend what 's best for you but beware many commission driven salespeople pretend to be fee only advisors   the good advisor will be happy to advise investment types and let you pick the brand fidelity vs vanguard and buy it in your own discount brokerage account with a password you do n't share frankly finance is not that hard   but it 's made hard by impossibly complex products that do n't need to exist and are designed to confuse people to conceal hidden fees   avoid those products   you just do n't need them   now you really need to take a harder look at what this investment is like i say they make these things unnecessarily complex specifically to make them confusing and i am confused   although it does n't seem like much of a question to me   1.5 a quarter is 6 a year or 60 in 10 years to ignore compounding if the market grows 6 a year on average so growth just pays the fees they will consume 60 of the $ 220,000 or $   as far as the $ 60,000 for that kind of money it 's definitely worth talking to a good lawyer because it sounds like they misrepresented something to get your friend to sign up in the first place   put some legal pressure on them that $ 60k penalty might get a lot smaller    for instance they 'll recommend which has a 5.25 buy in fee front end load and a 1.23 per year fee expense ratio compare to with zero load and a 0.20 fee   that front end load is kicked back to your broker as commission so he literally ca n't recommend there 's no commission his company would and should fire him for doing so

when they make the most money off of charging interest on late payments this is incorrect do you have any data to back this in the past decade there was a tendency by financial institutions to make money from late payments and there were certain rewards incentives for people who paid late however the bubble cracked soon enough and there were huge losses in the card industry today most of the revenue for card companies is from margins on customers who pay on time and growth avenues are promoting to pay every transaction by card why do they actively seek people who pay their bills on time as evidence by requiring good credit scores to get approved for a card instead of they opposite as indicated above remember if one customer defaults it wipes out margins made by tons of customers in spite of giving credit to people with good credit score the average credit card debit an us individual holds is still quite high

comedy answer the mcdonalds corporation thinks about $ 600 or 30 the real answer is whatever you can part with and still have money left over for the rest of your budget   do n't consider your savings consider your monthly income this type of question is exactly why you need a budget   a budget is n't just a tool for getting out of debt it is a tool to help you understand your money and show you how much to spend on stuff so based on your costs utilities food shopping auto expenses savings etc how much is left from your monthly income   that would be what you can afford in rent also please notice that i still suggest you save money each month you have a great habit going and to lose it now would be a shame in my opinion   maybe while you are planning a budget you can start to roughly plan for buying a house or having a new car fund or having a pile of money for starting a family along with an emergency fund and a fully funded retirement    you do n't have to save 2/3 but save a dime of every dollar at least two dimes is better   in the future you will probably find it easier to spend more money rather than less and you will never get back the chance to save

anyone considering this approach needs to talk to a lawyer before going ahead certainly you do n't want to trust anything i say as legal advice as i have no legal training this is not a gift all the cra has to show is that there was a reasonable expectation that the property would be sold and the money returned to the parent that 's obviously the case here in your timeline the evidence is in the two bank accounts after approximately six months as to whether you 'd get away with tax fraud of this nature that depends on how careful the cra is willing to investigate there 's another risk too canada 's at risk of a market correction on real estate prices where prices might drop 20 40 or worse if you are pessimistic that 's speculation of course but such corrections are common place over the long term if you buy a house today with the expectation of improving it and flipping it in six months you run a very real risk of not recovering your initial investment let alone the time and materials invested heck you might not be able to sell the house at all and from the parent 's point of view there 's nothing to be done they ca n't claim this was a gift and now claim any sort of obligation whatsoever the child is n't obligated to sell at a loss and may not be able to sell in any case

since your youtube income is considered self employment income and because you probably already made more than $ 400 in net income after deducting expenses from the $ 4000 you 've received so far you will have to pay self employment tax and file a return   this is according to the irs 's publication 17 2016 your federal income tax so assumes the same rules for 2016 will remain in effect for 2017 you are self employed if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor are an independent contractor are a member of a partnership or are in business for yourself in any other way self employment can include work in addition to your regular full time business activities such as certain part time work you do at home or in addition to your regular job you must file a return if your gross income is at least as much as the filing requirement amount for your filing status and age shown in table 1 1 also you must file form 1040 and schedule se form 1040 self employment tax if your net earnings from self employment excluding church employee income were $ 400 or more or you had church employee income of $ or more see table 1 3 use schedule se form 1040 to figure your self employment tax self employment tax is comparable to the social security and medicare tax withheld from an employee 's wages for more information about this tax see pub 334 tax guide for small business i 'd also note that your predicted income is getting close to the level where you would need to pay estimated taxes which for self employed people work like the withholding taxes employers remove their employees paychecks and pay to the government if you end up owing more than $ 1000 when you file your return you could be assessed penalties for not paying the estimated taxes there is a grace period if you had to pay no taxes in the previous year 2016 in this case that could let you escape those penalties

hmm that does n't quite answer my question sorry if i was unclear let me try   here 's what i 'm asking is the black scholes equation derived using martingale pricing methods e.g. 's theorem the martingale representation theorem and so on equivalent to the equation derived using the method in the 1973 paper e.g. constructing a risk less portfolio and eliminating the drift term i was led to believe that both of these approaches lead to the same   i agree that there 's an enormous difference between equilibrium and arbitrage free term structure models i 'm just not convinced that this is a meaningful difference in the case where market completeness holds e.g. european equity options    as you correctly said it 's generally impossible to a model to get it to match the observed term structure while this is something that can be readily done with a hull white ho lee libor market model hence the prices you get from a will obviously be different from what you get using a hull white since you wo n't be able to match the initial term structure but such a difference does n't hold with a black scholes equation derived using martingale vs. the original method   sorry if this sounds i just want to make sure i 'm understanding these concepts correctly   edit added

that 's true it definitely depends on the temperature   the dew point is the temp at which water or evaporates depending on which way your going on the scale and is dependent on the relative humidity   when relative humidity goes up the dew point goes up   as long as your external body temp skin temp is higher than the dew point the sweat will evaporate   mentioned the heat index being 102 ° f   this would mean you 'd have to get your skin temp higher than 102 ° f which would mean your core temp is even higher dangerously high   this is one of the major advantages of moisture clothing   it removes the sweat from your skin when evaporation is n't good enough and helps cool you faster

it all depends on the country   in the us mobility at the top is reasonably high ie first generation millionaires first generation billionaires etc       in other western countries mobility at the top is very poor   this is typically due to regulation and taxes that make it incredibly difficult for small businesses to be compliant and compete ie hire a bad employee as a small startup and it can cripple the business if you can not easily fire them      mobility at the bottom is reversed    getting out of abject poverty in the us is incredibly difficult almost impossible   in other western countries it is not easy but far easier than the us thanks to those social safety nets

two more esoteric differences related to the same cause when you have an outstanding debit balance in a margin the broker may lend out your securities to short sellers   they may well be able to lend them out even if there 's no debit balance check your account agreement and relevant regulations    you 'll never know this there 's no indication in your account of it unless you ask and maybe not even then if the securities pay out dividends while lent out you do n't get the dividends directly   the dividends go to the person who bought them from the short seller   the short seller has to pay the dividend amount to his broker who pays them to your broker who pays them to you   if the dividends that were paid out by the security were qualified dividends 15 max rate the qualified goes to the person who bought the security from the short seller   what you received were n't dividends at all but a payment in lieu of dividends and qualified dividend treatment is n't available for them    some many   all brokers will pay you a gross up payment to compensate you for the extra tax you had to pay due to your qualified dividends on that security not actually being qualified a similar thing happens if there 's a shareholder vote   if the stock was lent out on the record date to establish voting eligibility the person eligible to vote is the person who bought them from the short seller not you   so if for some reason you really want need to vote in a shareholder vote call your broker and ask them to journal the shares in question over to the cash side of your account before the record date for determining voting eligibility

brokers need to assess your level of competency to ensure that they do n't allow you to bite off more than you can chew and find yourself in a bad situation some brokers ask you to rate your skills others ask you how long you 've been trading it always varies based on broker i use ib and they gave me a about a wide range of instruments my skill level time spent trading trades per year etc   many brokers will use your self reported experience to choose what types of instruments you can trade some will only allow you to start with stocks and restrict access to forex options futures etc until you ask for and for some brokers even pass a test of knowledge options are very commonly restricted so that you can only go long on an option when you own the underlying stock when you are a newbie and scale out from there many brokers adopt a four tiered approach for options where only the most skilled traders can write naked options as seen here it 's important to note that all of this information is self reported and you are not legally bound to answer honestly in any way if for example you are well aware of the risks of writing naked options and want to try it despite never trading one before there is nothing stopping you from saying you 've traded options for 10 years and be given the privilege by your broker of course they 're just looking out for your best interest but you are by no means forced into the scheme if you do not wish to be

i am neither a lawyer nor a tax accountant and if you 're dealing with serious money i suggest you consult a professional but my understanding is if you make a loan at zero interest or at below market rates the irs will consider the difference between the interest that you do charge and the market rate to be a gift that is if someone could get a loan from a bank and he 'd pay $ 1000 in interest for the year but instead you loan him the money as a friend interest free than as far as the irs is concerned you have given him a $ 1000 gift and you could potentially have to pay gift tax or they might the interest to you and tax you on $ 1000 of additional income if you have no agreement on repayment terms if it 's all hey joe just pay me back when you can then the irs is likely to consider the entire loan to be a gift there 's an annual exclusion on gifts i think it 's now $ 13,000 so if you loan your buddy fifty bucks to tide him over until next pay day the irs is n't going to get involved in that they 're worried about more serious money and yes the irs does police loan rates the irs examines exact numbers for all sorts of things if say you go on a overnight business trip and the company gives you $ 10,000 for travel expenses the irs is likely to say that this is not a tax deductible travel expense at all but a sham to hide part of your salary from taxes or if you donate a pair of old socks to charity and declare a $ 500 charitable contribution deduction the irs will say that that is not a realistic value for a pair of old socks and disallow the deduction etc a small discrepancy from market rates can be justified for any number of reasons if the book value of a used car is $ 5000 and you sell it to your neighbor for $ 4900 the irs is unlikely to question it there are any number of legitimate business reasons why you had to give a discount to make the sale but if you sell it to him for $ 50 they may declare that this is not a sale but a gift etc

as an addition to chris rea 's excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they do n't now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if there 's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings

well it certainly has the first mover advantage i imagine tesla has become pretty efficient in its production of electric cars and they are continuously driving down costs as production expands tesla is gaining economies of scale allowing it to produce electric vehicles for much cheaper than any other company might do with its patents i think it would be difficult for new entrants to achieve the same quality and cost that tesla does even if they are using tesla 's patents    furthermore tesla and electric vehicles have become synonymous if someone is going to buy an electric car the first thing they are going to think of is tesla owning a tesla has become and will likely continue to be a bit of a status symbol and because of that i think they will probably always have the dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and will likely be able to charge premium prices that competitors might not be able to justify similar to the way that despite the ubiquity of smartphones apple has a dominant position and an ability to charge premium prices largely because apple kind of drove the smartphone revolution    tesla wants the electric car market to grow as quickly as possible the more money automobile manufacturers pour into electric cars the less they will spend on cheaper fossil fuel vehicles secondly as more companies start producing electric vehicles more people will end up owning one hence more infrastructure will be built to support those people making owning an electric car a lot easier hence increasing the value of a tesla making electric cars accessible to the mainstream public is tesla 's ultimate goal because they know they will likely always have the lion 's share of that industry

the contract is not very clear as much as i can understand it will still help if you make part prepayments in an rule 78 or actuarial method the schedule is drawn up front and the break up of interest and principal for each month is calculated ahead at the beginning both the reducing balance method as well as actuarial method will give the same schedule   however in actuarial method if you make part prepayments they get applied to the future principals the interest are ignored however the future interests are not reduced example say your schedule looks something like this monthly payments say 100 month | principal | interest 1 | 10 | 90 2 | 20 | 80 3 | 30 | 70 4 | 40 | 60 5 | 50 | 50 6 | 60 | 40 7 | 70 | 30 8 | 80 | 20 9 | 90 | 10 so lets say you have made 3 payments of 100 in the 4th month if you make 150 in addition to 100 it would get applied to the principal of 4th 5th and 6th month so essentially you would save interest of 4th 5th and 5th month it would also reduce the total payments to 6 i.e. you will only have 7th 8th 9th due the next payment you make of 100 will get applied to row 7 the disadvantage of this method over reducing balance is that the interest calculated for rows do n't change compared to reducing balance however if you prepay in full the unearned interest is calculated and returned as per the actuarial tables

this scheme does n't work because the combination of corporation tax even the lower tax plus the personal income tax does n't give you a tax advantage not on any realistic income i 've ever worked it out on anyway   prior to the 2014 tax year on lower incomes you could scrape a bit of an advantage but the 2013 budget changed the calculation for the tax credit on non eligible dividends so there should n't be an advantage anymore moreover if you were to do it this way by paying corporation tax instead of cpp you are n't eligible for cpp if you sit with a calculator for long enough you may figure out a way of saving $ 200 or something small but it 's a lot of paperwork for little if any benefit and you would n't get cpp i understand the money multiplier effect described above but the tax system is designed in a way that it makes more sense to take it as salary and put it in a tax deferred saving account i.e. an rrsp so there 's no limit on the multiplier effect like i said sit with a calculator if you 're earning a really large amount and are still under the small business limit it may make more sense to use a but that is the case regardless of using it as a tax shelter because if you 're earning a lot you 're probably running a business of some size the main benefit i think is that if you use a you can carry forward your losses but you have to be aware of the definition of an allowable business investment loss

i thought the finance buff made a pretty solid argument for a financial advisor the other day but 1.5 is too expensive the blog post at finance buff suggests several alternatives he also has the great suggestion to use vanguard 's cheap financial planning service if you go with vanguard a lot of investing advice fails to consider the human factor sure it 'd be great to rebalance exactly every 6 months and take precisely the amount of risk to theoretically maximize returns but yeah right it 's well known that in the aggregate individual investors go to cash near market bottoms and then buy near market tops it 's not that they do n't know the right thing to do necessarily it 's just that the emotional aspect is stronger than any of us expect you should n't rely on sticking to your investments any more than you rely on sticking to your diet and exercise program the theoretically optimal solution is not the real world people are involved optimal solution my own blog post on this suggests a balanced fund rather than a financial advisor but i think the right financial advisor could well be a better approach http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ anyway i think people are too quick to think of the main risk as volatility and to think of investing as simple sure in theory it is simple but the main risk is yourself fear at market bottoms greed at market tops laziness the rest of the time so there 's potential value in taking yourself out of the picture the human part is the part that is n't simple on whether to get a financial advisor in general not just for investments see also what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

it depends on the business entity if the entity is a sole proprietorship or a general partnership the individual are considered to be the business there are no shares and so yes the owner would have to take on 75 of the expenses for example in the event of a lawsuit if the claimant were awarded $ 1,000,000 the 75 partner would be personally liable for $ 750,000 in the event of a corporation there are shares so the responsibility is on the management of the company not the owners to come up with money for the expenses of the business that money can come from the business capital which is the money owners have put in basically for a corporate entity the owner is not responsible for 75 of expenses for a partnership yes they are

yes and no any great idea excluding new technologies discoveries usually involves a trade off good ideas taken to their extremes usually are   i 've generally worked in the open communication environment musk describes for most of my career for 25 years and i 've seen where it works and where it does n't and what musk 's email misses is where it does n't work it is a good starting   for one thing there need to be filters a vp director senior manager ceo or other higher up can not deal with 1000 emails per day for ideas criticisms etc he does mention avoiding chit chat but employees with good ideas for technology or business do not see their suggestions as chit chat most actual good ideas from juniors are too low level for senior management such as different platforms coding methods etc most ideas that senior management are needed like company direction organization etc require a sophisticated knowledge and experience of business contracts etc most of the junior ideas i 've seen including my own were bad ideas that came from lack of experience in business   or take some new hr policy imagine the thousands of direct responses of people straight to hr on the policy that would grind things to a halt the whole purpose of direct managers and supervisors is to filter information down up and sideways so that other people can do their jobs   you do n't want to have high value people knowledge experience spending their day dealing with emails and other people 's ideas you want them providing that value to the business so you need filters people who can recognize the good from the bad and pass on the bad that could be direct managers at the employee 's side or it could be administrative help at the department 's side either way it 's necessary to be efficient   then there 's the problem of including all stakeholders if you are junior and work out a solution to a problem with a junior in another problem but in implementing it you break a whole system which i 've seen happen you 've just caused a lot of harm to the organization neither of you may fully understand the implications of your solution on other things people with responsibility for those things need to be included in the discussion and take responsibility for any implementation   i hate bureaucracy and sometimes it can be a major inefficiency and for getting simple and obvious things done but bureaucracy can also improve efficiency and value and a lack of it can be i 've seen marketing and sales people continually take engineers off of important development work in order to build demos for potential new clients all of which failed to materialize why because the marketing and sales people were chasing leads for contracts without any review of the technical solution the ideal one what the solution to the customer needs really involves what was needed to improve efficiency was a bureaucratic process that reviewed the market opportunities with the technical offerings of the company and either reject opportunities early on or plan and schedule how best to chase the leads   in my experience what works best in most cases is open communication but clear guidelines a on what is appropriate or not to go direct b that the communications are about ideas only and coming up with solutions and c that actions or implementations require bringing the chain of command into the loop for comment or objection before doing anything   complaining to management is n't usually of much value and does n't change much but identifying the problem that is part of the complaint identifying a workable solution with stakeholders and asking for permission via the chain of command is usually a good way to get things done without creating the problems of a free for all

but is the money saved taxable not sure i understand the question if say you have salary of rs 5 lacs after paying taxes and expenses lets say you save rs 1 lacs if you keep this 1 lacs in savings account you will get interest if this interest is less than rs 10,000/- it is not taxable if it is more that rs 10,000 then the additional amount is taxable i.e. if you get a savings bank interest of rs the difference rs 15,000 minus rs 10,000 i.e. rs 5000 is taxable note if you keep the 1 lacs in fixed deposits then all interest even if you get rs 1 is taxable edit if you invest the rs 1 lacs in tax saving fd lock in period of 6 years then yes you can claim deduction under section 80c.

when you are starting out using a balanced fund can be quite advantageous a balanced fund is represents a diversified portfolio in single fund the primary advantage of using a balanced fund is that with it being a single fund it is easier to meet the initial investment minimum   later once you have enough to transition to a portfolio of diversified funds you would sell the fund and buy the portfolio with a custom portfolio you will be better able to target your risk level and you might also be able to use lower cost funds   the other item to check is do any of the funds that you might be interested in for the diversified portfolio have lower initial investment option if you can commit to adding money on a specified basis assuming that you are able to also there might be an etf version of a mutual fund and for those the initial investment amount is just the share price the one thing to be aware of is make sure that you can buy enough shares that you can rebalance holding a single share makes it hard to sell some gain when rebalancing i would stay away from individual stocks until you have a much larger portfolio assuming that you want to invest with a diversified portfolio the reason being that it takes a lot more money to create a diversified portfolio out of individual stocks since you have to buy whole shares with a mutual fund or etf your underlying ownership of can be fractional with no issue as each fund share is going to map into a fraction of the various companies held and with mutual funds you can buy fractional shares of the fund itself

yea but they might feel and that you pulled a fast one on them and not be as willing to give you good deals in the future    like as a totally non mathematical example they have a car for $ 50k they lower the price to 40k with a financing that will bring total payment to 60k their break even on that car is let 's say 45k the financier cuts them a commission on expected profits of maybe 7k they made an expected 2k on the car but if you pay it all off asap they may lose that commission be 5k in the hole on the sale and pretty upset even more upset if they finance in house    so when you go back to buy another car they 'll say fuck this guy we need to recoup past lost profits do n't go below 4 k above break even    i 'm not really 100 on how financing workings when it comes to cars but from my background in sales this is the bar i would set for a customer that made me take a loss by doing business with them if they tried to come back in the future   this does n't take into account how car dealerships do n't own their inventory finance all of their cars and actually are willing to take a loss on a car just to get it off the lot some times

if i do n't need this money for decades meaning i can ride out periodical market crashes why would i invest in bonds instead of funds that track broad stock market indexes you would n't   but you can never be 100 sure that you really wo n't need the money for decades   also even if you do n't need it for decades you can never be 100 certain that the market will not be way down at the time decades in the future when you do need the money   the amount of your portfolio you allocate to bonds relative to stocks can be seen as a measure of your desire to guard against that uncertainty i do n't think it 's accurate to say that the general consensus is that your portfolio should at least be 25 in bonds   for a young investor with high risk tolerance many would recommend less than that   for instance this page from t. rowe price suggests no more than 10 bonds for those in their 20s or 30s basically you would put money into bonds rather than stocks to reduce the volatility of your portfolio   if you care only about maximizing return and do n't care about volatility then you do n't have to invest in bonds   but you probably actually do care about volatility even if you do n't think you do   you might not care enough to put 25 in bonds but you might care enough to put 10 in bonds

i 'll take a stab at this question and offer a disclosure i recently got in ring 5.1 asx rio and   while i wo n't add to my positions at current prices i may add other positions or more to them if they fall further   this is called catching a falling and it 's a high risk move cons let 's scare everyone away pros the ecb did n't engage in as much qe as the market hoped and look at how it reacted especially commodities   consider that the ecb 's actions were tighter than expected and the fed plans to raise rates or claims so   commodities should be falling off a cliff on that news while most american western attention is on the latest news or entertainment china has been seizing commodities around the globe like crazy and the media have failed to mention that even with its market failing china is still seizing commodities   if china was truly panicked about its market it would stop investing in other countries and commodities and just bail out its own country   yet it 's not doing that   the whole china crisis is completely oversold in the west china is saying one thing oh no but doing another using its money to snap up cheap commodities capitalism works because hard times strengthen good companies   you know how many bailouts has received compared to goldman sachs   you know who owns more real wealth   oil does n't get bailed out banks do and banks ca n't innovate to save their lives while oil   hard times strengthen good companies   this means that this harsh bust in commodities will separate the winners from the losers and history shows the winners do very well in the long run related to the above point how many bailouts from tax payers do you think mining companies will get   zero   at least you 're investing in companies that do n't steal your money through government confiscation if you 're like me you can probably find at least 9 people out of 10 who think investing in miners is a very bad idea   what do they think is a good idea   duh snapchat and twitter   then there 's the old saying be greedy when everyone 's fearful and fearful when everyone 's greedy finally miners own hard assets   benjamin graham used to point this out with the dead company strategy like finding a used cigarette with one more smoke   you 're getting assets cheap while other investors are overpaying for stocks hoping that the fed qe   think strategy here seize cheap assets begin limiting the supply of these assets if you 're the saver and not borrowing then watch as the price begins to rise for them because of low supply   remember investors are part owners in companies take more control to limit the supply   using graham 's analogy stock pile those one puff cigarettes for a day when there 's a low supply of cigarettes many miners are in trouble now because they 've borrowed too much and must sell at a low profit or in some cases must lose   when you own assets debt free you can cut the supply   this will also help the federal reserve who 's been desperately trying to figure out how to raise inflation   the new patriotic thing to do is stimulate the economy by sending inflation up and limiting the supply here is key

other people have pointed this out but there are a few considerations in whether you should do a roth or traditional ira such as one of the major arguments for using a traditional ira is that you can at least in theory afford to contribute more money initially than you 'd be able to afford if you were using a roth ira while this is in theory true i 'm not at all convinced that using a traditional ira will actually cause people to contribute more to it realistically how many people will actually contribute say $ 500 more to their ira because they knew that their contribution for this year will save them $ 500 to know if this is the case consider the last time that you actually invested some of your tax refund in your retirement account i have n't seen any actual statistics on this but i 'm guessing that very few people do this please see other people 's answers for details on the mathematics behind that the second argument for contributing to a traditional ira is if you expect your future income tax rate to be lower than your current tax rate for some reason e.g. due to a change in government policy e.g. replacing income taxes with value added tax or something like that the fact that you 're doing the contribution relatively close to when you 're planning on withdrawing it etc please see this question for more discussion about this keep in mind that while a traditional ira saves you tax money this year a roth ira saves you money when you withdraw it so it 's not really a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now or $ 5000 later it 's a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now vs. for example $ 50,000 later or however much the money 's grown by the time you withdraw it maybe the traditional ira is still worth it though if there are changes to tax policy or you end up with a lot more money in your traditional ira due to being able to contribute more

in some sense the share repurchasing program is better if the company does not foresee the same profit levels down the road   paying a dividend for several years and then suddenly not paying or reducing a dividend is viewed as a slap in the face by investors   executing a share repurchase program one year and then not the next is not viewed as negatively from an investor 's standpoint i would say a dividend is preferred over a share repurchase program for a similar reason   typically companies that pay a dividend have been doing so for quite some time and even increasing it over time as the company increases profits   so it can be assumed that if a company starts paying a dividend it will do so for the long run

what you 're thinking of is more market making kind of activity hft algo 's thrive on this having information faster than anyone else this type of activity could also likely be lumped into what is considered top down analysis as opposed to bottom up which is what most mutual fund equity research involves again the more important aspect is what does the company you are applying to use   top down analysis means that you are forecasting the revenue drivers for a company using macro economic analysis for example let 's say i 'm investing in chinese cement manufacturer 's what implications does chinese interest rate policy have on infra structure expansion and how does that drive revenue for this specific company i might then look at margins etc to get an eps estimate part of this could fall into secular   investing too let 's say i like lcd panel glass because of this consortium i might take a look at 5 companies and then find the ones i think would benefit most from this the problem with top down is it tends not to be as much of a deep dive and its hard to pick individual companies because of it bottom up tends to be more analytical and is what most pitches would be based around the most important thing i 'm not saying one is right or wrong they are just different and every investor has their own style   bottom up analysis which would be closer to what an equity research analyst would be doing on the sell side is analyzing what bottom line indicators drive revenue and how are those expanding for example lets say i 'm looking at search providers i.e. google yahoo etc i 'd be looking at cost per thousand clicks and number of clicks on the website multiply the two and i get revenue very simplified version for clicks business i might then also forecast other revenue driving segments and try to understand how they are growing pricing at an individual segment level i.e. business services or mobile advertising i 'd then break down costs margins for each segment and forecast those out i could then get a forward eps get a range of multiples i believe it could trade in i.e. i think the multiple will trade up down to get a target price also i would likely do a dcf analysis on forward earnings to get a fair market value and then try to a price i would also be looking at stuff like management teams and industry trends too but bottom line i 'm pitching a company because i think it is undervalued and will outperform competitors in the long this type of work tends to be more research oriented and is what most not all mutual funds use when analyzing companies since mutual funds tend to have longer holding periods 2 10 years as opposed to short term it 's harder to justify investing in a company only because it has a short term catalyst anecdotally it 's also easier to present in a written thesis because the numbers tend to be more concrete and easier to forecast than top down which have wider target ranges   your thought process that catalyst + industry context = market beating returns is n't wrong it 's just that every company thinks about investing differently and it 's important to tailor the report to that group 's style

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

not charging taxes on a money losing investment or business is much more than humanitarian it is common sense in general money that is used to invest has already been taxed as income or inheritance to the person making the investment so taxing that money again not just the profit would provide a disincentive for people to invest which would be bad for economic growth over the medium and long term as far as taxing a money losing businesses goes most businesses do n't make money in their couple of years and adding further tax burdens would be counter productive because it would provide a major hurdle for people wanting to start a business other have already mentioned that the money losing operation likely paid indirect taxes as well small businesses provide a majority of the economic growth and innovation so in short additional taxes on money losing investments and businesses would be both foolish and shortsighted

yea i pretty much the same but i 'd argue that if you play a record in a room with large speakers then you can get some or feedback effects on the actual turntable and/or needle       this can be annoying or pleasant depending on what kind of music you are playing of course but i kind of like when it happens at bass or lower mid range frequencies     of course this all depends on size and shape of the room volume the music is played position of the speakers what kind of furniture the actual turntable is on     it 's kind of similar to how different kick drum setups can sound different very different rooms well smaller rooms at least you do n't as interesting and effects as the space gets large with drums

say the company has created 500 shares or whatever number you have 10 shares equivalent of 2 now when new capital is needed generally more shares are created say they create 100 more shares and sell it to venture capital to raise funds after this happens total shares 500 + 100 = 600 you own 10 shares your ownership = down from 2 like wise for other older shareholder the new venture guy gets of ownership    more funds would mean more growth and overall the value of your 10 shares would be more depending on the valuation

when you refinance there is cost guess around $ to cover lawyers paperwork surveys deed insurance etc etc etc someone has to pay that cost and in the end it will be you even if you get a no points no cost loan the cost is going to be hidden in the interest rate that 's the way transactions with knowledgeable companies works they do business because they benefit profit from it the expectation is that what they need is different from what you need so that each of you benefits but when it 's a primarily cash transaction you ca n't both end up with more money so unless value will be created somewhere else from the process and do n't include the + cash because that ends up tacked onto the principle this seems like paying for financial entertainment and there are better ways to do that

if you place your emergency fund in your tfsa you can withdraw it at any time e.g. in an emergency and then replace the withdrawn money in the next calendar year be careful there you pay a hefty fine if you replace it in the current calendar year if this leads to an overcontribution it 's not an either or thing though you could invest the money in a mutual fund inside your tfsa i strongly recommend against this for your emergency fund however the whole point of an emergency fund is that you may need it immediately so keep it in an investment that you can liquidate quickly cash or very near cash while i obviously do n't know your specific situation i needed $ 10,000 within 24 hours and another $ 10,000 within two weeks during an emergency in a world where you have large sums of money you 'd max out your rrsp and tfsa with investments and keep your emergency fund outside of both but most of us are n't in that situation in that case it makes sense to use your tfsa for your emergency fund i use some of my tfsa space for my emergency fund savings account paying low interest though people often like gics and some for investment passive indexed stocks and bonds note that you need to pay taxes on your savings account interest too if held outside your tfsa and rrsp accounts

gt;because something is legal does n't make it the ethical choice   you fail to demonstrate what is unethical about minimizing tax burdens    making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region   did the corporations have an option to refuse using that infrastructure and instead provide their own or work with others to develop a competing infrastructure    in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind   you have failed to support any argument that there is anything wrong with minimizing tax burden   gt;if i 'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $ 100 bill without noticing i can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally but its hardly the moral thing to do   a more relevant example is if i order a pizza have it sent to your house then show up later with a bill for the pizza and my costs to send it to you demanding you pay it you never asked for the pizza maybe you did n't want the pizza maybe you did n't eat the pizza maybe you do n't like pizza or do n't like that kind of pizza that i choose to send you a pizza does not you to pay for that pizza

the risk besides the extra interest is that you might be upside down on the loan because the car loses value the moment you drive off the lot the slower you pay it off the longer it takes to get the loan balance below the resale value of course if you have a significant down payment the risk of being upside down is not as great even buying a used car does n't help because if you try to sell it back to the dealer the next week they wo nt give you the full price you paid some people try and split the difference get the longer term loan but then pay it off as quickly as the shorter term loan yes the interest rate is higher but if you need to drop the payment back to the required level you can do so

b. 's answer is good but there 's an important note to consider for tax purposes   it 's too large for a comment so i 'm adding it as an answer and that is you can not claim the property as a rental property under certain conditions   this affects things like claiming mortgage interest which you do n't have and depreciation in value which a rental is allowed see irs topic for details but i 've included an important excerpt below with emphasis added if you rent a dwelling unit to others that you also use as a residence limitations may apply to the rental expenses you can deduct you 're considered to use a dwelling unit as a residence if you use it for personal purposes during the tax year for more than the greater of      a day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that it 's used by talk to a tax accountant to better understand the ramifications of this but it 's worth noting that you ca n't just rent it to her for a paltry sum and be able to take tax advantages from this arrangement

i moved from contributing 10 to maxing as my salary rose over the course of three years after graduation   because of my raises my monthly take home still increased so it was a pretty painless way to increase my 401(k contribution and also avoid lifestyle inflation that said i would not do it if you have any credit card debt school loans or an auto loan   pay that off first   then work on maxing the 401(k   personally i rate owning a home behind that but that 's partially because i 'm in an area where the rent ratios are barely on the side of buying so i do n't find buying to be a pressing matter one thing to investigate is if your company offers a roth 401(k option   it 's a nice option where you can go roth without worrying about income limits   my personal experience does not include a roth ira because when i still qualified for one i did n't know much about them and now that i know about them i have the happy issue of not qualifying

there is a distinct difference between having a degree and being genuinely smart and business savvy if you 're genuinely smart and business savvy you could theoretically break into the business world with no degree and make a decent salary the trouble there is that many people are n't smart and business savvy until they get a degree   on the other hand it 's very possible to get a degree and be completely oblivious about how to conduct your career poor resume interviewing skills no business sense etc in that case an mba might not be totally useful but probably still will be to a degree however if you are smart about how you conduct your career an mba should help you immensely

what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor the first priority is an emergency fund one of the largest expenses of poor people are short term loans for emergencies being able to avoid those will likely be more lucrative than an s&p investment remember just like a loan if you use your emergency fund you 'll need to refill it be smart and pay yourself 10 interest when you do it 's still less than you 'd pay for a payday loan and yet it means that after every emergency you 're better prepared for the next event to get an idea for how much you 'd need you probably own a car how much would you spend if you suddenly had to replace it that should be money you have available if you think must buy a new car better have that much available if you can live with a you 're still going to need a few k.   having said that the next goal after the emergency fund should be savings for the infrequent large purchases the emergency fund if for the case where your car unexpectedly gets totaled the saving is for the regular replacement again the point here is to avoid an expensive loan   paying down a mortgage is not that important mortgage loans are cheaper than   car loans and much cheaper than payday loans still it would be nice if your house is paid when you retire but here chances are that stocks are a better investment than real estate even if it 's the real estate you live in

yes maybe for themselves but for you that depends on quite a number of things but not all advisors are scum but accept the fact that you are their cash cow and you are there for their some advisors are true to their professions and advise ethically trying to get the best for their clients so search for a good advisor rather than a cheap one and regarding the mortgage you are talking about the mortgage provider and the mortgage taker do n't deal directly but use their solicitors every party wants the least of legal hassles for their transactions and get the best legal help the financial advisor maybe both rolled into one or he has legal practitioners in his firm who would do the legal job after he takes care of the financial matters seems a cost effective workshop

starting with small amount of money is definitely a good idea as it is a fact that majority of the online traders lose their initial investment no wonder that for example in the uk fca decided to make steps to raise the chances of clients staying in business by limiting leverage to and trading leveraged products is risky and you will lose some or all your money with very high chance but that does n't mean necessarily it is a bad investment to trade on your own imagine you have a $ 1000 account and you trade max lot fx position at once maximum = $ 10.000 position size that is 1:10 leverage max beginner steps are very challenging and exiting but turning back to your initial question is there a better way to invest with a small amount of money obviously you could purchase a cheap etf that follows a broad market index or an already existing successful portfolio

my figuring and i 'm not an expert here but i think this is basic math is let 's say you had a windfall of $ 1000 extra dollars today that you could either a. use to pay down your mortgage b. put into some kind of equity mutual fund maybe you have 20 years left on your mortgage   so your return on investment with choice a is whatever your mortgage interest rate is compounded monthly or daily   interest rates are low now but who knows what they 'll be in the future   on the other hand you should get more return out of an equity mutual fund investment so i 'd say b is your better choice except but that 's also the other reason why i favour b over a.   let 's say you lose your job a year from now   your bank wo n't be too lenient with you paying your mortgage even if you paid it off quicker than originally agreed   but if that money is in mutual funds you have access to it and it buys you time when you really need it   people might say that you can always get a second mortgage to get the equity out of it but try getting a second mortgage when you 've just lost your job

the equity you have is an asset locked away until you sell and sometimes pledged as a loan if you wish the idea that it 's dead money is nonsense it 's a pretty illiquid asset that has the potential for growth at the rate of inflation or slightly higher long term and provides you an annual dividend in the form of free rent   in this country most people who own homes have a disproportionate amount of their wealth in their house this is more a testament to the poor saving rate than anything else for me a high equity position means that i can sell my home and buy a lesser sized house for cash i am older and my own goal with the mrs is to have the house paid and college for the kid fully funded before we think of retiring for others it 's cash they can use to rent after they retire i hope that helped there 's nothing magic about this just a lot of opinions

leveraged etf 's are killer to hold because they seek to return some multiple of the daily price movement in an index so seeks to return 2x the daily move in the russell 2000 let 's trace this out assuming just to make it easy large daily moves and that you start with $ 1000 and the russell 2000 starts at 100 start of first day 2000 = = 100 you have $ 1000 end of first day up 10 nice 2000 = = 110 you have $ 1200 end of second day down russell 20000 = = 100 you have $ so the russell 2000 can move nowhere and you have lost money this does n't apply to all etf 's just leveraged etf 's   you would be better buying more of a straight inverse etf and holding that for a longer time if you wanted to hedge

if you are struggling with debt and can not realistically pay your debts off with your current level of income these businesses offer for a fee to negotiate with your debt providers a sum that you can realistically afford to pay the debt providers will consider the offer because they would rather get some money back rather than nothing as these are usually unsecured loans for you it can be a better deal than going bankrupt or trying to struggle endlessly to pay off something you ca n't afford to pay off note that even though you wo n't be bankrupt you will be treated by lenders very similar to being bankrupt in other words it will be very hard for you to get new loans in the near future

i think the dividend fund may not be what you re looking for you mentioned you want growth not income but i think of dividend stocks as income stocks not growth they pay a dividend because these are established companies that do not need to invest so much in capex anymore so they return it to shareholders in other words they are past their growth phase these are what you want to hold when you have a large nest egg you are ready to retire and just want to make a couple percent a year without having to worry as much about market fluctuations the etf you mentioned and other small caps are i think what you are after i recently made a post here about the difference between index funds and active funds the difference is very small that is in any given year many active etfs will beat them many wo nt it depends entirely on the market conditions at the time under certain conditions the small caps will outperform the s&p definitely however under other conditioned such as global growth slowdown they are typically the first to fall based on your comments like how you mentioned you do nt want to sell i think index funds should make up a decent size portion of your portfolio they are the safest bet long term for someone who just wants to buy and hold that s not to say they need be all do a mixture diversification is good as time goes on do nt be afraid to add bond etfs either this will protect you during downturns as bond prices typically rise under slow growth conditions and sometimes even under normal conditions like last year when tlt beat the s&p

to some extent i suppose most people are okay with paying some taxes but as they teach in intro to economics decisions are made on the margin few are honestly expecting to get away with paying no taxes at all they are instead concerned about how much they spend on taxes and how effectively the classic defense of taxes says roads and national defense and education and fire safety are all important this is not really the problem that people have with taxes people have problems with gigantic ongoing infrastructure that cost many times what they were projected to cost a la boston 's big dig while the city streets are n't properly paved people do n't have big problems with a city run garbage service they have problems with the who get six figure salaries plus a guaranteed union protected job for life and a defined benefit pension plan which they do n't contribute a penny to and likewise for their health plans people do n't have a big problem with paying for schools they have a big problem with paying more than twice the national average for schools and still ending up with miserable schools new jersey people have a problem when the government issues bonds invests the money in the stock market for the public employee pension plan projects a 10 annual return contractually guarantees it to the employees and then puts the taxpayers on the hook when the dow ends up at 11,000 instead of california and people have a problem with the attitude that when they do n't pay taxes they 're basically stealing that money or that tax cuts are morally equivalent to a handout and the that they 're terrible people for trying to keep some of their money from the government

you have no guarantees the stock may last have traded at $ 100 so the market price is $ 100 but is currently in free fall and nobody else will be willing to buy it for any more than $ 80 or heck maybe nobody will be willing to buy it at all at any price or maybe trading on this stock will be halted remember the market price is just what the stock last traded at if you put in a market order you are ordering your broker to sell at the best available current price assuming someone 's willing to buy your stock that means you 'll sell it but if it last traded at $ 100 this does n't guarantee you 'll sell at anything close to that

the first thing you need to do is to set yourself a budget total all your money coming in from jobs allowances etc and all your money going out including rent utilities loan repayments food other essential and the luxuries   if your money coming in is more than your money going out then you are onto a positive start if on the other hand your money going out is more than the money coming in then you are at the beginning of big trouble you will have to do at least one of 2 things either increase your income or reduce your expenses or both you will have to go through all your expenses money going out and cut back on the luxuries try to get cheaper alternatives for some of your essential and get a second job or increase your hours at your current job the aim is to always have more money coming in than the money you spend the second thing to do is to pay off any outstanding debts by paying more than the minimum amounts and then have some savings goals you said you wanted to save for a car that is one saving goal another saving goal could be to set up a 6 month emergency fund enough money in a separate account to be able to survive at least 6 months in case something happened such as you lost your job or you suddenly got sick next you could look at getting a higher education so you can go out and get higher paying jobs when you do get a higher paying job the secret is not to spend all your extra money coming in on luxuries you should treat yourself but do not go overboard increase the amounts you save and learn how to invest so you can get your savings to work harder for you building a sound financial future for yourself takes a lot of hard work and discipline but once you do get started and change the way you do things you will find that it does n't take long for things to start getting easier the one thing you do have going for you is time you are starting early and have time on your side

when you set up a short sale for equities you are borrowing stock from someone else typically another client at the broker   the broker usually an agreement to let your shares be borrowed for short sales in your account details   so if client a wants to short a stock he borrows stock from client b to do the short sale it 's usually not this direct as they can borrow from many clients   if client b then wants to sell his shares if the broker ca n't shift around assets to find another client 's shares to let client a borrow then he has to close the short position out because he does n't have the shares in the brokerage to let client a borrow to short anymore

i struggle to see the value to this risk from the standpoint of your mother in law   this is not a small amount of money for a single person to lend to a single person ignoring your personal relationship    right now using a blended rate of about 8 and a 5 year payment period your cost on that $ 50,000 is somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 11,000 with a monthly payment around $ using the same monthly payment but paying your mil at 5 you 'll complete the loan about 3.5 months sooner and save about $ 5,000 she will make about $ 6,000 in interest over 5 years against a $ 50,000 outlay alternatively you can just prioritize payments to the more expensive loans   it 's difficult to work out a total cost comparison without your expected payoff timelines and you 're currently paying toward all the loans   i 'm sure a couple hours with a couple of spreadsheets could yield a plan that would net you a savings substantially close to the $ 5,000 you 'd save by risking your mother in law 's money a lot of people think personal lending risk is about the relationship between the people involved but there 's more to it than that it 's not about you and your wife separating it 's not about the awkward dinner and conversations if you lose your job   something might physically happen to you you could become disabled or die   right now that 's an extremely diversified and calculated risk taken by a gigantic lender unless your mother in law is very wealthy this is not nearly enough reward to assume this sort of risk in my opinion   her risk far outpaces your potential five year savings if you wanted to pursue this as a means of paying interest to a family member rather than the bank i 'd only borrow an amount i budgeted and intended to pay within this single year   say $ 10,000 against the highest interest loan

if it 's feasible try to get one card down to zero balance and preferably one of your cash back cards   then keep that at zero every month pay it off in full and use it for your purchases as you describe above the idea would be to get it so that you are not paying interest on your month to month purchases   this not only reduces the 20 or whatever that you 're paying on that balance but also the 20 or whatever you 're paying on those purchases remember a card you carry a balance on charges you interest on those purchases from the current month if this is n't feasible if these are all very high balance cards then i suppose the way you 're currently doing it would be okay though i think you 're overthinking things to some extent but with 80 interest if that 's a significant pile of money you may need to as clearly that needs to be tackled first   i think it 's mostly better for you to pay your day to day stuff out of pocket and not use your cards the way you are suggesting but with the 80 you may need to the reason i say it 's better not to use your card the way you suggest is that it is difficult to do properly and never get it wrong i.e. never go over a balance and it 's also leaving you in the habit of using credit   it does n't help you budget necessarily either   instead set up a fully developed budget that includes all of those minimum payments and pay them   certainly once you have the > 50 debt handled i would switch to this method not using credit cards at all

as a rule of thumb no   only in very rare circumstances will it prove better than a rrsp   the media has overplayed the usefulness of this account type for retirement savings   that 's just a general rule   your specific situation will make a difference but it 's very easy to show that rrsps will always outperform if the marginal rates are lower on withdrawal than when you deduct contributions from income if you plan to use the money before retirement or you 're expecting to collect on retirement then you may need to look at the specifics of your situation   if you plan to put money in a rrsp and carry forward the deduction to use at a later date then it does n't matter whether you put it in a rrsp now or use the tfsa and transfer it later the rrsp also has advantages of some tax treaties and creditor protection   it as a can also be used after 65 for income splitting and the pension credit an resp can also provide a greater return as you get free money which is always good   there are many other things you can do with it but i 'd say it 's always better in a tfsa than paying tax in a regular account    since you pay the mortgage with after tax dollars that could be another option for the cash and it 's a guaranteed return albeit small nowadays

dealerships make a lot of money in the finance department   one of the thing they play upon is your emotional reaction of purchasing a new vehicle new to you in this case   they perform all sorts of shenanigans like adding selling gap insurance or extended warranties   they entice you with a promise of a lower interest rate but really what they are trying to do is back you into a payment    so if you can fiance 20,000 but the car you are buying is 16,000 then they will try to move that figure up to the 20 k mark   in your case it sounded like some borderline at the least illegal activity they used to fool you into paying more   it sounds like you regret this decision which puts you a step ahead of most   how many people brag about the extended warranty or gap insurance they got included in the sale    as mentioned in another answer the best bet is to go into the dealership with financing in place   say you were able to get a 3 loan on   the total interest would be   if you avoid the finance room you might avoid their dubious add ons that would probably cost you more then the 1600 even if you can get 0    if you are going to buy a car on time my advice would be to not fill out a credit app at the dealership   the dealership people through a fit but hold your ground   if need be get up and walk out   they wo n't let you leave one thing i must mention is that one feels very wealthy without that monthly pain in the payment for a car   you may want to try and envision yourself without a car payment and make steps to making that a reality for the rest of your life

to begin with bear in mind that over the time horizon you are talking about the practical impact of inflation will be quite limited inflation for 2017 is forecast at 2.7 and since you are talking about a bit less than all of 2017 and on average you 'll be withdrawing your money halfway through the overall impact will be < 1.3 of your savings you should consider whether the effort and risk involved in an alternative is worth a few hundred pounds if you still want to beat inflation the best suggestion i have is to look at peer to peer lending that comes with some risk but i think over the course of 1 year it 's quite limited for example zopa is currently offering 3.1 on their access product and are offering 2.9 on the everyday product both of these are advertised as instant access albeit with some caveats these are n't fscs guaranteed bank deposits and they do come with some risk firstly although both and zopa have a significant level of provision against bad debt it 's always possible that this wo n't be enough and you 'll lose some of your money i think this is quite unlikely over a one year time horizon as there 's no sign of trouble yet secondly there 's liquidity risk although the products are advertised as instant access they are actually backed by longer duration loans made to people who want to borrow money for you to be able to cash out someone else has to be there ready to take your place again this is very likely to be possible in practice but there 's no absolute guarantee

prop 13 's benefit to the rich is incidental and frankly minimal    check out these maps that i grabbed from a title records   i searched for data on single family homes that were purchased ergo assessed value is based on between 1900 and 1980   arbitrary but it 'll do for our purposes   i 'd speculate that if i were to have picked 1970 or earlier the number of homes that are assessed at far below market value is negligible relative to the tax base as a whole     here 's island   the peninsula in beach   the san francisco bay area   and a in area of the bay   if a parcel is outlined in green it 's assessed based on a purchase date prior to 1980   outlined in white means after 1980   in my eyes the big takeaway is that the number of homes which were purchased prior to 1980 is minimal   even in the bay area where the out view suggests that there 's a lot of those homes when you zoom in and realize how densely populated the area is not very many homes are assessed on outdated values   for example on the map the number of homes purchased was 47   was 179   the search shows a total of single family residences in the map area     you can argue that it 's a dumb tax policy but as social policy i do n't have an issue with it and i 'd still contend it 's largely negligible   it 's a battle that does n't matter   a when compared to 1031 exchanges basis step ups the massive decline in personal income taxes for the upper brackets etc     our tax policy as a whole is skewed and becoming more regressive or to the gop fair all the time     not entirely unrelated but i did some research and played with some numbers about income taxes because it 's something that interests me     using this link you can see that $ 10,000 income in 1950 which is about $ 100,000 in 2016 dollars was taxed i 'm using married filing separately throughout    20 on the first $ 2,000 22 from $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 26 from $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 30 from $ 6,000 to $ 8,000 34 from $ 8,000 to $ 10,000   the highest marginal tax rate was 91 which applied to all income over $ 200,000 just over $ 2,000,000 in 2016 dollars    median household income in 1950 was $   so the median american paid a maximum marginal tax of $ 22   if you do the math our median household pays of its income in taxes versus for the $ 10,000 income household     fast forward to 1970 where our $ 10,000 cpi adjusts to $ and median household income is now $    14 on first $ 500 15 from $ 500 to $ 1,000 16 from $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 17 from $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 19 from $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 22 from $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 25 from $ 6,000 to $ 8,000   the highest marginal tax rate has dropped 23 to 70 from 91 and our median american is paying a maximum marginal tax rate of 25     skip forward to 2010 where our $ 10,000 cpi adjusts to $ and median household income is now $     10 on the first $ 15 from $ to $ 34,000 24 from $ 34,000 to $ 28 from $ to $ 33 from $ to $ 35 above that   the highest marginal tax rate has dropped another 50 from 70 to 35 and a total of 62 from the 1950 rate     of course this is all skewed because the more income you make the better able you are to shelter income from taxes   a family making median income is unlikely to be able to take significant advantage of tax shelters

gt i will need to see sources but actually they are claiming that it is on every stock bond or derivative    let me know when you find a source for this claim    gt that is clearly not the same as i did n't ask to be born   true however only if you are taking action to change the condition that you are against just saying i did n't ask for to be born into this just rings hollow in my ears voting is definitely more productive running for office to push the ideas would do even more heading out to open land to make your society in your image would definitely prove your point as long as it works    gt i love how you assume that it takes a government to have a stable civilization   i do n't assume we only have some 10,000 years of recorded history to provide some backup for the statement and not saying that this form of government is perfect we just have plenty of evidence that no government is less so    gt the only infrastructure i truly need to trade stock now is my computer made by a private business my electricity provided to me by another private business and my internet connection   that is not true lets go beyond the invention of internet it exists and it provides us with the ability to trade stock so lets pretend that it always existed so and ignore the billions of investment in infrastructure and r&amp;d it took to get her on commercial as well as governments part so the inference that you made is all you need to trade is your computer electricity and the internet all provided by commercial entities no need for government    yes and no how long do you think that electricity would keep pumping if there was no one to regulate how much each district gets to pull if there was no one to enforce pricing and payment after all if the electricity company cuts power to a house and they just run out to the box and hot wire their own connection who stops them if there is no government that how do we keep people paying and when the electricity company decides that they   are going to artificially jack up prices enron style who keep them based in reality do we just wait for a violent uprising    gt however statistics ca n't help us in this case    true do you have any examples of innovation in highly unregulated markets i still have n't seen or heard of what the ideal market would look like just lots of rhetoric about the problems with this one    gt there are a lot of examples like the f-35 fighter jet that cost american taxpayers nearly $ 1.5 trillion   that would be a corporation that won the right to build the next evolution of the fighter jet by under bidding the cost and having all kinds of cost not to mention scope creep from the customer i.e. yes we want it to do everything we asked for in the rfp but we also want it to cook coffee doing 5 keep in mind that the f-35 was a between government and commercial so not a very good example about how government is bad at stuff because commercial is also involved granted also not a good example of how government is good at stuff there is definitely lots of examples of pork in government    and as for the $ 6.5 trillion if i remember correctly it was n't that it disappeared it was that it was n't recorded correctly much of that money is not actual money it was double triple quadruple counted because the accounting error was n't caught early and there were thousands of people involved in this situation but again an example of how government is n't good at everything    course i could always point to a topic near and dear to your heart and talk about how a single person caused a $ 16b to put that in perspective that is $ 16b caused by one person much bigger than $ 25,000 per person or how a single tweet erased $ does one fake tweet cause a stock market in a days time the markets are not exactly perfect either of course you could always say it is an example about how government is imperfect at regulating either and we would both be right    the civil society is not a new topic or approach i just do n't think i have seen any examples of one that succeeded mankind always seem to into some form of structure when presented with chaos what that structure looks like is not always good and not always bad i think how ours has formed is pretty good although i do agree it could be better

the statement is in terms if not in real terms correct most credit cards i know this to be true for visa and mastercard have dispute processes and will do a chargeback on the merchant ie take the money back from the supplier in cases where you do n't receive the goods or other fraud particularly if they ca n't produce a signature and for transactions which are not face to face a tracking number your exact rights will vary by bank but mostly they need to follow the guidelines set by the credit card company and you do need to be a bit careful if you received goods which were fake or a dispute arises you may be up for shipping the goods back to the merchant and you have a limited but reasonable time in which to make the dispute the statement the money is the banks is not technically true there is no money involved until you pay it only credit they are very different but almost no one knows that i communicated with a minister of finance on the topic but this is quite technical and as a layman not something you need to worry about here

i 've been down the consolidation route too of a handful of dc pensions the db ones i 've not touched and you would indeed need advice to move those around what you should be comparing against is what 's the cheapest possible thing you could be doing   online platform list will give you an idea of sipp costs if your pot is big enough and you 're a buy and hold person flat fee model means costs can become arbitrarily close to zero percent and if you 're happy to be invested in something like vanguard target retirement or vanilla index trackers then charges on those will be something like   savings of 0.5 1.0 per year add up over pension saving but only you can decide whether whatever extra the adviser is offering vs. a more diy approach is worth it for you are you absolutely sure that 0.75 pa fee is n't on top of whatever charges are built into the funds he 'll invest you in   for the £ 1000 fee advisers claim to have high costs per customer because of regulatory burdens this is why there 's talk of an advice gap these days if you only have a small sum to invest the fixed costs of advice become   imho are still quite expensive for what they offer too although still probably cheaper than any advised route

from getting rid of pmi per the federal homeowners protection act you can ask that your pmi be canceled when you 've paid down your mortgage to 80 of the loan if you have a good record of payment and compliance with the terms of your mortgage you make a written request and you show that the value of the property has n't gone down   what 's more when you 've paid down your mortgage to 78 of the original loan the law says that the lender must automatically cancel your pmi so in this case to prove it has n't gone down an appraisal is in order but all of this does n't answer the question the pmi is a separate line item once it 's removed your total monthly payment drops you are welcome to keep it in and indicate it should be a prepayment of principal if that 's your wish but that 's up to you it 's not automatic   in researching this the first time i ran into an article how to calculate pmi costs in which an example is given where a 91 ltv $ 200 k loan has a pmi cost of $ so the impact of not having that extra $ 20 k or so is to pay what amount to an extra 5 on the last $ 20 k of the loan the pmi does n't scale over time when you are $ 10 k away from 80 ltv you still pay the $ 1k yr for this reason if you absolutely must go over 80 ltv i 'd suggest shopping for a bank that will permit the excess to be a home equity loan   at least the payoff of that 2nd loan in totally in your control

1 how does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation and at worst it should be viewed as a liability and has no place alongside other real investments periods of high inflation are generally accompanied with interest rates any home is a liability as has been pointed out in other answers it costs money to live in it costs money to keep in good shape and it offers you no return unless you sell it for more than you have paid for it in total in fact as long as you have an outstanding mortgage it actually costs you money to own even when not considering things like property taxes utilities etc the only way to make a home an investment is to rent it out for more than it costs you in total to own but then you ca n't live in it instead 2 how should one view payments on a home mortgage how are they similar or different to investing in low risk low reward investments like joetaxpayer said in a comment paying off your mortgage should be considered the same as putting money into a certificate of deposit with a term and return equivalent to your mortgage interest cost adjusting for tax effects what is important to remember about paying off a mortgage besides the simple and not so unimportant fact that it lowers your financial risk over time is that over time it improves your cash flow if interest rates do n't change unlikely then as long as you keep paying the interest but do n't pay down the principal assuming that the bank is happy with such an arrangement your monthly cost remains the same and will do so in perpetuity you currently have a cash flow that enables you to pay down the principal on the loan and are putting some fairly significant amount of money towards that end now suppose that you were to lose your job which means a significant cut in the household income if this cut means that you ca n't afford paying down the mortgage at the same rate as before you can always call the bank and tell them to stop the extra payments until you get your ducks back in the proverbial row it 's also possible with a long history of paying on time and a loan significantly smaller than what the house would bring in in a sale that you could renegotiate the loan with an extended term which depending on the exact terms may lower your monthly cost further if the size of the loan is largely the same as or perhaps even exceeds the market value of the house the bank would be a lot more unlikely to cooperate in such a scenario it 's also a good idea to at the very least aim to be free of debt by the time you retire even if one assumes that the pension systems will be the same by then as they are now some do n't but that 's a completely different question you are likely to see a significant cut in cash flow on retirement day any fixed expenses which can not easily be cut if needed are going to become a lot more of a liability when you are actually at least in part living off your savings rather than contributing to them the earlier you get the mortgage paid off the earlier you will have the freedom to put into other forms of savings the money which is now going not just to principal but to interest as well what is important to consider is that paying off a mortgage is a very illiquid form of savings on the other hand money in stocks bonds various mutual funds and savings accounts tends to be highly liquid it is always a good idea to have some savings in easily accessible form some of it in very low risk investments such as a simple interest bearing savings account or government bonds despite their low rate of return before you start to aggressively pay down loans because particularly when you own a home you never know when something might come up that ends up costing a fair chunk of money

this depends in part on who officially owns the account federally 529 plan contributions are not tax deductible regardless of ownership   anyone can contribute to a 529 plan though the earnings of the 529 plan are tax deferred and are tax free if they are used for qualified educational expenses in the state of new york the account owner is entitled to deduct up to 10,000 married filing jointly from their state taxes however that 's limited to the account owner only   if they 're not in the state of new york they may be able to have similar benefits from their home state check their rules you may have multiple accounts for one child though so if you and they both want to contribute for your child that 's perfectly fine the limits are at the taxpayer level so you can deduct $ 10k for all contributions to all children 's accounts in sum 5k per kid if you have 2 and want to contribute equally for example but they can do the same gift tax is the other relevant thing to consider   you can contribute $ 14k per year without either paying gift tax or adding it to the lifetime maximum which is currently $ but could change at any time either up or down   you can also make a one time contribution of 70k 5 years worth and have that amount exempt as if it were contributed over five years for more information on all of this see the new york 529 page for more details

the only problem that i see is that by not giving the 20 right away you might need to pay pmi for a few months in addition in the case of conventional loans i heard that banks will not remove the pmi after reaching 80 ltv without doing an appraisal in order to be removed automatically you need to reach 78 ltv   finally i think you can get a better interest by giving 20 down and you can get a conventional loan instead of a fha loan which offers the option to avoid the pmi altogether on fha you have two one upfront and one monthly and the monthly one is for the life of the loan if you give less than 10

it would depend on a ones view on markets and b ones nature if one believes that the market would be going up in the near future then it would be best to buy all at once if one believes the market is uncertain it would make sense to invest over a period of time if one is a disciplined investor and can stick to plan it would make sense to invest over a period of time as the risk is generally less how much less is again subjective if one is not a disciplined investor then buying now and getting done with is a good idea    as to exactly quantifying this is absolute number for future would not be possible one can take the data from past however it would work advantages if the prices moves up and disadvantages if the price moves down

first if your stock is trading at $ 1 and you transfer the 5000 shares in kind to your tfsa on august 2 2011 you are deemed to have disbursed that stock in your assumed non registered account this may have tax consequences depending on the of the original purchase as for your tfsa overcontribution you will only have to pay the 1 monthly penalty on the value of the overcontribution i.e. $ 5000 you will pay for each month the overcontribution exists regardless of what the value of the assets end up being thus you 'll pay a $ 250 penalty for an overcontribution life of 5 months the stock price could go to $ 2 or $ 0 but you 'll pay a fixed tax of $ 250 for the value of the initial overcontribution see these articles at the cra website for more information tax payable on excess tfsa amount and examples tax payable on excess tfsa amount

as out by inflation figures are almost always quoted as a comparison of prices last month and prices a year ago last month   so 10 inflation in august means that things cost 10 more than they did in august a year ago   this can lead to some perverse conclusions consider an imaginary economy where prices stay constant over years   annualized inflation is zero then something happens on january 2nd 2018   some crop fails a foreign cheap source of something becomes unavailable whatever   prices rise permanently as more expensive sources are used this is the only disruption to prices nothing else goes wrong so in february 2018 the authorities find that prices in january 2018 rose by 1 over january 2017 inflation politicians pontificate economists wring their hands etc in march again prices for february 2018 are found to be 1 higher than for february 2017   more this goes on for months   every month inflation year over year is unchanged at 1   everyone has a theory as to how to stop it finally in february 2019 there 's a change   prices in january 2019 were the same as in january 2018   zero inflation   everyone takes credit for bringing down inflation

if the buyer exercises your option you will have to give him the stock   if you already own the stock the worst that can happen is you have to give him your stock thus losing the money you spend to buy it   so the most you can lose is what you already spent to buy the stock minus the price the buyer paid for your option if you do n't own the stock you will have to buy it   but if the stock skyrockets in value it will be very expensive to buy it   if for instance you buy the stock when it is worth $ 100 sell your covered call and the next day the stock shoots to $ 1000 you will lose the $ 100 you got from the purchase of the stock   but if you had used a naked call you would have to buy the stock at $ 1000 and you would lose $ 900 since there is no limit to how high the stock can go there is no limit to how much money you may lose

we have a lot of debt at this point i do n't even know how much this is your problem find out and while you 're at it find out how much income you have and also what your total expenditures are you seem to be facing up to the problem but not looking it in the eyes you just need to take some time and a little to get all your financial documentation together and lay it all out so you know what your situation actually is its not hard to do this get a box and put all old bills and statements in that you can find and at the end of a month pick them out and write down the totals then work out your income and all that you 've spent that month this is known as a statement of affairs and there are calculators to help you then you can work out how much you need to pay off and how much spare money you have to do this with you can also start to cut down on all the really unnecessary stuff to increase your spare money that you can use to pay off the debts hopefully this wo n't take too long and you can easily if work the debt off over time if it really is there are things you can do to help firstly contacting your creditors and seeing what they can do to either part write off the debt or freeze it as you pay it off most creditors understand that if you 're desperate enough to talk to them then they may not see any of their debt back and are at least willing to help you pay them back generally though it sounds like you are not in a total mess as you can pay it off there are people in far worse states than you but you really do need to be fully aware of your financial situation sit down and count your money one lazy sunday there are links to help try the motley fool 's guide and its dealing with debt forum both of which are very practical if uk based the fool has a us site too see for yourself if there 's the same stuff on it but this kind of thing tends to be fundamental to people of all nations

some of the other answers recommended peer to peer lending and property markets i would not invest in either of these firstly peer to peer lending is not a traditional investment and we may not have enough historical data for the risk to return ratio secondly property investments have a great risk unless you diversify which requires a huge portfolio crowd funding for one property is not a traditional investment and may have drawbacks for example what if you disagree with other crowd about the required repairs for the property if you invest in the property market i recommend a well diversified fund that owns many properties beware of high debt leverage used to enhance returns and at the same time risk and high fees when selecting a fund however traditionally it has been a better choice to invest in stocks than to invest in property market beware of anyone who says that the property market is too good to not get into without specifying which part of the world is meant note also that many companies invest in properties so if you invest only in a well diversified stock index fund you may already have property investments in your portfolio however in your case i would keep the money in risk free assets i.e. bank savings or a genuine low cost money market fund i.e. one that does n't invest in corporate debt or in variable rate loans which have short duration but long maturity the reason is that you 're going to be unemployed soon and thus you may need the money soon if you have an investment horizon of say 10 years then i would throw stocks into the mix and if you 're saving for retirement then i would go all in to stocks in the part of the world where i live in money market funds generally have better return than bank savings and better diversification too however your 2.8 interest sounds rather high the money market fund i have in the past invested in currently yields at 0.02 but then again i live in the eurozone so be sure to get estimates for the yields of different risk free assets so my advice for investing is simple risk free assets for short time horizon a mixture of stocks and risk free assets for medium time horizon and only stocks for long time horizon in any case you need a small emergency fund too which you should consider a thing separate from your investments my emergency fund is 20 000 eur your 50 000 aud is bit more than 30 000 eur so you do n't really have that much money to invest only a bit more than a reasonably sized emergency fund but then again i live in rental property so my expenses are probably higher than yours if you can foresee a very long time horizon for part of your investment you could perhaps invest 50 of your money to stocks preference being a geographically diversified index fund or a number of index funds but i would n't invest more because of the need for an emergency fund

index funds like ibb generally lack active management which equates to lower expenses this is simply because the target index the nasdaq biotechnology index in the case of ibb is composed of known quantities this means there wo n't be stock pickers or analysts constantly swapping holdings increasing the turnover rate of the portfolio and increasing capital gains costs that are offset by higher expense ratios in more actively managed funds

there are usually so many different options around for the same stock that some are rarely traded especially if the price has moved since the option was issued nobody might be interested in that particular option at that price anymore so the asking price might be something that someone asked for ages ago and that is much higher than anyone would reasonably pay today   with a bid of $ 20 and an ask of $ 30 nobody is trading but the value of that option is somewhere between $ 20 and $ 30 if the value is below $ 25 someone will notice your $ 25 bid and sell

the first thing that i learned the hard way by trying my hand at actual options trading is that liquidity matters so few people are interested in trading the same options that i am that it is easy to get stuck holding profitable contracts into expiration unless i offer to sell them for a lot less than they are worth   i also learned that options are a kind of insurance and no one makes money in the long run buying insurance   so you can use options to hedge and thereby prevent losses but you also blunt your gains   edit imo options in the long run only make money for the brokers as you pay a commission both on the buy and on the sell with my broker the commission on options is higher than the commission on stocks or etfs

assuming that a couple big players are making the majority of money in the stock market which is true it is logical to assume that most smaller players are losing    for example if one big hedge fund makes 20 a year   it means either 20 funds lost 1 or 5 funds lost 4 and etc    assuming that the economy is not drastically getting much better stocks are a zero sum game therefore the couple of funds with the most resources will be taking from the people that are n't as advanced or taking a chance

my own personal point of view i earn about twice what my wife to be earns we are planning on getting married next year   i ultimately do all the finances basically because she hates that kind of thing not because i 'm in charge or whatever to work out how we do this i wrote a spreadsheet   at the top it has my monthly pay in one column and her 's in another i add all our bills against me at the bottom i have a total of both of our spending money spending money is wage bills savings i then move money out of my column into her column my goal is that we pay all the bills and save a decent amount and have roughly the same amount to spend each month so each persons spending money should be roughly equal i then fine tune this as things change if we get a pay rise we alter it if a bill goes up or down we alter it to manage this we have 4 accounts a joint account to pay bills both give a set amount to each a savings acount both give a set amount to each month and our own accounts where we get paid and where our spending money lives like everyone else says this seems fair to me i do n't earn more we both earn an amount and this should be split equally

to be honest if you have to ask tips about taking over your family business someone really dropped the ball on showing you the business in the first place      anyway learn yourself some basic bookkeeping accounting   money management tax handling will be something you will need to know even if you have staff to handle this for you      learn the specific product service whatever you offer   nothing can be worse than having no clue what your product service does and you 're running it      shadow the family that are running it now   find out what they do throughout their day involving the business   whoever your replacing is the one you should focus on most      also make sure you understand your branding quality and price measures   any basic business class will teach you that branding quality and price are the three factors of a business 's success   where you fail in one you take up in another   for instance apple has horrible prices   extremely expensive   how do they make it up   well quality is about on par with other products since they largely come from the same source as competitors but the iphone and ipod are well known brands far more recognized than the smartphone and mp3 player that they are instead called by the specific product name   same with kleenex   no one asks for a facial tissue   they ask for a kleenex   that 's strong branding that connects the consumer to the product      anyway just make sure you know where your points fall on those three lines in your business   improve as you can but understand where your main fall back is   best prices quality or most well known           lastly do n't doubt that you can do this   similarly do n't   your friends will all ask for deals and discounts and you 'd do best to deny them in most cases   family will always want a cut and will probably get nasty in some cases by how you 're set up   when dealing with employees remember that they work for you   you 're not friends   nothing destroys a staff faster than the boss trying to be friends with everyone and ends up promoting the           eh not sure what else to toss out   that covers a lot of bases but i 'm sure i can think of more later

reits can be classified as equity mortgage or hybrid a security that sells like a stock on the major exchanges and invests in real estate directly either through properties or mortgages trades like equity but the underlying is a property ot mortgage so you are investing in real estate but without directly dealing with it so you would n't classify it as real estate cd looks more like a bond if you look at the terms and conditions they have many conditions as a bond i.e. callable that is a very precious option for both the buyer and seller self occupied house yes an asset because it comes with liabilities when you need to sell it you have to move out you have to perform repairs to keep it in good condition foreign stock mutual fund classify it as foreign stocks for your own good investments in a foreign country are n't the same as in your own country the foreign economy can go bust the company may go bust and you would have limited options of recovering your money sitting at home and so on and so forth

others have pointed out that many benefits offered by employers for free are actually taxed the employee must pay taxes on the value of what they 're receiving usually services of some kind this is called imputed income also pointed out was that healthcare is an exception a specifically protected class of benefits that are n't taxed but sometimes they are many companies now offer domestic partner health coverage as well regardless of whether the couple is in any kind of civil union or other arrangement the costs to the employee vary but it 's often that they simply pay double of what their individual coverage contribution would be independent of the employee 's direct contribution for their domestic partner they must also pay taxes on the value of the employer 's cost of the coverage this can be significant as typically the employer is paying the lion 's share of the healthcare cost

stock prices are set by bidding in principle a seller will say i want $ 80 if he ca n't find anyone willing to buy at that price he 'll either decide not to sell after all or he 'll lower his price likewise a buyer will say i 'll pay $ 70 if he ca n't find anyone willing to pay that price he 'll either decide not to buy or he 'll increase his price for most stocks there are many buyers and many sellers all the time so there 's a constant the typical small investor has very little control of the price you say i want to buy 10 shares of xyz corporation and my maximum price is $ 20 if the current trending price is below $ 20 your broker will buy it for you if not he wo n't you normally have some time limit on the order so if the price falls within your range within that time period your broker will buy that is your choice is basically to buy or not buy or sell or not sell at the current price you have little opportunity to really negotiate a better price if you have a significant percentage of a company 's total stock different story in real life most stocks are being traded constantly so buyers and sellers both have a pretty good idea of the current price if the last sale was ten minutes ago for $ 20 it 's unlikely anyone 's going to now bid $ 100 they 're going to bid $ or $ or some such if the last sale was for $ 20 and your broker really came to the floor and offered to buy for $ 100 i suppose someone would sell to him very quickly before he realized what an outrageous price this was i use td ameritrade and on their web site if i give a price limit on a buy that 's more than a small percentage above the last sale they reject it as an error i forget the exact number but they wo n't even accept a bid of $ 80 if the stock is going for $ 40 they might accept $ 41 or $ 42 something like that

gt i do n't have a lot of time to keep going back and forth it seems like we differ on a bunch of things   okay i 'll try to respect your time and just point out where i think we disagree factually and then end with a general question   gt that makes sense as the electric company does not own the utility poles   the utility poles and municipal electrical delivery infrastructure is generally owned by the electric company who do you see repairing it when it breaks it was 1996 order by the federal energy regulatory commission that requires the electric companies to share it like a public legal reg land docs   gt no one would by a coffee pot if there was a known fire starting issue with those coffee pots   i think this is a key difference of opinion between us   i would be a lot more pro free market if i believed that the consumer could always make a complete informed decision   i am certain an individual can not   the manufacturer is certainly not going to tell potential customers that their product is dangerous and neither consumers nor stores have the tools to confirm a faulty product or the voice to inform the world   consider the quintessential example of the health effects of smoking   it was 1950 when there was strong evidence that smoking was correlated to lung articles   the tobacco companies when on a huge successful campaign that was so good after almost twenty years only one third of doctors believed cigarettes to be   in 1965 the us government added warning labels to cigarette packages but in 1981 the ftc found this was of poor effectiveness of informing tobacco labels index.htm   it was n't until the us government went on a media campaign of it 's own that the message started to get wiki   okay you might say but that was then and it 's different now   we have the internet now and people are smarter   nope   tobacco use is on the decline in the us but it is booming globally and manufactures continue to use the exact same misinformation campaigns to sell its the world is losing the war on the tobacco 11   these companies are exploiting people selling them something they know to be addictive and toxic and we know that here mainly thanks to the us government   gt taxing people as a way to redistribute wealth is wrong imposing mandates so people buy a product service is just straight up wrong   your stand here rings hollow to me   i hear you making a moral stand on mandates and wealth redistribution taxes but in so much of our other discussion you have suggested the ends justify the means   it is okay if a few coffee pots explode as long as everyone gets a free market   jobs fleeing the country is fine as long as we all get cheap iphones   on one hand you think it is a travesty that a health plan wo n't replace an old knee but say almost nothing about leaving people with no health care at all   you have demonstrated that you have no problem breaking a few eggs to make an so claiming that breaking these particular eggs is wrong just does n't add up especially when you say you 're good with it for true welfare cases   that leaves me with two theories about your position   1 you do n't actually have a problem with taking wealth from the rich   you have a problem with giving wealth to people who are poor by choice 2 you do n't actually have a problem making people pay for a service they wo n't use   you have a problem with giving a service to non hard luck cases for free   what do you think   do either of my theories hold water   have a great weekend

if i understand correctly the traditional ira if you have 401k with an employer already has the following features actually 1 and 2 are characteristics of roth iras not traditional iras only 3 is a characteristic of a traditional ira whether you have a 401(k with your employer or not makes absolutely no difference in how your iras are taxed for the vast majority of people the rules for iras are different if you have a very high income though you 're allowed to have and contribute to both kinds of accounts in fact i personally have both traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free as people sometimes mistakenly call them they 're very different meaning that you do n't have to pay taxes on the contributions or profits you make inside the account e.g. from dividends interest profits from stock you sell etc rather you pay taxes on any money you withdraw for roth iras the contributions are taxed but you never have to pay taxes on the money inside the account again that means that any money you get over and above the contributions e.g. through interest trading profits dividends etc are genuinely tax free also if you leave any of the money to people they do n't have to pay any taxes either important point there are no tax free retirement accounts in the u.s. the distinction between different kinds of iras basically boils down to pay now or pay later many people make expensive mistakes in their retirement strategy by not understanding that point please note that this applies equally to traditional and roth 401(k)s as well you can have roth 401(k)s and traditional 401(k)s just like you can have roth iras and traditional iras the same terminology and logic applies to both kinds of accounts as far as i know there are n't major differences tax wise between them with two exceptions you 're allowed to contribute more money to a 401(k per year and you 're allowed to have a 401(k even if you have a high income by way of contrast people with very high incomes generally are n't allowed to open iras a primary advantage of a traditional ira is that you can in theory at least afford to contribute more money to it due to the tax break you 're getting also you can defer taxes on any profits you make e.g. through dividends or selling stock at a profit so you can grow your money faster

the market is efficient but it is not perfectly efficient there are entities out there that consistently legitimately and significantly outperform the market because of asymmetric information not necessarily insider trading and their competitive advantage access to data and proprietary highly sophisticated i say this despite most hedge funds performing worse than their respective benchmarks for most people even very smart people it makes a lot of sense to invest in index funds with a reasonable asset allocation based on desired volatility tax situation rebalancing methods etc    the usual example that is cited is rt 's   medallion fund because it has enjoyed quite dramatic returns other groups that have been successful include citadel and soros fund management

i 'm just really getting sick of these omg free market bullshit arguments these regulations did n't spring up all over the country without reason discrimination red lining and rate gouging were all issues the taxi industry faced at one time taxi regulators put these rules into effect to protect customers and assure that people using public transportation could get to where they needed to go   the difference between uber lyft and taxis that follow the law is that there is regulatory body that impose fines on companies and cab drivers that violate them and with enough complaints the regulators can completely revoke their ability to serve as taxi cabs in a city   instead you want this free market where the cab drivers can tell their passengers to get fucked if they do n't like it go read the wiki page on taxi regulation i ca n't find a single instance on there where customers benefited from deregulation

people treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace in the hole when it comes to financial difficulty but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize what is an emergency first you have to define what an emergency is   is it a lost job   is it an unplanned event pregnancy perhaps   is it a medical emergency   is it the death of you or your spouse also what does it mean to be unplanned   is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency   is one month of planning an emergency   two only you can answer these questions for yourself but they significantly shape your financial strategy   planning is highly dependent on your cashflow and for some people it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work   for others they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month also you have to consider the length of the emergency   job loss is rarely permanent but it 's rarely short as well   the current average is weeks that 's 7 months money in an emergency there are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency a good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account   some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other   however some of these are correlated for example in 2008 three things happened   the stock market crashed unsecured debt dried up and people faced financial emergency lost jobs cut wages   if you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit you 'd be up a creek because the value of your investments suddenly decreased and you ca n't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit however if you had a one or more of cash savings unemployment income and unemployment insurance you would probably have been ok budgeting for an emergency when you say financial emergency most people think job loss   however the most common cause of bankruptcy in the us is medical debt   depending on your insurance situation this could be a serious risk or it may not be    people say you should have of your monthly income in savings because it 's an easy back of the envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk but it 's not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you to properly budget for an emergency you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency generally having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk mitigation strategy   but it 's not a panacea for every kind of emergency

let me give you some advice from someone who has experience at both ends had student loan issues myself and parents ran financial aid department at local university quick story of my student loan   i graduated in debt and could not pay at first due to having kids way too early   i deferred   schools will have rules for   there are also federal guidelines lets not get specific on this though since these change every year it seems    so basically there is an initial deferment period in which any student can request for the repayments to be deferred and it is granted   then there is an extended deferment   here someone has to ok it   this is really rather arbitrary and up to the school lender   my school decided to not extend mine after i filled out a of paperwork and showed that even without paying i had basically $ 200 a month for the family to live off past housing fixed expenses eventually they had to cave because i had no money so they gave me an extended deferment   after the 5 years i started paying   since my school had a very complex way to pay i decided to give them 6 months at a time   you would think they would love that right   on the check it was clearly stated what months i was paying for to show that i was not prepaying the loan off well i was in collections 4 months later   their billing messed up set me up for prepayment   they then played dumb and acted like i did n't but i had a picture of the check and their bank 's stamp on the back they could n't get my loan out of collections even though they messed up   this is probably some lower level employee trying to cover their mistake   so this office tells creditors to leave me alone but i also cannot pay my loan because the credit collection agency has slapped a 5k fee on the 7k loan   so my loan spent 5 years kid you not like this   it was interest free since the employee stopped the loan processing point being is that if you do n't pay the lender will either put your loan into deferment automatically or go after you   most not all schools will opt for deferment which i believe is 2 years at most places   then after that you have the optional deferment   so if you keep not paying they might throw you into that bucket    however if you stop paying and you never communicate with them the chances of you getting the optional deferment are almost none unless school does n't know where you live   basically if you do n't respond to their mail emails you get swept into their credit collection process   so just filling out the deferment stuff when you get it even if they deny it could buy you up to 10 years kid you not    now once you go into the collection process anything is game   as long as you do n't need a home car loan you can play this game   what the collection agency does depends on size of loan and the rules   if you are at a major university the rules are usually more lax but if you are at the smaller schools especially the advertised trade online schools boom better watch out   wages will be garnished very soon   expect to go to court might have to hire an attorney because some corrupt lenders start on fees think of the 5k mine on me    so the moral of the story is you will pay it off   if you act nice fill out paperwork talk to school and so on you can probably push this off quite a few years   but you are still paying and you will pay interest on everything   so factor in that to the equation   i had a 2.3 loan but they are much higher now    defaulting is n't always a bad thing   if you do n't have the money then you do n't have it   and using credit cards to help is not the thing to do   but you need to try to work with the school so you do n't incur penalties fees and so that your job does n't have creditors calling them    my story ended year 4 that my loan was in collection   a higher up was reviewing my case and called me   told her the story and emailed her a picture of their cashed check   she was completely embarrassed when she was trying to work out a plan for me and i am like how about i come down tomorrow with the 7k   but even though lender admitted fault this took 20 + calls to agencies to clear up my credit so i could buy a house    so your goal should be

mathematically the wisest choice is to invest your extra money somewhere else and not pay off your 0 loan early an extreme example highlights this suppose some colossal company offered to loan you a billion dollars at 0 interest would you take it or would you say no thanks i do n't want that much debt you would be crazy not to accept you could put that money in the safest investments available and still pocket millions while making the minimum payments back to them your choice here is essentially the same but unfortunately on much smaller scale that said math does n't always trump other factors you need to factor in your peace of mind future purchases the need for future borrowing your short term income and job security and whether you think you can reliably make payments on this loan without messing up and triggering fees that wipe out the mathematical advantage of slow paying the loan you are fortunate because you really ca n't make a wrong choice here paying off debt is never a bad choice imo however it may not always be the best choice

having someone else paying you rent is always going to be the better deal financially the question is what does $ 450k buy in the neighborhood in which you want to live vs $ 800k i 'm going to assume you can afford either option buying a $ 450k home and not selling or an $ 800k home and selling your current one whether someone 's paying you rent or not let 's make up some numbers here a $ 450k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30 years will cost you about $ in p&i payments per year plus escrows such as re taxes pmi and homeowners insurance where applicable an $ 800k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30yr will give you payments of about $ before taxes and insurance so the worst case overall is that you buy a 450k home in the new neighborhood and are not at any given time collecting rent on the old property that would assuming the mortgage terms on both home loans were comparable cost you $ and you 'd be living in a $ 450k home in a neighborhood where 450k may not buy a home as nice as the one you moved out of the question as i stated above is this assuming you had a reliable tenant in your home for the entire remaining life of the loan on your current home which is more acceptable to you buying $ 450k of home which might be a downgrade in sqft or amenities and paying $ 2020 in p&i or paying about a grand more $ for a much nicer home in the new location strictly from a money perspective the renter is going to be the best option if you get reliable tenancy for the entire life of the mortgage on that house you 'll be paying $ for 30 years which is $ to end up with $ of total home value plus adjustments for actual home value appreciation depreciation that 's the only way you 'll come out ahead on any mortgage have someone else pay most of it for you if you do n't rent the $ 800k home will cost you $ while two $ 450k homes will cost you $ the percentage of home value over total payments for the 800k home would be 72 you will have paid 137 of the value of the home while you will have paid of the value of two 450k homes

my experience with owning a home is that its like putting down roots and can be like an anchor holding you to an area   before considering whether you can financially own a home consider some of the other implications once you own it you are stuck for awhile and can not quickly move away like you can with renting   so if a better job opportunity comes up or your employer moves you to another office across town that doubles your commute time you 'll be regretting the home purchase as it will be a barrier to moving to a more convenient location    i along with my fiancée and two children are being forced to move out of my parents home asap   do not rush buying a home   take your time and find what you want   i made the mistake once of buying a home thinking i could take on some diy remodeling to correct some features i was n't fond of   life and finding extra time for diy house updates does n't come easy especially with children    speaking of children consider the school district when buying a home too   often times homes in good school districts cost more   if you do n't consider the school district now then you may be faced with a difficult decision when the kids start school    if you are confident you wo n't want to move anytime soon and can find a house you like and want to jump into home ownership there are some programs that can help first time buyers but they can require some effort on your part   fha has a first time buyer program with a 3.5 down payment   you will need to search for a lender that offers fha loans and work with them   fha covers this program by charging mortgage insurance every month that 's part of your house payment fannie mae has the program where first time home buyers can purchase a foreclosed home from their inventory for as little as 3 down and possibly get up to 3 from the seller to apply toward closing costs   private mortgage insurance pmi is required with this program too   their inventory of homes can be found on the website there is also which requires attending workshops and creating a detailed plan to prove you 're ready for homeownership   this might be a good option if they have workshops in your area and you want to talk with someone in person

i think this gets at why some of us are becoming concerned about the volume or more importantly the portion of hft in capital markets these days you have algos trading based on technical trends which are increasingly just the behavior of other algos rinse and repeat at a certain point it just becomes a feedback loop   now i agree that there 's no reason to be scared of hft simply because its new or fast which is what i think threatens a lot of people but the problem is that the economic and social utility of markets arises from their being information aggregation engines if it gets to the point where most of the price action is driven by algos which are trading solely based on a few minutes of technical data no new information is being contributed to the price discovery process    now it may be that a certain amount of meta information can be discovered from pattern analysis of short term technical history but it seems to me this information is more limited in both quality and quantity compared to the information inputs of thoughtful humans acting on a reasoned analysis of economic and other world events

as a new very small business the irs has lots of advice and information for you start at and be sure you have several pots of coffee or other appropriate aid against   by default a single member llc is disregarded for tax purposes at least for federal and generally states follow federal although i do n't know mass. specifically although it does have other effects if you go this route you simply include the business income and expenses on schedule c as part of your individual return on 1040 and the net se income is included along with your other income if any in computing your tax turbotax or similar software should handle this for you although you may need a premium version that costs a little more   you can elect to have the llc taxed as a corporation by filing form see in principle you are supposed to do this when the entity is formed but in practice aiui if you do it by the end of the year they wo n't care at all and if you do it after the end of the year but before or with your first affected return you qualify for automatic relief however deciding how to divide the business income profits into reasonable pay to yourself versus dividends is more complicated and filling out corporation tax returns in addition to your individual return which is still required is more work in addition to the work and cost of filing and reporting the llc itself to your state of choice unless until you make something like $ a year this probably is n't worth it 1099 reporting stripe qualifies as a payment network and under a recent law payment networks must annually report to irs and copy to you on form 1099-k if your account exceeds certain thresholds see   note you are still legally required to report and pay tax on your se income even if you are n't covered by 1099-k or other reporting self employment tax as a self employed person if the llc is disregarded you have to pay se tax that is effectively equivalent to the fica taxes that would be paid by your employer and you as an employee combined this is 12.4 for social security unless until your total earned income exceeds a cap for 2017 $ adjusted yearly for inflation and 2.9 for medicare with no limit plus additional medicare tax if you exceed a higher threshold and it is n't repealed and replaced if the llc corporation status it has to pay you reasonable wages for your services and fica on those wages like any other employer estimated payments you are required to pay most of your individual income tax and se tax if applicable during the year generally 90 of your tax or your tax minus $ 1,000 whichever is less most wage earners do n't notice this because it happens automatically through payroll withholding but as self employed you are responsible for making sufficient and timely estimated payments and will owe a penalty if you do n't however since this is your first year you may have a safe harbor if you also have income from an employer reported on w-2 with withholding and that withholding is to pay last year 's tax then you are exempt from the underpayment penalty for this year   if you elect corporation status then the corporation which is really just you must always make timely payments of withheld amounts according to one of several different schedules that may apply depending on the amounts i believe it also must make estimated payments for its own liability if any but i 'm not familiar with that part

a debenture is a security document this means that the bond is secured over assets under english law you can issue bonds which if defaulted upon you can enforce your security against the issuer i.e. the company which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company 's assets    as for a floating charge i 'll first explain what a fixed charge is say you 're a bank a lender and you lend £ 1000 to x. you take security by way of a fixed charge over x 's photocopy machines x is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender 's consent this means that if x can not pay up the loan you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines sell them and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default   a floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate e.g. x 's stock of potatoes x sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you ca n't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons you ca n't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato when an event of default occurs i.e. you do n't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement the floating charge and becomes a fixed charge thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back   random examples but makes sense   source future english solicitor

your question is n't great but i will attempt to answer this piece as it seems really the root of your personal finance question i want to convince my wife to make this move because it will save us    at least 800 month but she fails to see how buying a second home is    financially sound because we have to lose our savings and we have to    pay interest on our second home and her logic is it will take almost 5 years to get back our down payment    and we have to pay interest as well so how can this move help our    family financially in the long run is she right she is mostly wrong first consider that there is no roi really on your down payment assuming you are paying what your home would sell for the next day then your rio is already yours minus realtor fees she is talking about cash on hand not roi i will use an example without taking into account risk of home markets going down or other risks to ownership example let 's say you pay $ 2800 a month in mortgage at 5.5 apr and $ 200 a month in on a $ loan $ 400k house in this example let 's say the same house if you were to rent it is $ 3800 a month understand the opportunity cost of renting the marginal amount it costs you to not buy so far your opportunity cost is $ 800 a month the principle of your house will be increasing with each payment in our example it 's about $ 400 for the first payment and will increase with each payment made while decreasing the interest payment suggest you look at an amortization table for your specific mortgage example so you 're real number is now $ 1200 a month opportunity cost consider also the fact that the $ 400 a month is sitting in a savings account of sorts while most savings accounts give you less than 1 in returns and then charge taxes on that gain your home may or may not be much higher than that and wo n't charge you taxes on the gains when you sell it if you live in it for a period of time as defined by the irs let 's assume a conservative long term appreciation rate of 3 that 's $ 12k a year on a $ 400k house so now you 're at $ 2200 a month opportunity cost in this example i did n't touch on your tax savings of ownership i also did n't touch on the maintenance cost of ownership or the maintenance cost of renting your deposit + other fees which all should be considered you may have other costs involved in renting for instance the cost of not being able to fully utilize your rental as your own house this may be an even simpler and more convincing way to explain it on the $ 2800 mortgage example you will be paying around $ 19k in interest and $ 2400 on taxes insurance = $ 23k per year number could be way different in your example that is basically throw away money you 're never getting back on the rental 100 of your rent at $ 3800 a month is throw away money you 're never getting back that 's $ a year

our group leader was very interested in the amazon go concept which got us thinking about that as a potential deal while writing the paper i found some articles discussing whole foods amazon potential merger from last year but it seemed unlikely since the companies had a sit down last year and it did n't amount to anything obviously amazon thought this was a good target then so it was known at the time however we did n't think the deal was back on the table recent mentions of the possible deal did n't come out until a few weeks after we started writing our paper

you 're trying to change the subject i guarantee to you the amount of interference in your life and death would be far less intrusive with single payer which is at least in responsible nations accountable to the public what we have now is forced privatization which means a total lack of accountability why because the insurance industry and drug industry claim they need it in order to be which is bullshit   nobody is calling them out on this   so what we 're getting is obama 's chicago school neoliberal right wing being forced on this country and other because of trade retirees say no to a trade deal that would make medicine more even when they know it ca n't work   its a race to the bottom that is only going to get worse it wastes quite conservatively at least a resources research the case for a national health program much more probably more than half of every health care dollar that s the facts    it worthless arguing with you though because you 're not listening

you can call it a stock rating of say between 0 to 5 or 0 to 10 or whatever scale you want to use   it should not be called a recommendation but rather a rating based on the you have also a scale from say 0 to 5 is better than using terms like buy hold and sell

i have friends in denver once upon a time they could afford the suburbs nearby but prices have to growing too fast for even their tech incomes to afford it there are cheap less decent areas but gentrification will sky rocket the costs even without amazon     in reality wherever amazon chooses to settle their hq2 prices will rise by how much depends on how little is in the area already

the best way is to ask the charity and the custodian of the retirement account both will want to make sure it is done correctly the charity will want to be able to not have the account go through the probate process probate can delay to transfer of money for months or longer items in the will could be contested

but it goes both ways why should the people care about your business and if it 's sustainable the market will deem it unprofitable if he ca n't support paying his workers living wages    if there are no minimum wages that a person can scrape by on then you have companies taking advantage of people or the business offsetting the cost to the public like tips the public would be subsidizing the business    i think you need to dig deeper into that logic

before you even enroll in a good financial school register for an account with a bank that allows you to manage a stock portfolio   i prefer td ameritrade   you do have to be 18 just register it under your parents it does n't matter   just make sure they fill out the information portion   get the ssn and tax info right   basically it 's their account you 're just managing it that way you 'll have some good practical experience going into it   understand that working with money can be a very cut throat industry be ready to be competing with people constantly     also surround yourself with books from successful stock brokers investment bankers things like that   when you 're working you 'll want information like that   good luck and   i hope this helps

why do these stories use the word avoid instead of delay it 's only avoided if they never bring the money into the us and instead find some way to spend it off shore if their stockpile gets too big investors are going to want some sort of return

do you have any support for the statement that il pensions are among the most generous in the entire country   when last i looked at some data from an study ca 2015 il was n't toward the top   it is n't the terms of the pensions as much as fiscal mismanagement in funding them
