according to what little information is available currently this fund is most akin to an actively managed exchange traded fund rather than an investment trust an investment trust is an actively managed closed end fund that is tradeable on the stock market   closed end means that there are a fixed number of shares available for trading so if you wish to buy or sell shares in a closed end fund you need to find someone willing to sell or buy shares   actively managed means that the assets are selected by the fund managers in the belief that they will perform well   this is in contrast to a passively managed fund which simply tracks an underlying index    the closed end nature of investment trusts means that the share price is not well correlated to the value of the underlying assets   indeed almost all uk investment trusts trade at a significant discount to their net asset value   this reflects their historic poor performance and relatively weak liquidity   of course there are some exceptions to this examples of open end funds are unit trust us = mutual funds and etfs exchange traded funds   they are open end funds in the sense that the number of shares units available will change according to demand   most importantly the price of a share unit will be strongly correlated to the net asset value of the underlying portfolio   in general for an open end fund if the net asset value of the fund is x and there are y shares units outstanding then the price of a share unit will be x y.   historic data shows that passively managed funds index trackers always outperform actively managed funds in the long term   one of the big issues with actively managed funds is they have relatively high management fees   the peoples trust will be charging about 1 with a promise that this should come down over time   compare this to a fee of 0.05 on a large major market index tracking etf   further the 1 headline fee being touted by peoples trust is a somewhat misleading since they are paying their employees bonuses with shares in the fund   this will cause dilution of the net asset value per share and can be read as addition management fees by proxy   since competent fund managers will demand high incomes bonus shares could easily double the management fees depending on the size of the fund in summary history has shown that the promises of active fund managers rarely if ever come to fruition personally i would not consider this to be an attractive investment and would look more towards a passively managed major market index etf with low management fees

ebitda is in my opinion not a useful measure for an investor looking to buy shares on the stock market it is more useful for private businesses open to changing their structuring or looking to sell significant parts of their business one of the main benefits of reporting earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization is that it presents the company as it would look to a potential buyer consider that net income as a metric includes interest costs taxes and depreciation   interest costs are to put it simply a result of multiplying a business 's debt by its interest rate if you own a business and personally guarantee the loan that the company has with the bank your interest rates might be artificially low if you have a policy of reaching high debt levels relative to your equity in order to achieve high financial leveraging your interest cost might be artificially high either way if i bought your business my debt structure could be completely different and therefore your interest costs are not particularly relevant to me a potential buyer instead i should attempt to anticipate what my own interest costs would be under my plans for your business taxes are a result of many factors including the corporate structure of the business if you run your business as a sole proprietorship ie no corporation but i want to buy it under my corporation then my tax rates could look nothing like yours or if we operated in multiple jurisdictions etc etc instead of using your taxes as an estimate for mine i should anticipate my taxes based on my plans for your business depreciation amortization is a measure that estimates how much of a business 's fixed assets were used up during the year ie how much wear and tear occurred on your fleet of trucks it is generally calculated as a of your overall asset value it is a very loose proxy for the cash costs which will ultimately be incurred to make repairs replacements is also something which could significantly change if a business changes hands if the value of your building is much higher now than when you bought it i will have higher costs than you because i will be recording a of total costs higher than yours and therefore i should forecast my own removing these costs from net income is not particularly relevant for a casual stock investor because these costs will not change when you buy shares whatever ibm 's interest cost is reflects the debt structuring policy that the company currently has therefore when you buy a share in ibm you should consider the impact that interest has on net income similarly for taxes and they reflect costs to the business that impact the company 's ability to pay you a dividend and therefore you should look at net income which includes those costs why would a business with good net income and good ebitda report ebitda because ebitda will always be higher than net income why say $ 10 m net income when you could say $ 50 m ebitda the fact is it 's easy to report and is generally well understood so why not report it when it also makes you look better from a purely big number = good perspective i 'm not sure that reporting ebitda implies any sort of manipulative reporting but it would seem that warren buffet feels this is a risk

one point that i do n't see covered in the other answers yet how does this affect the months that have 5 weeks do we actually lose two weeks a year i get paid every two weeks and pay day is always a friday   some months i get paid 3 times which is always great   if you live within your means it 's like an extra paycheck   all other months i get paid two times   how many months a year do i get paid 3 times 2   it will always be two because there are 12 months   if you get paid twice a month that 's 24 pay checks which is 2 shy of 26 pay checks what we would expect if we were paid every two weeks   that means those 2 extra pay checks need to fall somewhere and they will be on the months where your pay day is hit 5 times   for example in 2014 there are 4 months with 5 fridays jan may aug oct   i got paid the second friday of january so i only got 2 checks in january   i will be paid on the first friday of may which means i will get 3 checks in may.   my other triple check month this year is october so of course i am only going to be paid twice in august

in the case of hp in the early to mid 1990 's they had done really well but by the late 90 's the board and shareholders wanted to see even more profits thanks to the internet boom they ousted their ceo who rose through the hp ranks brought in who was from at&amp;t old long distance at&amp;t not the sbc one we have now who over promised and never delivered and basically forced hp in buying compaq which nearly destroyed hp   the only reason why hp is still around today is thanks to its business line of and printers the company made many bad decisions during tenure which was amazing that anyone trusted her but i 'm guessing she was great at fits somehow she has made a name for herself and is now trying politics and her type of leadership fits perfectly with the current republican party

it is important to distinguish between cause and effect as well as the supply saving versus demand borrowing side of money to understand the relationship between interest rates bond yields and inflation what is mean by interest rates is usually based on the officially published rates determined by the central bank and is referenced to the overnight lending rate for meeting reserve requirements   in practice what the means is for example in the united states the federal reserve will have periodic meetings to determine whether to leave this rate alone or to raise or lower the rate   the new rate is generally determined by their assessment of current and forecast national and global economic conditions and factors in the votes of the various regional federal reserve presidents   if the fed economic weakness they will tend to lower and keep rates lower while when the economy seems to be overheated the tendency will be to raise rates bond yields are also based on the expectation of future economic conditions but as determined by market participants   at times the market will actually lead the fed in bidding bond prices up or down while at other times it will react after the fed does   however ignoring the varying time lag the two generally will track each other because they are really the same thing   the only difference is the participants which are collectively determining what the rates yields are the inverse relationship between interest rates and inflation is the main reason for fluctuating rates in the first place   the fed will tend to raise rates to try to slow inflation and lower rates when it feels inflation is too low and economic growth should be stimulated   likewise when the economy is doing poorly there is both little inflationary pressure driving interest rates down both in terms of what savers can accept to keep ahead of inflation and at and depressed levels of borrowing reduced demand for money driving down rates to try to balance supply and demand and the opposite is true when the economy is booming bond yields are thus positively correlated to inflation because during periods of high inflation savers wo n't want to invest in bonds that do n't provide them with an acceptable inflation adjusted yield   but high interest rates tend to have the effect or in inflation because it gets more costly for borrowers and thus puts a on new economic activity so to summarize

i was able to find several references that claim that the indo us treaty provision is limited to five years here it says this on page 20 generally the treaty exemption for students is limited to the first    five calendar years that the international student is in the u.s.    however there is no set time limit for students from belgium    bulgaria china the netherlands and pakistan however i could n't find any specific time limit neither in the treaty nor in the technical explanation the explanation says thus for example an indian resident who visits the united states as    a student and becomes a u.s. resident according to the code other    than by virtue of acquiring a green card would continue to be exempt    from u.s. tax in accordance with this article so long as he is not a    u.s. citizen and does not acquire immigrant status in the united    states the saving clause does apply to u.s. citizens and immigrants however the treaty explicitly says this the benefits of this article shall extend only for such period of time    as may be reasonable or required to complete the education    or training undertaken the reason for this last paragraph is to ensure that you do n't artificially prolong your student status and the 5 year limit may come out of the interpretation of this specific paragraph similar paragraph exists in the us china treaty and the explanation for that treaty says this these exemptions may be claimed only for the period reasonably    necessary to complete the education or training in some cases the    course of study or training may last less than year for most    undergraduate college or university degrees the appropriate period    will be four years for some advanced degrees such as in medicine    the required period may be longer e.g. seven years based on this it is my personal impression that if you 're an undergraduate student and studying the same degree and not for example finished your ba and started your ms you are no longer eligible for the treaty benefit but i suggest you ask a professional ea cpa licensed in your state for a more reliable tax advice on the matter i 'm not a tax professional and this is not a tax advice

which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover emergency funds are for emergencies which to me means expenses that are unanticipated and ca n't be covered out of normal cash flow   oil changes are not an emergency and should be part of your normal budget   car house repairs and doctor visits might be an emergency depending on the severity and the urgency e.g. do i need to fix this now or can i save up and fix it for known predictable expenses that are infrequent christmas birthdays car insurance home insurance taxes if it 's not part of your mortgage payment i use an escrow account   i calculate how much i 'll need for all of those things put together over the year and set aside a fixed amount each paycheck to ensure that i have enough to cover each item   you could do something similar for minor doctor visits car repairs etc   estimate how much you might spend and set aside some money each month if you find you 're spending more than you thought just increase the amount   you can use envelopes for each type of expense have a separate checking account for those whatever   the point is to set it aside and make sure you have enough left over to cover your known expenses the whole point of an emergency fund is to be able to pay cash for emergencies rather than borrowing to pay them and dealing with interest late fees etc

lost checks happen occasionally and there are procedures in place banking business to handle the situation   first and foremost you need to note the money is legally yours so the company is obligated to work with you here   if they refuse to cancel or reissue the check at a minimum you 'll want to contact the state government and let them know about the company 's actions if small claims court is not an option   businesses are n't permitted to keep forfeited funds in most states instead they are required to turn them over to the government who would then return them to you when you ask for it   it 's rather scummy of the government bureaucrats because it puts them in the sole position to benefit from forgotten money but that 's the system we 've given ourselves since you 've moved overseas since the last time you worked with this company you might need to exercise a little patience and be willing to jump through some hoops to get this resolved   be prepared to provide them proof of who you are and be ready to pay for extra security such as certified mail fedex so that you 're both sure that the new check is delivered to you and only you last of all learn from your mistake this time and be a little more cautious proactive in keeping track of checks and depositing them in the future

the hidden fees in any transfer are usually foreign exchange transfer services are usually the cheapest option for sending money abroad when a conversion is involved they tend to offer ways to get the money to or from them cheaply or for free and they typically offer low or no fees plus much better exchange rates than the alternatives my preferred foreign exchange service is xe trade it looks like they support cad to transfers so you might check them out   in my experience they have not set a minimum on the amount i send although it does impact the exchange rate they will offer   the rate is still better than other alternatives available to me though note that for large enough transfers the exchange rate difference will dominate all other costs   for example if you transfer $ 10,000 and you pay $ 100 for the transfer plus $ 50 in wire fees $ 150 in fees but get a 2 better exchange rate than a free service you would save $ 50 by choosing the non free service

when you buy a house the real estate agent or title company normally draws up a big sheet with all the costs and payments involved there are typically two columns one for amounts paid to or paid by the seller and another for amounts paid to or paid by the buyer who is responsible for what is a legal question this is pretty fixed but it 's very common for the seller to agree to pay some portion of the buyer 's closing costs in any house sale i 've ever been involved in whether as buyer or seller nobody bothers to say which costs the seller is agreeing to pay rather the seller just agrees to a number then somewhere on the sheet of costs there will be a line that says closing costs paid by seller or some such wording and then it shows a minus to the seller and a plus to the buyer or something equivalent depending on how the sheet is organized   the amount is negotiated when you make an offer you 'll say whatever numbers you are prepared to offer like i offer to pay $ 100,000 for the house seller to pay $ 3,000 of closing costs and whatever other conditions seller to repair the leak in the roof whatever it makes sense for the seller to pick up some share of the closing costs because the seller normally walks away with cash in hand while the buyer is struggling to come up with enough cash to make a down payment and pay all the closing costs i.e. the seller probably can afford to give up some cash while the buyer may be struggling to come up with cash the only costs i can think of that i 've had before closing day are a earnest money b inspection c credit check or application fee to bank earnest money is applied to the purchase price at closing so it 's pretty much a moot point the application fee is a potential deal breaker i 've never heard of a seller agreeing to pay this but i guess they could but if you ca n't get the loan you probably wo n't buy the house so the seller would be out money for nothing   everything else is normally paid on closing day they total up all the costs and all the money floating around and at the end the seller gets one check that is the net of everything and the buyer writes one check that is the net of everything and the realtor or title company deals with getting the money to the right people so there 's normally no issue of paying things as they come up you do it all at once

if your uncle is looking to maintain life insurance coverage for specific shorter period of time he may want to look into hybrid life insurance if you buy a hybrid universal life policy the premium and death benefit can be guaranteed to last until any age since most permanent policies focus on cash value accumulation it is hard for most people to find cheap whole life or affordable universal life consumers only looking for a longer duration have a more flexible choice with a new hybrid product that combines elements of both term life coverage and universal life hybrid universal   policies are much cheaper then other permanent coverage such as whole life coverage because they do not emphasize cash value accumulation however the premiums and death benefits can still be guaranteed to a specific age i.e. 85 90 95 100 so premiums can be scaled to coordinate with your desired budget and the face amount required for your family typical universal life and whole life insurance contracts only allow for lifetime coverage however hybrid universal life offers a much smaller premium because the coverage can be into a specific age if the does live beyond the originally selected age the death benefit will simply begin getting smaller while the original premium will   continue to remain the same

your wife is probably not going to be able to get a policy until all tests are complete and the doctors give her a clean bill of health    a change in your health could make your premiums 50 to 75 higher than they would be if you applied for a policy in perfect health   health history is one of the biggest factor in calculating an premium    the average age for purchasing a policy is 59   including all rate increases the average long term care insurance premium is $ per year based on my calculations from a 2015 national association of insurance report with 2014 data because of new consumer protections designed to prevent rate increases policies purchased today do cost more than older policies in 2015 the average premium for a new policy was $ per year according to a survey of most companies selling long term care insurance couples can get discounts as high as 30 percent when purchasing policies at the same time do not work with just a local insurance agent who sells many different types of insurance   only work with an insurance agent who specializes in ltc insurance and that represents at least 7 of the top companies   there are probably a couple of hundred agents in the country that specialize in ltc are independent agents representing a lot of companies and have a lot of experience   interview at least 3 different agents   get quotes from every agent you speak with and ask each of them their opinion about which policy you should get   go with the agent who seems the most knowledgeable and professional   do not buy ltc insurance from a financial advisor   they are usually limited to offering only a few companies because of their broker dealer arrangements and they rarely understand ltc underwriting   do not buy ltc insurance from the company you get auto insurance or home insurance with   and do not buy a policy just because your retirement association or alumni association recommends it   shop around   in your wife 's case it would probably be wise to apply to more than one company at the same time in case one of them denies her application    here is an article i wrote for a website owned by pbs which answers some of the most common misconceptions about ltc insurance an insurance agent ’s case for buying long term care insurance

the difference between dividend and growth in mutual funds has to do with the types of stocks the mutual fund invests in typically a company in the early stages are considered growth investments in this phase the company needs to keep most of its profits to reinvest in the business typically once a company gets a significant size the company 's growth prospects are not as good so the company pays some of its profits in the form of a dividend to the shareholders   as far as which is the best buy is totally a personal choice there will be times when one is better then the other most likely you will want to diversify and invest in both types

gold ownership has been outlawed before in this country   however if you research it i think you 'll find that there are two components in pricing gold coins   the spot value of gold   the value of the coin in question   that second point is where you get fucked   there are a whole lot of outfits selling worthless investment grade coins that sell for way more than they should based on gold content and for way more than any coin collector would ever give you for the value of the coin itself   but it 's much harder to find a reasonable price for some supposedly rare coin than it is for the metal itself so it 's easier to scam you   so it 's in the best interest of the guys that advertise for these firms to say buying rare coins is awesome and buying straight gold is stupid   me   if i want to buy going coins i 'll buy us gold for a small percentage over the spot price   they 're probably more liquid than some random chunk of metal that says it 's oz of gold

mutual funds buy and sell shares in companies in accordance with   the policies set forth in their prospectus not according to the   individual needs of an investor that is when you invest money in or withdraw money from a mutual fund   the manager buys or sells whatever shares that in the manager 's judgement   will be the most appropriate ones consistent with the investment policies thus a large cap mutual fund manager will not buy the latest hot small cap stock that will likely be hugely profitable he she must choose only between various large capitalization companies some exchange traded funds are fixed baskets of stocks suppose you will not invest in a company x as a matter of principle unless a mutual fund prospectus says that it will not invest in x you may well end up having an investment in x at some time because the fund manager bought shares in x. with such an etf   you know what is in the basket and if the basket does not include stock in x   now it will not own stock in x at a later date some exchange traded funds are constructed based on some index and track the index as a matter of policy thus you will not be investing in x unless x becomes part of the index because standard or poor or russell or somebody changed their minds and the etf buys x in order to track the index finally some etfs are exactly like general mutual funds except that you can buy or sell etf shares at any time at the price at the instant that your order is executed whereas with mutual funds the price of the mutual fund shares that you have bought or sold is the nav of the mutual fund shares for that day which is established based on the closing prices at the end of the trading day of the stocks bonds etc that the fund owns   so you might end up owning stock in x at any time based on what the fund manager thinks about x.

this is such a common question here and elsewhere that i will attempt    to write the world 's most answer to this question hopefully    in the future when someone on asks how to split up    the ownership of their new company you can simply point to this    answer the most important principle fairness and the perception of    fairness is much more valuable than owning a large stake almost    everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong and one of    the biggest things that can go wrong is huge angry shouting matches    between the founders as to who worked harder who owns more whose    idea was it anyway etc that is why i would always rather split a new    company 50 50 with a friend than insist on owning 60 because it was    my idea or because i was more experienced or anything else why    because if i split the company 60 40 the company is going to fail    when we argue ourselves to death and if you just say to heck with    it we can never figure out what the correct split is so let 's just    be and go 50 50 you 'll stay friends and the company will    survive thus i present you with joel 's totally fair method to divide up the    ownership of any startup for simplicity sake i 'm going to start by assuming that you are not    going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside    investors later i 'll explain how to deal with venture capital but    for now assume no investors also for simplicity sake let 's temporarily assume that the founders    all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at    the same time later i 'll explain how to deal with founders who do    not start at the same time here 's the principle as your company grows you tend to add people in    layers the top layer is the first founder or founders there may be 1 2 3    or more of you but you all start working about the same time and you    all take the same risk quitting your jobs to go work for a new and    unproven company the second layer is the first real employees by the time you hire    this layer you 've got cash coming in from somewhere investors or    customers doesn't matter these people did n't take as much risk    because they got a salary from day one and honestly they did n't    start the company they joined it as a job the third layer are later employees by the time they joined the    company it was going pretty well for many companies each layer will be approximately one year long    by the time your company is big enough to sell to google or go public    or whatever you probably have about 6 layers the founders and    roughly five layers of employees each successive layer is larger    there might be two founders five early employees in layer 2 25    employees in layer 3 and 200 employees in layer 4 the later layers    took less risk ok now here 's how you use that information the founders should end up with about 50 of the company total each of the next five layers should end up with about 10 of the    company split equally among everyone in the layer example two founders start the company they each take 2500 shares there are    5000 shares outstanding so each founder owns half they hire four employees in year one these four employees each take    250 shares there are 6000 shares outstanding they hire another 20 employees in year two each one takes 50 shares    they get fewer shares because they took less risk and they get 50    shares because we 're giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up by the time the company has six layers you have given out 10,000    shares each founder ends up owning 25 each employee layer owns 10    collectively the earliest employees who took the most risk own the    most shares make sense you do n't have to follow this exact formula but the basic    idea is that you set up stripes of seniority where the top stripe    took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least and each    stripe shares an equal number of shares which magically gives    employees more shares for joining early a slightly different way to use the stripes is for seniority your top    stripe is the founders below that you reserve a whole stripe for the    fancy ceo that you recruited who insisted on owning 10 the stripe    below that is for the early employees and also the top managers etc    however you organize the stripes it should be simple and clear and    easy to understand and not prone to arguments now that we have a fair system set out there is one important    principle you must have vesting preferably 4 or 5 years nobody    earns their shares until they 've stayed with the company for a year a    good vesting schedule is 25 in the first year 2 each additional    month otherwise your co founder is going to quit after three weeks    and show up 7 years later claiming he owns 25 of the company it    never makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting this is an    extremely common mistake and it 's terrible when it happens you have    these companies where 3 cofounders have been working day and night for    five years and then you discover there 's some jerk that quit after    two weeks and he still thinks he owns 25 of the company for his two    weeks of work now let me clear up some little things that often complicate the    picture what happens if you raise an investment the investment can come from anywhere an angel a vc or someone 's dad basically the    answer is simple the investment just dilutes everyone using the example from above we 're two founders we gave ourselves    2500 shares each so we each own 50 and now we go to a vc and he    offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the    company 1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares so you make another 2500 shares    and give them to the vc he owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd that 's    all there is to it what happens if not all the early employees need to take a salary a lot of times you have one founder who has a little bit of money    saved up so she decides to go without a salary for a while while the    other founder who needs the money takes a salary it is tempting    just to give the founder who went without pay more shares to make up    for it the trouble is that you can never figure out the right amount    of shares to give this is just going to cause conflicts do n't    resolve these problems with shares instead just keep a ledger of how    much you paid each of the founders and if someone goes without    salary give them an iou later when you have money you 'll pay them    back in cash in a few years when the money comes rolling in or even    after the first vc investment you can pay back each founder so that    each founder has taken exactly the same amount of salary from the    company should n't i get more equity because it was my idea no ideas are pretty much worthless it is not worth the arguments it would cause to    pay someone in equity for an idea if one of you had the idea but you    both quit your jobs and started working at the same time you should    both get the same amount of equity working on the company is what    causes value not thinking up some crazy invention in the shower what if one of the founders does n't work full time on the company then they 're not a founder in my book nobody who is not working full    time counts as a founder anyone who holds on to their day job gets a    salary or ious but not equity if they hang onto that day job until    the vc puts in funding and then comes to work for the company full    time they did n't take nearly as much risk and they deserve to receive    equity along with the first layer of employees what if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods patents domain names etc to the company great pay for that in    cash or ious not shares figure out the right price for that computer    they brought with them or their clever word processing patent and    give them an iou to be paid off when you 're doing well trying to buy    things with equity at this early stage just creates inequality    arguments and unfairness how much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees that depends on market conditions realistically if the investors end    up owning more than 50 the founders are going to feel like    and lose motivation so good investors do n't get greedy    that way if the company can bootstrap without investors the founders    and employees might end up owning 100 of the company interestingly    enough the pressure is pretty strong to keep things balanced between    investors and founders employees an old rule of thumb was that at ipo    time when you had hired all the employees and raised as much money as    you were going to raise the investors would have 50 and the    founders employees would have 50 but with hot internet companies in    2011 investors may end up owning a lot less than 50 conclusion there is no one size fits all solution to this problem but anything    you can do to make it simple transparent straightforward and    above all fair will make your company much more likely to be    successful the above awesome answer came from the stack exchange beta site for startups which has now closed i expect that this equity distribution question which is strongly tied to personal finance will come up more times in the future so i have copied the content originally posted   all credit for this excellent answer is due to joel a for the startups se beta site and co founder of stack exchange

mark is a mixture of hard work intelligence and   he spent more time working reading or studying when others were out drinking   that 's the story of most successful people   they spend their time taking risk so they make their own luck   sure it boils down to luck but you ca n't be lucky if you do n't play   what people like to hear worse is that they can make their own success   though success on the facebook level seems to have some aspects of luck most successful people are successful because they spend their time taking risk   if you are working for someone else you are not taking a risk   if you are off you are not really taking a risk   unless you are specifically building project for profit or performing some service this luck will never shine down on you

my observations is that this seems like hardly enough to kill    inflation is he right or are there better ways to invest the tax deferral part of the equation is n't what dominates regarding whether your 401k beats 30 years of inflation it is the return on investment   if your 401k account tanks due to a prolonged market crash just as you retire then you might have been better off stashing the money in the bank   remember 401k money at now + 30 years is not a guaranteed return though many speak as though it were   there is also the question as to whether fees will eat up some of your return and whether the funds your 401k invests in are good ones i 'm uneasy with the autopilot nature of the typical 401k non strategy it 's too much the standard thing to do in the u.s. it 's too and strikes me as ponzi like   it has been a winning strategy for some already sure and maybe it will work for the next 30 100 years or more   i just do n't know   there are also changes in policy or other unknowns that 30 years will bring so it takes faith i do n't have to lock away a large chunk of my savings in something i ca n't touch without hassle and penalty until then for that reason i have contributed very little to my 403b previously contribute nothing now though employer does automatically   i have no match and have built up a sizable cash savings some of which may be used to start a business or buy a house with a small or no mortgage thereby guaranteeing at least not paying mortgage interest   i am open to changing my mind about all this but am glad i 've been able to at least save a chunk to give me some options that i can exercise in the next 5 10 years if i want instead of having to wait 25 or more

you are discounting the cash used the discount rate for cash should be whatever you determine is your risk premium over the risk free rate not the equity growth rate if equity growth rate is above your determined required return the equity investment is wealth destroying and if it is above that then it is wealth increasing    the difficulty i see is that the scenario is all wrong what you are really after is a rent vs buy decision do i take this money and rent a place or do i buy a house in either case you could invest the remainder after paying your rent mortgage in the equity market no   so what really matters is the difference in cost between renting and buying    let   growth rate   rent = rent m = mortgage payment   i = income   ha =   home value appreciation   now the question is is renting or buying a better decision two scenarios renting first   pmt = i rent   i y =   n = time horizon in years   gain from cf left after paying rent     then discount to present day at your required rate of return to find present value   now scenario for buying this is more complicated because you are investing two different cf streams at different rates and have to calculate both and add them together   1 cf 1 the mortgage payments buy you equity in the house which appreciates hopefully but can be extremely volatile this is the cf stream scenario one does nt have when renting the rent payments poof disappear forever and you earn nothing on them 2 the income left after mortgage payment which can be invested at the market rate measured the same way as above this is extremely simplistic and does nt take into account expected maintenance property taxes and other costs intrinsic to the investment it also does nt take into account the lost down payment setting you well behind the renter    tl dr it is complicated but you determine the required rate based on the perceived risk of the investment and your particular views   and it does nt matter what expected growth rates are since any investment with an expected growth rate below your required rate is wealth destroying since you are paying for something which returns cash flows too small for its risk level if you use growth rates as discount rates then all your investments will net to zero

in the current system it would be irresponsible to pay more than they have to but if corporations get to be amoral people they need tighter regulation because what 's good for maximizing profits is rarely good for people if you want to argue that businesses are more important than people then perhaps profits should receive favorable treatment to people but i highly doubt lincoln was talking about walmart when he was talking about a government by the people and for the people there 's plenty of businesses out there charging a fair markup for a quality product or service and paying a fair wage it 's not highly profitable but i think we 've been watching the race to the bottom by publicly traded companies maximizing quarterly returns at the expense of literally anything and everything else something 's got ta give   also your argument implies that you 're ok subsidizing walmart 's profit margin with your tax money their employees are receiving government benefits because walmart does n't pay them well enough to afford it on their own figure $ split 190 m ways we us workers all gave walmart a little over $ 30 each

directors can be held responsible for the liabilities of the corporation see this wikipedia article and especially if it was clear that was the reason for the arrangement you might well find this happening that said i know a canadian who sold his house to a corporation he already owned he was doing consulting work through it at the in his opinion ridiculously high amount it had been assessed for property tax purposes the company paid and claimed any and all expenses including paying for the lawn to be and the house to be painted he lived in it at a reduced rent this rent was then income to the company in exchange for looking after it he was very happy with the arrangement he was losing the no income tax when you sell your primary residence benefit we have here but since he expected to never be able to sell it for more than the amount the company had paid he was n't worried if the company exists for no reason other than to shelter income hide you from liability and reduce your taxes then i would expect it would get you some unwanted attention and possibly some rulings you did n't like if the company exists for a real purpose and has income and expenses that outweigh whatever games you 're playing with cars and homes you might be able to achieve this you need to work out what the benefits other than liabilities would be and whether they are worth the hassle

i recently moved out from my parents place after having built up sufficient funds and gone through these questions myself i live near louisville ky which has a significant effect on my income cost of living and cost of housing factor that into your decisions to answer your questions in order when do i know that i 'm financially stable to move out when you have enough money set aside for all projected expenses for 3 6 months and an emergency fund of 4 10 k depending on how large a safety net you want or need note that part of the reason for the emergency fund is as a buffer for the things you wo n't realize you need until you move out such as pots or chairs it also covers things being more expensive than anticipated should i wait until both my emergency fund is at least 6 months of pay    and my loans in my parents names is paid off to free up money 6 months of pay is not a good measuring stick use months of expenses instead in general student loans are a small enough cost per month that you just need to factor them into your costs when should i factor in the newer car investment how much should i    have set aside for the car do the car while you are living at home this allows you to put more than the minimum payment down each month and you can get ahead that looks good on your credit and allows refinancing later for a lower minimum payment when you move out finally it gives you a sense of the monthly cost while you still have leeway to adjust things   depending on new used status of the car set aside around 3 5 k for a down payment that gives you a decent rate without too much haggling trouble should i get an apartment for a couple years before looking for my own    house not unless you want the flexibility of an apartment in general living at home is cheaper if you intend to eventually buy property in the same area an apartment is throwing money away if you want to move every few years an apartment can depending on the lease give you that how much should i set aside for either investment apartment vs    house 10 20 k for a down payment if you live around louisville ky be very about the price of your house and this gives you the best of everything the biggest mistake you can make is trying to get into a place too early banks pay attention to the down payment for a good reason it indicates commitment care and an ability to go the distance in general a mortgage is 30 years you wo n't pay it off for a long time so plan for that is there anything else i should be doing taking advantage of with my    money during this living at home period before i finally leave the    nest if there is something you want now 's the time to get it you can make snap purchases on furniture motorcycles games and not hurt yourself take vacations since there is room in the budget if you 've thought about moving to a different state for work travel there for a weekend week and see if you even like the place look for deals on things you 'll need when you move out towels furniture and so forth can be bought cheaply and you can get quality but it takes time to find these deals pick up activities with monthly expenses boxing dancing gym memberships and so forth become much more difficult to fit into the budget later they also give you a better credit rating for a recurring expense and allow you to get a feel for how things like a monthly utility bill will work finally get involved in various investments a 401k is only the start so look at penny stocks indexed funds etfs or other things to diversify with check out local businesses or start something on the side experiment and have fun

i 'd encourage you to use rules of thumb and back of the envelope here are some ideas that could be useful the problem with any kind of detailed calculations is the number of unknowns there are some really complex calculators out there for example see caution horrible user interface but seemed to work that will include all kinds of factors and run monte carlo and the whole thing but in my opinion it 's just as good or better to say save at least 15 of income until you have 25x what you spend or some other such rule of thumb here 's my little blog post on savings and investing fwiw http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ another note there 's sort of an ideology of how to live embedded in any retirement recommendation and you might want to take the time to reflect on that and consciously choose a book on this topic is your money or your life by robin which is a sort of radical you should save everything possible to achieve financial independence as early as possible argument i did n't go for their plan but i think it 's thought provoking a newer book that may be more appealing is called the number   and it 's about your question exactly it 's more designed to get you thinking while your money or your life has a particular answer in mind both have some math and some rules of thumb though they are n't focused on that a kind of general takeaway from these books might be first think about your expenses what are you trying to accomplish in life how would you like to spend your time and then ask how much money you absolutely need to accomplish that and focus on accomplishing your goals spending your time as much as you can on what you 'd like to spend it on i 'm this with a generic recommendation to save enough to spend 80 of your income in retirement which this idea that you should spend as much as possible every year before and after you retire lots of people do like that idea but it 's not a law of the universe or something it 's just one popular approach

the brokerage firm will purchase shares for the dividend paid in a account for the security of the issuer and then they will distribute fractional shares among all their clients that chose div reinvest   they will only have to buy 1 extra share to account for the fractional portion of what they allocate   the structure of the market does not permit trading of fractional shares there is generally not any impact to the market place for div reinvest with the exception of certain securities that pay large dividends that are not liquid sometimes this occurs in   preferred securities where a large amount of div reinvestment could create a large market order that has market impact   most brokers place market orders for the opening on the day following the payment of the dividend when you sell the fractional portion same process as full shares are sold into the market and the fractional if traded between you and the brokers account   if it creates a full share for the broker has .6 shares and you sell him .5 they would likely flip that out to the street with the full share portion of your order this would not have impact to outstanding shares and all cost are operational and with the broker handling the div reinvestment service

this is a purely numerical statement that you should be able to check and you cpa friend should be able to prove if true   the general advice i think is that you should not use your retirement funds this way but general advice does not apply equally well to everyone    you did n't give enough information for us to compute the answer so you 're on your own there   if you do this or have the cpa do it make sure that it accounts for all pluses and minuses that you 'll have   on the minus side you get any direct penalties in addition to potential loss of right to contribute for a period of time so make sure you consider both aspects especially to any degree that you would lose an employer contribution or match   also consider the fact that the money already in is tax advantaged and you wo n't be able to replace that amount later   so there will be a compounding effect to what was lost this may or may not be balanced by a mortgage interest deduction down the road my guess is that it will not but again the details of your situation may dictate a different path   the mortgage interest deduction decreases each year as you pay more principal whereas the compounding from being tax deferred tends to increase each year

when you do your taxes you have two choices for your deductions you can take the standard deduction or you can choose to itemize your deductions if you itemize your deductions you use form 1040 schedule a.   by looking at schedule a you can see the list of deductions that are itemized on schedule a itself you only list a total for each of these broad categories in some cases this is sufficient detail however for certain deductions finer detail may be required and you may have to submit additional forms showing this detail for example on the medical expense line you generally only list a total of medical expenses details are only supplied to the irs upon request for gifts to charity you need to supply more details on form if your gifts are worth more than $ 500   these requirements can be found in the instructions for schedule a. as noted by in the comments the above deductions that are a part of your itemized deductions are called below the line deductions because they are subtracted after the adjusted gross income line and are only able to be deducted if you choose to decline the standard deduction there are other deductions that are available whether or not you itemize these above the line deductions are found on form 1040 lines 23 35 if you look at these lines on the form you 'll see the different types of deductions that are called out here some of these deductions require additional details on other forms for example the hsa deduction requires details on form 8889   if you have a business your business expenses are not part of your itemized deductions at all and do not appear on schedule a anywhere instead your business expenses get subtracted from your business 's revenue and the resulting profit or loss is what is reported on your form 1040   different types of businesses report these expenses differently if you have a sole proprietorship the details of your business 's expenses are reported on schedule c. on this schedule part ii is devoted to deductible business expenses take a look at schedule c and you 'll see that lines 8 27 are different categories of expenses that get called out on this schedule

in essence the problem that the op identified is not that the fx market itself has poor liquidity but that retail fx brokerage sometimes have poor counterparty risk management the problem is the actual business model that many fx brokerages have most fx brokerages are themselves customers of much larger money center banks that are very well capitalized and provide ample liquidity by liquidity i mean   the ability to put on a position of relatively decent size long eurusd say at any particular time with a small price impact relative to where it is trading for spot fx intraday bid ask spreads are extremely small on the order of fractions of pips for majors eur usd gbp jpy chf even in extremely volatile situations it rarely becomes much larger than a few pips for positions of 1 to 10 million usd equivalent notional value in the institutional market given that retail traders rarely trade that large a position the fx spot market is essentially very liquid in that respect the problem is that there are retail brokerages whose business model is to encourage excessive trading in the hopes of capturing that spread but not guaranteeing that it has enough capital to always meet all client obligations what does get retail traders in trouble is that most are unaware that they are not actually trading on an exchange like with stocks every bid and ask they see on the screen the moment they execute a trade is done against that fx brokerage and not some other trader in a transparent central limit order book this has some deep implications one is the nifty attribute that you rarely pay commission to do fx trades unlike in stock trading why because they build that cost into the quotes they give you in markets buyers and sellers cancel out they just capture that spread which is the desired outcome when that business model functions well   there are two situations where the brokerage 's might lose money and capital becomes very important in extremely volatile markets every one of their clients may want to sell for some reason this forces the fx brokers to accumulate a large position in the opposite side that they have to offload they will trade in the institutional market with other brokerages to net out their positions so that they are as close to flat as possible in the process since bid ask spreads in the institutional market is tighter than within their own brokerage by design they should still make money while not taking much risk however if they are not fast enough or if they do not have enough capital the brokerage 's position might move against them too quickly which may cause them lose all their capital and go belly up the brokerage is net flat but there are huge offsetting positions amongst its clients in the example of the swiss franc revaluation in early 2015 a sudden pop of 10 20 would have effectively meant that money in client accounts that were on the wrong side of the trade could not cover those on the other side when this happens it is theoretically the brokerage 's job to close out these positions before it wipes out the value of the client accounts however it would have been impossible to do so since there were no prices in between the instantaneous pop in which the brokerage could have terminated their client 's losing positions and offload the risk in the institutional market since it 's extremely hard to ask for more money than exist in the client accounts those with strong capital positions simply ate the loss such as oanda those that fared worse went belly up the irony here is that the more leverage the brokerage gave to their clients the less money would have been available to cover losses in such an event using an example to illustrate say client a is long 1 contract at $ 100 and client b is short 1 contract at $ 100 the brokerage is thus net flat if the brokerage had given 10:1 leverage then there would be $ 10 in each client 's account now instantaneously market moves down $ 10 client a loses $ 10 and client b is up $ 10 brokerage simply closes client a 's position gives $ 10 to client b. the brokerage is still long against client b however so now it has to go into the institutional market to be short 1 contract at $ 90 the brokerage again is net flat and no money actually goes in or out of the firm had the brokerage given 50:1 leverage however client a only has $ 2 in the account this would cause the brokerage close client a 's position the brokerage is still long against client b but has only $ 2 and would have to eat the loss for $ 8 to honor client b 's position and if it could not do that then it technically became insolvent since it owes more money to its clients than it has in assets this is exactly the reason there have been regulations in the us to limit the amount of leverage fx brokerages are allowed to offer to clients to assure the brokerage has enough capital to pay what is owed to clients

the trump tax plan is strongly modeled on the kansas 's republican governor 's tax plan   given that it was fairly radical in size corporate tax rate to zero and eventually it was repealed by the republican kansas legislature i think folks should look at some of the research on the great kansas tax cut blog kansas tax cut   ps trump 's current tax plan is pretty different than the tax plan he on and talked about in his standard speech which was pretty populist and not shocking i.e. a broad middle class tax cut vs. the current plan which is geared primarily to benefit the rich and corporations

thanks for explaining added value i do not think professors are much if any part of the problem it really does come down to cost in my eyes year over year costs go up as a country we are pricing ourselves out of education it will continue to create disparity and eventually you will have a large segment of the population saying no way on college i can get a lot of free on and other sites    as numbers drop colleges are going to be hard pressed to really make money   i often ponder what that money is spent for i know a chunk goes to sports and other not necessarily academic activities   i have advocated for years to people who can not afford to go to a college to attend community college get an associates and make their decision from there    with exception of the ivy league schools i do not think there is enough value in 4 yr degree 's in the job market i am in it and the number of people i have worked with who have had degrees since the early days of my career has dropped greatly many of them had non computer degrees and jumped job fields to fill gaps early on   just my two cents i really believe that most professors are not the problem unless they are paid huge sums and even that 's dependent on a lot of things

i knew before i clicked that this was going to refer to i do n't mean to his scholarship but he 's clearly a guy with an agenda for example the reason this number is so outrageous is because 2010 was a terrific year for the stock market and a to bad year for employment and wage growth stocks tend to be a leading indicator while job growth is a trailing one in fact also tries to make hay by comparing the first two years of this recovery with the entirety of the much longer 90 's and 00 's booms if you target your analysis at years when the market has recovered but jobs have n't of course you 'll see greater income gains for the investor class   but by that same token could have been putting out press releases for studies in 2008 showing how the rich were getting absolutely screwed by losing the lion 's share of their income as the market tanked while ordinary folks were perhaps losing only a little because the full force of job losses had n't hit yet but he did n't afaik

there are a number of reasons i 'm in agreement with a house that is worth $ 300,000 or $ 50,000 of equity in a house and $ 225,000 in the bank   so the update to the first comment should be a paid off house worth $ 300 k or a house with $ 150 k equity and $ 275 k in the retirement account   edit on reflection an interesting question but i wonder how many actually have this choice when a family budgets for housing and uses a 25 target this number is n't much different for rent vs for the mortgage cost so how exactly do the numbers work out for a couple trying to save the next 80 of the home cost a normal qualifying ration allows a house that costs about 3x one 's income a pay in full couple might agree to be conservative and drop to are they on an austerity plan saving 20 of their income in addition to paying the rent since the money must be invested conservatively is it keeping up with house prices after 10 years inflation would be pushing the house cost up 30 or so so is this a 12 15 year plan   i 'm happy to ignore the tax considerations but i question the math of the whole process it would seem there 's a point where the mortgage plus expenses add up to less than the rent and i 'd suggest that 's the point to buy the house

is there anything i need to ask or consider during my negotiation    process based on the fact that they probably will soon be own by    another company very tricky situation you are being hired by one company and one hiring manager but you already know that there are big changes ahead what you do n't know is how all those changes will actually play out you will at least end up working for a different company   i 've worked for several companies in the past that were acquired and some that acquired other companies after each acquisition the nature of the company changed significantly some teams were let go completely often overhead departments like accounting marketing etc that were handled at the corporate level some teams were moved to a different location others stayed the same sometimes management changed in one case i was working for a new boss who worked out of the home office in another state the time frame for these changes ranged from immediately to several years after the acquisition for me at least some of the things that made the job appealing earlier typically were gone   try as best you can to ask questions about the acquisition and about the nature of the acquiring company if they are allowed to tell you the name of the company that is acquiring them do some searching see if you can find out how the company typically deals with acquisitions do they immediately let almost everyone go keeping only the essential few or do they run new acquisitions as separate divisions and leave them alone for at least a while try to find out from your hiring manager what their expectations are for your specific team post acquisition try to find out if anything within your offer is subject to change post acquisition are you being hired under the old pre acquisition rules or under the new post acquisition rules the fact that you even know the company is being acquired is good often companies can not even divulge that fact until very near the end on the other hand your use of the phrase probably will soon makes me wonder how much is definite here here 's something you might wish to read

a real simple definition or analogy of present value would be the principal or loan amount being lent and the future value as being returning the principal along with cost of borrowing the is the interest you earn on present value the is the interest you pay on future value the first one is the or future value of a $ 1 the second one is the or present value of a $ 1 both these interest factors assume interest is paid annually if the interest payment is made more often within the payment year then interest factors look this way m is the frequency of interest payment the higher this frequency the more of interest you pay or earn and you pay or earn the most interest when compounding occurs on each small fraction of time this entails here e is the 's e   thus the interest factors turn to this the examples only considered a single repayment at future date now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of $ 1 for n number of periods then the present value of all such periodic payment is the principal or amount you borrowed this is the sum of discounted periodic payments as   if we replace with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form this simplifies to   replacing for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of $ 1 the future value of periodic payments in amount of $ 1 can be arrived at multiplying the by giving once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intra year compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield to use as the effect rate is the and calculation for continuous compounding all the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of then the present value of a $ 1 would be as follow once again you would have to use if compounding frequency of interest is intra year now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount q per period to find the present value of series of payments p that increase or decrease per period by an amount q we would do the following calculations here and all of these calculations have been available in add in for finance and incrementally being offered as javascript financial functions library please note that the tad series of the financial functions library for various environments such as excel javascript php ruby and others are property of the author writing this post all of these libraries except one for excel are available for free for public use and the future value of such payments with increments may be found by multiplying the pv by as follows here

bp holdings management on taxes and thier original intents is designed to generate enough revenue to sustain essential public service such as public safety civil infrastructure for communication and transportation and basic health services when you see a government hospital you know your taxes support the upkeep of that institution and when you see soldiers fighting in you can be sure tax went into training them and keeping them fit and equipped to preserve our national security    as essential as tax is to our national existence many do not know the true value of what taxes can do other than what we have mentioned above here are some generally unknown facts about taxes and what you need to do to make full use of their benefits    1 taxes should not favour one group over another   taxes are intended to be neutral and must not cater to any one sector or group of people over another neither should it impose or interfere with individual decision making    what this signifies is that taxes as they were originally conceived had an altruistic purpose meant to benefit people equally without favoring any individual or any societal unit it is a fund to provide services and public amenities for all people alike so whether you earn only so much or make millions you walk or drive over the same road or bridge that taxes helped to build we can not discount the goodwill and welfare taxes have brought to both ancient and modern societies   pay your taxes so you can enjoy them    2 taxes must be predictable    in order for a government to function well it must have some stability in terms of its fiscal health without the necessary funds to run a government chaos would ensue and so taxes must flow into a state ’s coffers at a regular schedule and at a reasonably predictable amount or the oil will run out at a time when the engine of progress badly needs it    now we understand why the state imposes and does not merely request that taxes be paid at a particular time of the year why april for many countries it is the time of the year when people have probably paid off last year ’s debts or recovered from the expenses of the holiday season in the previous year it is also the time when most parents have extra cash because their children are on school vacation unfortunately it is also the time when many people want to spend a vacation so it is either you pay your tax or spend a nice vacation during spring for most people    3 taxes must be simple   assessment and computation of tax and determination should be easily understood by the average taxpayer but this has been forgotten by tax officials in recent years it has not only become more complex in terms of schedule as the tax calendar seems to nowadays it has also become so hard to decipher through the many pages now incorporated in the tax return the best thing to do if you have extra cash is to let an accountant do your tax    4 taxes must not be forced but enforced to encourage voluntary compliance   the key is convenience as much as possible it is the tax duty to encourage voluntary compliance among taxpayers through creative implementation without making people feel they are being harassed or unduly burdened ordinary taxpayers have to go through a lot of stress figuring out forms and lining up to pay their tax perhaps a more convenient way can be implemented using modern technology and the banking system if we can pay bills in malls or online now why can not tax be paid in the same way    5 taxes earmarked for specific purposes must result in direct benefits   certain taxes such as gasoline tax for road maintenance must be dedicated to the particular purpose they were intended based on a direct cost benefit link today much of the corruption in government circles arise from taxes or diverting them from their intended purposes thus losing sight of the original intent of the tax    what can the taxpayer do to prevent these things from happening aside from joining protest rallies or talking to your congress representative you can actually form or join small groups that could create awareness among people through the media or internet this is already being done on facebook and twitter how effective it is may be hard to measure but time will come when a critical mass of concerned people will have a force of a virtual army that can change the tide of events in a society    inevitable as taxes may be enjoying their ultimate benefits can be a much better motivation that spending our time looking for ways to avoid them

at first this seems like it makes sense assuming like you say in your question that you are perfectly confident in your ability to repay even if you need to pay the balance in full if you lose your job then this seems like a guaranteed 4 return and a reasonable part of your retirement portfolio where it falls apart though is that you 're paying yourself you 're just taking the money out of one pocket and putting it in another so really you 're getting a guaranteed 0 return you 're losing the compounding growth of the loan amount while it 's out of your accounts and the fact that you can afford the 4 interest means you could have been putting that into a requirement account as well aside from the loan so it does n't really count as interest in the sense that your money is passively making money for you so ultimately no it should n't count as part of your bond allocation

according to this q&a by a houston law professor the law however is not designed to interfere with an individual 's right to stop payment on a valid check because of a dispute with someone if he did n't deliver as promised you do not owe the money and have the right to stop payment assuming that you had enough money in the bank to cover the check stopping payment is not a crime i found several other pages essentially saying the same thing   all the usual disclaimers apply i am not a lawyer this is not legal advice etc   in particular laws might vary by state basically though it does n't seem there 's any reason why you ca n't stop payment on the check just because you feel like it   if you then provide a cashier 's check for the payment your ex partner will not really have anything to complain about   if you 're worried about annoying him by doing this that 's a separate issue but given the situation you describe i do n't see why you should be   if you feel he is being a pain in the neck feel free to be a pain in the neck right back and force him to accept the payment in the manner you decide instead of allowing him to string you along note two things obviously if you have reason to believe the guy will sue you you should act with caution   also i 'm not suggesting withdrawing payment completely only stopping the check and issuing a new payment that you do n't have to wait on e.g. cashier 's check

the fed does charge interest like you said they do give profits to the treasury each year but not all of their profits are sent back they also pay dividends to the banks that hold stock in the fed i think it is like 7   but   yeah since the fed does pay the rest back to the treasury any interest it pays is basically moot   gt;if you do n't already know this is the modern version of printing money   this is the larger concern if they are just buying bonds to implement monetary policy that is one thing however if they are financing the government debt because foreign investors are strapped for cash or do n't want it that is a bigger problem i have n't been following closely enough to know if that is an issue here but it seems treasury bills are in high demand at the moment so i do n't think the fed is actually financing our budget just keeping rates low which does create problems but that 's a different conversation

what prevents a company from doing secondary public stock offerings on regular basis the primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds that can be utilized for funding the business if no funding is needed i.e. company has sufficient funds or no expansion plans this funding creates a drag and existing shareholder including promoters loose value for example with the current 100 invested the company is able to generate say 125 25 as profit if additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering then with 200 the company should mark around 250 else it looses value so if the company took additional 100 and did not is not able to deploy in market on 200 they still make 25 as profit its bad there are other reasons i.e. to fight off hostile acquisition or dilute some of promoters shares etc thus the reasons for company to do a secondary po are few and doing it often reduces the value for primary share holders as well as minority share holders

i thought the finance buff made a pretty solid argument for a financial advisor the other day but 1.5 is too expensive the blog post at finance buff suggests several alternatives he also has the great suggestion to use vanguard 's cheap financial planning service if you go with vanguard a lot of investing advice fails to consider the human factor sure it 'd be great to rebalance exactly every 6 months and take precisely the amount of risk to theoretically maximize returns but yeah right it 's well known that in the aggregate individual investors go to cash near market bottoms and then buy near market tops it 's not that they do n't know the right thing to do necessarily it 's just that the emotional aspect is stronger than any of us expect you should n't rely on sticking to your investments any more than you rely on sticking to your diet and exercise program the theoretically optimal solution is not the real world people are involved optimal solution my own blog post on this suggests a balanced fund rather than a financial advisor but i think the right financial advisor could well be a better approach http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ anyway i think people are too quick to think of the main risk as volatility and to think of investing as simple sure in theory it is simple but the main risk is yourself fear at market bottoms greed at market tops laziness the rest of the time so there 's potential value in taking yourself out of the picture the human part is the part that is n't simple on whether to get a financial advisor in general not just for investments see also what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

i do n't see a way out of this that does n't involve economic upheaval on a scale that would make 2008 look like boom times   economic upheaval could also be considered economic re formation and re organization   the danger lies in the political sphere that the problems inherent in any such even will create a mob that makes demands which inevitably result in strong man rule i.e. a full blown dictator   americans themselves that we have never had this in the past when in fact we have several times most notably fdr we just retained the forms of a democracy and the labels of a republic and then we got very lucky that the dictator died when he did and power transitioned to someone who was a token place holder and not party to his grand scheme and so unwound the whole thing   iow we may be headed over a proverbial cliff but that does n't necessarily mean that it will be an apocalyptic affair just that it will be tough to weather and get through though the agile will still manage and there is potential hope for the other side however minimal

thinking of personal residence as investment is how we got the bubble and crash in housing prices and the great recession there is no guarantee that a house will appreciate or even retain value it 's also an extremely illiquid item selling it especially if you 're seeking a profit can take a year or more housing is not guaranteed to appreciate constantly or at all tastes change and renovations rarely pay for themselves things wear out and have costs neighborhoods change in popularity without rental income and the ability to write off some of the costs as business expense it is n't clear the tax advantage closes that gap as the advantage is limited to the taxes upon your mortgage interest by deducting that from agi   if this is the flavor of speculation you want to engage in fine but i 've seen people screw themselves over this way and wind up forced to sell a house for a loss by all means hope your home will be profitable count it as part of your net wealth but generally lynch is wrong here or at best oversimplified a house can be an investment or perhaps more accurately a business or your home but unless you 're renting out the other half of a duplex which splits the difference trying to treat it as both is dangerous accounting

stop order is shorter term for stop loss order   the point being that is intended as a protective measure   a buy stop order would be used to limit losses when an investor has sold a stock short   meaning that they have borrowed stock and sold it in hopes that they can take advantage of a decline in the stock 's price by replacing the borrowed stock later at a cheaper price   the idea is to limit losses due to a rising stock price   meanwhile a sell stop order would be used to limit losses on a stock that an investor actually owns by selling it before the price declines further the important thing to keep in mind about stop orders is that they turn into market orders when the stop price is reached   this means that they will be filled at the best available price when the order is actually executed   in fast moving markets this can be a price that is quite different from the stop price a limit order allows an investor to ensure that they do not buy sell a stock at more less than the specified amount the thing to keep in mind is that a limit order is not guaranteed to execute a stop limit order is a combination of a stop loss order and limit order in that it becomes a limit order instead of a market order when the stop price is reached links to definitions stop order stop limit order limit order market order

these products are real but they are n't risk free 1 the bank could go under in that time   are the investments fdic insured 2 your money is locked up for 5 years probably with either no way to get it back out or a stiff penalty for early withdrawal so you risk having a better investment opportunity come along and not having the liquidity to take advantage of it 3 if the market does go down and you get 100 of your principal back the endless ratchet of inflation practically guarantees that $ 10 k will be worth less 5 years from now than it is today so you risk losing purchasing power even if you 're not losing any nominal quantity of money it 's still a fairly low risk investment option particularly if it 's tied to something that you have reason to believe will increase in value significantly faster than inflation in the next 5 years

gt the report i linked to appears to disagree with you about the numbers   i ca n't remember the report you linked anymore but prior to drawdown there was only a single point where contractors outnumbered troops and it was by iirc from the chart 30 40k had 53k contractors under them at that time the math there means that at no point prior to the drawdown did dod contractors outnumber dod personnel   gt;i wonder how it works out from a budgetary perspective for the professional companies who i 've read get paid massive amounts which i imagine must those doing similar work for government pay people like blackwater and their ilk   that was the contracting work that i did the military guys are just but in a pretty positive way certainly not and the government civilians can be annoyed but largely do n't care everyone is in the same boat pretty much you 're all there together the military guys know that if they want to do contracting they need to follow a certain career path which they either choose not to pursue or can not    state department employees had the biggest problem with it because a contractors fuck all of their women and b they make more than the without having a degree it 's very much a thing and they are on the losing end of it kids educated at cornell and now playing do n't appreciate that   pay for me was $ 675 a day for some of the time $ a day for the other part it was decent pay i worked 4 hours a day on average and i got to work out a lot but the food sucked and there were too few girls and the ones that were there you did n't want them or at least i did n't but i 've seen some of the best looking guys i 've ever met dick down some ugly girls in country and there was no way that i was about to fight with them over the stretch marked or busted looking scraps

yes you are right as per my understanding while doing trade you must consider specially for starters like me the volume of the stock you are trading in should be high enough to keep you secure for quick in and out whenever the bid volume is more than the ask volume the prices will move up and vice versa to give an example if a stock is at 100 points and there are bids the transaction will occur when either the bidder agrees to pay the ask price case 1 he pays 101 his bid offer will disappear and the next best ask will be 102 and the current price will be 101 which was the last transaction or when the person giving ask price agrees to deal at best bid which was 99 in which case the share will go down

gt all food companies are required to have the answers to a set of questions available via email or website phone or standard mail those questions are determined by a combination of independent panel and consumer polling what those questions are may change over time allowing for a reasonably generous grace period for the companies to prepare   why should we trust big to release accurate information that may be to their business this is n't like government where records have to be kept for requests i 'd expect them to pursue their own interests above all else as they have done now by altering the laws in their favor   gt i also think we need a series of third party organizations rather than the usda organic system we have what 's acceptable and what is n't is super arguable and rather than just taking the standard that exists which imo is not meaningful folks can choose which standard they wish to head combined with the mandated transparency above this would lower costs by removing the need for active investigation and lead to more informed decision making on the part of the consumers   the problem is that the usda has been underfunded to the point that it 's completely incapable of doing the amount of inspections needed having multiple sets of competing standards would be confusing to the consumer and unless the terms labeled have legal weight it ultimately does n't mean anything i recall all the products as organic until legal standards were published defining the term   consumers do n't know what they need to be educated about and rely on reporters and experts to make recommendations and revelations on their behalf today these groups are neutered to maximize agricultural profits and public health is suffering agricultural workers are suffering   gt combined with the mandated transparency above this would lower costs by removing the need for active investigation and lead to more informed decision making on the part of the consumers   i suggest the following alternatives   fund the usda properly allow journalists to report on our food supply chain without legal revoke all laws that restrict the first amendment when it comes to our food disparaging a food product should not be illegal in a free country public health should be more important than sales of products

there 's really no general rule of thumb there are a lot of factors that go into that decision    it highly depends on the type of business your financials and business strategy    it 's a double edged sword because retained earnings lose the potential to provide a higher return while being cash poor can easily kill a company   it sounds like you 're experiencing significant growth if there is high market potential and expansion prospects a safe bet is to keep about 3 months of operating costs accessible while leveraging a bank loan to fund the growth   that 's the best answer i can provide without having any information

what you are describing is called following or going over a budget there is no debt or loans in the scenario you are describing simply put a budget is when you allocate a certain amount of your income for expenses in various categories and a certain amount for savings   so lets say you earn $ 100 a month if you budget $ 50 in expenses every month then that means you try not to spend more then $ 50 a month and the rest you save in any given month you may go over your self imposed budgeted amount for expenses that simply means you are over the amount for that month but that does not make you in debt it just means you did n't meet your goal for that month or whatever time period you created however if you do this then you clearly do n't have a realistic budget because the idea behind a budget is a plan that you can realistically meet on a consistent basis sometimes you may have to break it but it should be made in such a way that if you work at it it is consistently achievable if not then you need to rethink your budget instead of thinking in terms of taking loans from yourself i would encourage you to think in terms of saving up for goals and only spending money from those goal funds in this way you are not arbitrarily spending money that would instead go into savings but rather explicitly setting money aside for those goals this will also help you to see where exactly your money is going and also help you to prioritize your financial goals

to me it depends on things like your net worth debt and how other assets are invested    currently you have 25 k invested in the company you work for    if you have 100 k in student loans are a renter and 12 k in your 401 k then i would recommend exercising almost all of your options   in that case you have a much to large part of your world wrapped up in your company if you have 250 k in your 401 k own a home and have an emergency fund with no debt then you are fine with letting it ride   you can afford to absorb a loss of 25 k without wrecking your net worth more than likely you are somewhere in between just statistics speaking there   so why not exercise some of them now with the purpose of improving your financial situation   say do a 1/3 now and when they come available    when 401ks were first invented people put almost all of their money in their company stock   they lost just about everything when the company went down in value and were often a victim of layoffs the issue   this is akin to the same situation   most financial advisers recommend against putting any 401 k money to company stock or at least limiting the amount

stop orders and stop limit orders typically do not execute during extended hours after the general market session has closed stop orders are market orders and market orders especially are not executed during extended hours although there are exceptions because a broker can say one thing and do another thing with the way order types are presented to customers vs what their programming actually does the regulatory burden is a slap on the wrist so you need to ask the broker what their practices are orders created during normal market hours do not execute in extended sessions different orders would have to be made during the extended session your stop order should execute if the normal market hour price stays below your stop price so a stop limit would actually be worse here because a stop limit will create a limit order which may never get hit since it is above the best bid best ask

these statements are n't necessarily contradictory in the first case investors are bearish because they anticipate selling in the future because all the interested buyers have bought so all that remains in the short run are people willing to sell and therefore drive down the price   in the second case the trend is strengthened because the increase in volume indicates that the price movement interested a lot of traders the trend could be bullish or bearish   the statements are n't contradictory because the second case could very well lead to the first case for example if an increase in price is coupled with an increase in volume this could indicate that the positive trend is strengthening second case traders are becoming more interested in the price move so they buy   however once all of the traders who are willing to enter the market long do so we 're in the first case investors realize that all of the traders who were interested in buying have bought so they become bearish because they expect selling to start soon

there 's another line of business based on the theory of perpetual incremental growth it 's called a pyramid scheme   in the there were two general types of stock growth stocks and income stocks    growth stocks were generally smaller businesses that were still well growing you did n't expect much of a dividend from them because they were reinvesting profits into growing into new markets the focus was on capital growth    once a company got fairly large and mature then the expectation of capital growth off because back then reasonable investors recognized it 's insane to expect that a company can grow forever then while there may be some ongoing capital growth the major focus was on dividend income getting a piece of the profits a large established company could pull in    the dotcom among other things broke that people got obsessed with capital growth and instant returns the idea of a decent yield over time became laughable instead a company had to show a percentage year over year growth or they got by wall street    if you put one penny on the first square of a then two pennies on the next then four pennies on the square after that once you fill the entire how much money do you have

stock index funds are likely but not certainly to be a good long term investment   in countries other than the usa there have been 30 + year periods where stocks either underperformed compared to bonds or even lost value in absolute terms   this suggests that it may be an to assume that they always do well in the long term   furthermore it may suggest that they are persistently overvalued for the risk and perhaps due for a long term correction   if everybody assumes they 're safe the equity risk premium is likely to be eaten up putting all of your money into them would for most people be taking an unnecessary risk   you should cover some other asset classes too   if stocks do very well a portfolio with some allocation to more stable assets will still do fairly well   if they crash a portfolio with less risky assets will have a better chance of being at least adequate

most likely that 's the amount of interest that accrued on the loan while you were in school   if you had paid that amount before you would have just paid off accrued interest and your loan balance would have stayed the same since you did not pay the interest it will be added to your loan balance and you will just pay it off as part of the loan plus compounded interest    if you pay off your loan at 5 over 30 years hopefully you wo n't but that 's what they 're amortized for that $ 350 will compound and become $   essentially you 're borrowing $ 350 at 5 interest for 30 years hopefully that motivates you to pay it off sooner that that

i would like to establish credit history have heard it 's useful to    gain employment and makes it easy to rent an apartment higher credit scores will make it easier with landlords that 's true as to employment they do background checks which means that they usually wo n't like bad things but wo n't care about the good things or no things they 'll know you 're a foreigner anyway is it safe to assume that this implies i have no history whatsoever probably but you can verify pulling through do n't go around giving your personal information everywhere is taking out a secured loan the only way for me no but it 's one of the easiest better would be getting a secured credit card not loan for loan you 'll have to pay interest for a credit card assuming you pay off all your purchases immediately you will only pay the credit card fees for secured credit cards they charge 100 yearly fees so do shop around the prices vary a lot if you 're using it wisely after a year it will be converted to a regular credit card and the collateral will be returned to you with interest which is actually very competitive last i heard it was around 2 twice as much as the online savings accounts as to a secured loan you 'll be paying 4 to cu for your own money does n't make any sense at all for me for credit cards you 'll at least get some value for your money convenience additional fraud protection etc the end result will be the same usually the credit starts to build up after ~6 12 months that 's why after a year your secured cc will be converted to a regular one make sure to have the statement balance in the range of 10 30 of your credit limit to get the best results would it make much better sense to wait till i get a job then i would    have a fixed monthly salary and can apply for a regular cc directly you can apply but you 'll probably be rejected as i mentioned in another answer elsewhere the system in the us is such that you 're unable to get credit if you do n't already have credit which is kindof a magic circle which you can break with the secured credit card as the least costly solution

i think you need to understand the options better before you go around calling anything worthless   $ 11k in a 1 savings account gets you just over $ 100 each year   obviously you 're not buying with your returns but it 's $ 100 more than your checking account will pay you   and you 're guaranteed to get your money back i think a cd ladder is a great way to store your emergency fund   the interest rate on a cd is typically a bit better than a regular savings account though the money is locked away and while we seem to be on the cusp of a rate increase it might not be the best time to put the money in jail   generally there is some sort of fee or lost interest from cashing a cd early   you 're still guaranteed to get your money back stock trading is probably a terrible idea   if you want some market exposure i 'd take half of the money and buy a low expense s&p etf i would n't put my whole savings if i were you or if i were me   many large brokers have an s&p etf option that you can generally buy with no commission and no loads   vanguard is a great option voo schwab has an s&p mutual fund and there are others   actively trading individual stocks is a great way to let commissions and fees erode your account   there are some startup alternatives with lower fees but personally i would stay away from individual stock picking unless you are in school for finance and have some interest in paying attention and you 're ready to possibly never see the money again   you 're not guaranteed to get your money back there are also money market accounts   these will typically pay some interest based on exposing your funds to some risk   it can be a bit better return than a savings account but i probably would n't bother an ira roth and traditional is just an account wrapper that offers certain tax benefits while placing certain restrictions on the use of some or all of the money until you reach retirement age   as a college student you should probably be more concerned about an emergency fund or traveling than retirement savings though some here may disagree with me   with your ira you can buy cds or annuities or stocks and etfs or any other kind of security   depending on what you buy inside the ira you might not be guaranteed to get your money back first you need to figure out what you 'd like to use the money for   then you need to determine when you 'd need the money for that use   then you need to determine if you can sleep at night while your stock account fluctuates a few percent each day   if you ca n't or you do n't have answers for these questions a savings account is a really low friction low risk place store money and combat inflation while you come up with answers for those questions

as joetaxpayer has commented the markets are littered with the of those who buy into the idea that markets submit readily to formal analysis    financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of   to borrow a concept from mathematics that of a chaotic system one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a structure of chaotic for example the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour in my experience becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve   your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money   if you are currently entertaining such thoughts then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility tl dr it is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends   also in the area of psychology confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind   quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks however these methods require considerable resources and given the   performance of hedge funds in the last few years it does not appear to be worth the investment if you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments then here are a few ideas on where to start there are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments   for example how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another e.g. the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues   also to repeat it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions

this is an excellent question one that i 've before as well here 's how i 've reconciled it in my mind why should we agree that a stock is worth anything after all if i purchase a share of said company i own some small percentage of all of its assets like land capital equipment accounts receivable cash and securities holdings etc as others have pointed out notionally that seems like it should be worth something   however that does n't give me the right to lay claim to them at will as i 'm just a very small minority shareholder the old adage says that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay you for it that share of stock does n't actually give me any liquid control over the company 's assets so why should someone else be willing to pay me something for it as you noted one reason why a stock might be attractive to someone else is as a potentially tax advantaged revenue stream via dividends especially in this low interest rate environment this might well exceed that which i might obtain in the bond market the payment of income to the investor is one way that a   stock might have some inherent value that is attractive to investors as you asked though what if the stock does n't pay dividends as a small shareholder what 's in it for me without any dividend payments there 's no regular method of receiving my invested capital back so why should i or anyone else be willing to purchase the stock to begin with i can think of a couple reasons expectation of a future dividend you may believe that at some point in the future the company will begin to pay a dividend to investors dividends are paid as a percentage of a company 's total profits so it may make sense to purchase the stock now while there is no dividend banking on growth during the no dividend period that will result in even higher capital returns later this kind of your question a non dividend paying stock might be worth something because it might turn into a dividend paying stock in the future expectation of a future acquisition this addresses the original premise of my argument above if i ca n't as a small shareholder directly access the assets of the company why should i attribute any value to that small piece of ownership because some other entity might be willing to pay me for it in the future in the event of an acquisition i will receive either cash or another company 's shares in compensation which often results in a capital gain for me as a shareholder   if i obtain a capital gain via cash as part of the deal then this proves my point the original non dividend paying stock was worth something because some other entity decided to acquire the company paying me more cash than i paid for my shares they are willing to pay this price for the company because they can then reap its profits in the future if i obtain a capital gain via stock in as part of the deal then the process in some sense maybe the new stock pays dividends otherwise perhaps the new company will do something to make its stock worth more in the future based on the same future expectations the fact that ownership in a stock can hold such positive future expectations makes them worth something at any given time if you purchase a stock and then want to sell it later someone else is willing to purchase it from you so they can obtain the right to experience a positive capital return in the future while stock valuation schemes will vary both dividends and acquisition prices are related to a company 's profits this provides a connection between a company 's profitability expectations of future growth and its stock price today whether it currently pays dividends or not

according to an article on bankrate.com from 2011 yes it can hurt your credit with individual liability accounts the employee holds all responsibility for the charges even if the company pays the issuer directly joint liability means the company and employee share the responsibility for payments says author of the survey in both cases if the card is n't paid and the account becomes delinquent it will pop up on the employee 's credit report and dent his or her credit score says barry consumer affairs manager at it does n't matter if the company was supposed to make the payment the repercussions fall on the employee it will impact your score no differently than if you were late on one of your own accounts says usually with corporate credit cards the employee is liable along with the employer for charges on the card   the intent is to provide the employee with an incentive not to misuse the card   however this can be a problem if your company is late in paying bills in the distant past i had a corporate credit card   i was not supposed to have to pay the bill but i did receive a bill in the mail every month   and occasionally the payment was late   in my case these late payments never showed up on my credit report   i ca n't remember now whether or not this card was reported on my credit report at all   and i remember being told when i got the card that i was jointly responsible for the card with the company however your experience may be different   do the on time payments show up on your credit report   if so that may be an indication that a late payment might appear

qe2 will mean that there are about $ 500 billion dollars in existence which were n't there before these dollars will all be competing with the existing dollars for real goods and services so each dollar will be worth a little less and prices will rise a little this is inflation you can probably expect annual inflation for the us dollar over the next several years the market certainly does in the aggregate anyway this is in terms of us based goods and services qe2 will also reduce the amount of other currencies you can get for the same dollar amount the extent to which this will occur is less clear in part because other currencies are also considering quantitative easing your long term savings should probably not be in cash anyway because of the low returns this will probably affect you far more than the impact of quantitative easing as for your savings which do remain in cash what you should do with them depends on how you plan to dispose of them the value of a currency is usually pretty stable in terms of the local economy 's output of goods and services it 's the value in international trade which tends to fluctuate wildly if you keep your savings in the same currency you plan to spend them in they should be able to maintain their value decently well in the intermediate term

all the other answers are spot on but look at it this way really all you mean when you say building equity is accumulating wealth   if that is the goal then having her invest the money in a brokerage e.g. ira account makes a lot more sense   if you ca n't afford the apartment without her then you ca n't afford to pay out her portion of the equity in the future   which means she is not building equity you are just borrowing money from her   the safest and simplest thing for you to do is to agree on a number that does not include equity to be really safe you might want to both sign something in writing that says she will never have an equity stake unless you agree to it in writing   it does n't have to be anything fancy in fact the shorter the better i am thinking about 3 sentences should do the trick if you feel you absolutely have to borrow money from her on a monthly basis to afford your mortgage then i recommend you make it an unsecured loan   just be sure to specify the interest rate even if it is zero and the repayment terms and ideally late payment penalties again nothing fancy 10 sentences maybe   e.g. john doe will borrow x$ per month until jane doe the apartment after such time john doe will begin repaying the loan at per month that said borrowing money from friends and family almost never turns out well at the very least you need to save up a few months of rent so that if you do break up you have time to find another roommate disclaimer i do not have any state issued professional licenses

in practice momentum and trend following are two different ideas albeit similar and often simultaneously   i do n’t know if the book makes a clear between the two but keep this in mind   1 momentum trading is a trade where prices are increasing decreasing and an increasing rate usually confirmed by heavy volume   like you said this can often be at the top of a bubble or nearing a bottom of a crash but not necessarily   it may also occur when trend trading is violated switching directions or a new trend emerging   2 trend following is a trade where one could draw a linear line in a chart up or down at some angle   being able to draw a line into the future would be your projected target   you could buy now and say the trend is up in 365 days the s&amp;p 500 will trade at on the trend we ’ve seen in the past year

you have 1998 2011 income contingent student loans where the interest rate is the lower of 1 + base rate or retail price inflation for the next few years the it 's likely to be 1 + base rate as interest rates stay low and inflation shoots up these loans only need to be repaid in proportion to your salary and if they are n't repaid for long enough e.g. the holder takes a career break for children they are written off so all in all they are pretty good debt to have low interest rate and you might not have to repay them ever it 's likely that your mortgage will have a significantly higher rate than the student loan so you 'd be better off reducing your mortgage also the higher deposit might mean you can get a lower interest rate on the whole mortgage because the lender will see you as a lower risk so the return from investing it in your mortgage would be even greater than the raw interest rate having the student loan outstanding might make some difference to the affordability check for your mortgage payments but lenders will be very familiar with how they work reducing your mortgage payments with the higher deposit should easily counterbalance that your own suggestion is to invest the £ 30 k in a reasonably safe portfolio making 5 there 'll inevitably be some risk in that 5 is a relatively high return in today 's climate but if you 're willing to take that risk you can investigate the effect on your mortgage to see if it 's worth it or not

there 's not usually a point to issuing new stock as a dividend because if you issue new stock it dilutes the existing shareholders by the exact same amount as the dividend so now they have a few more shares great but they 're worth the exact same amount this assumes that all stockholders are equal if there are multiple share classes or people whose rights to a stock are tied to the stock price in some manner options warrants or something then a properly structured stock dividend could serve to enrich one set of shareholders and other rights holders at the expense of another but this is usually illegal if this sort of dividends are popular in china i suspect it is due to some regulatory or tax related circumstances which are not present in the united states markets china is kind of notorious for having unusual capital controls limitations on the exchange of currency and markets which are not very transparent

i think everything in your case is just simply missing one important rule of how credit works essentially your mil can not get a loan you can you are making her a large loan that she can not get for herself that is all that is the essence of what this deal is it is not without interest she makes a financial contribution toward your son you get the deal in 2 years assuming she does n't default she will etc imagine it this way you are sitting in the dealership with the dealer and your mil she wants a loan to pay for the car the dealership says you are way not credit worthy so your mil says why does n't my son in law take out the loan instead now the dealership says sure that 's fine from the dealer 's standpoint every other part of your arrangement is irrelevant boring even the only magic trick is in who takes the loan out no other difference you 're letting your mil pull a car out of her sleeve like a and in taking the deal you 're believing her   this sentence i am pretty sure that the ex mil will not let me down i 've loaned her large sums of money before and she always promptly repaid   is everything you 're making a rather large bet that the things that can go wrong in two years including any situation involving your wife 's welfare are rather miniscule and furthermore that the few times she 's paid you back that did not convince banks and dealer she is more creditworthy justifies her good creditworthiness is the interest worth it do you really believe that your mil needs to wring a car out of you before she would consider contributing to her grandson 's well being which is essentially the interest but wait it 's not everything her daughter my ex wife would drive it for 2 years and then turn the car over to our son even if your mil is creditworthy the woman you described as follows her daughter though is a loose will be holding and returning the collateral in this deal things she can do include so i 'm arguing two points obviously my opinion on this is clear i hope i did a decent job of explaining where the components of this deal credit interest collateral play out in the eyes of a dealer or bank and get lost in the mechanics of the rules you worked out with your family

minimum wage is not supposed to be a living wage working at mcdonalds or a movie theater or a car wash are n't careers you do n't live off of unskilled hourly jobs and you certainly do n't have a family if you ca n't afford it so no minimum wage should n't afford to pay for a 2 bedroom    it 's unbelievable that you think someone should be able to support a family off of 40 hour weeks at mcdonalds the rich lawyers and businessmen who make millions a year are n't working 40 hour weeks granted their time is much more valuable so their 40 hour week probably would bring in a decent amount of money but no they work 80 + hour weeks

fidelity has a good explanation of restricted stock awards for grants that pay in actual shares the employee ’s tax holding period begins at the time of vesting and the employee ’s tax basis is equal to the amount paid for the stock plus the amount included as ordinary compensation income upon a later sale of the shares assuming the employee holds the shares as a capital asset the employee would recognize capital gain income or loss whether such capital gain would be a short- or long term gain would depend on the time between the beginning of the holding period at vesting and the date of the subsequent sale consult your tax adviser regarding the income tax consequences to you so you would count from vesting for long term capital gains purposes   also note the point to include the amount of income you were considered to have earned as a result of the original vesting market value then amount you paid   and of course you reported that as income in right so if you had 300 shares of stock abc granted you in 2014 for a price of $ 5/share and in 2015 100 of those shares vested at fmv $ and in 2016 100 of those shares vested current fmv $ 10/share you had $ 300 in income in 2015 and $ 500 of income in 2016 from this    then in 2017 you sold 200 shares for $

in this answer i wo n't elaborate on the possibilities of fraud or pure human error because something can always go wrong i will however explain why i think you should always keep receipts when the monthly or so time comes to pay your credit card bill your credit card company sends you a list of transactions that list has two primary purposes both of which i would consider equally important while for the former item a receipt is not necessary though it certainly does not hurt showing the receipt along with the bill to provide further proof that the payment was indeed connected to that bill the latter point does require you to store the receipts so you can check item by item whether each of the sums is correct and matched with a receipt at all so unless you can actually memorize all the credit card transactions you did throughout the past one or two months the receipts are the most convenient way of keeping that information until the bill arrives yes your credit card company probably has some safeguards in place to reveal fraud which might kick in in time the criteria are mostly it seems with credit cards or legitimate transactions here getting blocked every now and then simply because some travelling of the actual owner was misinterpreted as theft however it is your money it is your responsibility to discover any issues with the bill just as you would check the monthly transaction list from your bank account line by line ultimately that is why you sign the vendor copy of the receipt when buying something offline if you discover an issue in your list of transactions you have to notify your credit card company that you dispute one of the charges and then the charging vendor has to show that they have your signature for the respective transaction so to summarize do keep your receipts use them to check the list of transactions before paying your credit card bill edit the receipt often can not be replaced with the bill from the vendor the bill is useful for seeing how the sum charged by the respective vendor was created but in turn such bills often do not contain any payment information or when payment was concluded before the bill was printed as sometimes happens in pre paid scenarios such as hotel booking remarks such as payment received without any further indication of which one of your credit cards debit cards bank accounts stored value cards or cash was used

if you keep going over budget with your credit card then stop using the credit card if you plan to pay off the card every month then your balance should always be under whatever your budget is   for example if you budget to spend $ 500 then even though your card has a limit of $ 5,000 you will never carry a balance of over $ 500   most banks have an option to email and or text message you when you pass a certain balance threshold in this instance you would set two notices one when your balance exceeds $ 400 warning you that you 're close need to start paying closer attention and one when you exceed $ 500 additionally maybe you are n't ready to pay for everything with your credit card   i prefer to use mine just for groceries and then pay it off at the end of the month   whatever rewards you get for putting all of your purchases on the card are more than paid for when you cross your budget limit costing you more in interest and fees   perhaps starting with just one type of purchase groceries or gas are good choices as most consumers are fairly consistent in their purchases of both would allow you to ease into using the card until you get used to managing your budget with it personal finances are all about behavior not knowledge   do n't worry too much about slipping up right now and making a mistake just keep practicing good behavior with your credit card and soon managing your budget with it will be as natural for you as when you only used cash

my son who is now 21 has never needed me to cosign on a loan for him and i did not need to establish any sort of credit rating for him to establish his own credit   one thing i would suggest is ditch the bank and use a credit union i have used one for many years and opened an account there for my son as soon as he got his first job he was able to get a debit card to start which does n't build credit score but establishes his account work the credit union he was able to get his first credit card through the same credit union without falling work the bureaucratic bs that comes with dealing with a large bank his interest rate may be a bit higher due to his lack of credit score initially but because we taught him about finance it is n't really relevant because he does n't carry a balance he has also been able to get a student loan without needing a cosigner so he can attend college   the idea that one needs to have a credit score established before being an adult is a fallacy like my son i started my credit on my own and have never needed a cosigner whether it was my first credit card at 17 the credit union probably should n't have done that since i was n't old enough to be legally bound my first car at 18 or my first home at 22 for both my son and i knowing how to use credit responsibly was far more valuable than having a credit score early before your children are 18 opening credit accounts with them as the primary account holder can be problematic because they are n't old enough to be legally liable for the debt using them as a cosigner is even more problematic for the same reason each financial institution will have their own rules and i certainly do n't know them all   for what you are proposing i would suggest a small line of credit with a credit union being small and locally controlled you will probably find that you have the best luck there

no it 's not all long term capital gain   depending on the facts of your situation it will be either ordinary income or partially short term capital gain   you should consider consulting a tax lawyer if you have this issue this is sort of a weird little corner of the tax law   irc do n't go into it nor do the attendant regs   it also somewhat the people on years ago they mostly and just declared it self employment income avoiding the holding period issue   but i did manage to find it in portfolio buried in there   that cited to a court case v. williams 152 5th and to revenue ruling 75 and to another   rev 75 cites fred 32 for the proposition that assets are acquired progressively as they are built   note also that land and improvements on it are treated as separate assets for purposes of depreciation pub so between williams which says something similar but about the industry and 75 as well as some related rulings and cases you may be looking at an analysis of how long your property has been built and how built it was   you may be able to some of the building as long term and some as short term   whether the apportionment should be as to cost before 1 year or value created before 1 year is explicitly left open in williams   it may be simpler to account for costs since you 'll have expenditure records with dates however if this is properly ordinary income because this is really business inventory and not merely investment property then you have fully ordinary income and holding period is irrelevant   your quick turnaround sale tends to suggest this may have been done as a business not as an investment a proper advisor with access to these materials could help you formulate a tax strategy and return position   this may be complex and law driven enough that you 'd need a tax lawyer rather than a cpa or preparer   they can sort through the precedent and if you have the money may even provide a formal tax opinion   experienced real estate lawyers may be able to help if you screen them appropriately i.e. those who help prepare real estate tax returns or otherwise have strong tax crossover knowledge

yes they are and you 've experienced why generally speaking stocks that pay dividends will be better investments than stocks that do n't   here 's why 1 they 're actually making money they can balance sheets and news releases but cash is cash it tells no lies they ca n't fake it    2 there 's less good they can do with that money than they say when a business you own is making money they can do two things with it reinvest it into the company or hand it over to you all companies must reinvest to some degree but only a few companies worth owning can find profitable ways of reinvesting all of it having to hand you the owner some of the earnings helps keep that money from leaking away on such necessities like corporate jets expensive printer paper or ill conceived corporate buyouts       3 it helps you not freak out markets go up and markets go down if you own a good company that 's giving you a nice check every three months it 's a lot easier to not panic sell in a downturn after all they 're handing you a nice check every three months and checks are cash and cash tells no lies you know they 're still a good company and you can ride it out     4 it helps others not freak out see 3 that applies to everyone that in turn means market downturns weigh less heavily on companies paying solid dividends than on those that do not   5 it gives you some of the reward of investing in good companies without having to sell those companies if you 've got a piece of a good solid profitable growing company why on earth would you want to sell it   but you 'd like to see some rewards from making that wise investment would n't you      6 dividends can grow solid growing companies produce more and more earnings which means they can hand you more and more cash via the dividend which means that if say they reliably raise dividends that measly 3 dividend turns into a 6 dividend seven years later on your initial investment at year 14 it 's 12 year 21 24 see where this is going companies like that do exist google dividend   7 dividends make growth less important if you owned a company that paid you a 10 dividend every year but never grew an inch would you care how about 5 and it grows only slowly   you invest in companies not dividends you invest in companies to make money dividends are a useful tool when you invest to gauge company value to smooth your ride and to give you some of the profit of the business you own they are however only part of the total return from investing as you found out

in such a situation is there any reason financial or not to not pay    as many points as mortgage seller allows i can think of a few reasons not to buy points in the scenario you described if interest rates decrease you could be better off refinancing to a lower rate than buying points now if buying points reduced your down payment below 20 then the pmi would more than offset the benefit of having purchased points your situation changes and you are n't able to stay in the home as long as planned   that said current interest rates are pretty low so i 'd probably gamble on them not getting too much lower anytime soon i also assume that if you can afford as many points as they allow that you would n't have to dip below 20 down payment even with points edit others have mentioned that it 's important to note opportunity cost when calculating the benefit of purchasing points i agree you would n't want to buy points at a rate that saved you less than you could earn elsewhere personally i 've not seen a points scenario that did n't yield more benefit than market average returns but that could be due to my market or just coincidence you should definitely calculate the benefit for your scenario and shop for a good lender do n't forget that points are tax deductible in the year paid when calculating their benefit

gt the best teachers make hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars in private educational institutions   1 i am sure some teachers do and that these teachers are far better than average but teacher pay correlates with a lot of other things like seniority    2 education is not just one thing and it is sometimes closer to a private good and sometimes closer to a public wiki education as status is a private good which is why private schools can afford to pay prestige bringing teachers a lot of money education as human capital is in some cases also a private good e.g. most of the benefits for graduate business education accrues to the student so externalities are negligible but in other cases it is probably not e.g. it 's better for everyone if everyone else is literate and so there are externalities involved in basic education and civic education is an almost public good the benefits of voting only exist if many people do it and they are spread largely evenly throughout society   right now the government has a hand in funding all of these this may or may not be a good idea whether from the standpoint of pure efficiency or from the taxation is theft   but in your opinion which of the above educations could plausibly be funded adequately without taxation   edit fixed link

i got my passport by mail there was a procedure and well written rules to follow it was completed in the time expected and the cost was known   i also have dead friend who died just before obamacare because he found that the insurance he had paid for as a small business owner did n't actually cover cancer treatment so he went without    i have two dead brothers who might very well be alive had they had their problems post obamacare    my favorite professor had a kid who needed a transplant the procedure was delayed for more than a year while the insurance company hoped he would die before they had to pay out for the transplant    in single payer countries for children are as simple and cheap as having a quick eye exam or school picture in our system every parent must make an appointment weeks in advance take their kid out of school drive to an office wait an hour or so get the shot and deliver the kid back to school repeat that by 25 to 30 for every single classroom across the country then the parent waits weeks and either the shot was covered or a bill arrives for as much as a couple hundred per shot this is inefficient to the point or absurdity but it keeps that profit margin high for stockholders    i 'll take the government agency over a for profit entity to shareholders over me any day we pay something like 3000 times more money that someone in france we have no one at our back or standing with us i want my government in the game and not looking on passively as though the health of the people mean nothing at all

yes you could sell what you have and bet against others that the stock price will continue to fall within a period of time shorting   if you 're right your value goes up even though the stock price goes down this is a pretty darn risky bet to make   if you 're wrong there 's no limit to how much money you can owe   at least with stocks they can only fall to zero   when you short and the price goes up and up and up before the deadline you owe it and just as with stocks someone else has to agree to take the bet   if a stock is pretty obviously tanking its unlikely that someone would oppose your bet it 's probably pretty clear that i barely know what i 'm talking about but i was surprised not to see this listed among the answers

i found this article to clarify some of the issues one point raised is that the concession can be thought of as getting tax exemption for the closing costs which normally are not allow i 'm not sure i follow this logic since you can only deduct the interest not the principal i asked a lender and he verified you can only spend the concession money on closing costs i think if your closing costs are less than 1 of the loan its probably not worth it to go for a concession over the price reduction with interest rates so low its also not cost effective to buy down points on the loan this should limit most of your closing costs

my recommendation is to pay off your student loans as quickly as possible it sounds like you 're already doing this but do n't incur any other large debts until you have this taken care of   i 'd also recommend not buying a car especially an expensive one on credit or lease either back during the dotcom boom i and many friends bought or leased expensive cars only to lose them or struggle paying for them when the bottom dropped out a car instantly depreciates and it 's quite rare for them to ever gain value again stick with reliable older used cars that you can purchase for cash if you do borrow for a car shop around for the best deal and avoid 3 + year terms if at all possible do n't lease unless you have a business structure where this might create a clear financial advantage avoid credit cards as much as possible although if you do plan to buy a house with a mortgage you 'll need to maintain some credit history if you have the discipline to keep your balance small and paid down you can use a credit card to build credit history however these things can quickly get out of hand and you 'll wonder why you suddenly owe $ 10 k $ 20 k or even more on them so be very careful with them as for the house speaking of us markets here save up for at least a 20 down payment if you can based on what you said this would be about $ 20 25k. this will give you a lot more flexibility to take advantage of deals that might come your way even if you do n't put it all into the house stretching to buy a house that 's too expensive can quickly lead to financial ruin as for house size i recommend purchasing a 4 bedroom house even if you are n't planning on kids right away it will resell better and you 'll appreciate having the extra space for storage home office hobbies etc also life has a way of changing your plans for having kids and such

if you 're losing money or breaking even you own a bad investment   the problem you have is that you are emotionally invested in your tenant that is n't a bad thing in general but it 's costing you money and unless interest rates fall enough to justify a refi or property taxes go down in your area that 's kind of unlikely to change   option 1 tell your wife that you are willing to accept a loss up to a certain level because of your long term relationship with your tenant in a perfect world the two of you would then discuss what the magic number would be where you got out and come to a compromise for example if you are comfortable losing up to $ 3,000 per year and she is unhappy with any loss you may agree on selling the house when your losses climb to $ 1,500 in a less perfect world it would cause an argument as she has already told you what she wants you to do   option 2 raise the rent to the break even point from what you 've said this will likely result in the loss of your tenant but you could then rent to someone else for significantly more   option 3 sell the house it 's an investment property which means it 's supposed to make money for you it can do that very quickly by way of a sale and then it 's no longer your problem option 4 sell the house to your tenant you bought it for $ 50,000 and it 's currently worth $ 150,000 roughly the problem you face is that property taxes have gone up and caused your mortgage to increase past your tenants ability to pay my guess is after 15 years your payoff is somewhere in the high $ 20 's to mid 30 's assuming you got a 30 year loan and have n't refinanced if you sell to her for say $ 75,000 or even up to $ 90,000 you will still make a profit wife is happy she will get a mortgage she can afford and be able to stay in the house you and the tenant are happy added bonus is that her property taxes would be lower assuming a different rate for investment property in your area i would discuss this at length with your wife as well before making such an offer   option 5 get a property management company as mentioned above they will keep a percentage but will remove your emotions from the equation altogether and turn the situation into a winner   i do n't know if your wife is right in saying you do n't have the stomach for this but i do think your heart is getting in the way in this particular situation i get the feeling that if your tenant was 25 years old and had only been renting from you since last october you would have no problem raising the rent to market levels at every renewal

i believe you are confusing sales tax with income tax the tax holidays in the us are only for sales tax consumers purchasing certain goods during the tax holiday do not have to pay sales tax like they normally would effectively the price is slightly lower during those days with the purpose of giving people an extra reason to shop at that time during the tax holiday the stores make the exact same profit that they normally do but they may experience a bump in sales simply because more people will shop during that time income tax for both consumers and the businesses is not affected by this although new york state was the first state to implement a tax holiday 20 years ago they no longer have one today though they do have certain goods which have a lower tax rate year round

i 'm posting this because i think i can do a better job of explaining and detailing everything from start to stop a broker is just someone who connect buyers and sellers a middleman of sorts who is easy to deal with there are many kinds of brokers the ones you 'll most commonly hear about these days are mortgage broker for arranging home loans and stockbroker the stockbroker helps you buy and sell stock the stockbroker has a connection to one or more stock exchanges e.g. nasdaq nyse and will submit your orders to them in order to fulfill it this way nasdaq and nyse do n't have to be in the business of managing millions of customer accounts and submitting tax information about those accounts to the government and what not they just manage relationships with brokerages which is much easier for them to invest in a stock you will need to in this day and age most brokers that you care about will be easily accessed via the internet the applications will be available on the internet and the trading interface will be over the internet there may also be paper and/or telephone interfaces to the brokerage but the internet interface will work better be aware that post ipo social media stock is risky do n't invest any money if you 're not prepared for the possibility of losing every penny of it also do n't forget that a variety of alternative things exist that you can buy from a broker such as an s&p 500 index fund or exchange traded corporate bond fund these will earn you some reward over time with significantly less risk if you do not already have similar holdings through a retirement plan you should consider purchasing some of these sooner or later

i wrote this in another thread but is also applicable here in general people make some key mistakes with property not factoring in depreciation properly houses are perpetually falling down and if you are renting them perpetually being trashed by the tenants as well particularly in bad areas accurate depreciation costs can often run in the 5 20 range per year depending on the property area add insurance to this as well or be prepared to lose the whole thing in a disaster related to 1 they take the index price of house price rises as something they can achieve when in reality a lot of the house price rise is just everyone having to spend a lot of money keeping them standing up no investor can actually track a house price graph due to 1 so be careful to make reasonable assumptions about actual achievable future growth in your example they could well be lagging inflation barely growing if you are not pricing in upkeep and depreciation properly failure to price in the huge transaction costs often per sale and capital gains other taxes depends on the exact tax structure where you are these add up very fast if you are buying and selling at all frequently costs in either time or fees to real estate rental agents having to fill check evict fix and maintain rental properties is a lot more work than most people realise and you either have to pay this in your own time or someone else ’s again has to be factored in liquidity issues selling houses in down markets is very very hard they are not like stocks where they can be moved quickly houses can often sit on the market for years before sale if you are not prepared to take low prices as the bank owns your house if you fail to pay the mortgage rents collapse loss of job etc they can force you to fire sale it leaving you in a whole world of pain depending on the exact legal system negative equity etc these factors are generally correlated if you work in the same cities you are buying in so quite a lot of potential long tail risk if the regional economy collapses finally if you ’re young they can tie you to areas where your earnings potential is limited renting can be immensely beneficial early on in a career as it gives you huge freedom to up sticks and leave fast when new opportunities arise locking yourself into 20 contracts landlord activities when young can be hugely inhibiting to your earnings potential without more details on the exact legal framework area house type etc it ’s hard to give more specific advise but in general you need a very large margin of safety with property due to all of the above so if the numbers you ’re running are coming out close and they are here it ’s probably not worth it and you ’re better of sticking with more hands off investments like stocks and bonds

sounds to me like you 're describing just how it should work   ask is at 30 bid is at 20 you offer a new bid at 25   either depending on liquidity one or the other may be more likely this article on the subject describes what you 're seeing and recommends the strategy you 're describing precisely instead of a market order take advantage of the fact that the options world truly is a marketplace one where you can possibly get a better price just by asking how does that work if you use a limit order instead of a market order when opening a position you can tell your broker how much you are willing to pay to enter a trade for example if you enter a limit price of $ 1.15 you can see whether the market maker will bite you will be surprised at how many times you will get your price i.e. $ 1.15 instead of the ask price of $ 1.30 if your order at $ 1.15 is not filled after a few minutes you can modify your order and pay the ask price by entering a market order or limit order at the ask price that is you can tell your broker to pay no more than $ 1.30

evidence for the second scenario can banks individually create money out of nothing the theories and the empirical evidence excerpt it was examined whether in the process of making money available to    the borrower the bank transfers these funds from other accounts    within or outside the bank in the process of making loaned money    available in the borrower 's bank account it was found that the bank    did not transfer the money away from other internal or external    accounts resulting in a rejection of both the fractional reserve    theory and the financial theory instead it was found    that the bank newly the funds by crediting the borrower 's    account with a deposit although no such deposit had taken place this    is in line with the claims of the credit creation theory thus it can now be said with confidence for the first time possibly    in the 5000 years history of banking that it has been empirically    demonstrated that each individual bank creates credit and money out of    nothing when it extends what is called a bank the bank does    not loan any existing money but instead creates new money the money    supply is created as fairy produced by the banks out of thin    air

invest in a high quality dividend paying group of stocks   look up stock   to find longterm quality stocks that have regularly increased their dividends for over is a safe period of time to invest in stocks   if you had bought stocks at their in 2007 and kept them through the 40 decline thru 2008 and 2009 and held on to them for 10 years until 2017 you would have earned a 40 increase from when you purchased them   that is pretty much a worst case   if you had invested in dividend paying stocks and had earned an additional 2.5 per year you would have exceeded your 5 goal the lifetime yearly return of the stock market is 10   time is the only downside but with ten years you are almost certainly immune

a lease is a rental plain and simple   you borrow money to finance the expected depreciation over the course of the lease term   this arrangement will almost always cost more over time of your ownership   that does not mean that a lease is always a worse deal    cars are almost always a losing proposition save for the oddball porsche or ferrari that is too scarce relative to demand   you accept ownership of a car and it starts to lose value   new cars lose value faster than used cars   typically if you were to purchase the car then sell it after 3 years the total cost over those three years will work out to less total money than the equivalent 36 month lease   but you will have to come up with a lot more money down or a higher monthly payment and/or sell the car after 36 months assuming the pretty standard 36 month lease   with this in mind some cars lease better than others because the projected depreciation is more favorable than other brands or models    personally i bought a slightly used car certified pre owned with a agreeable factory warranty extension   my next car i may lease   late model cars are getting so unbelievably expensive to maintain that more and more i feel like a long term rental has merit just understand that for the convenience for the freeing up of your cash flow for the of maintenance to not bother with resale or trading the car in a lease will cost a premium over a purchase over the same time frame

modern portfolio theory has a strong theoretical background and its conclusions on the risk return trade off have a lot of good supporting evidence   however the conclusions it draws need to be used very carefully when thinking about retirement investing   if you were really just trying to just pick the one investment that you would guess would make you the most money in the future then yes given no other information the riskiest asset would be the best one    however for most people the goal retirement investing is to be as sure as possible to retire comfortably   if you were to just invest in a single very risky asset you may have the highest expected return but the risk involved would mean there might be a good chance you money may not be there when you need it instead a broad diversified basket of riskier and safer assets leaning more toward the riskier investments when younger and the safer assets when you get closer to retirement tends to be a better fit with most people 's retirement goals   this tends to give on average more return when you are young and can better deal with the risk but back the risk later in life when your investment portfolio is a majority of your wealth and you can least afford any major swings   this combines the lessons of mpt diversity risk return trade off in a clearer way with common goals of retirement caveat   your retirement goals and risk tolerance may be very different from other peoples   it is often good to talk to fee only financial planner

the operating margin deals with the ability for a company to make a profit above the costs of running the company and generating sales while roe is how much money the company makes relative to the shareholders equity i 'd be willing to bet that if a company has a small roe then it also has a quite large p e price to earnings ratio this would be caused by the company 's stock being bid up in relation to its earnings and may not necessarily be a bad thing people expect the high operating margin to help drive increased revenues in the future and are willing to pay a higher price now for when that day comes

you could do a voluntary repossession while a repossession never looks good on your credit a voluntary repossession is slightly better a good friend of mine had a situation like this about 11 years ago   she was in an accident did n't have replacement coverage insurance and was left with a large chunk of debt on a wrecked vehicle that she then rolled into a new car in the end it came down to the simple fact that she could not afford a car loan on a vehicle that never was worth as much as she owed   since the car was worth less than the loan she really could n't sell it to fix the problem she called and arranged a voluntary repossession   she stopped making payments and parked the car till they came and picked it up   took about 4 months and 20 phone calls from her for them to come get it   in the mean time i purchased her a much older used but decent car for a couple thousand and she paid me back over the next year   the total she paid me back was less than the money she would have paid in the 4 months it took them to come get the car   in fact by the time they picked up the car she had paid back over half on the car i bought her yes the repossession did stay on her credit for seven years but during that time she was approved for a mortgage cellphone plans and credit cards etc   therefore i do n't know that it did that much damage to her credit when her car was sold at auction by the repo company it sold for much less than the loan amount technically she was on the hook for the remaining amount the outstanding balance on the loan was then sold several times to several different collection agencies over the years since then she has gotten letters every now and then demanding she pay the amount off she ignores these   most of these letters even included very favorable terms full forgiveness for 20 of the amount   at this point the statute time has run out on the debt so there is no recourse for anyone to collect from her the statute time limit varies from state to state   some states it is as long as 10 years in others it is as short as 3 years what this means is that counting from the date of the repossession of debt last payment or agreement to pay whichever is later if the statute period has elapsed and the lender collector has not filed a suit against you by the end of the period then they have effectively abandoned the debt and can not collect    find out what that period of time is in your state   if you can avoid the collection agencies till that period runs out you are scott free you just have to make sure that you do not ever send them any money or agree to pay them anything as this resets the calendar if you do not want to wait for the calendar to run out if you wait long enough you will probably be offered favorable terms to pay only a fraction of the remaining amount you just have to wait it out note i normally would not endorse anyone not paying off their debts   however sometimes it is necessary and it is for this type of situation that we have things like this and bankruptcy

there are lots of different ways to generate passive income   what is passive income basically it is income you receive without having to consistently work for it i.e. paid to do your day job or get paid by the hour instead you do the work once and then receive ongoing payments like a recording artist getting paid royalties or a book author etc   online passive income also some online business models can be great ways to generate passive income you set up an automated system online to drive traffic and sell products either as the merchant or an affiliate and get paid regularly without having to do any more work   you just need to use seo or ppc or media buys or online advertising to generate the automated traffic to your website which will have special landing pages and sales that do the conversion and selling for you if you are an affiliate you do n't even have to handle any products packaging delivering etc   and if it ’s a digital product like software or information products they can be sent straight to the customers automatically online then you can set up a system that can generate true passive income time consuming or expensive however the above mentioned methods of generating passive income tend to require a lot of work or special skills talent or knowledge and can be expensive or time consuming to set up preferred method therefore for many people the preferred passive income method is fully managed hands free property investing or other types of investing for that matter   but for people who want full ownership of the income generating asset then property investing is the best as they can sell and have control over the capital invested whereas investing in a business for example will have a lot of other variables to consider like the business sector the market factors the management team and even down to individual employee performance so in my opinion if you have the money to invest then fully managed hands free buy to let property investing is one of the best types of passive income available to us today   some of the most popular income generating property assets today in the uk include    student property    care homes    residential buy to let

the offset account is the way to go the rate is higher and even if interest rates fall further when you go to renew your term deposit the interest rate for that will be lower as well also with a term deposit you will be penalised if you take the money out before the end of the term regarding tax you will pay tax at your marginal tax rate on every dollar earned from the term deposit as long as your income is above the $ 18,000 tax free threshold if the mortgage is for your primary residence then you will not pay any tax on the money in your offset account as you are not earning any interest in this account you are saving interest on your mortgage so definitely the way to go would be with the offset account you 'll get an effective higher interest rate it will help you pay off your mortgage sooner the money is always on call and you will pay no tax

generally investing in index tracking funds in the long term poses relatively low risk compared to short term investment aka speculation no one says differently however it is a higher risk than money market savings bonds the reason for that is that the return is not guaranteed and loss is not limited here volatility plays part as well as general market conditions although the volatility risk also affects bonds at some level as well while long term trend may be upwards short term trend may be significantly different take as an example year 2008 for s&p500 if by any chance you needed to liquidate your investment in november 2008 after investing in november 1998 you might have ended up with 0 gain or even loss had you waited just another year or liquidated a year earlier the result would be significantly different that 's the volatility risk you do n't invest indefinitely even when you invest long term at some point you 'll have to liquidate your investment higher volatility means that there 's a higher chance of downward spike just at that point of time killing your gains even if the general trend over the period around that point of time was upward as it was for s&p500 for example for the period 1998 2014 with the significant downward spikes in 2003 and 2008 if you invest in major indexes these kinds of risks are hard to avoid as they 're all tied together so you need to diversify between different kinds of investments bonds vs stocks as the books parrot and/or different markets not only us but also foreign

do n't sell ever   well almost a number of studies have shown that buying equal amounts of shares randomly will beat the market long term and certainly wo n't do badly   starting from this premise then perhaps you can add a tiny bit extra with your skill maybe but who knows you might suck   point is when buying you have the wind behind you a monkey would make money selling is a different matter you have the cost of trading out and back in to something else only to have changed from one monkey portfolio to the other if you have skill that covers this cost then yes you should do this but how confident are you a few studies have been done on retail broker accounts and they show the same story   retail investors on average lose money on their switches even if you believe you have a real edge on the market   you 're strategy still should not just say sell when it drops out of your criteria   your criteria are positive indicators lack of positive is not a negative indicator   sell when you would happily go short the stock    that is you are really confident it is going down otherwise leave it

you 've laid out a strategy for deciding that the top of the market has passed and then realizing some gains before the market drops too far   regardless of whether this strategy is good at accomplishing its goal it can not by itself maximize your long term profits unless you have a similar strategy for deciding that the bottom of the market has passed   even if you sell at the perfect time at the top of the market you can still lose lots of money by buying at the wrong time at the bottom people have been trying to time the market like this for centuries and on average it does n't work out all that much better than just some money into the market each week and letting it sit there for 40 years so the real question is what is your investment time horizon   if you need your money a year from now well then you should n't be in the stock market in the first place   but if you have to have it in the market then your plan sounds like a good one to protect yourself from losses if you do n't need your money until 20 years from now though then every time you get in and out of the market you 're risking sacrificing all your previous smart gains with one trade   sure just leaving your money in the market can be psychologically taxing cf 2008 2009 but i guarantee that a you 'll eventually make it all back cf 2010 2014 and b you wo n't miss the top or miss the bottom since you 're not doing any trading

you know there is a heading in big bold text that says my budding product empire that conveniently links to actual products that make money for said author    i think you have a problem with the whole way the author markets herself but i obviously it works   edit also i do n't feel like it 's bragging it 's more like sharing the wealth you get examples of how to make and sell your own products from someone who makes and sells her own products successfully what is so bad about that

automation is an admirable goal but i do n't think we 're going to see a world where there 's no menial labor for a very long time   coupled with that there 's pretty much no real way to look at a menial style job and say that deserves $ 15 an hour     the two reasons above combine and make a strong argument for something like a basic income or drastically expanded welfare and safety net programs     a further failing of the retrain everyone approach is assuming that everyone can be   there are simply put people that exist and will always exist that can not do non menial work for a myriad of reasons

paywall   but this is an issue that comes up in many places including california where we were recently up to our in drought including the pressure on nestle   somewhere there is a government official that approved this arrangement just as there was in california   i 'm sure elsewhere as well   and we should n't be taking nestle to task we should be naming those government officials and investigating them for corruption or firing them for   i ca n't read this particular article but i 've never seen this addressed in the press   are there any names mentioned here   in california likely in michigan too the government does not acknowledge individuals right to resources   we instead use the water supply as for political clout and give it away for jobs as a favor   government should n't control the water supply   it should be owned by people   individuals will protect what is theirs in a way government does n't even corporate owners treat what is theirs better that the current model of government leases

the various levels of government have laws determining what a protected class is    federally wiki are the protected classes under federal law it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their membership of any   of those demographics on the state and local level many states have additional protections for example my home state of il explicitly forbids discrimination based on someone 's sexual orientation or gender identity classes which are not explicitly forbidden on the federal level   hate speech is protected under the first amendment so long as you 're not violence that caveat is very murky and i am not qualified enough to speak on what is and is n't violence from a legal perspective i just know that the caveat exists   the key distinction that i think a lot of people misunderstand and are confused about is that while hate speech is protected under the first amendment like all other forms of speech it is not a protected class meaning i can say whatever hateful rhetoric i want but non government entities are free to discriminate against me     i can absolutely be fired if my employer finds out i am posting on facebook advocating for the death of black lives matter activists or saying stuff like terrorist immigrant go home because political speech is not a protected class i can not be fired for posting a photo of my gay wedding in il because in il sexual orientation is a protected class    does that make sense

no this really does n't happen when states buy power from that great a distance they really are only buying renewable credits the electricity is not actually directed through 16,000 + miles ny co of cables that would be incredibly inefficient   when a state needs power not merely credits they buy from one of their neighbors
