with the information you have given i would say never remember the banker is a salesman and the line of credit is the product if you do n't need to borrow the money for something specific then you do n't need the line of credit in the first place even if you did need something i would tell you to save up and pay cash for it on the tax advantage there is none in the us you can deduct your mortgage interest on your taxes but it 's not a tax credit it 's a tax deductions let me explain further you spend $ 10,000 on mortgage interest and you 're in the 25 tax bracket you send the bank $ 10,000 in return you get at tax savings of $ 2500 you are still in the hole $ 7500 you would have been better off not taking out the loan in the first place on the emergency fund you should have 3 6 months of expenses in cash like a money market account   this money is n't for investing it 's like insurance and you do n't make money on insurance the last thing you want to do is have to go into debt right in the middle of an emergency say you lost your job the last thing you would want to do is borrow money right at the time you have no income to pay it back the bank is under no obligation to maintain you credit limit and can without notice reduce it they can in most cases call the loan balance due in full with little or no notice as well both of those are likely scenarios if the bank were to become aware of the fact that you were unemployed

the only really good reason to open a line of credit is that you want to buy something that you do n't have money for that 's got its own risks see plenty of other places to see warnings about not borrowing too much the only other reason is that you might want to use a line of credit as your emergency fund the usual way of doing this is to keep the money in an easily savings account but such accounts usually pay rather now interest and there is an argument for instead investing your emergency money in a higher interest but less accessible fund and using a line of credit to tide you over until you can extract the money i 'm worried about the comment that you can deduct my interest on my tax returns that is usually only possible if you are borrowing money to invest it sounds as if your banker is going to persuade you to not only open a line of credit but then invest that money in something be aware that this kind of leveraging is much higher risk than investing money you already own

there are two basic types of lines of credit typically offered at a retail bank overdraft line of credit is essentially a revolving personal loan that you can draw upon as needed or automatically draw on when you overdraw on your checking account typically with a commercial bank there is a fee to use the automatic overdraft in addition to interest some credit unions do n't charge a fee interest is typically computed using average daily balance a home equity line of credit is a revolving loan that is secured against your home interest on home improvement related expenses is deductible since the bank gets a lien on your home the rates are low sometimes you can even get debit cards that will hit the line i think these are a good idea if

i have a line of credit that i have attached to my checking account in case of an overdraft    since i have n't over drafted my checking account in 4 years i typically borrow the minimum $ 5 from the line of credit and then pay it back the next day    this usually costs me a couple of cents and i have to do it twice a year but it keeps the account active and they do n't close it down

a line of credit is a poor substitute for an emergency fund    banks typically have a clause that allows them to stop further withdrawals from your line of credit if there is a change of vaguely defined type    for example if you lose your job they can stop you from making withdrawals from your line of credit

currency exchange is rather the norm than the exception in international wire transfers so the fact that the amount needs to be exchanged should have no impact at all the processing time depends on the number of participating banks and their speeds typically between europe and the us one or two business days are the norm sending from other countries might involve more steps banks   which each takes a bit of time however anything beyond 5 business days is not normal consider if there are external delays how did you initiate the sending was it in person with an agent of the bank who might have put it on a stack and they type it in only a day later or worse or was it online so it is in the system right away on the receiver side how did you your friend check could there be a delay by waiting for an account statement finally and that is the most common reason were all the numbers names and codes absolutely correct even a small mismatch in name spelling might trigger the receiving bank to not allocate the money into the account either way if you contact the sender bank you will be able to make them follow up on it they must be able to trace where they money went and where it currently is if it is stuck they will be able to get it

the phrase does n't mean anything specifically your so could start paying the payments but the title and lien would remain in your name   if you wanted to change the title or lien to be in her name you would have to sell the car to her sales tax would be involved but the process would be relatively painless   you could sell her the car for a pretty cheap price but not $ 1 unless the depreciated value of the car was less than the rest of the loan amount you could draft up an agreement that if you break up or something she agrees to buy the car from you for $ x dollars minus all the payments she has made on the car

if you want the cheapest online broker in australia you ca n't go past cmc markets they charge $ 9.90 upto a $ 10,000 trade and 0.1 above that there is no ongoing fees unless you choose to have dynamic data stock prices get updated automatically as they change however the dynamic data fee does get waived if you have about 10 or more trades per month you do n't really need the dynamic data unless you are a regular trader anyway they also provide some good research tools and some basic charting your funds with them are kept in a account so are safe they do n't provide the best interest on funds kept in the account so it is best to just deposit the funds when you are looking to buy and move your funds earning higher interest when selling hopes this helps regards victor update they have now increased their basic brokerage to a minimum of $ 11 per trade unless you are a frequent trader

utilities and cost of living vary from city to city but maybe not that much   for basic planning purposes you can probably figure to spend as much as you are now maybe a little more   and adjust as needed when you get there   and adjust if for example you 're moving from a very low cost of living area or to a very high cost of living area the cost of housing varies quite a bit from city to city but you can do this research using zillow craigslist other places now on to moving itself   the cost of moving can vary hugely depending on how much stuff you have and how much work you want to do   on the cheap end you can rent a u haul or one of those portable boxes that they plant outside your old house and move for you   you 'll do all the packing loading unloading yourself but it saves quite a bit of money   my family and i moved from seattle to california last year using one of those portable box places and it ended up costing us including 30 days of storage at the destination while we looked for a place   we have a < 1000 sq foot place with some furniture but not a huge amount and did all the packing loading ourselves   if we had wanted full service where people come pack load unpack etc it could have been 2 3x that amount   and if we had more stuff it could have been a lot more expensive too   try not to acquire too much stuff as you just end up having to move it around and take care of it all   your employer may cover moving expenses ask about this when talking about job offers   un reimbursed moving expenses are tax deductible in the us even if you do n't itemize    since you 're just starting out your best bet is to overestimate how much you think things will cost then adjust as you arrive and settle in for a few months   try to save as much as you can but remember to have fun too   hope this helps

i 'm guessing you 're in the us if so yes you can be prosecuted but it 's unlikely   fraud crimes are up to a prosecutor to pursue there are a lot of fraud cases and take low priority i 'm assuming you 're passively complicit not actively   if this is the case it 's best to work with the bank to get your situation cleaned up and move on   these days most banks have dealt with wire fraud at least once and they 're familiar with cashiers check fraud    a fair warning the bank will report you if they think you 're involved so if you are not a complete bystander you may want to lawyer up   so hopefully you did n't try to spend any of the fraudulent money and hopefully you have proof of a third party because they will want a connection to that person name number other to file their report

i believe your statement is mostly correct   all the expert recommendations are based on an inflexible conventional wisdom that presumes that all renters are relatively resource poor when you purchase a $ 50 electronic item at the store and are offered an extended warranty for $ 3 most people turn it down not only because they do n't think it 's worth it but also because in the event that the item fails between say years 1 and 3 they do n't worry enough about that $ 50 to care if they have to buy a new one or live without it the percentage of your net worth also matters for example if you had an entire loss tomorrow you 'd be out $ 20 k if you needed to re purchase your possessions 30 k minus 10 k in current coverage $ 20 k is approximately or 2.3 of your net worth if a catastrophe occurs and you only lose 2.3 of your net worth some might consider that lucky so from that point of view it is n't really a big deal but on the flip side if the extra insurance only costs you $ 50 more per year you may not even notice that dent in your net worth either i think for most people the value of items in their home may be their net worth or at least a much larger percentage of it in which case the insurance makes more sense for someone in your position it probably does n't make much difference either way if you had $ 300 k in valuables in your house perhaps your point of view would be different

a straddle is an options strategy in which one buys or sells options of the same maturity expiry date that allow the buyer or seller to profit based on how much the price of the underlying security moves regardless of the direction of price movement ie a long straddle would be you buy a call and a put at the same strike price and the same expiration date your profit would be if the underlying stock moves far enough down or then the premiums you paid for the put + call options in case one waits till expiry profit = expiry level strike price premium paid for bought options straddle

first let me answer the question the best way i can i do n't know if there are any studies other than those that have already been mentioned now let 's talk about something more interesting you do n't need to base your behavior on any study even if it is scientific let 's pretend for example that we could find a scientifically valid study that shows that people spend 25 more when using a credit card than they do when spending cash   this does not mean that if you use a credit card you will spend 25 more   all it means is that the average person spending with a credit card spends more than the average person paying cash   but there are outliers   there are plenty of people who are being frugal while using a credit card and there are others who spend too much cash   everyone 's situation is different   the idea that you will automatically spend less by using cash would not be proven by such a study when hearing any type of advice like this you need to look at your own situation and see if it applies to your own life   and that is what people are doing with the anecdotal comments   some say yep i spend too much if i use a card others say actually i find that when i have cash in my wallet i spend it on junk   and both are correct   it does n't matter what the study says the average person does because you are not average now let 's say that you are a financial counselor who helps people work through disastrous financial messes   your client has $ 20,000 in credit card debt and is having trouble paying all his bills   he does n't have a budget and never uses cash   probably the best advice for this guy is to stop using his card and start paying cash   it does n't take a scientific study to see that this guy needs to change his behavior for what it is worth i keep a strict budget keeping track of my spending on the computer   the vast majority of my spending is electronic   i find tracking my cash spending difficult and sometimes i find that when i have cash in my wallet it seems to disappear without a trace

i suggest that you 're really asking questions surrounding three topics 1 what allocation hedges your risks but also allows for upside 2 how do you time your purchases so you 're not getting hammered by exchange rates 3 how do you know if you 're doing ok allocations your questions concerning allocation are really what if questions as points out only you can really answer those i would suggest building an excel sheet and thinking through the scenarios of at least 3 what ifs   a what if you keep your current allocations and anything in local currency gets cut in half in value could you live with that b what if you allocate more to stable economies and your economy recovers so stable items grow at 5 per year but your local investments grow 50 for the next 3 years could you live with that missed opportunity   c what if you allocate more to stable economies and they grow at 5 while sa continues a gradual slide remember that slow or flat growth in a stable currency is the same as higher returns in a declining currency i would trust your own insights as a local but i would recommend thinking more about how this plays out for your current investments   timing you bring up concerns about timing of buying expensive foreign currencies you ca n't time the market if you knew how to do this with forex trading you would n't be here   read up on dollar cost averaging for most people and most companies with international exposure it may not beat the market in the short term but it nets out positive in the long term   rebalancing for you there will be two questions to ask regularly is the allocation still correct as political and international issues play out have any returns or losses thrown your planned allocation out of   alignment   put your investment goals in writing and revisit it at least once a year to evaluate whether any adjustments would be wise to make   and of course i am not a registered financial professional especially not in sa so i obviously recommend taking what i say with a large dose of salt

my suggestion would be to keep it the value of a new car is that you get to drive it around when it 's still new and shiny and that you know its history if you maintain it in good condition both mechanically and then you can have both of those benefits for the life of the car your question the old car sale and new car purchase transactions together but that 's not correct the value of your 2010 car has no relationship to the value of any new car you might buy except incidentally through the market forces that act on each the car dealership is likely to be skilled at making you feel like your most important criteria are satisfied but they will try to construct the deal to maximize the money you pay them while making you feel like you 're the one maximizing your value also note that the dealership can not give you maximum value for your car because it costs them money to sell it and they take all the risk some of the difference between typical direct sale and trade in prices is the commission you are paying them to both sell it for you and absorb the risks in the transaction

ianal but i had heard and would appreciate someone more qualified commenting on this that one reason these things were often found unenforceable is that there is no consideration   the contract is to bind you for your work each day but once you stop working they you have a continued obligation that your time at the company   claiming that your day to day compensation covers this is as if to say some part of that compensation is not for your work but to pay you for not going elsewhere   it would be nice to see at minimum a requirement to separate these two concepts into separate contracts as bundling them creates a blur and most importantly does n't allow you to negotiate or walk away from the terms of one part without the other   at the heart of any market which the job market purports to be is a sense that a fair price is reached when both parties can walk away from a bad deal this is not so in the case of employment because as said a hungry man is not a free man so someone who needs to eat or feed a family has a need to take an offer that is already their acceptance of work and this quasi duress is compounded when a company can attach additional pressures that work that person 's ability to fairly negotiate possible improvements of what may already have been a bad situation   i 'm of the impression that duress itself has been argued to be a reason to hold a contract invalid   but more and generally any time two parties are bargaining i 'm not sure the legal definition but intuitively i 'd say where one party has the ability to force a contract change and the other party is not then those terms have to be suspect   also for the special case the pay is anything near minimum wage i would suggest asking the question of whether the part of the compensation that is salary not keeping you from working for the competition is the wage paid consistent with minimum wage or does it have to draw from the pool of money that is not about wage but is about incentivizing you to not move   and finally if they stop paying you and each day you 've been paid a little to work and a little to incentivize you to leave then are you getting a continued revenue stream to continue to incentivize you not to work for the competition if not there would seem again not to be consideration   as i said i 'm not an expert in this i just follow such matters sometimes in the news but i do n't see these issues getting discussed here and i hope we 'll see some useful responses from the crowd here and also the smart folks at reddit can help through their discussions to form some useful political and legal to help individuals overcome what is really a moral outrage on this matter   capitalism is an often cruel engine   i worked at a company where one of the bosses said to me after contributing really great things that added structurally in fundamental ways to the company do n't tell me what you 've done tell me what you 've done lately capitalism makes people scrap every day to prove their worth so it 's morally an outrage to see it also trying even as it beats down the price of someone and tells them they are n't entitled to better to tell them that they may not go somewhere else that thinks they are better that is not competition and it is not fair     indentured servitude not slavery is more technically correct and yet it is a push to treat people like capital so slavery is not inappropriate   the topic is non competes but really it 's about businesses not wanting to have to compete for employees that is about businesses not wanting capitalism to prevail in hiring   sorry for the length

related and one of the best titled psychology papers if money does n't make you happy then you probably are n't spending it money doesnt make you happy     the relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak which may stem in part from the way people spend it drawing on empirical research we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money specifically we suggest that consumers should 1 buy more experiences and fewer material goods 2 use their money to benefit others rather than themselves 3 buy many small pleasures rather than fewer large ones 4 eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance 5 delay consumption 6 consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day to day lives 7 beware of comparison shopping and 8) pay close attention to the happiness of others   even money does n't bring happiness material things do n't bring happiness things that bring happiness however are much easier to achieve with money novel bring happiness and it 's hard to afford vacations when you 're poor being useful to society at large make people happy bill gates is more useful because he is rich than a peace corps worker it 's the little things in life that make us happy and the rich can afford more of them happiness like death is by a thousand cuts

thanks for the info things are starting to make more sense now for some reason i 've always neglected learning about investments now that i m in a position to invest and am still fairly young i 'm motivated to start learning    as for help with td ameritrade i was looking into index funds as another commenter mentioned that i should on their site and am a little overwhelmed with the options first i 'm looking at mutual funds going to symbol lookup and using type = i 'm assuming that 's the same thing as an index fund but since the language is slightly different i 'm not 100 sure however at that point i need some kind of search for a symbol in order to see any results makes sense but i do nt know where to start looking for good index funds     so my first question is if i find a good mutual fund is it correct to simply go to buy mutual funds and find it from there and if so my second question is how do i find a good mutual fund    my goal is to have my money in something that will likely grow faster than a savings account i do n't mind a little volatility i can afford to lose my investment i 'd plan on leaving my money in the fund for a several years at least    my last question is when investing in these types of funds or please point me in another direction if you think index funds are n't the place for me to start should i be reinvesting in the funds or having them pay out dividends i would assume that reinvesting is the smart choice but i can imagine situations that might change that in order to mitigate risk and as i 've said a few times in this thread including the title i 'm a complete amateur so my assumptions are n't necessarily worth that much    thanks for the help i really appreciate all the info so far

a couple ways but its not a guarantee   you have to have special charts instead of each tick being 1 min 5 min or whatever it is a set number of trades say 2000 since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts there will be small volume per tick an institutional investor however would have a much much higher trade lot size even if using an algo thus large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail similarly daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest as they have much larger trade sizes you could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used ie every time price hits vwap a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling especially if it happens multiple times in a row

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

mastercard rules also prohibit asking for id along with the card yet when i was at disneyland years ago so i do n't know if this is still a practice they asked for my driver 's license with every purchase i can charge up to $ 200 at costco with a swipe not even a signature but a $ 5 bottle of water maybe it was $ 6 required me to produce my license   the answer is pete 's comment do n't patronize these merchants by the way it 's legal now from visa web site   note 9 states still prohibit surcharges so they tend to offer cash discounts the question you linked is from 2010 things change

what is the importance or benefit of the assumption that high risk is preferable for younger people investors instead of older people law of averages most high risk investments stocks for examples including mutual funds take any stock market some have data for nearly 100 years on a 15 year or 30 years horizon the year on year growth is around 15 to 18 percentage again depends on which country market etc equally important every stock market in the same 15 year of 30 year time if you take specific 3 year window it would have lost 50 or more value as one can not predict for future someone who is 55 years if he catches wrong cycle he will lose 50 a young person even if he catches the cycle and loses 50 he can sit tight as it will on 30 years average wipe out that loss

when the inflation rate increases this tends to push up interest rates because of supply and demand if the interest rate is less than the inflation rate then putting your money in the bank means that you are losing value every day that it is there so there 's an incentive to withdraw your money and spend it now if say i 'm planning to buy a car and my savings are declining in real value then if i buy a car today i can get a better car than if i wait until tomorrow when interest rates are high compared to inflation the reverse is true my savings are increasing in value so the longer i leave my money in the bank the more it 's worth if i wait until tomorrow to buy a car i can get a better car than i would be able to buy today also people find alternative places to keep their savings if a savings account will result in me losing value every day my money is there then maybe i 'll put the money in the stock market or buy gold or whatever so for the banks to continue to get enough money to make loans they have to increase the interest rates they pay to lure customers back to the bank there is no reason per se for rising interest rates to consumers to directly cause an increase in the inflation rate inflation is caused by the money supply growing faster than the amount of goods and services produced interest rates are a cost if interest rates go up people will borrow less money and spend it on other things but that has no direct effect on the total money supply except you may note i put a bunch of in that paragraph in the united states the federal reserve loans money to banks it creates this money out of thin air so when the interest that the federal reserve charges to the banks is low the banks will borrow more from the feds as this money is created on the spot this adds to the money supply and thus contributes to inflation so if interest rates to consumers are low this encourages people to borrow more money from the banks which encourages the banks to borrow more from the feds which increases the money supply which increases inflation i do n't know much about how it works in other countries but i think it 's similar in most nations

it could be money laundering so answer 1 they did n't get your data wrong they indeed sent you $ 1,000 how they obtained your banking data is another issue we wo n't address here answer 2 your was most likely compromised from what you report it included at least your banking info and your phone number probably more but goes out of the scope of this answer   answer 3 money laundering is done in small transactions to avoid having the financial institution filing a currency transaction report so they send $ 1,000 to several marks possibly at the stage of to out the paper trail associated to the money money is a risky endeavour and the criminals do n't expect to have all the money they enter into the system come out clean on the other side you really do n't want to be associated with that cash so the best is to report to your bank that you do n't recognize that transaction and suspect illegal activity in writing your financial institution knows how to proceed from there answer 4 yes and one of the worst financial scams from drug trafficking to human slavery and terrorism that money could be supporting any of these activities i urge the reader to access the us treasury 's national money risk assessment report for more information

some thoughts 1 do you have a significant emergency fund 3 6 months of after tax living expenses if not you stand to take a significant loss if you have an unexpected need for cash that is tied up in investments what if you lose hate your job or your car breaks down what if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk 2 has a good suggestion given that if you 'd reinvested your dividends the s&p 500 has returned about 3.5 over the last 5 years you may be able to get a very nice risk free return   3 do you have access to employer matching funds such as in a 401(k at work if you get a dollar for dollar match that is a risk free pre tax 100 return and should be a high priority 4 what do you mean by medium volatility given that you are considering a 2/3 equity allocation it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15 or more in any given year and take several years to recover if that would you you may want to consider lowering your equity weights a high quality bond fund may be a good fit 5 personally i would avoid putting money into stocks that i did n't need back for 10 years if you only want to tie your money up for 2 5 years you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall you wo n't have time to recover before you need your money back the portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement however if your goals are to invest for 2 5 years only your situation would be significantly different   6 you can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees unless you plan to liquidate assets if you plan to buy a house saving enough to avoid pmi is a good risk free return on your money 7 in general and etf or index fund is a good idea the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term there are many good choices a la vanguard here to choose from 8) do n't worry about buy low sell high do n't be a speculator be an investor that 's my version of anthony 's do n't be a tourist be a traveler a speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at an investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part owner if you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions good for you you can move to wall street and make millions however almost no one can do this consistently and it does n't seem worth it to me to try i do n't mean to discourage you from investing just make sure you have your bases covered so that you do n't have to cash out at a bad time best of luck edit response to additional questions below 1 emergency fund i would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents money market short term cds etc until you 've built up an emergency fund it makes sense to want to make the best use of your money but you also have to account for risk my concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events that you could lose a lot of money or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt and it would be prudent to self insure against some of those risks i would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions taxes fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns ideally you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns there are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility even if they are less common using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this 2 invest at all i would recommend starting an emergency fund and then beginning to invest for retirement once your retirement savings are on track you can begin saving for whatever other goals you may have

gt they have no bargaining power   individually and in the long term that 's true   in the short term most franchise businesses are running on the minimum needed labor and even lower level management positions are still labor   so if several workers went on strike at once they could severely hamper operations   if several low level managers went on strike even more so   there 's a training period for any staff that are hired and even a minor period for transfers   if enough people leave all at once the store is hurt   corporate might keep them from going under but they will loose money and goodwill   all of that is before you get to picket lines and alternatives   a smart competitor can and should milk labor disputes for all they 're worth   they should try to get as many customers as possible to go to their store instead of the one being   collective bargaining exists because most individuals do n't have much power but as a group they do   the idea of zero training does n't exist   the idea of being able to simply replace large numbers of people quickly does n't work   that 's why places like walmart are afraid of unions   they are already running on the edge with their staff   all it would take is several cashiers who were ready to leave anyways going on strike to shut the store down   mind you the trick with these large companies is to do it relatively suddenly   if they have time to prepare they can be ready to throw overtime at the people who did n't leave or could bus in people from other stores   compare that to the entire kitchen crew or cashiers just not showing up one shift

what most respondents are forgetting is when a company allows its employees to purchase its shares at a discount with their salary the employee is usually required to hold the stock for a number of years before they can sell them the reason the company is allowing or promoting its employees to purchase its shares at a discount is to give the employees a sense of ownership of the company being a part owner in the company the employee will want the company to succeed and will tend to be more productive if employees were allowed to purchase the shares at a discount and sell them straight away it would defeat this purpose your best option to decide whether or not to buy the shares is to work out if the investment is a good one as per any other investment you would undertake i.e. determine how the company is currently performing and what its future prospects are likely to be regarding what percentage of pay to purchase the shares with if you do decide to buy them you need to work that out based on your current and future budgetary needs and your savings plan for the future

since you already have twice your target in that emergency fund putting that overage to work is a good idea the impression that i get is that you 'd still like to stay on the safe side what you 're looking for is a balanced fund   in a balanced fund the managers invest in both stocks and bonds and cash since you have that diversification between those two asset classes their returns tend to be much less volatile than other funds also because of their intended audience and the traditions from that class of funds long history they tend to invest somewhat more conservatively in both asset classes   there are two general types of balanced funds conservative allocation funds and moderate allocation funds conservative allocation funds invest in more fixed income than equity the classic mix is 60 bonds 40 stocks moderate allocation funds invest in more equity than fixed income classic mix 40 bonds 60 stocks a good pair of funds that are similar but the difference between conservative allocation and moderate allocation are vanguard 's income fund for the former and vanguard 's wellington fund for the latter disclaimer though both funds are broadly considered excellent this is not a recommendation good luck sorting this out

only 6 time in us history has the stock market had rallies with 9 or more days in a row of all time highs hoover in 1929 eisenhower in in 1964 reagan in 1987 trump in 2017 and trump again in 2017   now president trump is the only president in us history to oversee more than one stock market rally of 9 or more days in a row of all time closing highs   there are two related events like the growth in gdp and the decline in unemployment that should n’t be forgotten   unemployment is going down good paying jobs are increasing the us gdp broke $ 19 trillion for the first time ever under president trump the us debt is down $ 100 billion since the and americans are making money again   a healthy and growing middle class is of a great importance to a nation like ours because working americans have more disposable income and more capable of saving and investing for their retirements   economies thrive when the power of government is restrained and economic freedom is promoted

i 'm a pretty big yelp user i have been a new local business and have come to understand how their reviews get filtered to help them it 's very simple to get the filtered reviews to come up on the main page    if you sign up and do one review it will be on the main page for a little while a week or two then drop off they give the new user time to start doing reviews and to become part of the community if there is no other activity they become filtered to get them back to the main page all the user has to do is friend a few people and do some more reviews not many even they are a small sandwich shop and know their i shared with them this simple information and i have seen their page go from two reviews to seven they just asked their customers to review other places and their reviews came back    the yelp system is to stop the one review and done people it works the same for bad reviews as well

the card you have is one where you had to deposit an amount to your card limit secured limit credit card   capital one is one if the primary cards of this type the typical rules of credit card usage and building your credit do not apply   so yes you want to use the card as much as possible and pay off your balance as often as is necessary to keep your limit freed up you can actually pay the full balance plus 10 and gain a little extra limit use your card as much as possible and call them and ask for a limit increase every three months   usually about 4 5 months in they will increase your limit and do so without asking for a corresponding security deposit   this is really cool because it means you are becoming credit worthy i know so much about this because i applied for this card for my son and am helping him in his attempt to repair his credit   his score increased by almost 200 points last year

i feel that op 's question is fundamentally wrong and an understanding of why is important the stock market as a whole in the usa has an average annualized return of 11 that means that a monkey throwing darts at a board can usually turn 100 k into over three million in thirty five years the analog i 'm drawing is a 30-year old with 100 k randomly picking stocks will be a multi millionaire at 65 so to be good at investing in the stock market you need to be better than a monkey most people are n't why what mistakes do people make and how do you avoid them a very common mistake is to buy high sell low this happened before and after the 08 's recession people rushed into the market beforehand as it was reaching its peak sold when the market bottomed out then ignored the market in years it was getting returns a bogle approach for this is to simply consistently put a   part of your income into the market whether it is raining or shining paying high fees going back to the monkey example if the monkey charges you a 2 management fees which is low by canadian standards the monkey will cost you one million dollars over the course of the thirty five years if the monkey does a pretty good job it is a worthy expenditure but most humans including professional stock pickers are worst than a monkey at picking stocks another mistake is adjusting your plan many people when the market was giving bull returns before the 08 's crash happily had a large segment of their wealth in stocks they thought they were risk tolerant crash happened they moved towards bonds then bonds returns were comically low while stocks soared had they had a plan almost any consistent plan they 'd have done better another genre of issues is just doing stupid things do n't buy that penny stock do n't trade like crazy do n't pay 5 $ commission on a 200 $ stock order do n't fail to file your taxes   another mistake and this burdens a lot of people is that your long term investments are for long term investing what a novel idea you 're 401 k does n't exist for you to get a loan for a home many people do liquidate their long term savings do n't especially since people who do make these loans or say i 'll pay myself back later do n't

the basic optimization rule on distributing windfalls toward debt is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first putting any extra money into that debt while making minimum payments to the other creditors if the 5k in other debt is credit card debt it is virtually certain to be the highest interest rate debt pay it off immediately do n't wait for the next statement once you are paying on credit cards there is no grace period and the sooner you pay it the less interest you will accrue second keep 10k for emergencies but pretend you do n't have it keep your spending as close as possible to what it is now check the interest rate on the auto loan v student loans if the auto loan is materially higher pay it off then pay the remaining 20k toward the student loans added this comment about credit with a view towards the op 's future something to consider for the longer term is getting your credit situation set up so that should you want to buy a new car or a home a few years down the road you will be paying the lowest possible interest you can jump start your credit by taking out one or two secured credit cards from one of the banks that will in a few years your account return your deposit and leave no trace you ever opened a secured account that 's the route i took with citi and wells fargo while over spending on credit cards can be tempting they are with a solid payment history the single most important positive attribute on a credit report and impact fico scores more than other type of credit or debt so make an absolute practice of only using them for things you would buy anyway and always always pay each monthly bill in full this one thing will make it far easier to find a good rental buy a car on the best terms or get a mortgage at good rates and remember credit is not equal to debt maximize the former and minimize the latter

toward the philosophical side of your question it seems to me that what is most important is knowing how well your fund is performing versus it 's benchmark this is an actionable piece of information that can help you get out of an under performing fund although if you 're already using vanguard it 's likely a low cost and broadly diversified fund ultimately what you want to avoid over the long term is under performing the market due to high fees market timing poor fund selection etc and selecting a fund that closely tracks the market seems to be the best way to achieve this assuming that you intend to be a passive investor i do n't see a clear benefit to calculating a personal rate of return if the fund is performing well versus its benchmark you are likely to stay with it and if it is performing poorly you   are likely to pull out at the end of the day the complicated accounting wo n't actually change the amount you 've got in your account so i 'd recommend picking a good fund checking up on it once in a great while and putting your time to better purpose

besides what others have mentioned another thing to watch out for is the tax withholding on withdrawal if it 's a traditional ira they will probably withhold a certain percentage on non qualified withdrawals i am not sure if you can ask them not to withhold i do n't remember the percentage and it varies by state but let 's assume it is 20 that means that you only receive 80 of the withdrawal amount when you take it out however when you deposit the money to complete the rollover you need to give them 100 of the withdrawal that means assuming the 20 withholding you need to fork out cash equal to 125 of what you received in cash within 60 days that 's like several hundred percent apr and hard to meet unless you are certain of receiving a large payment within the time period and if you forget about this and you just deposit the same amount that you received 80 of the withdrawal the remainder 20 of the withdrawal will count as an early withdrawal with all the taxes and penalty so what happens to the 20 withheld that you never received but had to pay anyway well the government has it it will count as tax paid on your tax return so it will increase your refund decrease the amount you owe but that means you are out that money until tax time unless you decrease the withholding on your salary in the rest of the year to compensate if it 's a roth ira withdrawal on the contribution there is generally no withholding so you do n't have to worry about the above but there is no penalty on withdrawal of roth ira contribution anyway

i sell gas to gas stations your profit is n't much in gas it 's in the convenience store so if you 're going to do it focus on your store here in the midwest we have a brand of stations called everyone loves these gas stations and will go out of their way if they need gas because they 're very clean and the workers are friendly   do n't build a branded station right now branded gas is cheaper than wholesale in a lot of markets but that 's not usually typical it 's better to have options and not be locked into a bp station where you can only buy their gas no matter the price additives are bs it 's a commodity    operating capital will be fairly high   roughly per truck at say 3.00 cents gal is about $ 22,500 in a high traffic area you could be pulling 1 truck per day to keep supply full this is an assumption based on what we sell to customers do some math and that 's quite a bit of operating capital can you finance that we set credit limits on our customers but they 're not high think 50 100k for small stations which is only a couple truck loads   i do n't think it 's a terrible business to be in but i would almost rather own the trucks hauling gas to your station and charging on the gallon or on the supply side of the equation where gas is more profitable

keep in mind that the only portion of the mbs that was rated aaa was the most senior tranche it achieved this rating due to the buffer to principal losses provided by the equity and mezzanine tranches so for the principal to be at risk for the aaa senior tranche 10 of the mortgages in the pool would have to default since this number was way higher than historical default rates it seemed safe obviously looking back we know that risk management underestimated the effect that lowered lending standards would have on the default rates if they did project a rise in default rates they did not project a large enough rise   as well while the mbs is exposed to systemic risk as happened when the entire country was affected by the collapse they were packaged to avoid other risks for example the pool would spread out mortgages across the country and other various factors would be hedged so that if a natural disaster hits state x and everyone defaults on their mortgage you are only losing a small part of the underlying   i assume hope that at some point the quantitative analysis people in risk management at the major investment banks realized that the default rates would rise given the lower lending standards being employed but chose to ignore it they chose to ignore it because investors still wanted to buy it and the banks make money by collecting fees on issuing securities

banks consider investment mortgages and any mortgage where you do n't live in the property as a riskier investment than an owner occupied home collateral mortgage the sources of increased risk range from concerns that you will screw up as a landlord your tenants will destroy the place you wo n't have tenants and ca n't afford to pay the bank and/or you 'll take out several other investment mortgages and over extend yourself all of these risks are compounded by the fact that it is harder for the bank to convince you to pay when they ca n't put you out on the street if you default banks lend and invest in money not real estate so they would much rather have a paying loan than a foreclosed house especially with the modern foreclosure glut the increased risk means the bank will charge higher interest for the loan may require a higher downpayment and will require higher lending standards before issuing the loan a new housing investor can get around these higher prices by living in the home for a few years before renting it out though your lender could possibly require you to renegotiate the loan if you move out too soon

simple math take the sale proceeds after trade expenses and divide by cost subtract 1 and this is your return for example buy at 80 sell at 100 = 1.25 your return is 25 to annualize this return multiply by 365 over the days you were in that stock if the above stock were held for 3 months you would have an annualized return of 100   there 's an alternative way to annualize in the same example above take the days invested and dive into 365 here you get 4 i suggested that 25 x 4 = 100 others will ask why i do n't say 1.25 ^ 4 = so the return is in other words compound the return a single day trade noon to noon the next day returning just 1 would multiply to 365 over a year ignoring the fact there are about 250 trading days but 1.01 ^ 365 is or a return for long periods the compounding makes sense of course the i hope to see should double my money in 9 years not 12 but taking the short term trades and compounding creates odd results of little value

as mentioned the main advantage of a 15-year loan compared to a 30-year loan is that the 15-year loan should come at a discounted rate   all things equal the main advantage of the 30-year loan is that the payment is lower a completely different argument from what you are hearing is that if you can get a low interest rate you should get the longest loan possible   it seem unlikely that interest rates are going to get much lower than they are and it 's far more likely that they will get higher   in 15 years if interest rates are back up around 6 or more where they were when i bought my first home and you are 15 years into a 30 year mortgage you 'll being enjoying an interest rate that no one can get you need to keep in mind that as the loan is paid off you will earn exactly 0 on the principal you 've paid   if for some reason the value of the home drops you lose that portion of the principal   the only way you can get access to that capital is to sell the house   you generally ca n't sell part of the house to send a kid to college   you can take out another mortgage but it is going to be at the current going rate which is likely higher than current rates another thing to consider that over the course of 30 years inflation is going to make a fixed payment cheaper over time   let 's say you make $ 60 k and you have a monthly payment of $ 1000 or 20 of your annual income   in 15 years at a 1 annualized wage growth rate it will be 17 of your income   if you get a few raises or inflation jumps up it will be a lot more than that   for example at a 2 annualized growth rate it 's only 15 of your income after 15 years in places where long term fixed rates are not available shorter mortgages are common because of the risk of higher rates later   it 's also more common to pay them off early for the same reason    taking on a higher payment to pay off the loan early only really only helps you if you can get through the entire payment and 15 years is still a long way off   then if you lose your job then you only have to worry about taxes and upkeep but that means you can still lose the home   if you instead take the extra money and keep a rainy day fund you 'll have access to that money if you hit a rough patch   if you put all of your extra cash in the house you 'll be forced to sell if you need that capital and it may not be at the best time   you might not even be able to pay off the loan at the current market value my father took out a 30 year loan and followed the advice of an older coworker to buy as much house as possible because inflation will pay for it   by the end of the loan he was paying something like $ 250 a month and the house was worth upwards of $ 200k.   that is his mortgage payment was less than the payment on a cheap car   it was an insignificant cost compared to his income and he had been able to invest enough to retire in comfort   of course when he bought it inflation was above 10 so it 's bit different today but the same concepts still apply just different numbers   i personally would not take anything less than a 30 year loan at current rates unless i planned to retire in 15 years

there are many aspects to consider in deciding what sort of company you want to form instead of an s corporation you should determine whether it would be better to form a limited liability company llc limited partnership lp or even a professional company pc littleadv is correct there is minimal benefit in forming an s corp with you and your wife as the shareholders if you will be the only contributor worker there are costs associated with an s corporation or any corporation that might outweigh benefits from more favorable tax treatment or personal protection from liability filing fees and disclosure rules vary from state to state for example my father was a who had no employees other than my grandmother she worked for free in a state with income taxes he was advised that a pc was best in new mexico while an s corp was better in florida there are no personal income taxes in florida   the only way to know what to do requires that you consult an accountant a good one for guidance

at your age i do n't think its a bad idea to invest entirely in stocks the concern with stocks is their volatility and at 40 + years from retirement volatility does not concern you just remember that if you ever want to call upon your 401(k for anything other than retirement such as a down payment on a home which is a qualified distribution that is not subject to early distribution penalties then you should reconsider your retirement allocations i would not invest 100 into stocks if i knew i were going to buy a house in five years and needed that money for a down payment if your truly saving strictly for a retirement that could occur forty years in the future first good for you and second put it all in an index fund an s&p index has a ridiculously low expense ratio and with so many years away from retirement it gives you an immense amount of flexibility to choose what to do with those funds as your retirement date approaches closer every year

the price of a bond goes up when yields go down   for example you purchase a 5 bond today for $ 100 and the very next day the same bond is being offered with a rate of 10   will you be able to sell you bond for the $ 100 you paid   no you must compete with the 10 bonds being sold so you will have to sell your bond for less than the $ 100 you paid to compete with the new bonds being sold   thus bond prices are inversely related to bond yields the 20-year index you cited tracks bond prices and bond prices have gone up over the last 10 years which means bond yields have gone down   why have bond prices gone up   demand   more investors are moving their savings into bonds   why   i believe there a couple of reasons   one us treasuries are thought to be one of the safest investments   with the financial crisis and increased stock market volatility see chart below more investors are allocating more of their portfolios to safer investments   two a large portion of the us population is approaching retirement see chart below   these folks are not interested in watching their retirement portfolios potentially shrink in the stock market so they move into bonds

this is a slightly different reason to any other answer i have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of one 's irrationality in the future or in different circumstances can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong first of all why do people sometimes maintain balances on high interest debt when they have savings standard advice on many money management sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt however i think there is a problem with this suppose you have $ 5,000 in a savings account and a $ 2,000 credit card balance you are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account and pay off the cc however the difference between the two scenarios other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance is your motivation for saving if you have a credit card balance of $ 2,000 you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of $ 100 each month if you have any extra money you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month to maintain your savings goal it 's enough to agree with yourself that you wo n't do any new spending on the cc or withdraw any savings   now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings there is now nothing forcing you to save $ 100 each month when you get to the end of the month you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your $ 3,000 savings balance rather than that you have to pay down your cc yes if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it you get something in return for it but it is possible that spending $ 140 on small scale discretionary spending things you do n't need actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company $ 40 interest and saving $ 100 you might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again knowing that you have a 0 balance and that you can always pay it off out of savings it 's easy to this to a situation with two types of debt suppose that you have a $ 2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a $ 2,000 loan at high interest and you get a $ 2,000 windfall let 's assume that your parents do n't need the money in a hurry and are n't you to pay them otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate might it not be better to pay your parents off if you do you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments in 20 paychecks or whatever you might be debt free if you pay off your loan you lose the incentive to save after 20 months you still owe your parents $ 2,000 i am not saying that this is always what makes sense just that it could make sense note that this is an opposite to the debt snowball method that method says that it 's better to pay off small debts because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts the above argues that this is a bad idea because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk it would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend

if your stock is rising and you want to buy on a dip the best way to do this is by looking at the chart and incorporating simple technical analysis techniques firstly an uptrend is defined as a price chart with higher highs and higher lowers if you get a lower high or a lower low or both it could be the end of the uptrend be cautious this can be seen on the chart below with an uptrend line drawn   if you draw a trend line you can wait for the price to approach the trend line bounce off it and start moving up again to buy your stock on a dip if instead the price closes below the trend line be very cautious this could be the end of the uptrend and the start of a downtrend no telling how low the price will go if this is the case you can then draw a downtrend line and wait for the price to close above the downtrend line before making your purchase

if you have multiple accounts you have to empty them all before you can deduct any losses your loss is not a capital loss its a deduction it is calculated based on the total amount you have withdrawn from all your roth ira 's minus the total basis it will be subject to the 2 agi i.e. if your agi is > 100 k none of it is deductible and you have to itemize to get it bottom line think twice summarizing the discussion in comments if you have a very low agi i would guess that your tax liability is pretty low as well even if you deduct the whole $ 2 k and all of it is above the other deductions you have which in turn is above the standard deduction of almost $ 6 k you save say $ 300 if you 're in 15 tax bracket that 's the most savings you have however i 'm assuming something here i 'm assuming that you 're itemizing your deductions already and they 're above the standard deduction this is very unlikely with such a low income you do n't have state taxes to deduct you probably do n't spend a lot to deduct sales taxes and i would argue that with the low agi you probably do n't own property and if you do you do n't have a mortgage with a significant interest on it you can be in 15 bracket with agi between roughly $ 8 k and $ 35 k i.e. you can not deduct between $ 160 and $ 750 of the $ 2 k so it 's already less than the maximum $ 300 if your agi is $ 8 k the deduction does n't matter might cover all of your taxes anyway if your agi is $ 30 k you can deduct only $ 1400 so if you 're in the 15 bracket you saved $ 210 that again assuming it 's above your other deductions which in turn are already above the standard deduction highly unlikely as i said in the comments i do not think you can realistically save on taxes because of this loss in such a manner

where are you planning on buying this etf   i 'm guessing it 's directly through vanguard   if so that 's likely your first reason the majority of brokerage accounts charge a commission per trade for etfs and equities but not for mutual funds    another reason is that people who work in the financial industry brokerages mutual fund companies etc have to request permission for every trade before placing an order   this applies to equities and etfs but does not apply to mutual funds   it 's common for a request to be denied if the brokerage has inside information due to other business lines they 'll block trading if a mutual fund company is trading the same security they 'll block trading etc without an explanation   this can happen for months   for these folks it 's typically easier to use mutual funds so if someone can open an account with vanguard and does n't work in the financial industry then i agree with your premise   the vanguard admiral shares have a much lower expense typically very close to their etfs source   worked for a brokerage and mutual fund company

i support the strategy to buy a less expensive car at the outset and then save for that more expensive car you mentioned that you would be able to save $ 9000 by the time you had to start making payments that sounds like a great budget for car shopping for $ 9k you can get a dependable used car   if you find the right high yield savings account you can get around 2 on your $ 500/month direct deposit that 's a difference of about 5 when you add in the 2.9 interest that you would have been paying on the loan you ca n't find such a low risk investment that would yield 5 these days   also at that rate 2 you would have $ saved up in less than 52 months or over $ in 60 months then you could buy a bmw with cash and i 'm sure they would give you a cash discount alternatively you could be just finishing paying off the loan and might already be looking at the next car you 'll take a loan out for the point is not that you have to completely deprive yourself for the rest of your life but by not taking out a loan you were certainly come out ahead in 5 10 years time   also one common mistake that new grads make is thinking that they are rich right out of college yes you definitely have a nice salary and could afford it by most people 's standards   i have a coworker that graduated and started work a year ago he first bought a brand new subaru why subaru i do not know but that is what he thought he wanted after driving the car for a few months he decided for a few reasons that it was not what he wanted so he sold the car for a loss and bought a slightly used nissan z. he has since decided that he needs a more practical car for day to day driving to minimize the abuse that his z takes so he has bought another car this time a low budget honda had he started with a low budget car he could be driving the same car to work right now but have a good chunk of savings for a new car instead of a loan and a car that he drives only occasionally

i 've been in a very similar situation to yours in the past   since the company is reimbursing you at a flat rate i assume you do n't need to provide documentation receipts in order to be paid the per diem it 's not directly connected to the $ 90 in expenses that you mention   unless they were taking taxes out that would need to be reimbursed the separate category for assets reimbursable city serves no real purpose other than to categorize the expenses since there is no direct relationship between your expenses and the reimbursement i would list them as completely separate transactions later if you needed to locate all of the associated expenses with the trip gnucash lets you search on memo text for and will display all of the related transactions   this is a lot cleaner than having to determine what piece of the per diem goes to which expenses or having to create a new asset account every time you go on a trip

it 's very simple the whole purpose of a credit card for the credit card company is that you borrow money and then pay them interest for the rest of your life the way you describe yourself you are the perfect victim so the obvious thing for you to do is to not touch credit cards with a pole   if you decide to use a credit card then what you should really really do is to pay back the maximum amount possible all the time best is to pay off the credit card in full if at all possible   consider this if you owe them money the interest rate is so high that with the minimum payment your debt will be growing all the time spend $ 1,000 pay $ 10 a month and next year you owe $ 1,100 without having used the credit card at all if you pay $ 32 a month as you mentioned your $ 1,000 purchase is actually a multi year loan if you need a multi year loan for a $ 1,000 purchase an ordinary loan from your bank will be much much cheaper

sorry my response was supposed to be to the above comment not yours my main point was that in africa where there was already a large population did not require bringing in people which you would need to incentivize to move to hence offering the free carrot of property rights to settlers of na to extract resources instead the british and other european powers just used the local populace to extract the resources the main reason the us and canada are well off is that property rights were established very early on and this encouraged people to invest and produce more because the higher production accrued to the producer and the producer would have legal recourse should a negative externality be put upon them by someone else obviously there were other reasons as well but property rights are huge this is true globally now in encouraging people to grow their assets part of the reason africa is still so screwed up is that many of their institutions and governments are too corrupt to protect their citizens property rights thereby discouraging investment and production

one of the reasons is also general distrust to the government another one is that there exist special interest group which profits from the complicated scheme keep adding special cases and has stronger financial situation that the opponents of such complex scheme people do not trust government or companies to act in their best interests so they we waste huge amount of time and/or money to comply with income laws in 2004 democratic presidential primary presidential candidate clark who beyond being general has also master degree in economics from oxford and taught economics in west point proposed similar scheme for people with income under 50 k employer would do all the simple paperwork if desired and get return   in the noise of the campaign idea how to simplify taxes for half of the population was lost   funny how the only candidate in recent history who was both professor of economics not mba which is about business and profits and distinguished military hero could not get any traction in democratic party

if you are still paying off debt then you should have about $ 1000 in savings and put all you can towards non mortgage debt if you do n't have any debt besides your mortgage then add up all of your monthly expenses including food gas utilities and keep 3 6 months in liquid savings whether you keep 3 or 6 months depends on how safe your income is if you have a steady safe job you might be safe with 3 months but if your employer is cutting back or you are in a commission based job or self employed then lean more towards 6 months expenses congrats on your new home

if you bought 5 shares $ 20 each that would cost you $ 100 plus brokerage even if your brokerage was only $ 10 in and out your shares would have to go up 20 just for you to break even you do n't make a profit until you sell so just for you to break even your shares need to go up to $ 24 per share because your share holding would be so small the brokerage even the cheapest around would end up being a large percentage cost of any overall profits if instead you had bought 500 shares at $ 20 being $ 1000 the $ 20 brokerage in and out only represents 2 instead of 20 this is called economies of scale

okay i think i managed to find the precise answer to this problem it involves solving a non linear exponential equation but i also found a good approximate solution using the taylor series see below for a spreadsheet you can use let 's start by defining the growth factors per period for money in the bank and money invested    now let s be the amount ready to be invested after periods so the first of that money has earned interest for n periods that is   the key step to solve the problem was to fix the total number of periods considered so let 's introduce a new variable t = the total number of time periods elapsed so if money is ready to invest every periods there will be separate investments and the future value of the investments will be   this formula is exact in the case of integer t and n and a good approximation when t and n are not substituting s we get the version of the formula which explicitly depends on n   fortunately only a couple of terms in fv depend on n so we can find the derivative after some effort   equating the derivative to zero we can remove the denominator and assuming t is greater than zero we can divide by the constant t   to simplify the equation we can define some extra     then we can define a function f(n and write the equation as   note that g and r are all constant from here there are two options use newton 's method or another numerical method for finding the positive root of f(n this can be done in a number of software packages like matlab etc or by using a graphics calculator solve approximately using a taylor series polynomial i will use this method here the taylor series of f(n around is   the series to the first three terms we get a polynomial with constant coefficients   using r g and defined above let and be the coefficients of the taylor series for f(n     then   n should be rounded to the nearest whole number to be certain check the values above and below n using the formula for fv using the example from the question for example i might put aside $ 100 every week to invest into a stock    with an expected growth of 9 p.a but brokerage fees are $    for how many weeks should i accumulate the $ 100 before investing if i    can put it in my high interest bank account at 4 p.a until then using newton 's method to find roots of f(n above we get n = using the closed form approximate solution we get n = checking this against the fv with t = evenly divisible by each n + 1 tested therefore you should wait for n = 14 periods keeping that money in the bank investing it together with the money in the next period so you will make an investment every 14 + 1 = 15 weeks here 's one way to implement the above solution with a spreadsheet stackexchange does n't allow tables in their syntax at this time so i 'll show a screenshot of the formulae and columns you can copy and paste formulae   copy and paste column a copy and paste column b results   remember n is the number of periods to accumulate money in the bank so you will want to invest every weeks in this case every 15 weeks

all life insurance is pretty much the same when it comes to cost you can run the numbers over certain time period and the actual cost of insurance is about the same a simplified way to explain life insurance and the differences between them below the 3 characteristics of life insurance there are 5 popular types of life insurance and they are term whole life universal life variable universal life indexed universal life but first one must understand the most basic life insurance which is called annual renewable term   this is a policy that covers 1 year and is renewable every year after the cost of insurance typically increases each year as the insured ages so for every year of coverage your premium increases like in the simplified illustration above this is the building block of all life insurance term or permanent there is no cash value all premium goes to the cost of insurance   this is an art that spans over a longer time period than 1 year say 5 10 15 20 or 30 years all the cost is added together then divided by the number of years of coverage to give a level premium payment for the duration of the policy the longest coverage offered these days is 30 years there is no cash value all premium goes to the cost of insurance the premium is fixed level for the term specified if the policy comes to an end and the owner wishes to renew it it will be at higher premium this can be seen in the simplified illustration above for a 15-year term policy   because life insurance gets very expensive as you reach old age life insurance companies came up with a way to make it affordable for the consumer wishing to have coverage for their entire lifespan they allow you to have interest rate crediting on the cash value account inside the policy   to have cash value in the first place you must pay premiums that are more than the cost of insurance the idea is your cash value grows over time to help pay for the cost of insurance in the later stages of the policy where the cost of insurance is typically higher this is illustrated above in an overly simplified way this is a permanent life insurance policy that is designed to cover the lifespan of the insured there is cash value that is credited on a fixed interest rate specified by the insurance company typically 3 5 the premium is fixed for the life of the policy it was designed for insuring the entire lifespan of the insured this is variation of whole life there is cash value it is credited on a fixed interest rate specified by the insurance company but it does fluctuate year to year depending on the economy typically 3 6 the premium is flexible you can increase decrease the premium   this is basically a universal life policy but the cash value sits in an account that is invested in the market normally mutual funds your interest that is being credited to your account with your cash value from investments is subjected to risk in the market rise fall with the market depending on the portfolio of your choosing hence the word variable you take on the risk instead of the insurance company it can be a very good product if the owner knows how to manage it just like any other investment products this is a hybrid of the and the the interest rate depends on the performance of a market index or a set of market indices the insurance company states a maximum interest rate or cap you can earn up to and a guaranteed minimum floor on your cash value interest that will be credited typically 0 floor and 12 cap it is purely a method to credit you interest rate it takes the market risk out of the equation but still retains some of the growth potential of the market term policy is designed for temporary coverage there is no cash value accumulation permanent policies such as whole life universal life variable universal life and indexed universal life have a cash value accumulation component that was originally designed to help pay for the cost of insurance in the later stages of the policy when the insured is at an advanced age so it can cover the entire lifespan of the insured people do take advantage of that cash value component and its tax advantages for retirement income supplement and maximize the premium contribution always remember that life insurance is a life insurance product and not an investment vehicle there is a cost of insurance that you are paying for but if you have life insurance needs you might as well take advantage of the cash value accumulation deferred tax growth and tax free access that these permanent policies offer

index funds are well known to give the best long term investment are they maybe not all the time if you had invested in an index fund tracking the s&p500 at the start of 2000 you would still be behind in terms of capital appreciation when taking inflation into considerations your only returns in 13.5 years would have been any dividends you may have received see the monthly chart of the s&p500 below   diversification can be good for your overall returns but diversification simply for diversification sake is as you said a way of reducing your overall returns in order of smoothing out your equity curve after looking up indexes for various countries the only one that had made decent returns over a 13.5 year period was the indian bse 30 index almost 400 over 13.5 years although it also has gone nowhere since the end of 2007 5.5 years see monthly chart below   so investing internationally especially in developing countries when developed nations are stagnating can improve your returns but i would learn about the various international markets first before straight in regarding investing in an index fund vs direct investment in a select group of shares i did a search on the us markets with the following criteria on the 3rd january 2000   if the resulting top 10 from the search were bought on 3rd january 2000 and held up until the close of the market on the 19th june 2013 the results would be as per the table below   the result almost 250 return in 13.5 years compared to almost no return if you had invested into the whole s&p 500 index note this table lists only the top ten from the search without screening through the charts and no risk management was applied if risk management was applied the 4 losses of would have been limited to a maximum of 20 but possibly much smaller losses or even for gains as they might have gone into positive territory before coming back down as i have not looked at any of the charts i can not confirm this this is one simple example how selecting good shares can result in much better returns than investing into a whole index as you are not pulled down by the bad stocks

the main difference between an etf and a mutual fund is management an etf will track a specific index with no manager input a mutual fund has a manager that is trying to choose securities for its fund based on the mandate of the fund liquidity etfs trade like a stock so you can buy at 10 am and sell at 11 if you wish mutual funds most are valued at the end of each business day so no intraday trading   also etfs are similar to stocks in that you need a buyer seller for the etf that you want have whereas a mutual fund 's units are sold back to itself i do not know of many if any issues with an etf but you could be stuck holding it if you can not find a buyer usually the market maker mutual funds can be closed to trading however it is rare tax treatment both come down to the underlying holdings in the fund or etf however more often in mutual funds you could be stuck paying someone else 's taxes not true with an etf   for example you buy an equity mutual fund 5 years ago you sell the fund yourself today for little to no gain i buy the fund a month ago and the fund manager sells a bunch of the stocks they bought for it 10 years ago for a hefty gain i have a tax liability you do not even though it is possible that neither of us have any gains in our pocket it can even go one step further and 6 months from now i could be down money on paper and still have a tax liability expenses a mutual fund has an mer or management expense ratio you pay it no matter what if the fund has a positive return of 12.5 in any given year and it has an mer of 2.5 then you are up 10 however if the fund loses 7.5 with the same mer you are down 10 an etf has a much smaller management fee typically 0.10 0.95 but you will have trading costs associated with any trades risks involved in these as well as any investment are many and likely too long to go into here however in general if you have a canadian stock etf it will have similar risks to a canadian equity mutual fund i hope this helps

in steady state the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside   the amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures and the overall insulation quality   thus a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air    in practice people open the door take cold food out put warm food in and the unit may also make ice dispense cold water and itself   aside from tweaking those uses e.g. minimizing time with the door open a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space   this helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass so it cools down rapidly   when you need the space you can remove the cartons and set them aside similarly water filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator particularly if the electric utilities are erratic   however they increase the cost of when cooling the water in the first place and when you eventually dump out the water the expense of cooling it goes down the drain

i do n't think you have your head in the right space you seem to be thinking of these lifecycle funds like they 're an annuity or a pension but they 're not they 're an investment specifically they 're a mutual fund that will invest in a collection of other mutual funds which in turn invest in stock and bonds stocks go up and stocks go down bonds go up and bonds go down how much you 'll have in this fund next year is unknowable much less 32 years from now what you can know is that saving regularly over the next 32 years and investing it in a reasonable and diversified way in a tax sheltered account like that roth will mean you have a nice chunk of change sitting there when you retire the lifecycle funds exist to help you with that reasonable and diversified bit they're meant to be one stop shopping for a retirement portfolio they put your money into a diversified portfolio then age the portfolio allocations over time to make it go from a high risk potentially high reward allocation now to a lower risk lower reward portfolio as you approach retirement the idea is is that you want to shoot for making lots of money now but when you 're older you want to focus more on keeping the money you have incidentally kudos for getting into seriously saving for retirement when you 're young one of the biggest positive effects you can have on how much you retire with is simply time the more time your money can sit there the better at 26 if you 're putting away 10 percent into a roth you 're doing just fine if that 5k is more than 10 percent you 'll do better than fine that 's a rule of thumb but it 's based on a lot of things i 've read where people have gamed out various scenarios as well as my own calculations i 've done in the past

the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent maynard keynes the stocks could stagnate and trade in a thin range or decline in value you assume that your stocks will offer you any positive return for every month over 24 months just one month of negative returns puts you underwater that s what s wrong with it   even if you identified any stock that has been up every month for a consecutive 24 months in the past there is nothing that says it will be so in the future and a broad market selloff will effect both indexes as well as individual stocks   literally any adverse macroeconomic event in the next two years will put you underwater on your loan no matter how much research you do on individual stocks

what you 're getting at is the same as investing with leverage usually this comes in the form in a margin account which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate invest the money and hopefully beat the interest rate   is this approach unwise that completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loan 's interest rate is the higher your loan 's interest rate the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate if you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations you have come out ahead and made a profit if you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest if not then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan   are there really are investments aside from stocks and such that i can try to use to my advantage with interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the us you 'll probably be hard pressed to find a savings account or cd that will return a higher interest rate than your loan 's if you 're nervous about the risk associated with investing in stocks and bonds as is healthy then know that they come in a wide spectrum of risk it 's up to you to evaluate how much risk you 're willing to take on to achieve a higher return

ordinarily a cosigner does not appear on the car 's title thus no ownership at all in the vehicle but they are guaranteeing payment of the loan if the primary borrower does not make the payment you have essentially two options stop making payments for him   if he does not make them the car will be repossessed and the default will appear on both his and your credit   you will have a credit ding to live with but he will to and he wo n't have the car continue to make payments if he does not to preserve your credit and sue him for the money you have paid   in your suit you could request repayment of the money or have him sign over the title ownership to you if you would be happy with either option   i suspect that he will object to both so the judge is going to have to decide if he finds your case has merit if you go with option 1 and he picks up the payments so the car is n't repossessed you can then still take option 2 to recover the money you have paid   be prepared to provide documentation to the court of the payments you have made bank statements showing the out go or other form of evidence you made the payment the finance company 's statements are n't going to show who made them

when you exercise a put you get paid the strike price immediately so you can invest that money and earn some interest compared to only exercising at expiry so the benefit to exercising early is that extra interest the cost is the remaining time value of the option along with any dividend payments you miss as @joetaxpayer points out there might be tax considerations that make it better to exercise at one time rather than another but those would likely be personal to you so if the option would intrinsically have more value unexercised in many cases you could sell it on rather than exercise it the exception might be if it was n't very liquid and the transaction costs of doing that outweighed the theoretical value

# 426771
the problem i have with gold is that it 's only worth what someone will pay you for it   to a degree that 's true with any equity but with a company there are other capital resources etc that provide a base value for the company and generally a business model that generates income gold just sits there it does n't make products it does n't perform services you ca n't eat it and the main people making money off of it are the folks charging a not commission to sell it to you or buy it back   sure it 's used in small quantities for things like plating electrical contacts dental work shielding etc but industrial uses account for only 10 of consumption   mostly it 's just hoarded either in the form of jewelry 50 or investment bullion coins 40   its value derives largely from rarity and other than the last few years there 's no track record of steady growth over time like the stock market or real estate just look at what gold prices did between 10 to 30 years ago i 'm not sure it came anywhere near close to keeping pace with inflation during that time   if you look at the chart you see a steady price until the us went off the gold standard in 1971 and rules regarding ownership and trading of gold were relaxed   there was a brief run up for a few years after that as the market found its level as it were and you really need to look from about 74 forward which it experienced its first test and demonstration of a supporting price around inflation adjusted   then the price fluctuated largely between 800 to 400 per ounce adjusted for inflation for the next 30 years other than a brief sympathetic silver tuesday spike due to the hunt brothers manipulation of silver prices in 1980   not sure if there is any causality but it is interesting to note that the recent in price starts in 2000 at almost the same time the last country the swiss went off the gold standard and gold was no longer tied to any currency or versa    if you bought in 75 as a hedge against inflation you were down as much as 50 during much of the next 33 years   if you managed to buy at a low the couple of times that gold was going down and found support around adjusted then you were on average up slightly as much as a little over 50 throwing out silver tuesday but then from about 98 through 05 had barely broken even   i personally view investments in gold at this time as a speculation   look at the history below and ask yourself if buying today would more likely end up as buying in 1972   or 1975 or gods forbid 1980   would you be taking advantage of a buying opportunity or piling onto a bubble and end up buying at the high   note from joe the article demand and supply adds to the discussion and supports chuck 's answer

i do n't think this is a french thing   it 's like this everywhere   banks always want people to open accounts of every type   a person with a checking account should be easy to sell on a savings account at the same institution given that it does not appear that they will have any chance to recover the money they spend to get customers to open these accounts there are no fees and they have to pay out the interests even if very small oh they recover it   banks make money by having deposits that they can use to lend out   they do pay interest on deposits but not as much as they earn on your money   if they persuade you to have a savings account in addition to your checking account then you might find it convenient and then move your money out of a different institution into their savings account   or you might stop hoarding it under your mattress   or whatever   more money in their accounts means more profit for them i do n't know whether banks make more profit per dollar in savings or checking accounts   i see banks pushing for both   i think they simply view more accounts as a good thing because it can lead to more total savings in their institution   that 's how they make money

essentially what you 're describing is a leveraged investment   as others noted the question is how confident you can be that a the returns on the investment will exceed what you 're paying in interest and b that if you lose the bet you 'll still be able to pay off the loan without severely yourself   i did essentially this when i bought my house taking out a larger loan than necessary and leaving more money in my investments which had been returning more than the mortgage 's interest rate i then got lucky during the recession and was able to refinance down to under 4 which i am very certain my investment will beat i actually considered the term of the loan for that reason or borrowing a bit more but decided not to double down on the bet that was my own risk comfort threshold know exactly what your risks are including secondary effects of these risks run the numbers to see what the likely return is decide whether you like the odds enough to go for it

alright bud i 'm sure you 're a smart and nice person who just wants people to earn as much as they possibly can at least i hope you are so let 's look at it logically    you are suggesting people that are unskilled uneducated lack the ability to negotiate in their favor and a government law must be placed to help them however the effect of a higher minimum wage means you now force that very individual to compete with more people for that same position this is because there 's not a lot of competition for a job that pays say $ because skilled people do n't apply to them the higher you set that minimum wage like the livable wage of $ 15/hr that i hear so much about the more skilled people will apply to these positions because they now pay more what makes you think an unskilled uneducated individual will be able to find employment in this competitive environment you are assuming that people earning minimum wage today will continue earning a minimum wage even if a higher minimum wage law is passed    also remember that employment goes both ways just as a potential employee has the freedom to walk away from a wage he does n't like an employer is free to not hire an employee for a given wage an employer does not hire personnel that provides value less than the wage paid because that employee now costs the employer to keep him retained so when you enforce a minimum wage which states an employer must at a minimum pay a certain wage you forcibly fire all the employees that do not merit that wage you effectively take away the 1 bargaining chip unskilled and uneducated individuals can offer which is offering to work for lower wages

well keep in mind until the housing crash fannie and freddie made money they received no help from the federal gov't the whole idea of the secondary mortgage market was to keep money flowing to home buyers and everyone who bought a home benefited via rates a few points lower than if banks had to keep all the capital on hand to back all the loans   both these institutions worked well for about 40 years the here was that ratings agency rated these bonds as aaa when in fact they were junk that 's who failed in their due diligence and really should be held accountable as if they were rated junk the banks would have no one to buy them except at junk bond interest rates meaning they would n't have made these loans to people who could n't really afford houses the rating agencies were supposed to be neutral of the debt and instead they essentially took what amounts to bribes from the banks to rate them highly

there are several variables to consider taxes fees returns taxes come in two stages while adding money to the account you can save on state taxes if the account is linked to your state if you use an out of state 529 plan there is no tax savings keep in mind that other people such as grandparents can set aside money in the 529 plan $ 1500 a year with 6 state taxes saves you $ 90 in state taxes a year the second place it saves you taxes is that the earnings if they are used for educational purposes are tax free you do n't pay taxes on the gains during the 10 + years the account exists if those expenses meet the irs guidelines they will never be taxed   it does get tricky because you ca n't double dip on expenses a dollar from the 529 plan ca n't be used to pay for an expenses that will be claimed as part of the education tax credit how those rules will change in the next 18 years is unknown fees they are harder to guess what will happen over the decades as a whole 401(k programs have had to become more transparent regarding their fees i hope the same will be true for the state run 529 programs   returns one option in many all plans is an automatic change in risk as the child gets closer to college a newborn will be all stock a high school senior will be all bonds many all also allow you to opt out of the automatic risk shift though they will limit the number of times you can switch the option time horizon making a decision that will impact numbers 18 years from now is hard to gauge laws and rules may change the existence of tax breaks and their rules are hard to predict but one area you can consider is that if you move states you can roll over the money into a new account or create a second account in the new state to take advantage of the tax breaks there   there are also rules regarding transferring of funds to another person the impact of scholarships and attending schools like the service the tax breaks at deposit are important but the returns can be significant and the ability shelter them in the 529 is very important

i would put about a month 's worth of expenses in the highest paying savings account that you find convenient to access for the rest i recommend ally 's high yield cds specifically the 5-year option normally 5 years would be way too long to commit short term savings to a cd however the ally cds allow you to break them for a penalty of only two months worth of interest if you look at the graph below from when the rates were apy you can see the effective interest rate at every possible time you break the cd early doing the math if you can keep your savings in the account for at least four months it will outperform any other current fdic backed investment that i am aware of for the length of time the money was invested   credit

in general a stock can open at absolutely any price with no regard for the closing price or after hours price the previous day the opening price will be determined by the best bid and offer made by people who decide to trade the next day   some of the those people may have put orders in on a prior day that are still on the books and matter but there 's a lot of time overnight for people to cancel orders and enter new ones which is especially likely to happen if there was substantive news overnight as for what you can do in your case you have the same options that you always had   sell or hold   if you 're selling you can sell after hours in the pre open hours or during the trading day   there 's nothing we can say about this case that 's really any different than we can say about any other stock on any other day

the short answer is that the exchange of the stock in exchange for the elimination of a debt is a taxable exchange and gains or losses are possible for the stock investor as well as the bank    the somewhat longer answer is best summarized as noting that banks do n't usually accept stocks as collateral mostly because stock values are volatile and most banks are not equipped to monitor the risk involved but it is very much part of the business of stock brokers    in the usa as a practical matter i only know of stock brokerages offering loans against stock as part of the standard services of a margin account you can get a margin account at any us stock broker the stockholder can deposit their shares in the margin account and then borrow around 50 of the value though that is a bit much to borrow and a lower amount would be safer from sudden demands for repayment in the form of margin calls in a brokerage account i can not imagine a need to repay a margin loan if the stocks dividends plus capital appreciation rises in value faster than the margin loan rate creates interest charges   trouble begins as the stock value goes down   when the value of the loan exceeds a certain percentage of the stock value which can depend on the stock and the broker 's policy but is also subject to federal rules like regulation t the broker can call in the loan and/or take initiative to sell the stock to repay the loan    notice that this may result in a capital gain or loss depending on the investor 's tax basis which is usually the original cost of the stock   of course this sale affects the taxes of the investor of who gets the money

when dividend is announced the stock and option price may react to that news but the actual payout of the dividend on the ex dividend date is what you probably are referring to the dividend payout affects the stock price on the ex dividend date as the stock price will drop by the amount of paid out dividend not taking into account other factors this in turn drives the prices of all options   the amount of change in the option price for this event is not only dependent the dividend payout but also on how far these are in our out of the money and what there time to expiration is the price of a call option that is far out of the money would react less than the price of a put that would be far in the money therefore i would argue that these two will not necessarily offset each other

in my opinion every person regardless of his or her situation should be keeping track of their personal finances   in addition i believe that everyone regardless of their situation should have some sort of budget spending plan for many people it is tempting to ignore the details of their finances and not worry about it   after all the bank knows how much money i have right   i get a statement from them each month that shows what i have spent and i can always go to the bank 's website and find out how much money i have right   unfortunately this type of thinking can lead to several different problems overspending   in olden days it was difficult to spend more money than you had   most purchases were made in cash so if your wallet had cash in it you could spend it and when your wallet was empty you were required to stop spending   in this age of credit and electronic transactions this is no longer the case   it is extremely easy to spend money that you do n't yet have and find yourself in debt   debt of course leads to interest charges and future burdens for the future   without a plan it is difficult to know if you have saved up enough for large future expenses   will you have enough money to pay the water bill that only shows up once every three months or the property tax bill that only shows up once a year   will you have enough money to pay to fix your car when it breaks   will you have enough money to replace your car when it is time   how about helping out your kids with college tuition or funding your retirement   without a plan all of these are very difficult to manage without proper accounting    anxiety   not having a clear picture of your finances can lead to anxiety   this can happen whether or not you are actually overspending and whether or not you have enough saved up to cover future expenses because you simply do n't know if you have adequately covered your situation or not   making a plan and doing the accounting necessary to ensure you are following your plan can take the worry out of your finances fear of spending   there was an interesting question from a user last year who was not at all in trouble with his finances yet was always afraid to spend any money because he did n't have a budget spending plan in place   if you spend money on a vacation are you putting your property tax bill in jeopardy   with a good budget in place you can know for sure whether or not you will have enough money to pay your future expenses and can spend on something else today this can all be done with or without the aid of software but like many things a computer makes the job easier   a good personal finance program will do two things keeps track of your spending and balances apart from your bank   the bank can only show you things that have cleared the bank   if you set up future payments outside of the bank or you write a check that has not been cashed yet or you spend money on a credit card and have not paid the bill yet these will not be reflected in your bank balance online   however if you manually enter these things into your own personal finance program you can see how much money you actually have available to spend lets you plan for future spending   the spending plan or budget lets you assign a job to every dollar that you own   by doing this you wo n't spend rent money at the bar and you wo n't spend the car insurance money on a vacation i 've written before about the details on how some of these software packages work   to answer your question about double entry accounting some software packages do use true double entry accounting gnucash ledger and some do not ynab everydollar mvelopes   in my opinion double entry accounting is an unnecessary complication for personal finances   if you do n't already know what double entry accounting is stick with one of the simpler solutions

if you can afford the cost and risk of 100 shares of stock then just sell a put option   if you can only afford a few shares you can still use the information the options market is trying to give you see below a standing limit order to buy a stock is essentially a synthetic short put option position 1   so deciding on a stock limit order price is the same as valuing an option on that stock options and standing limit orders are hard to value and the generally accepted math for doing so the black scholes merton framework is also generally accepted to be wrong because of black so rather than calculate a stock buy limit price yourself it 's simpler to just sell a put at the put 's own midpoint price accepting the market 's best estimate options market makers whole job and the purpose of the open market is price discovery so it 's easier to let them fight it out over what price options should really be trading at the result of that fight is valuable information use it sell a atm put option every month until you get exercised after which time you 'll own 100 shares of stock purchased at this will typically give you a much better cost basis several dollars better versus buying the stock at spot and it the valuation math onto the options market   meanwhile you get to keep the cash from the options premiums as well disclaimer markets do make mistakes   you will lose money when the stock drops more than the option market 's own estimate if you ca n't afford 100 shares or for some reason still want to be in the business of creating synthetic options from pure stock limit orders then you could maybe play around with setting your stock purchase bid price to approximately see your statistics book for how to set 1 standard deviation gives you a 30 chance of a fill 2 gives you a 5 chance etc disclaimer the above math probably has mistakes do your own work   it 's somewhat invalid anyway because stock prices do n't follow a normal curve so standard deviations do n't really mean a whole lot   this is where market makers earn their keep or not if you still want to create synthetic options using stock limit orders you might be able to get the options market to do more of the math for you try setting your stock limit order bid equal to something like this where is the strike price of a put option for the equity you 're trading   which option expiration and strike you use for depends on your desired time horizon and desired fill probability   to get probability you can look at the delta for a given option   the relationship between option delta and equity limit order probability of fill is approximately disclaimer there may be math errors here   again do your own work also while this method assumes option markets provide good estimates see above disclaimer about the markets making mistakes

you can not do a 1031 exchange with stocks bonds mutual funds or etfs   there really is n't much difference between an etf and its equivalent index mutual fund both will have minimal capital gains distributions i would not recommend selling an index mutual fund and taking a short term capital gain just to buy the equivalent etf

you are correct to be wary car dealerships make money selling cars and use many tactics and advertisements to entice you to come into their showroom we are in desperate need of insert your make model year and color we have several people who want that exact car you have come in and sell it to us and buy a new car at a great price we 'll give you so much money on your trade in in reality they play a shell game and have you focus on your monthly payment by extending the loan to 4 or 5 years or longer they can make your monthly payment lower sure but the total amount paid is much higher you 're right it 's not in your best interest buy a car and drive it into the ground being free of car payments is a luxury

there is some element of truth to what your realtor said   the seller takes the house off the market after the offer is accepted but the contract is contingent upon among other things buyer securing the financing a lower down payment can mean a higher chance of failing that the buyer might be going through fha va or other programs that have additional restrictions if the buyer fails to secure a financing that 's weeks and months lost to the seller in a seller 's market this can be an important factor in how your bid is perceived by the seller sometimes it even helps to disclose your credit score for the same reason of course for your situation you will have to assess whether this is the case certainly do not let your realtor push you around to do things you are not comfortable with edit   a higher down payment also helps in the situation where the house appraisal does not fare well   as @dilip sarwate has pointed out the particular area you are interested in is probably a seller 's market thus giving sellers more leverage in picking bids all else equal if you are the seller with multiple offers coming in at similar price level would you pick the one with 20 down or 5 down while it is true that realtors have their own motives to push through a deal as quickly as possible the sellers can also be in the same boat one less mortgage payment is not trivial to many it 's a complicated issue as every party involved have different interests again do your own due diligence be educated and make informed decisions

unfortunately i 've seen every single example you 've provided from the health care providers perspective   trust me they are n't happy about the situation either hence the reason they will demand up front payment from you based on who your insurance carrier is   i could name a few of the top brand name insurance companies in this country that do all of this to their clients    medical billing is an incredibly over complicated beast   one that insurance companies have been doing everything they can to make worse over the years   the codes can change annually and there are many different codes which can cover the exact same situation   sure the insurance company might cover but if you happen to be pregnant well that may not covered even though the treatment is the exact same what can you do consider locating a new insurance company   you do have options and do n't have to go with the one your company uses   the downside is that this is going to take quite a bit of research on your part and it will end up costing you more money on your monthly premiums simply because your company wo n't be footing part of the bill    talk to other co workers and see if their experiences match yours   if so try to get a large enough group together to approach management and demand resolution    a third potential avenue is to get politically involved but i 'm enough of a pessimist that i doubt that would do any good   from what i 've seen neither major political party 's current position actually does anything to solve the problem a fourth option is suing the insurance company but that is going to be incredibly expensive and take forever   you might have better luck getting together with a bunch of local people and demand your attorney general review the billing payment practices again this is going to require a lot of effort a fifth option is to attempt to cash pay your bills and submit them yourself to the insurance company for reimbursement   if you do this you can likely negotiate lower bills with the medical provider   for anything less than about $ 2,000 i negotiate the amount prior to service   believe me when i say that providers are more than happy to give decent discounts if they know they wo n't have to deal with the insurance companies themselves   slightly more work for you but could be far cheaper in the long run

you are right on track with your idea of setting up a separate account for invoiced income create a new account with the type other asset and call it receivables or something similar every time you invoice a client enter a credit to this account with the amount of the invoice once the client pays and you deposit a check enter a transfer from the receivables account to the bank account edit i overlooked that you wish to account for not yet invoiced income i think that 's a bad idea it will become confusing and will give you the false sense that your financial condition is better than it really is there are plenty of stories about businesses that have stellar sales but fail because of lack of cash flow the business bills become due before it gets paid by its own customers

nobody has a crash proof portfolio you can make it crash resistant you protect against a crash by diversifying and not reacting out of fear when the markets are down be careful about focusing on the worst possible scenario us default vs. the more likely scenarios right now many people think that inflation and interest rates are heading up so you should be making sure that your bond portfolio is mostly in short duration bonds that are less sensitive to rate risk another risk is opportunity cost many people sold all of their equities in and are sitting on lots of money in cash accounts that money is safe but those investors lost the opportunity to recoup investments or grow to the tune of 25 40

the taxi industry   each city has it 's own way of regulating taxis car service and a lot of times they fall under different jurisdictions   the regulatory bodies are n't really a cash crop for municipalities   radio companies and fleet owners are separate a lot of times and neither are really rolling in the dough a fleet owner i know drives a 2004 camry and only recently was able to buy a house in his 60 's   the drivers usually lease from the owners and bring home about $ 20,000 a year even if they take radio calls and drive like a   it 's not some giant industry monopolized by holding everyone back with their draconian style of operation   it is easier to compare taxis and car service to other public services like buses and trains

bernie sources   gt heading out to open land to make your society in your image would definitely prove your point as long as it works   and do that how buy my own island sea and hope the us military does n't just drop a seal team on my head   gt;we just have plenty of evidence that no government is less so   no we really have evidence that structure is better than nothing i 'm not advocating for no structure businesses charities organizations etc obviously work better when they are well structured   to answer your enron example no corporation would have enough power to actually do something like that if they did n't have at least partial backing by the government    you know the drill big business buy politicians contributions politicians write big business laws anti competitive to push small guys out then when big business needs additional help politicians come in to save the day bailouts   the market would be extremely more competitive if for example the dodd frank act which to my understanding the repeal just recently passed the house went away it has been community banks just like glass did it essentially only allowed the big banks to compete surprise they did some stupid things great recession but if you do n't think they did n't already know that they those bailouts were coming if needed you are fooling yourself   these messages are almost getting to the point of tldr   i want to simplify our debate a bit   the crux of my whole belief is this the only way for a government to spend their citizens money in a better way than the citizens could would be if the government knew the utility of every single citizen it is absolutely impossible to do that the only people that truly know their own utility from something is them self    from here on i would like to debate the headlines like what i wrote above and not necessarily bullet points we can every now and then but i find that we then start working on tangents of tangents of tangents and can get a little messy   however i do not want to leave the current stones with your response   i would say that if it was privatized you are not going to have scope creep at least not to the same extent say we have the la militia that is wanting to help protect their ports they want to help develop a new boat that is fast and can help maneuver around big ships quickly like a better version of the new mark patrol boat   that money is their money directly or the peoples money who they 've asked to voluntarily give their money up to help protect their area   if they screw up and start asking for above necessary stuff or pick a developer who wastes their money etc they are going to lose business they will stop getting donations lose profit etc   however the government does n't have that why because their revenue donations are n't voluntary there really is n't accountability especially in bureaucracy    to the exchange stock problem i would say that exchanges are private businesses too they should have full reign on whether they allow trades if they believe that there is an unnecessary selloff because of a fake tweet saying that president has been shot they can stop that if fact it would be in there best interest to do so because it could limit unnecessary investor losses   it is unfortunate that the whole world is covered with governments i wish there was another western to populate and try new ways with   however i would say that there is a clear shift away from government is society   a few examples the driverless car elderly people and people who are disabled will be able to rely on the government less for transportation additionally assuming everyone will eventually have a driverless car there will be much less demand for traffic cops etc   cryptocurrency as there are now more and more businesses that stop accepting cash mainly starting with change there will naturally be less robbers because there is no money to steal you could make the argument that there will be an increase in cyber theft which i agree but not on a 1:1 ratio of the decrease in physical this decrease will help also lessen the demand for police officers   package delivery if it was n't for the post office their ability to deliver letters and using they would have gone broke a long time ago imagine amazon dhl ups fedex etc all competing to deliver you letter i 'm assuming that it would be less than the cost of a current stamp and with a lot more assurance that it will actually get to its destination   those are just a few examples

see the accepted answer for this question   what effect will credit card churning for frequent flyer miles have on my credit score this does not directly answer how often that you asked but it states that the answerer opens 5 15 accounts per year   so the answer to your question is as often as you want as long as you manage your account ages the reason for this is that there are two factors in opening a new account that affect your credit card score   one is average age of accounts the other is credit inquiries   that answerer with fico in high sees about a 5 swing based on new cards and closing old ones you 'll have to manage average age of accounts   i assume this is done by keeping some older ones open to prop up the average and by closing the churn accounts finally if you choose to engage in churning and you intend to apply for a large loan and want a good credit score simply pause the account open close part of the churn a couple of months ahead of time   your score should recover from the temporary hits of the inquiries    the churning communities really do have how to guides which discuss the details of this   key phrase credit card churning

i do n't see how anyone could give you a hard and fast formula unless they know where to get some applicable statistics because several factors here are not a straight calculation if you do n't replace the tires but keeping driving the car what is the increased probability that you will get into an accident because of the bald tires how much will bald tires vs new tires affect the selling price of the car presumably the longer you drive the car after getting new tires the less increase this will give to the market value of the car what 's the formula for that if you keep the car what 's the probability that it will have other maintenance problems etc that said it 's almost always cheaper to keep your current car than to buy a new one even if you have maintenance problems it would have to be a huge problem to cost more than buying a new car suppose you buy a $ 25,000 car with what 's a typical new car loan these days maybe 5 years at 5 so your payments would be about $ per month if you compare spending $ 1000 for new tires versus paying $ per month on a new car loan the tires are cheaper within 3 months the principle is the same if you buy with cash to justify buying a new car you have to factor in the value of the pleasure you get from a new car the peace of mind from having something more reliable etc mostly intangibles

this person could buy another car at any moment without any money problems so i do n't really see any point in insuring especially with such a ridiculously high price compared to the extremely low risk convenience   if you self insure then an accident means that you have to make arrangements to get the car fixed evaluated etc   if you buy insurance your insurer would prefer to do all that   they argue with the mechanic over prices the lawyer over liability etc    and of course rich people need more liability insurance than other people not less   so part of that $ 1400 is probably money that your friend would have to pay regardless

on line 21 of schedule d you write the smaller of so in your case since your line 16 shows a loss of more than $ 3000 on line 21 you write 3000 on line 21 the indicating that is it a negative number are already included on the form also you write 3000 on form 1040 line 13 the rest of the loss is a carryover to next year be sure to fill out the capital loss carryover worksheet where the carryover to next year is computed summary you can not write 0 on line 21 of schedule d and carry over the entire loss to next year you must deduct $ 3000 this year and carry over the rest of the loss to next year

if i had to take sides i 'd think that it would be better to be able to divide up the entirety of your savings into big buckets as others are saying in their answers if not in physically accounts then at least conceptually let 's say you 're 45 years old and have $ 350,000 in various accounts   i would argue that you should at the very least know this level of detail so if you get in a really really bad accident that costs $ 100,000 you know at least conceptually that now you 're in a better position to revise your goals   maybe you decide that real estate is n't all that and you allocate the entire shortfall to that item and reallocate it to start the first safety program in the country so now it looks like this but had you not the funds to begin with you would n't have known where you stood

i think you are the scenario by assuming a benefit that does n't exist assume an employee earns 50k before considering the the corporation wants to cover the they have two options increase the salary to $ or keep the salary the same and pay for the directly both options increase the employee 's taxable income by $ 900 both options decrease the corporation 's income by $ 900 net tax for each is unchanged note i could n't find any specific reference to the in income tax documentation on either bc finance 's or cra 's website i am assuming that it is treated as a regular cash benefit though i am not 100 convinced this is the case if i am wrong in this please provide a comment below

the biggest issue with a pure physical dividend is the cost of transfer cash or stock dividends are decentralized and easy to transfer ownership hence the majority of value can be transferred to the shareholder    if you were to deliver wine to every shareholder you would have to deduct the cost of transport from the value of the wine dividend otherwise it becomes value to shareholders and they 'd be better off keeping the dividend as stock value

a big part of why the insurers are pulling is is the uncertainty   the aca model worked in ma and is based on market forces there is no reason it should n't succeed other that being actively by the gop no legislation this big works out of the box yet this one has not been allowed to improve for 8 years and the gop was rewarded for that sabotage   if the insurance companies had clear understanding of the marketplace for the next few years you would not have this problem   there are changes that are needed imo first thing is to get rid of the employee mandate if it was up to me i d change it so no company would offer health insurance i do n't get my car insurance through work why do i get my health insurance from them but that is long term and we need to ease into it   there are other issues as well but they are all   the overall costs are an issue and that is not addressed in aca at all that i do n't have an answer for but the aca did n't make it worse

there are many factors    most gas stations price their gas based on what it will cost them to replace it   so when their supplier raises the price that it charges the station the station typically raises its prices   the suppliers tend to have their own rates   the business needs to make a profit so the business sets the price where it feels it will make the most money some stations buy bargain gas   many people say they find this gas to be just fine   personally some stations gas seems to make my cars run much worse   i can say that my mileage can vary by as much as 4 miles to the gallon based on where i get my gas   so i pay more to go to those stations that consistently have provided me good gasoline   however higher prices do not necessarily mean better gas   we have a bp just down the street that seems to have bad gas while one about a half a mile away that i prefer because i have never had a bad tank of gas   both are priced about the same also some have special tax zones   these are local taxes levied based on the location   we have 4 different zones here in il 150k pop   that does not take into account the smaller cities around us

over a period of time greater than 10 years keep in mind 2000 2009 ten year period fails so i am talking longer the market as measured by the s&p 500 was positive long term averaging more than 10%/yr   at a 1 year horizon the success is 67 or so percent it 's mostly for this reason that those asking about investing are told that if they need money in a year or two to buy a house for instance they are told to stay out of the market   as the time approaches one day or less the success rate drops to 50/50 the next trade being higher or lower is a random event   say you have a $ 5 commission a $ 10,000 trade buy sell is $ 10 for the day 250 trading days costs you $ 2500 if you get in and out once per day you need to be ahead 25 for the year to break even   you can spin the numbers any way you wish but in the end time long time spans is on your side

here is a simple way to analyze the situation go to your bank or credit union website and use their loan calculator with their current real interest rates and down payment requirements enter the rate and number of years enter different values for the loan amount to get the monthly payment to the level you want $ 400 today for my credit union the max loan would be about $ 9,500 keep in mind there may be taxes registration fees and down payment on top of this jump ahead two years the loan is paid off the car is owned free and clear you will be able to sell it and get some money in your pocket   if you go for a longer term loan to keep the payments under your goal the issue is that in two years you might be upside down on the loan the car may be worth less than the remaining balance on the loan your equity would be negative

yes bond funds are marked to market so they will decline as the composition of their holdings will households actually have relative levels of credit to equity holdings   the reason why is because there is little return on credit making it irrational to hold any amount greater than to fund future liquidity needs risk adjusted and time discounted the vast majority of credit is held by insurance companies   pension funds have large stakes as well   banks hold even fewer bonds since they try to sell them as soon as they 've made them insurance companies are forced to hold a large percentage of their floats in credit then preferred equity   while this their returns it 's not a large problem for them because they typically hold bonds until maturity   only the ones who the risk of insurance will have to sell at unfavorable prices being able to predict interest rates thus bond prices accurately would make one the best bond manager in the world   while it does look like inflation will rise again soon just as it has during every other us expansion can it be assured when commodity prices are high in real terms and look like they may be in a collapse   the banking industry would have to produce credit at a much higher rate to counter the deflation of all physical goods households typically shun assets at low prices to pursue others at high prices so their holdings of bonds etfs should be expected to decline during a bond collapse   if insurance companies find it less costly to hold etfs then they will contribute to an increase in bond etf supply

the time value decay is theoretically constant   in reality it is driven by supply and demand just like everything else in the market    for instance if a big earnings announcement is coming out after the close for the day you may see little or no time decay in the price of the options during the day before also while in theory options have a set value as related to the trading price of the underlying security that does not mean there will always be a buyer willing to pay a premium as they come close to expiration in the last few minutes you ca n't forget to account for the transaction fees associated with buying the options or the risk factor involved    it is rare but there are times i 've actually had to sell in the money calls at a penny or two less than they 're actually worth at the time just to unload them in the last few minutes before the market closed on expiration day

not sure why the downvote seems like a fair question to me who owns a house and in what proportions can be totally separate from who is named on the mortgage   there are two ways to do this one way would be for you loan them the money   first under a separate contract which you should have a solicitor draw up then they buy the house themselves the contract would state the terms for repayment of the loan which could be e.g. no repayment due until the sale of the house at which point the original amount is returned plus interest equivalent to the growth in value of the house between purchase and sale or whatever you 'd need to be clear about what happened if the house lost value or they ended up in a negative equity situation the other option is where you are directly a party to the purchase of the house and are named as part owners on the deeds again the solicitor who is handling the house purchase for them would help with the paperwork in either case you would need to clear this arrangement with the mortgage company to make sure they were ok with it   to answer your specific questions in order yes they would still be eligible for the help to buy isas assuming that is what you are referring to even though you would not be i 'm not sure what penalty you are referring to you 'd have to pay tax on any income or capital gain you made from the deal no one can say whether this is a good deal for you without knowing a great deal more about your individual circumstances and even then any such advice you would get on here is worth as much as you pay for it if in doubt consult an ifa

espp is common among us companies often with a framework similar to your outline   in the us some allow sales of shares to be considered qualifying subject to capital gains rather than ordinary income tax if they are sold at least 2 years after the enrollment date and at least 1 year after the purchase date   these details can vary from one plan to another and will be stated in the company 's espp enrollment documents    do look at the high and low values of the stock over the last year   if it swings up and down more than 15 or whatever the discount is then that risk should be a factor in your decision   if the stock is trending upward over the long term and you are confident in the durability of the company then you might favor holding

i agree with this i like to buy stocks that are priced low according to value investing principles but set limits to sell if the stock happens to get priced at a point that exceeds x% annualized return for instance 15 or 30 depending on preference if the price goes up i cash out and find the next best value stock and repeat if the price does not go up then i hold it which is fine because i only buy what i 'm comfortable with holding for the long term i tend to prefer stocks that have a dividend yield in the 2 6 range so i can keep earning a return   also i too like the look of mcd   ge looks good as well from this perspective

to start with i should mention that many tax preparation companies will give you any number of free consultations on tax issues they will only charge you if you use their services to file a tax form such as an amended return i know that h&r block has international tax specialists who are familiar with the issues facing f-1 students so they might be the right people to talk about your specific situation according to turbotax support you should prepare a completely new 1040nr then submit that with a ’s tax department says you can submit late so you should probably do that if you need to claim non resident status for tax purposes

monopolies do n't always charge more than a competitive market this is true but it 's still anti competitive to have a monopoly regardless if the consumer benefits from a lower price   i think it 's important to breed competition even in the rare cases where consumers might benefit from a lower price in the long run innovation would be stifled and consumers could be worse off   i just wanted to add that comment to the discussion i do n't think it applies to this scenario because amazon and whole foods make up a whopping 3 of the retail grocery market

charitable donations can be deducted from your income and in that way make your taxable income lower hence lower taxes that 's the meaning of tax deductible as to if i donate it then the money will be given right to the charity instead of spread out to many other places taxes are being used by the government based on its own decisions presumably made by elected officials thus representing the will of the voters charities use the money based on their defined goals giving money to a charity will ensure it is used for the specific goal the charity declared and that 's the way for you to funnel money to the goals of your preference choice for example you can donate money to your temple around the corner or the gay rights organization or anti gay for that matters your money will be spent on the goals of your choosing re advantages charitable donations are used by the rich folks to avoid paying taxes on their income because they 're deductible so someone might donate money to places they use themselves like the temple church for example or the school where the kids go or politician which will objectively choose someone 's business for a big government contract etc etc for ordinary people it 's a way to reduce the taxable income and divert the money to the specific goals of their choice for example donating $ 100 to red cross japan tsunami relief fund will reduce your taxable income by $ 100 and total taxes by $ 28 assuming you 're in the 28 bracket thus the $ 28 will go to the specific goal your choose instead of the general taxes

there are etf funds that only purchase preferred stock from banks i have one that pays a monthly dividend of a little under 6 per year that means that it pays just under 0.5 every month the purchase price of this stock just slowly goes up and up   you can do a whole lot better than 2 per year   the crux of the issue as i understand it is the lousy 2 interest she is getting my point is that you can do a lot better than 2   an etf is not a scam the price has stability and slow growth because it buys preferred stock from banks   yes she should invest my answer is yes because 2 roi   is a lousy return and she can do better   looking at the 200 day moving average the price goes from 15.25 in may of 2014 to in dec of 2015 that in price appreciation alone is a increase add on top of that a 0.5 increase per month and you get a stellar total return   the increase in the fed funds rate is a benefit to banks pgf invests in banks by buying their preferred stock this means that the share price of pgf will continue to increase and its ability to pay the nearly 6 per year dividend will also improve

to me this question is really about setting and meeting goals the process is the same whether it 's about exercising regularly or saving or whatever you need to have clear personally relevant reasons for doing something   write down exactly why you want to save it may seem trivial but if you ca n't visualize the prize it 's hard to stay motivated how much can you afford to save use something like mint.com to find out your real monthly expenses as opposed to what you think you 're spending also do n't get leave yourself some money for small luxuries and unexpected expenses so you do n't feel like a miser saving should be a joy not torture automate the saving process set up an automatic transfer to move the amount you figured out in step 2 to your savings account on the same date you get paid this is very important by saving early you ensure there will be enough money to save if you wait until the end of the month there will usually not be anything left do n't you dare touch your savings except in a real emergency if you must dip into your savings immediately create a plan to put it back as soon as possible also get into the habit of reading personal finance books blogs sites etc i recommend authors like robert kiyosaki and suze orman good luck

the obligation is contractual so you need to read the contract to answer your question however since you paid for the service provided i see no way they can force you buy any other service from them they can not file your tax returns without your explicit consent on a form dedicated to that dated and having the numbers matching the return filed not something you can sign before the actual return is ready worst case they can claim you owe them more money but since you paid for the services provided i ca n't see how they can have that stand in court as well bottom line even if the contract has such an obligation i can not see how it can be enforced as to the mistake they noted i would n't rely on h&r block advice in any matter very likely the person you were talking to was not even licensed to provide tax advice you 're lucky if the person has passed exams in california they 're legally required but i seriously doubt their clerks are eas or cpas the only designations other than a lawyer legally allowed to provide tax advice tax preparers included are only allowed to provide advice pertaining to the preparation of the tax return they 're currently engaged to prepare claiming income is sourced or not sourced in ny is borderline imho if they got it wrong and to me it sounds as they did you can sue them for damages if your situation is tricky and it is too late to get an appointment with a proper adviser file an extension form 4868 and deal with it after the april busy season

it really depends on the tasks and how things are going   well allocated work probably takes less than 40 hours a week most of the time but might take a lot more than that sometimes   it really depends   being in a really small company leaves little room for and then there is ambition   do you really want to dominate your industry   then there is the kind of work   truly creative work might be so intense that it tops out around 20 hours a week and everything above that is   that was what i meant by not fitting neatly into standard arrangements   it also has a lot to do what else there is in your life competing   it might be necessary to leave earlier than most to make time for afternoon activities or time with children   defining desirable intervals outside work may be the most important part of knowing what work hours make sense   ultimately it is necessary to understand that balancing work and life is complicated and may have no good answers   sometimes work may be life and other times it may compete vigorously with good living   simply saying anything over a standard 40 hour work week is too much might be a good place to draw the line or that might be a way of avoiding really thinking through where you want to be since that arrangement is only going to be idea for a subset of people   maybe for some 45 is the breaking point and for others 35 is right or maybe just it and leaving after a certain number of things are done is right   this emphasis on time drops away completely under results only work environment rowe arrangements but that leads directly to legal issues because we treat time as sacred no mater how much is spent at the desk or water cooler

tricky question   many car leasing companies like to quote payments by the week or twice a month to make the car sound cheaper to carry   if the lease or loan is calculated such that interest accrues monthly not in advance then any payments made prior to the date on which the interest is calculated will reduce the balance and therefore the interest however many loans and leases are calculated at the beginning for the whole life of the agreement   in that case splitting each payment in half does n't do anything to reduce the interest built in to the payments because the interest is calculated in advance

electric does make a difference when considering whether to lease or buy the make model is something to consider the state you live in also makes a difference if you are purchasing a small electric compliance car like the fiat leasing is almost always a better deal these cars are often only available in certain states california and oregon and the lease deals available are very enticing for example the fiat is often available at well under $ 100/mo in a three year lease with $ 0 down while purchasing it would cost far more $ 30k minus credits rebates = $ 20k even when considering the residual value if you want to own a tesla model s i recommend purchasing a used car the market is somewhat flooded with used teslas because some owners like to upgrade to the latest and greatest features and take a pretty big loss on their old tesla you can save a lot of money on a pre owned model s with relatively low miles and the battery packs have been holding up well if you have your heart set on a new model s i would treat it like any other vehicle and do the comparison of lease vs buy one thing to keep in mind that buying a model s before the end of 2016 will grandfather you into the free for life which makes the car more valuable in the future right now there is a $ 7500 federal tax credit when buying an electric vehicle if you lease the leasing company gets the credit not you the cost of the lease should indirectly reflect this credit however some states have additional incentives california has a $ 2500 rebate for example that you can receive even if you lease the vehicle to summarize a small compliance car often has very good reasons to lease an expensive luxury car like the tesla can be looked at like any other lease vs buy decision and buying a used model s may save the most money

the bank wo n't let you because differences in required account features business accounts have different features many of them legal features that are required by businesses for instances do you want to be able to deposit cheques that are written out to your business name you need a business account for that your business could be sold then it would n't be your business so it would n't make sense to put the business account under your personal name the bank account and the cash it holds is a business asset and should be owned by the business so when the business is sold the account goes with it this is especially the case for a corporation that has shareholders and not a sole proprietorship for a business you could also in theory assign other people as signing authorities on the business account e.g. your corporate treasurer and the individuals performing that role could change over time business accounts allow for this kind of use market segmentation the bank has consciously undertaken to segment their product offerings in order to maximize their profit market segmentation helps the bottom line even if there were zero legal reasons to have separate personal vs. business accounts banks would still make it their policy to sell different account types according to use because they can make more money that way consider an example in another industry the plain old telephone company also practices segmentation personal business do you want a telephone line for a business and listed as such in the phone book you need a business line do you want a phone line hooked up at a non residential address you need a business line here it 's clear it is less of a legal issue than with the bank account and it does n't matter that the technical features of the phone line may be identical for the basic product offerings within each segment the phone company has chosen to segment and price their product offerings this way q. why do companies choose to charge some kinds of customers more than others for essentially the same underlying service a. because they can

i will start with the assumption that you will never have any late payments and will fully pay off the loan this may be a big assumption but if you ca n't assume that then you would n't have asked the question in the first place the answer depends on your income you should calculate how much student loan interest you can deduct before and after the switch and adjust the interest rate accordingly to compensate for any difference

ditto just to get concrete i just checked one bank in india and they say they are paying 4 on savings accounts i do n't know what you 're getting or if 4 is typical in india but it 's at least an example so if the bank pays interest based on average daily balance and you left the money in the bank for a week you 'd get = so on rs 95,000 that would be rs 73 i live in the us where typical interest on a savings account today is about 1 so an equivalent amount of money i think that would be about $ 1,500 would get of 1 or 29 cents   do n't leave the lights turned on while you do the calculations you 'll spend more on the electricity than you make on the interest addendum this suddenly reminds me i read a news story a few years ago about a man who was expecting a tax refund check from the irs of a few hundred dollars and when the check arrived it was for several million well obviously it was a mistake but he came up with the clever idea deposit the check in an interest bearing account promptly contact the irs inform them of the mistake and ask how and where to go about returning the money hope that it takes at least a few days for them to figure everything out then keep the interest accumulated on the several million dollars for the time that he had the money and as he contacted them immediately about the error they ca n't say he was trying to hide anything it was a nice try but it did n't work they demanded he send them the interest as well as the principle

my answer is that when confronted with the obvious the most common human reaction is to seek reasons for it because things have to be right they have to have a reason we do n't like it when things suck   so when finding out that you are being ripped off every day of your life your reaction is there must be a logical reason that perfectly explain why this is after all the world is fair governments are working in our best interest and if they do it this way they must have a very good reason for it sorry but that not the case you have the facts you are just not looking at them economics as a subject is the proper management of resources and production now forget the fancy theories the elaborate nonsense about stocks and bonds and currencies and pay attention to the actual situation on our planet most people earn $ 2,000 per year clean water is not available for a very sizable percent of the world 's population admittedly 90 of the world 's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the most wealthy 10 a chinese engineer earns a fraction of what a similarly qualified engineer earns in the states most people even in rich countries have a negative net value they have mortgages that run for a third of their lifetimes credit card debts loans do the balance most people are broke does this strike you as the logical result of a fair and balanced economic system   does this look like a random happenstance   the dominant theory is it just happened it 's nobody 's fault and nobody designed it that way and to think otherwise is very bad because it makes you a conspiracy theorist and conspiracy theorists are nuts you are not nuts are you look at the facts already in your possession it did n't just happen   the system is rigged when a suit typing a few numbers in a computer can make more money in 5 minutes than an average joe can make in 100 lifetimes of honest productive work you do n't have a fair economic system you have a scam machine   when you look at a system as broken as the one we have you should n't be asking yourself what makes this system right what you should be asking yourself is more along the lines of why is it broken who benefits why did congress turn its monetary policy over to the federal reserve a group of unelected and unaccountable individuals with strong ties in the banking industry and does not even bother to conduct audits to know how your money is actually managed this brilliant movie money as debt points to a number of outrageous bugs in our economic system now you can dream up reasons why the system should be the way it is and why it is an acceptable system or you can look at the fact and realize that there is no justification for an economic system that perform as badly as it does   back to basics money is supposed to represent production it 's in every basic textbook on the subject of economics so what should money creation be based on debt no gold no randomly printed by the government when they feel like it no although this could actually be better than the 2 previous suggestions money is supposed to represent production index money on production and you have a sound system why is n't it done that way why do you think that is

the scenarios you describe are obviously easy to catch it is reasonably defined in tax law but more needs to be done to exert the spirit of the rules the problem is that when international businesses are cross charging   there is limited information the tax offices have to argue the toss for example a uk tax office can not audit the accounts of its us parent in order to decide whether a cross charge representing license fees and marketing costs is fair but these types of transaction are one of the primary mechanism for avoiding taxes these are inferred by the uk companies accounts but not in the open in the sense that they can be easily challenged with accurate information and that is why it happens people know about it but it is still not easy to stop

as someone who has worked for both an insurance carrier and an insurance agent the reason people buy insurance is two fold to spread risk out and to get the benefits when applicable of approaching risk as a group what you are really doing when you buy insurance is you are buying in to a large group of people who are sharing risk   you put money in that will help people when they take a loss and in exchange get a promise of having your losses covered   there is an administrative fee taken by the company that runs the group in order to cover their costs of doing business and their profits that they get for running the group well or losses they take if they run it poorly some insurances are for profit some are non profit all work on the principle of spreading risk around though and taking risk as a larger group so let 's take a closer look at each of the advantages you get from participating in insurance   the biggest and most obvious is the protection from catastrophic loss   yes you could self insure with a group size of one by saving your money and having no overhead other than your time and the time value of your money but that has a cost in itself and also does n't cover you against risk up front if you are n't already independently wealthy   a run of bad luck could wipe you out entirely since you do n't have a large group to spread the risk around   the same thing can still happen to insurance companies as well when the group as a whole takes major losses but it 's less likely to occur because there are more rare things that have to go wrong   you pay an administrative overhead for the group to be run for you but you have less exposure to your own risks in exchange for a small premium another significant but less visible advantage is the benefit of being part of a large group   insurance companies represent a large group of people and lots of business so they can get better rates on dealing with recovering from losses   they can negotiate for better health care rates or better repair rates or cheaper replacement parts   this can potentially save more than the administrative overhead and profit that they take off the top even when compared to self insuring there is an element of gambling to it but there are also very real financial benefits to having predictable costs   the value of that predictability and the lesser need for liquid assets is what makes insurance worth it for many people   the value of this group benefit does decrease a lot as the value of the insurance coverage the amount it pays out decreases   insurance for minor losses has a much smaller impact on liquidity and is much easier to self insure   cheaper items that have insurance also tend to be high risk items so the costs tend to be very high relative to the amount of protection   if you are financially able it may make more sense to self insure in these cases particularly if you tend to be more cautious   it may make sense for those who are more prone to accidents with their devices to buy insurance but this selection bias also drives the cost up further   generally the reason to buy insurance on something like a cellphone is because you expect you will break it   you are going to end up paying for an entire additional phone over time anyway and most such policies stop paying out after the first replacement anyway the reason why people buy the coverage anyway even when it really is n't in their best interest is due to two factors being risk averse as pointed out and also being generally bad at dealing with large numbers   on the risk averse side they think of how much they are spending on the item even if it is less compared to large items like cars or houses and do n't want to lose that   on the bad at dealing with large numbers side they do n't think about the overall cost of the coverage and do n't read the fine print as to what they are actually getting coverage for   this is the same reason that you always see prices one cent under the dollar    people often do n't really subconsciously get that they are paying more even if they would be able to eat the loss so they pay what feels like a small amount to offset a large risk   the risk of loss is a higher fear than the known small easy payment that keeps the risk away and the overall value proposition is n't even considered

you do not need to have high net value and yes you can invest in it typically fund companies require a minimum investment that could be 100 it could be a 1000 5000 should be enough for 99.9 of all funds for an initial investment what you need is an investment company that manages the account for you i can not name those for your country but they should be easy to find companies like and fidelity might serve your country you then open an account with the company of your choice transfer the money and tell them which fund it shall go in all this is possible online you can also go to see an agent in person and he will fill the forms for you and handle all the action but he might take a fee for it

for the requirement for risk free and hassle free account a cd or money market account through your local bank credit union or even large online bank will be fine these funds wo n't grow very fast over time but they are safe and insured these types of accounts are perfect for all the miscellaneous birthday holiday and religious event checks there is not a requirement that the money be in a ugma uniform gifts to minors act account putting it in a ugma account does make it hard for the parents to spend the irs does allow the child to have earnings from banks without the formality of a ugma the money should n't be moved between the parent 's and child 's account but it is possible for the parents to spend the child 's money if times are tight and the money is used for items that benefit the child if there is a reasonable assumption of college then the 529 plan makes a lot of sense the prepaid tuition options would be risky because they tend to be tied to a single state and who knows where they will be living in 10 to 15 years the 529 does focus the money to be used for educational expenses but it can be used for non educational expenses if you are willing to pay the taxes and penalties it can also be transferred to another child later or even other family members in my state the 529 plan does n't have to be used right after high school graduation it can be used up to 30 years after graduation so they can decide a few years later that they want to go back to school

more like   nobody can pay for it    just paying for someone to be available near a person 24 hours a day is very labor intensive     expensive even at minimum wage   so a worker has to earn enough both to pay their own living expenses but also the living expenses of their ailing mom and the living expenses of 2 3 aide workers    that 's crazy   and that 's not even counting in actual health care   we 're going to reach a breaking point with nursing homes etc soon    to a much greater extent you 'll see some combination of ailing parents who would otherwise need 24 hour care allowed to die by not having medical interventions moving back in with their kids and the kids sacrificing their career

treat negative experiences as contrasts with a similar but even worse past experience this contrast will make whatever you are pissed off about in the present seem less bad in comparison with that time your neighbor 's tree fell over and crushed your car

are you kidding subsidized loans is effectively free money of course they 're going to avail themselves   the real reason is that bernanke did n't want to be playing favorites which he was the level and quality of collateral required for these loans varied wildly with very little explanation   also 16 trillion is a lot of money to be given out as a subsidized loan even if the quality of the collateral was high and the duration was short which is not true for at least a trillion of that money
