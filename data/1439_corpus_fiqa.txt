put one of your monthly bills on it   utility bill netflix monthly donation to charity etc i have several automatic recurring monthly charges on my credit card if you do n't have any current monthly bills that you want to switch contact the red cross or a charity of your choice they would be very happy to charge your credit card once a month alternatively it might be okay to let it close

credit cards are almost never closed for inactivity i have had dozens of cards for years on end and only one was ever closed on me for inactivity i would bet a single 1 $ transaction per calendar year would keep all your cards open   as such you could forget automating the process and just spend 20 minutes a year making manual 1 $ payments e.g. to your isp utility company google play etc   alternatively many charities will let you set up an automatic monthly donation for any amount e.g. 1 $ to wikipedia or perhaps you could treat yourself to an mp3 once a month arguably a charitable donation in the age of file sharing side note i use both of these strategies to get the 12 debit card transactions per month required by my checking account

i agree with the rest of the answers you 're probably better off just using it for some predictable flat rate recurring monthly service like netflix or making a charitable donation if you 're into that sort of thing but since that was n't what you asked i 'll try to provide an answer if you do n't mind throwing away money send money to yourself using paypal here 's how   set up a paypal business account and use your personal paypal account to send funds to it by setting up a paypal subscription paypal says you can have one consumer account and one business account a paypal payments standard business account has no monthly fee only transaction fees according to paypal in order to set up a repeating payment you would need to create a subscription or recurring payments button from the merchant services tab in the business account you would then click the link button to set up the subscription from your personal paypal account to make it send money to your business account on an automatic schedule you can then at your own leisure send the money back to your personal account without paying a second transaction fee then finally send it back to your bank account or if your bank account is not yet tied to your personal account you can tie it to the business account instead and deposit the funds into your bank account unfortunately this step ca n't be automated again to reiterate you 're much better off just using it for something recurring

it 's possible   our healthcare systems is a serious mess but universal healthcare could also make things worse   the problem is that our healthcare system is by a of regulations neither guarantee care to the most vulnerable nor allow the market mechanisms to work   the mises institute has a few good pieces on this here 's blog how government regulations made healthcare so expensive but to put it very simply the issue is we are letting bureaucrats run our healthcare instead of leaving medical choices to physicians     i 'd wager that nz physicians have greater freedom to practice than us ones but that 's only a guess   that 's the key though   medical choices need to be left up to doctors and patients whether we adopt a market oriented system or a universal care scheme   if this is n't done quality of care will be poor and costs direct or indirect will be high   at the end of the day we could screw up either approach     i will say that i 've read rand paul 's imo media doc not the current republican plan and it seems like a good example of practical market reforms

indian pf is a social security scheme and as per the us india dtaa article 20 is not taxable by the us the exact text says as under   this clearly states that any social security benefit paid by any of the two contracting states to a resident of the other contracting state is taxable only in the first mentioned state in other words us can not tax indian social security benefits and vice versa therefore you are liable for taxes only in india even though you have to declare to the us that you were given the social security pf benefit by india

the lot size is 100 troy ounce see the contract specification at the same site so with the current price of around $ one lot would cost you around there may be other sites that offer smaller lots you would need to check with your broker if the price moves up by $ 500 you gain $ 50,000 for a lot the margin required changes from time to time   currently it 's $ with a maintenance of $ so a drop of $ per oz of gold will cause a margin call you make or lose 100 times the per oz movement as there are 100 oz in the contract you cited there 's also a broker fee analogous to the commission on a stock trade   the other option would be to buy a fund that invests in gold this will be more easier to buy and the lot sizes will be much less i hope you jumped into this great opportunity at the time experts said gold would have a straight run to $ 5000

i would say yes to your question   cd 's purchased from a bank on your behalf by your broker will be fdic insured and safe   however be aware that no one is examining the broker except you to ensure that each cd is actually purchased from an fdic insured bank   do n't trust them blindly see risks mentioned by the fdic on the subject remember the broker should not originate the cd so the broker 's lack of fdic protection is irrelevant   the job of a broker is to buy things on your behalf   if your broker does that appropriately and sticks with fdic insured cd 's you will be insured given the risks and gotchas mentioned in the link buying directly from a bank instead of through your broker still sounds like good advice to me but you can make your own decision based on your level of trust and aversion to inconvenience

in steady state the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside   the amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures and the overall insulation quality   thus a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air    in practice people open the door take cold food out put warm food in and the unit may also make ice dispense cold water and itself   aside from tweaking those uses e.g. minimizing time with the door open a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space   this helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass so it cools down rapidly   when you need the space you can remove the cartons and set them aside similarly water filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator particularly if the electric utilities are erratic   however they increase the cost of when cooling the water in the first place and when you eventually dump out the water the expense of cooling it goes down the drain

i 'd like to take a moment to point out   i can not find a bank that charges customers with a checking account fees for withdrawing from an atm owned by that same bank it is a cornerstone of most banks now to encourage online and atm banking you should definitely research the validity of the claim that you 're associate can not withdraw from their own account through their own bank 's atm without fees a second scenario i can think of is that this person uses a bank that does not operate in your region   then they can not find an atm owned by their bank   if this is the case they should simply go to the bank the check is drawn on and cash it there   so far i only know of chase bank charging non chase customers to cash a check drawn on a chase account this is a crap policy that makes me hate that bank disclaimer i am not familiar with all banks but a quick google search of banks that operate in your region should reveal which ones if any charge their customers for use of their atms   you may or may not find the check cashing charge policy without attempting to cash the check

i 'm not sure what point you think i was making it looks like you think i 'm supporting the idea that qe causes inflation which it does n't at least not when it is being used as it has been what it does seem to have done is depress interest rates and create a speculative market that does n't match up with economic reality it has also created a ridiculous profit loop for investment banks selling bonds to the fed   you ca n't talk about qe without mentioning that banks are now incentivized to hold onto reserves because they can collect interest so the banks screwed up were heavily subsidized under the pretense of it being best for the taxpayer and were then rewarded for sitting on all of that money    if i support any viewpoint it is this the government agreed to give the banks a thin veneer of solvency by granting them enormous sums in a short period obviously if that much currency went straight into the market it would be a disaster so it put a mechanism in place to reward them for holding onto it all qe did was massively increase the debt burden of the government which will be passed on to taxpayers in the form of taxes fines fewer benefits worsening infrastructure and more restrictions qe may have not caused inflation but it certainly did n't help the vast majority of americans who will simply see their standard of living decline at a quicker pace i 'm sure this will get blamed on immigrants or something instead of the reality that our government is rewarding banks for not lending to individuals why would they an individual might not pay them back but the government always will by simply extracting more out of those very individuals

this is more clearly defined in the eitc for purposes of the earned income tax credit then no it is not earned income   see publication page 18 specifically scholarship or fellowship grants not reported on a form a scholarship or fellowship grant that was n't reported to you on a form w-2 is n't considered earned income for the earned income credit further form describes unearned income and explicitly includes scholarships again not on for form unearned income includes all taxable    income other than earned income as defined later    unearned income includes taxable interest ordinary    dividends capital gains including capital gain    distributions rents royalties etc it also includes taxable    social security benefits pension and annuity income    taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on    form w-2 unemployment compensation alimony and    income other than earned income received as the    beneficiary of a trust so unless it was reported on a w-2 i.e. it 's for some sort of employment it 's not considered earned income   h t for that link the definition on the instructions of form is not particularly different though it 's more general earned income includes wages tips and other amounts received for personal services performed   scholarships do n't seem to fit any more into that so i would say they do not

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

wikipedia has a good summary historically branch banking in the united states especially interstate branch banking was viewed by regulatory authorities and this was codified with the enactment of the act of 1927 which specifically prohibited interstate banking over the next few decades some banks attempted to circumvent 's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so called independent banks in multiple states to address this the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out of state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act or by neighboring states some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws for example illinois outlawed branches other than the main office until 1967 and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993

another thing people forget is that you can only under perform the average aka the index if you try for most things in life the harder you try the better you do in investing that is not true you can lock in average by simply buying the index fund if you try but you do n't work as hard as everybody else who is trying or if you are not as smart as everybody else who is trying then you will be below average if you try and you do better research you are intelligent and most importantly more disciplined you can beat the average that is an awful lot of work to be a few percent above average it 's like a 100 man marathon race where you can choose to come in place if you do n't run it definitely beats running 26 miles only to come in place also note the people who know they are not very skilled will choose to be non participants if you are in the top 30 percentile in skill you 'll get killed if 80 of the participants choose to sit out and you are competing with the top 20 it becomes one of these funny game theory experiments where even if you know what your rank is do you choose to sit out or not or perhaps you will choose to participate when the shoe shine boy is giving out stock advice and take the opposite side of the bet   for most people it does n't make sense to try it makes the most sense to lock in the average by putting money into index funds stocks and bonds over time it certainly beats doing several hours of work a week and then getting below average it only makes sense to try to beat the average if you are really excited about stocks it is your job or it is your primary hobby and you have enough capital where getting that extra + 3 return over the average is significant otherwise just work more on your day job and you 'll make more money through wages i really can not stress the last point enough i know some people who are very smart and they do a lot of research on the market and they get pretty good percentage returns so you have to be cheap as hell or rich as hell before it makes sense to invest your own money otherwise you 'll spend 20 30 hours a week researching to make a few thousand dollars more than the index over a year which consequently gets spent on drinking or something so it never compounds not a wise way to spend your time

color me skeptical    your link is a survey of studies about power the cookie study is cited in the survey but the cookie study itself was not published one of the authors of the survey also did the cookie study so it kinda looks like the guy did a study that for some reason he was not able to publish but in a reference to it somewhere else anyway   also odd is that despite the text of the survey and lewis 's speech the chart on the second to last page of your link indicates that only high power women ate more cookies while high power men actually ate slightly fewer maybe the chart is or i am it but maybe the text is wrong    i know nothing about this field so it 's quite likely that i 'm missing something the claims made seem reasonable but i ca n't find anything verifying that there was a properly run study with the results that lewis described

do n't confuse a home warranty with homeowner 's insurance   insurance will cover disasters   warranty will cover lesser repairs that insurance does n't cover you can warranty your own home with a liquidity fund   stash 1 3 months of salary in a savings account that you can tap out at any time   water heater blows   just call a plumber   leaking roof   call a roofer   no need to argue with a warranty company for reimbursement chances are you will spend less on repairs than the cost of the warranty itself   if you 're handy it 'll be even cheaper

assuming us irs if you filed on time and paid what you believed was the correct amount they might be kind and let it go but do n't assume they will if you ca n't file on time you are supposed to file estimated taxes before the deadline and to make that payment large enough to cover what you are likely to owe them if there is excess you get it back when you file the actual forms if there is a shortfall you may be charged fees essentially interest on the money you still owe them calculated from the submission due date if you fail to file anything before the due date then the fees interest surcharge is calculated on the entire amount still due effectively the same as if you had filled an estimated return claiming you owed nothing note that since the penalty scales with the amount still due large errors do cost you more than small ones and before anyone asks no the irs does n't pay interest if you submit the forms early and they owe you money i 've sometimes wondered whether they 're missing a bet there and if it would be worth rewarding people to file earlier in order to spread out the work a bit better but until someone sells them on that idea

cart 's answer describes well one aspects of puts protective puts which means using puts as insurance against a decline in the price of shares that you own   that 's a popular use of puts   but i think the wording of your question is for another strategy writing puts consider cart 's strategy refers to the buyer of a put   but on the transaction 's other side is a seller of the put and ultimately somebody created or wrote that put contract in the first place   that first seller of the put that is the seller that is n't just selling one they themselves bought is the put writer when you write a put you are taking on the obligation to buy the other side 's stock at the put exercise price if the stock price falls below that exercise price by the expiry date   for taking on the obligation you receive a premium like how an insurance company charges a premium to insure against a loss example   imagine abc co. stock is trading at $ 25.00   you write a put contract agreeing to buy 100 shares of abc at $ 20.00 per share the exercise price by a given expiration date   say you receive $ premium from the put buyer   you now have the obligation to purchase the shares from the put buyer in the event they are below $ 20.00 per share when the option expires or technically any time before then if the buyer chooses to exercise the option early assuming no early assignment one of two things will happen at the option expiration date abc trades at or above $ 20.00 per share in this case the put option will expire worthless in the hands of the put buyer   you will have pocketed the $ 200 and be from your obligation   this case where abc trades above the exercise price is the maximum profit potential abc trades below $ 20.00 per share   in this case the put option will be assigned and you 'll need to fork over $ 2000 to the put buyer in exchange for his 100 abc shares   if those shares are worth less than $ in the market then you 've suffered a loss to the extent they are below that price times 100 because remember you pocketed $ 200 premium in the first place   if the shares are between $ to $ 20.00 you 're still profitable but not to the full extent of the premium received you can see that by having written a put it 's possible to acquire abc stock at a price lower than the market price because you received some premium in the process of writing your put   if you do n't succeed in acquiring shares on your first write because the shares did n't get below the exercise price you can continue to write puts and collect premium until you do get assigned i have read the book money for nothing and your stocks for free by canadian author derek foster   despite the flashy title the book essentially describes derek 's strategy for writing puts against dividend paying value stocks he would love to own   derek picks quality companies that pay a dividend and uses put writing to get in at lower than market prices   four pillars reviewed the book and interviewed derek foster money for nothing book review and interview with derek foster writing puts entails risk   if the stock price drops to zero then you 'll end up paying the put exercise price to acquire worthless shares   so your down side can easily be multiples of the premium collected   do n't do this until and unless you understand exactly how this works   it 's advanced note also that your broker is n't likely to permit you to write puts without having sufficient cash or margin in your account to cover the case where you are forced to buy the stock   you 're better off having cash to secure your put buys otherwise you may be forced into leverage borrowing when assigned   additional resources the montreal exchange options guide pdf that cart already linked to is an excellent free resource for learning about options   refer to page 39 writing secured put options for the strategy above other major options exchanges and organizations also provide high quality free learning material

your actual question has nothing to do with the technical issue of linking a paypal account to a bank account it is all about the accounting of the money that is what you claim as income and what you can prove to the taxman yes you will need to separate the money linking to a business account is probably the way to go from there it is about how you keep track of the money and account for it   how you do the accounting is a different question so no it does not automatically become business income just because it goes into a business bank account you still have to keep track of said income and claim it somewhere on some tax the point of the separate business account is to avoid the commingling of the the money which may lead to you losing the liability protection of an incorporation the bank does n't file your taxes for you

gt our corporations pay some of the lowest taxes in the world with some of the larger ones actually paying none   no they do n't the top marginal rate for income taxes is 38 meanwhile in the republic of ireland rates vary from 12.5 25 depending on the exact source of the income so no our corporations do not pay the lowest taxes in the world as far as them paying none that stems from one of two things one corporations that pay out all their money in salaries and therefore have no retained earnings hence all their money is taxed at the individual level and workers get at a full 35 and two corporations that create a price transfer agreement with a foreign corporation so that income is shifted to a low tax region where they end up paying nothing to uncle sam that money will still be taxed if they ever try to bring it home and distribute it but as long as it stays overseas then no one can touch it because technically it has n't been earned as income yet that 's how companies avoid greedy bastards trying to take their money because contrary to your opinion you 're not actually entitled to any of their money or anyone else 's money either it 's not your money or our money its their money and they have an effective method to make sure it stays that way   gt btw if wanting decent opportunity to take care of me and mine is greed then yes i 'm greedy    you can already do that it 's called getting a fucking job and living within your means you do n't deserve anything in life you have to earn it no one is obligated to just give you things just because you want them ultimately this whole lets sock it to the rich attitude does n't actually take any money out of their pockets the only people harmed are workers who ca n't take advantage of the methods they use to shift income overseas in short you 're not simply wrong you 're criminally ignorant

well it is a negative point of view but nobody in the history of money has ever loaned money because they like you   i suppose you could paint it as an honest point of view all money lending is for profit   if you have a high score you are very likely to repay your loan because you are lower risk   we always hear lower risk but the risk is that they wo n't make money off of you i think that just like we buy previously owned vehicles cars instead of used cars and we banks call them service fees instead of junk fees our credit score discusses our credit worthiness instead of profitability but none of that means you ca n't benefit from it   it is n't a fear tactic it is a way to judge each other   you probably pay interest and fees to keep it high but that is price of lending i think the questioner has a negative view of credit which i suppose is fine and is their right i will defend their right to an opinion but the way we do and judge credit is neither evil or benevolent i could certainly agree that more transparency would be good but only for honest folks   if the credit bureaus made it public how they judged us there would be a new industry for people who want to game the system update since it always will cost to use credit and using credit is the only way to prove your a low credit risk it will therefore always cost money to raise your credit score however the return on investment is in this question   a person with no credit was able to get a loan but at serious out of pocket cost   later after establishing credit at a price of real money he was able to secure a nearly identical loan for considerably less cost in terms of interest paid because he had proven himself worthy   when i say proven i mean paid interest there is nothing wrong with questioning the system change only occurs when people question the status quo   and for sure our current system is not perfect but like many employed systems while it is terrible but there is nothing better

the simple answer is that you are correct you should not purchase a house until you are financially stable enough to do so a house is an asset that you must maintain and it can be expensive to do so   over the long term you will generally save money by purchasing however in any given year you may spend much more money than a similar rental situation even if the rent is higher than your mortgage payment if you are financially stable with good cash savings or investments plus a 20 down payment then anytime is a good time to buy if that is part of your financial plan as of now in 2016 is is safe to assume that mortgage rates    would should not get back to 10    does this mean that one should always buy a house only when mortgage    rates are low is it worth the wait if the rates are high right now the mortgage rates are not the primary driver for your purchase decision that might be like saying you should buy everything on sale at target because it 's on sale do n't speculate on future rates also keep in mind that back when rates were high banks were also giving much better savings cd rates that is all connected   is refinancing an option on the table if i made a deal at a bad time    when rates are high you need to make sure you get a loan that allows it always do a break even analysis looking at the money up front you spend to refi vs the savings per year you will get this should give you how many years until the refi pays for itself if you do n't plan on being in the house that long do n't do it how can people afford 10 mortgage buying a house they can afford taking into consideration the entire it should be a reasonable amount of your monthly income generally 25 or less note that this is much less than you will be approved for by most lenders   do n't let good rates suck you into a deal you will regret make sure you have the margin to purchase and maintain a home consider where you want to be living in 5 years do n't leave so little financial breathing room that any bump will place you at risk of foreclosure   that said home ownership is great i highly recommend it

your question asks us to explain why a false statement is true   from the point of view of an investor a high price to earnings ratio is not necessarily desirable from the point of view of an investor a desirable stock is one that is likely to provide future dividends or price increases that more than compensates for the risk of the stock   this information can not be inferred from the p e ratio so what does the p e ratio tell us the p e ratio measures a stock 's current price i.e. the market 's belief about its future earnings divided by its recent past earnings   a high ratio means the market thinks earnings in the future will be higher than they are now and have therefore bid the price up   these can thought of as expensive stocks and are often called growth stocks because their price is driven by the market 's belief in future growth some individual high p e stocks do live up to or exceed the market 's expectation but there 's no evidence that this happens enough that they are more desirable as a group than low p e stocks if anything the empirical evidence goes the other way

i worked for a plumbing heating business in a management position for the past 3 years and i learned a few things   you need a web presence stat yellow page ads while effective at reaching older clients are expensive and effective web marketing can be created at a fraction of the cost social media is an amazing tool use it   flat rate pricing quote your prices before you get the work and get a signature before you start make sure it is very very clear that you expect to be paid on completion   be known for cleanliness wealthy clients will spread your name around if you take the time and care to respect their property carpet runners boot covers and cleaning supplies will pay off   pick a company name and get a professional graphic designer to make your logo plaster it on all sides of your vehicle and you now have a mobile billboard   find something to specialize in for example boiler repair is a dying art if you can be the boiler guy you will have lots of yearly maintenance work speaking of which offer yearly maintenance contracts as a way to get back into the house and develop a business relationship   get some sales training you can be and effective salesman and still be honest it is just a matter of understanding the customer might be something worth looking into but the membership fee is not cheap   setup some sort of inventory tracking system now have it in place so when he wants to grow it will be easy    the company i worked for while not doing all of the things i mentioned here still managed to do 7 million a year in revenue pm me if you want to know anything else

  so your question is how confident are people that fb stock will close above a certain price at a certain time   a call option contract allows you to buy shares in the future at a certain price   fb calls are available for march of 2013   the number in the strike column is the price you can buy fb stock at on the given date let 's take the strike   this allows you to buy fb shares at $ 33 each next march   if at that time it turns out they 're worth $ 50 each you can buy them at $ 33 then immediately sell them on the open market for $ 50 making money   the person selling you the option knows that there 's a chance the price will be above $ 33 in march so he 's going to charge you a few bucks to cover that possibility   in this case he 's charging you $ as of me writing this   so you can have the option to buy fb shares at $ 33 each for $   this means the guy selling you the option is reasonably confident that in march fb stock will be at or under $ otherwise he 'd lose money when you exercised the option     therefore $ is the option market 's best guess as to the highest fb stock will be going for in march

the study of technical analysis is generally used sometimes successfully to time the markets there are many aspects to technical analysis but the simplest form is to look for and in the charts generally higher highs and higher lows is considered an uptrend   and lower lows and lower highs is considered a downtrend   a trend follower would go with the trend for example see a dip to the trend line and buy on the rebound whilst a bottom fisher would wait until a break in the downtrend line and buy after confirmation of a higher high as this could be the start of a new uptrend there are many more strategies dealing with the study of technical analysis and if you are interested you would need to find and learn about ones that suit your investment styles and your appetite for risk

as chris pointed out if your expenses are covered by the income exactly as you have said to assume then you are basically starting with a $ 40 k asset your starting equity and ending with a $ 200 k asset a paid for home at the same value since you have said to ignore any appreciation so to determine what you have earned on the $ 40 k you leveraged 5x would n't it be a matter of computing a cagr that gets you from $ 40 k to $ 200 k in 30 years the result would be a nominal return not a real return so if i set up the problem correctly it should be $ 40,000 1 + = $ 200,000 then solve for return it works out to be about or so

i do n't think this can be explained in too simple a manner but i 'll try to keep it simple organized and concise we need to start with a basic understanding of inflation inflation is the devaluing of currency in this context over time it is used to explain that a $ 1 today is worth more than a $ 1 tomorrow inflation is explained by straight forward supply = demand economics the value of currency is set at the point where supply m1 in currency speak = demand actual spending increasing the supply of currency without increasing the demand will create a surplus of currency and in turn weaken the currency as there is more than is needed inflation now that we understand what inflation is we can understand how it is created the us central bank has set a target of around 2 for inflation annually meaning they aim to introduce 2 of m1 into the economy per year this is where the answer gets complicated m1 currency has a far reaching effect on secondary m2 + credit currency that can increase or decrease inflation just as much as m1 can for example if you were given $ 100 m1 in new money from the fed you would then deposit that $ 100 in the bank the bank would then store 10 the reserve ratio in the fed and lend out $ 90 m2 to me on via a personal loan i would then take that loan and buy a new car the car dealer will deposit the $ 90 from my car loan into the bank who would then deposit 10 with the fed and his bank would lend out $ 81 and the cycle will repeat any change to the amount of liquid currency be it m1 or m2 + can cause inflation to increase or decrease so if a nation decides to reduce its us dollar reserves that can inject new currency into the market although the currency has already been printed it was n't in the market the currency markets aim to profit on currency imbalances and in reality momentary inflation deflation between currencies

the first question i have to ask is why would your friend even be considering something so ridiculous   there are so many variations of the banking scam running around and yet people ca n't seem to see them for what they are scams    the old saying there 's no such thing as a free lunch really comes into play here   why would anyone send you your friend $ just because they like you   if you ca n't come up with a rational answer to that question then you know what you or your friend should do walk away from any further contact with this person and never look back why   well the simple answer is let 's assume they do send you $ by some means   if you think there are n't strings attached then all hope is lost   this is a confidence scam where the scammer wins your trust by doing something nobody would ever do if they were trying to defraud you   as a result you feel like you can trust them and that 's when the games really begin    ask yourself this how long do you think it will be even assuming the money is sent before they 'll talk you into revealing little clues about yourself that allow them to develop a good picture of you   could they be setting you up for some kind of identity theft scheme or some other financial scam   whatever it is you 'd better believe the returns for them far outweigh the $ they 're allegedly going to send so in a sense it 's an investment for them in whatever they have planned for you down the road please do n't take the warnings you get about this lightly   scams like this work because they always find a sucker   the fact that you 're asking the question in the first place means you your friend are giving serious thought to what was proposed and that 's nothing short of disaster if you do it    leave it be take the lesson for what it 's worth before it costs you one red cent and move on i hope this helps good luck

did a great job explaining your options so i wo n't rehash any of that i know you said that you do n't want to save for retirement yet but i 'm going to risk answering that you should anyway specifically i think you should consider a roth ira when it comes to tax advantaged retirement accounts once the contribution period for a tax year ends there 's no way to make up for it for example in 2015 you may contribute up to $ 5,500 to your ira you can make those contributions up until tax day of the following year april 15th 2016 after that you can not contribute money towards 2015 again   so each year that goes by you 're losing out on some potential to contribute as for why i think a roth ira specifically could work well for you i 'm advocating this because i think it 's a good balance you put away some money in a retirement account now when it will have the most impact on your future retirement assets taking advantage of a time you will never have again at a low cost custodian like vanguard you can open an ira with as little as $ 1,000 to start and choose from excellent fund options that meet your risk requirements if you end up deciding that you really want that money for a car or a house or beer money you can withdraw any of the contributions without fear of penalty or additional tax but if you decide you do n't really need to take that money back out you 've contributed to your retirement for a tax year you likely would n't have   otherwise and would n't be able to make up for later when you have more than enough to max out an ira each year i also want to stress that you should have a liquid emergency fund in a savings or checking account to deal with unexpected emergencies before funding something like this but after that if you have no specific goal for your savings and you do n't know for sure you 'll actually need to spend it in the near future funding a roth ira is worth considering in my opinion

the most common use of non deductible traditional ira contributions these days as joetaxpayer mentioned is as an intermediate step in a backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira and then immediately convert it to a roth ira which if you had no previous pre tax money in traditional or other iras is a tax free process that achieves the same result as a regular roth ira contribution except that there are no income limits this is something you should consider since you are unable to directly contribute to a roth ira due to income limits also i want to note that your comparison is only true assuming you are holding tax efficient assets ones where you get taxed once at the end when you take it out if you are holding tax inefficient assets like an interest bearing cd or bond or a stock that regularly produces dividends in a taxable account you would be taxed many times on that earnings and that would be much worse than with the non deductible traditional ira where you would only be taxed once at the end when you take it out

this is a misconception one of the explanations is that if you buy at the ask price and want    to sell it right away you can only sell at the bid price this is incorrect there are no two separate bid and ask prices the price you buy your bid is the same price someone else sells their sell the same goes when you sell the price you sell at is the price someone else buys there 's no spread with stocks emphasized it on purpose because many people especially those who gamble on stock exchange without knowing what they 're doing do n't understand how the stock market works on the stock exchange the transaction price is the match between the bid price and the ask price thus on any given transaction bid always equals ask there 's no spread there is spread with commodities if you buy it directly especially contracts mutual funds and other kinds of transactions that go through a third party the difference spread is that third party 's fee for assuming part of the risk in the transaction and is indeed added to your cost indirectly in the way you described these transactions do n't go directly between a seller and a buyer for example there 's no buyer when you redeem some of your mutual fund the fund pays you money so the fund assumes certain risk which is why there 's a spread in the prices to invest and to redeem similarly with commodities when you buy a gold bar you buy it from a dealer who needs to keep a stock thus the dealer will not buy from you at the same price there 's a premium on sale and a discount on buy which is a spread to compensate the dealer for the risk of keeping a stock

wyoming is a good state for this it is inexpensive and annual compliance is minimal although delaware has the best advertising campaign so people know about it the reality is   that there are over 50 states jurisdictions in the united states with their own competitive incorporation laws to attract investment as well as their own legislative bodies that change those laws so you just have to read the laws to find a state that is favorable for you what i mean is that whatever delaware does to get in the news about its easy business laws has been and done even better by other states by this point in time and regarding delaware 's court all other states in the union can also lean on delaware case law so this perk is not unique to delaware wyoming is cheaper than delaware for nominal presence in the united states requires less information then delaware and is also tax free a registered agent can get you set up and you can find one to help you with the address dilemma this should only cost $ 99 $ 200 over the state fees an llc does not need to have an address in the united states but many registered agents will let you use their address just ask many kinds of businesses still require a bank account for domestic and global trade many do n't require any financial intermediary any more to receive payments but if you do need this then opening a bank account in the united states will be more difficult again the registered agent or lawyer can get a tax identification number for you from the irs and this will be necessary to open a us bank account   but it is more likely that you will need an employee or nominee director in the united states to go in person to a bank and open an account this person needs to be mentioned in the operating agreement or other official form on the incorporation documents they will simply walk into a bank with your articles of incorporation and operating agreement showing that they are authorized to act on behalf of the entity and open a bank account they then resign and this is a private document between the llc and the employee but you will be able to receive and accept payments and access the global financial system now a lot of multinational entities set up subsidiaries in a number of countries this way

here 's an example that i 'm trying to figure out   etf firm has an agreement with gs for blocks of ibm they have agreed on daily vwap + 1 for execution price   further there is a commission schedule for 5 mils with gs   come month end etf firm has to do a monthly rebalance as such must buy 100,000 shares at ibm which goes for about $ 100   the commission for the trade is 100,000 5 mils = $ 500 in commission for that trade i assume all of this is covered in the expense ratio such that if vwap for the day was 100 then each share got executed to the etf at 101 1 + 5 mils per share = for a resultant cost basis   the etf then turns around and takes out let 's say 1 as the expense ratio $ per share   i think everything so far is pretty straight forward let me know if i missed something to this point   now this is what i 'm trying to get my head around etf firm has a revenue sharing agreement as well as other relations with gs one of which is 50 back on commissions as soft dollars on top of that gs has a program where if you do a set amount of vwap + trades you are eligible for their corporate well being programs and other sponsorship of etf 's interests including helping to pay for marketing rent computers etc    does that happen do these disclosures exist somewhere

in finance short selling also known as shorting or going short is the practice of selling assets usually securities that have been borrowed from a third party usually a broker with the intention of buying identical assets back at a later date to return to the lender remember your broker has to borrow it from somewhere other clients or if they hold those specific stocks themselves so if it is n't possible for them to lend you those stocks they would n't high p e stocks would find more sellers than buyers and if the broker has to deliver them it would be a nightmare for him to deliver all those stocks which he had lent back to whom he had borrowed from as well as to people who had gone when you went and if every body is selling there is going to be a dearth of stocks to be borrowed from as everybody around is selling instead of buying

how does one buy this quantity of tips do you simply buy directly from the us treasury you will might have to go through a financial institution like a broker or a bank edit you can also buy bonds directly with treasurydirect is it cheaper to buy a fund that invests in tips it might be cheaper depending on the fund   itself but you ca n't know for sure the price that the fund will be worth at you payout date since bonds can go up in value and are likely to with rates this low is there a way to measure potential downside statistically speaking yes you can look at the variation in price interest of the bonds in the last years to see how they usually move then compute the price range where they are likely to be that can be wide for volatile securities but there is no guarantee that there wo n't be some black swan event that will make the price shoot up down in another word it 's speculation can i mitigate downside risk by choosing different tips maturity there are quantitative strategies to do that like finding that some products that are negatively correlated such that a loss in one is be hedged by a gain in another however those correlation are likely to be just statistics and for every product that you buy you are likely to have to pay some fees for your bank broker which can be more devastating than the inflation itself is there some other strategy i should be considering to protect my cash against inflation or maybe a mixed strategy as i wrote above trying to use complex financial products can incurs loss and will have fees both for buying and selling is it really necessary to hedge from a 2 inflation by taking such risk personally i do n't think so if i were you i would just be buying bonds maturing for your payout date that would negate the reselling risk and reduce the fees

modern portfolio theory dramatically the risk of the recommended assets   this is because so few underlying assets are in the recommended part of the curve   as investors identify such assets large amounts of money are invested in them   this temporarily reduces measured risk and temporarily increases measured return   sooner or later the trade becomes crowded   eventually large amounts of money try to exit the trade into cash or the next discovered asset   and so the measurable risk suddenly rises and the measured return drops in other words modern portfolio theory causes bubbles and causes those bubbles to pop some other strategies to consider

okay let me elaborate the statement from uganda is perfectly sound because while they to improve in certain areas that spain has at this point an advantage they are not spanish qualities one can not define development indicators as spanish qualities you might as well bring up the football scores uganda has a unique cultural and identity and can want to improve their quality of life and industrial potential without wanting to be in the slightest bit like spain   this is also discussing specific economic performance in recent years uganda is in the middle of a boom so if you take that to logical conclusion the statement can be said to have additional meaning spain 's principal problem was over of sovereign debt uganda perhaps wants to avoid giving off the impression that they are at all like spain given that there may already be rumors of similar scenarios in uganda 's future economy their exchange went up 5 in one day yesterday 10x higher than any of their neighbors in east and south africa who knows personally i think it was just a fucking joke and he put in a good counter shot at what was a needless international stab at a country that 's picking itself up by it 's bootstraps slowly but surely

first we need to be clear about what the allowances on your w-4 mean the more allowances you claim the lower tax liability it is assumed that you have and they will take less tax out of your check so claiming 2 allowances will result in a bigger paycheck and less tax withholding than claiming 0 allowances would   if you claim 0 allowances you are in no danger of having too little tax withheld instead that would result in the maximum tax withheld so 0 allowances is certainly an option if you want to play it safe   this being your first year with these jobs it 's hard to know what to claim on your w-4 when you do your taxes next year you can see if the withholding was too much or just right if your refund is too big you can increase your allowances for next year   that having been said i do n't like getting big refunds i 'd rather have a bigger paycheck all year if i were you i 'd probably claim 1 or 2 allowances at the new job and adjust it next year if needed at your income level you are n't really in any danger of getting in trouble for having too little withheld   good luck with the new job game testing has always seemed like a dream job to me

when one says that corporations are people in a legal sense they are saying that they have the ability to enter into binding legal agreements in a manner similar to people this allows corporations to do things like own a building or a car or enter into a contract this is so that an individual does not have to do so this keeps individuals from being liable for the activities of the corporation it also keeps the individual from running off the the corporation 's car or selling the corporation 's building   if they are using it in any sense other than the legal sense it 's either hyperbole ignorance or pandering   now if you set yourself up as inc then you would very well be able to get all the same tax deductions and benefits as a corporation but you would also be liable for everything that a corporation is liable for namely a higher standard of reporting and different accounting methods

as the other answers indicate if you look only at the clear mathematical formulas regarding your debts and their interest rates then you 'll see that it 's better less expensive to pay off your student debt first   however you must also take into account the value of your car as it is an asset the older your car gets the less it 's worth the more your car gets used and worn out the less it 's worth cars depreciate at about 15 per year on average however you 're continuing to pay the same amount of money to keep a valuable asset now you also have to include the fact that you may be required to carry full coverage car insurance versus liability insurance this can represent an increase in spending if you 'd prefer to have liability only with insurance in the picture you should also be thinking about the possibility that something could happen to your vehicle that causes it to be worth less than you owe or just worthless if such an event happens then you may have more difficulty acquiring a replacement vehicle i personally do n't find the increase in total interest paid on student loans to offset the other consideration regarding the value of a car i 'm in a similar situation as you except your values are all about double what mine are the peace of mind i gain from being able to pay off the car more quickly and use that money towards loans or whatever i want is worth the interest i 'll earn by not putting that money into the student loans instead i also prefer the idea of being able to more easily use my vehicle as a trade in in case i need to get a different vehicle to better suit my family size

disclaimer i work in life insurance but i am not an agent    first things first there is not enough information here to give you an answer   when discussing life insurance the very first things we need to fully consider are the illustration of policy values and the contract itself   without these there is no way to tell if this is a good idea or not so what are the things to look for a. risk appetite   people love to discuss projections of the market like for example 7 8 a year compounded annually   go look at the historical returns of the stock market   it is never close to that projection   life insurance however can give you a guaranteed return this would be show in the guaranteed section of the life insurance illustration   as long as you pay your premiums this money is guaranteed to accrue   now most life insurance companies also show non guaranteed elements in their these are non guaranteed projections based on a scale at this point in time   these columns will show how your cash value may grow when dividends are credited to your policy and used to buy paid up additional insurance which generates more dividends this can be compared to the compounding nature of interest    b. tax treatment   i am definitely not an expert in this area but life insurance does have preferential tax treatment particularly to your beneficiaries c. beneficiaries   any death benefit again listed as guaranteed and maybe non guaranteed values is generally completely tax free for the beneficiary d. strategy   tying all of this together what exactly is the point of this   to transfer wealth to accrue wealth or some combination thereof   this is important and in your question so again without knowing more there is no way to answer your question   but i am surprised that in this forum so many people are quick to jump in and say in general that whole life insurance is a scam   and even more surprising is the fact the accepted answer has already been accepted my personal take is that if you are just trying to accrue wealth you should probably stick to the market and maybe buy term if you want a death benefit component   this is mostly due to your age higher risk of death = higher premiums = lower buildup and how long of a time period you have to build up money in the policy   but if a 25 year old asked this same question depending on his purposes i may suggest that a policy is in fact a good idea

what does points mean in any stock market there are certain stocks that go up and certain stocks that go down hence if we want to find the generic health of stock market i.e. on an average is it going up or down we have no means to find out   a practise that has evolved over the years is take a set of companies and find if on average they have gone up or gone down in very simple terms say in 1970 i take the market capitalization of a set of 50 companies lets say its value is x i would now call this index as value of 100 now after a month if the market capitalization is 2x the index value would be 200 after another month if the market capitalization come down to 1.5x then index value would be 150 so essentially now one is able to get the general trend more easily s&p is an index of select 500 companies based on various parameters so in isolation 2000 does not mean anything however as a comparison it does give quite a bit of insight note there are various adjustments made to factor i.e. certain companies go bankrupt or are not doing well are removed from index share splits mergers etc this ensure that the index is neutral and does not show spikes

diversifying but is n't that what mutual funds already do they diversify and reduce stock specific risk by moving from individual stocks to many stocks but you can diversify even further by selecting different fund types e.g. large cal small cap income bond funds international etc   your target date fund probably includes a few different types already and will automatically reallocate to less risky investments as you get close to the target date i would look at the fees of different types of funds and compare them to the historical returns of those funds   you can also use things like morningstar and other ratings as guides but they are generally very large buckets and may not be much help distinguishing between individual funds so to answer the question yes you can diversify further and probably get better returns and lower fees that a target date fund   the question is is it worth your time and effort to do so   you 're obviously comfortable investing for the long term so you might get some benefit by spending a little time looking for different funds to increase your diversification note that etfs do n't really diversify any differently than mutual funds they are just a different mechanism to invest in funds and allow different trading strategies trading during the day derivatives selling short etc

california bankruptcy law requires disclosure of any gift made by the person declaring bankruptcy in the past 12 months and any asset transfers in the past 2 years with a couple of minor exceptions this would most certainly include the car if it is back to you such a claim would likely be considered fraudulent though this would be a matter for the lawyers and bankruptcy trustee in question there 's a blog which you may wish to check out the california bankruptcy blog which has a specific entry on gifts now there is a specific exemption for automobiles but only up to a total of $ legally i believe there 's nothing you can do here if the $ 10 k was a loan it will be discharged in bankruptcy if it was a gift it 'll have to be declared and the car will have to be sold if or transferred it must be declared and will likely but not definitely be determined as an invalid disposal of assets either you or your family member will have to discuss this with a bankruptcy lawyer i 'm sorry your generous act is likely to get tangled up here

goodness i wish i could put away half my paycheck not to rain on your parade but a 6-month emergency fund is not quite very good   it is the typical starting time frame   personally i would feel more comfortable with a 2 + year fund   that is a bit extreme but only because many of us can barely seem to make it around to a 6-month fund   so we focus on the more attainable goal i say you do all three   make saving money your priority but do enjoy some of it in moderation   do not plan on making any big purchases with it but know that you will eventually be able able to do so   money not spent is worthless idle money is worthless   make some hopefully prudent investments with some of your money    a small portion of that investment portfolio can should be in speculative investments   maybe even as much as 20 of your investment portfolio since you are young   consider that money gone and you will hopefully be surprised by one of those speculative investments   that is the crucial point earmark a small portion of your investment portfolio which you are willing to lose   however do not gamble with it   research the hot emerging technologies for example and find a way to make an investment so in summary you may have more money that you know what do with right now   however that does not mean you need to go out and spend it all   trust me as you get older you will think of plenty of good uses for that money

as a buyer one of the easiest ways to save on closing costs is to avoid title insurance   this will only apply if you are a cash buyer as a mortgage writer will typically require title insurance    it is also one of the most ill advised ways to save money   you need title insurance    for the most part there is really no way to truly save on closing costs   wrapping costs into a loan saving on interest or taxes through timing do n't truly save money   sometimes you can obtain discounts on closing by using an targeted lender but that may cost you in higher interest rates    by paying points on your loan you may increase your costs at closing in order to save money on interest paid    certainly you ca n't discount required government imposed fees like doc stamps    you may be able to shop around and find a bit lower fees for appraisal credit reports title company fees and title insurance   however that is a lot of work for not a lot of return   title companies seem to be pretty tight about their fees    the best yield of your time is to get the other party in the transaction to pay your costs   the market or local tradition may not allow this   an additional way to lower your costs is to ask the realtors involved to discount their commissions   however they could always say no    the bottom line is transacting real estate is very expensive

do you mean how much income tax the irs will assess loans are not income therefore they do not incur income tax so as long as the money is n't being given but being loaned you do n't have to pay income tax on it and just in case you think there 's a loophole of instead of paying my workers i 'll just loan them their paychecks and then forgive the debt at the end of the year no the irs does consider loan forgiveness to be a form of income so you need to look at whether the loan is going to you or whether your business is a separate legal entity that is getting the money if it 's a capital contribution then you are selling a stake in your company or more precisely as long as the money is going into the business the company is selling a stake in itself in that case there generally is n't tax owed here 's a question that touches on this

if your requirements are hard must have $ 1000/month must have the same or bigger in capital at the end stocks are a poor choice of investment however in many cases people are willing to tolerate some level of risk to achieve the expected returns you also do not mention inflation which can take quite a lot out of your portfolio over the course of ten years if we make some simplifying assumptions you want to generate $ 12,000 a year you can realistically expect the whole stock market long term i.e. over time periods substantially longer than 10 years to return approximately 4 5 after factoring in inflation that means an investment of $ 240,000 $ 300,000 the math is simplified somewhat here if you do n't care about inflation you can up the percentage rather somewhat according to this article the s&p 500 returned an average of from through 2010 not factoring in inflation which would require an investment of approximately $ but this opens you up to substantial risk the stock market may go down 30 this year according to the above article the s&p returned only from 2001 to 2010 long term it goes up but your investment case is really to investing in an index to the entire stock market given your requirements you may be better suited investing primarily in stable bonds or perhaps a mix of bonds and stocks alternatively you may want to consider even more stable investments such as treasury notes treasury notes are all but guaranteed but with a lousy rate of return heck you could consider a gic that may be canada only or even a savings account there 's also the possibility of purchasing an annuity though almost everyone will advise against such personally i 'd go for a mutual fund which invested approximately 70 bonds and the rest in stocks over such a time period something like ing direct 's balanced income portfolio if you were in canada it substantially lowers your expected return but also lowers your risk i ca n't honestly say what the expected return there is at this point it 's returned 4 per year before inflation but has been around only since the beginning of 2008 and to be clear this is absolutely not free of risk

i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer but would like to add a few additional points to consider    turbotax and the professional it will send to represent you in case of a tax audit   have no more information about your tax return than what you entered into the program   now there are three or four different kinds of audits    the correspondence audit is the most common kind where irs sends a letter requesting copies of documents supporting a deduction or tax credit that you have claimed representation is hardly necessary in this case    the office audit is more serious where you have to make an appointment and go to the local irs office with paperwork that the examining agent needs to see physically and to answer questions etc   it would be better to be accompanied by a representative at these meetings but office audits are not as common as correspondence audits and because they are expensive for the irs usually occur when the irs is fairly sure of recovering a substantial sum of money   if you have been cutting corners and pushing the envelope in taking large enough deductions to make it worthwhile for the irs to go after you you probably should not have been using turbotax to file your income tax return   but should have been using an accountant or tax preparer who would be   representing you in case of an audit if the reason that you used turbotax   is that no accountant was willing to prepare a tax return with the deductions   that you wished to claim i doubt that having turbotax 's representative with you when you go to the irs office will help you all that much an example of a field audit is when the irs agent comes to your home to see if you actually have a space set aside to use exclusively as your home office as you claimed you did etc a taxpayer compliance measurement program audit is where the   irs randomly chooses returns for statistical checks that taxpayers are complying with the regulations the taxpayer has to prove every line of the return you claim to be filing as married filing jointly bring in your marriage certificate   submit birth certificates and social security cards of your dependent children and so on   yes having turbotax represent you for only $ will help but not if you are not married and can not provide the irs with a marriage certificate etc so pay the fee for peace of mind if you like and as insurance as littleadv suggests   but be sure you understand what you might be getting for the   money   most tax returns selected for audit are selected for what the irs believes are good reasons not at random   if what you said if my tax return is randomly selected for audit they will represent me   is interpreted literally turbotax will represent you only if your return is selected for examination under the program not if it is selected for audit because the irs believes that something is fishy about your return   and as always you get what you pay for

there are several possible effects there is n't much you could do about it if you had enough money to try to hedge by buying foreign securities in theory you could be happy no matter what your dollar did if it goes up you have pain or gain from local effects depending on whether imports or exports have a bigger effect on your life and that is offset by your investment having gain or pain ditto if it goes down in reality the amount you might have to invest to get to this point is probably not a realistic amount for an ordinary person to invest outside their country i own a canadian company that bills a number of us clients and i buy very little from the us i 'm big on local food for example and very frugal on the consumer goods front when the canadian dollar falls i effectively get a raise so i 'm happy while all around me are wringing their hands

pump and dump strategy is happening everywhere less so in developed market i can tell an experience from emerging market perspective usually several securities brokers work together to pump several penny stocks 5 7 stocks they together and searching for several investors who have money and willing to participate in this scheme these investors will then agree to invest usually with margin from securities to start pumping the stocks the stocks will be pumped until several research analysts take interest in it once the news were spread out regarding these highly speculative stocks the investors gradually dumps the stocks with help of their brokers the things that you need to keep an eye for low trading volume in the previous 3 6 months relative to their peers low p e ratio with earning growth no positive catalyst or material news regarding the company stocks have high momentum observe on weekly rather daily returns pump and dump usually last between 3 months to 6 months

this may make australian exports cheaper which can be a good thing however it is at the expense of making imports more expensive look to japan which is devaluing their currency and is a large importer of energy   i wo nt say its bad or unnecessary to hold money in other currencies however keep in mind that all aud denominated assets will or at least should rise as the currency falls if just aud usd falls this may not apply but if aud is weakened all around it should hold true again look to japan where the nikkei is closely correlated with the strength of the yen   another possibility is to buy gold which should rise in aud terms but other forces are at work with gold price so some would not agree with this

there are a couple pretty good answers here already but i wanted to add that depending on your location many grocery stores sell gasoline gift cards for those grocery stores can be used for gas and groceries and usually do not include any fees since we all need to eat and most of us need to fill the tank on a regular basis this seems like the best way to run up the bill without purchasing frivolous items as another poster mentioned pre paying bills is another great way to go some places such as health clubs may even offer you a discount for paying in full essentially earning you more money down the road

in a strictly mathematical sense no or rather it depends what long run means   say today the home average is $ 200 k and payment is $ the $ 900 today happens to be about 20 of the median us monthly income which is approximately $ housing rises income in 100 years long enough the house costs $ 10 m but incomes are only $ yr and the mortgage even at the same rate is $ 45k month or to be clear it rose to 52 of monthly income   my observation is that long term the median home costs what 25 of median income will support in terms of the mortgage after downpayment long term that means that if you graph this you 'll see trends above and below the long term line you 'll see a 25 year bubble form starting in the late 80 's as rates dropped from near 18 to the in the early but once you normalize it to percent of income to pay the loan much of the bubble is flattened out at 18 $ bought you a $ 100 k mortgage but at 3.5 it bought $ this is in absolute dollars wages also rose during that time i am just clarifying how rates distort the long term trends and create the short term anomalies

in my experience shiller is always way before his time with his predictions and often it comes at too early a point for anyone actually making some money to care about his view is very long term and i trust his predictions because he so accurately predicted so many of the and the measures that would follow he even predicted that there would be bailouts in his book irrational exuberance   his were poo as doom and gloom and manipulative until every piece started falling apart in the specific order of events give or take that they did   i personally think people like dr. shiller make bold predictions that are hard to swallow the derivatives market is a bit about rolling into bull territory with any kind of housing index but warren buffet 's old adage to buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying paraphrase i see this as a good long term investment because i trust shiller 's judgement he stuck to his guns when the doubts were at him   and krugman et al to some extent and he turned out to be more than   to me these kinds of sources are usually pretty sound the man knows what he 's talking about and i would n't mind picking up a piece of that action especially if the market just does n't trust any real estate investments it 's pretty easy to realize that right now housing will be undervalued and now that mortgage applications are supposedly stricter i think there 's a good argument to be made that this economist should continue to exceed expectations

you could do nothing for a while longer foreign exchange simply means your services are cheaper and imports and more expensive local transactions are otherwise unaffected your main worry is whether the government 's attempts to revert these issues will create inflation within russia   local clients will likely not care to pay you in euros dollars or pounds as it will cost them significantly more they 'd have to acquire the currency to pay you with but does it matter if they pay in the financial crisis in more an international thing not a local one now it is possible there will be inflation setting in but i doubt the powers that be will allow that to happen if you are concerned about it buying non liquid assets are the thing to do a house will still be worth 1 house no matter what a rouble note will buy you in a year 's time similarly you can invest in blue chip stocks that should be a good hedge against any further inflation the rich do n't tend to turn poor in difficult times in the meantime get some international clients as the rouble is so low relatively speaking your services are very competitive the rest of the time is to wait it out a little nobody knows what will happen but in my knowledge of history interest rates like this drop back to something much closer to normal quite quickly

well to put things simply the government debt level has to do with the money spent by government vs the revenue the government collects the only tenuous connection between the stock market price and the capital gains tax collected at the end of the year granted there should be an increase in the cgt it would be on the actual transactions made that incurred in capital gains that is at best a drop in the bucket which trump by the way wants to reduce since over a year 100 of the shares are not exchanged this would not be even remotely close to the increase in stock market value    the government simply us no ownership over the stock market value the stock market also does not count into gdp so you could n’t use that to say your debt to gdp ratio declined    they are just so unrelated that it ’s senseless to link them

i asked a friend and he gave me a good explanation so i 'm just gon na paste it here for others there is a simple and a complex answer depending on how much you want to understand the pricing dynamic of options   leaps do n't react 1:1 with a stock move because the probability of your option being in the money at expiry is still very much up in the air so you basically do n't get full credit for a move in the stock this far out from expiry the more complex answer involves a discussion of option greeks   delta gamma theta vega and are variables that affect the pricing of all options   the key greek in this case is delta because it describes mathematically the expected move of an option as a ratio vs changes in stock price   for put options the ratio is -1 to 0 where -1 is direct correlation between stock price and option price and 0 is no correlation   the delta increases as an option gets deeper in the money and also as it gets closer to expiry and reflects the probability of the option expiring in the money   for your option contract the current delta is   so = 1.9 which is close   also keep in mind that that strike price had a last trade at when the stock was at and the current ask price is so the last price is n't a true reflection of the market value    as for the other greeks gamma is a reflection of volatility in the sense that it affects the rate of change of delta as price and time changes   theta is the value of the time component of the option and is expressed as the expected time decay per day   the problem is that the time premium is really some arbitrary number that the market maker seems to be able to change at will without justification and it can fluctuate wildly over short periods of time and i think this may explain some of the discrepancy    if you bought the options when aapl was $ a couple weeks ago option price of $ and now aapl is at $ and the delta over that time averaged at then your expected option price would be $ $ $ 0.55 + = $ so you lost around $ in time premium or theta burn over the last 2 weeks assuming it opens trading around 22.1 on monday your broker should have information about the option contract greeks somewhere   for my platform i have to put the over top of the option contract for it to show me the greeks   if your broker does n't have this then you can get it from this is another reason that i only invest in deep in the money leaps because the time premium is much much lower than near the money and also because delta is much higher so if i want to trade out of it early i do n't feel like i 'm getting ripped off not getting paid for a stock price move   for example look at the jan 17 175 put   the delta is and the time premium is only $ 0 1 depending if you are looking at the bid or ask   the only downside is expected returns are lower for deep in the money contracts and they are expensive to buy

why should the rich who buy more expensive homes be by those who pay less or from those who rent a person who buys a 500k home in a high property tax area wins twice once but having more tax breaks by being able to deduct more than your average working class person who buys a house at 250k and the second time when they get nicer schools public services etc at other people 's dime sf home prices are a combination or speculation investment and poor government control sf prices are at tokyo levels when the population density is at 1/10 that is a failure of local government policy to build more homes not from lack of tax breaks   if your community wants to pay higher taxes for more local services power to you and i encourage it but you should n't be subsidized by those who do nt imo people should n't be punished for not owning property or living in a state where they think sales tax is better than income or property

assuming the amount of your car payment and student loan are n't crazy you should be fine i would suggest starting with a baseline budget listing your monthly income and expenses be sure to include miscellaneous expenses like car maintenance insurance food clothes etc the common things that sometimes get overlooked in a budget after all of your necessary expenses fluff like entertainment does n't count if your employer has a 401k with a match i would contribute to that up to the match amount   next i would save an emergency fund to cover unforseen events such as car repairs etc $ 1000 is not an uncommon amount to see people suggest for this next i would knock out your car loan then student loan as fast as possible this will free up some cash flow which gives you more freedom to do what you want at this point you save more so you do n't have to finance the next car or have a down payment for a home or whatever   building your savings to be 3 6 months of income is a good idea this covers things like being laid off or other larger unexpected events after you get to that point how you handle your budget is pretty open

it would seem to be in your best interest to file and that probably means that you should do all you can to get your documents back   if you are in fact owed a refund then there is apparently no penalty to filing late   if you instead owe taxes you better file in any case since the fees stack up pretty fast 5 per month after the due date up to 25 of the taxes owed

an activity which can help improve your credit score and actually make you money is it 's a little complicated but can be beneficial to do using either a credit card which allows fee free money withdrawals from or building up debt using your credit card gives you access to your credit amount you then use a long term 0 balance transfer card to transfer the debt which you pay off at the minimum rate it 's 0 so no costs are associated except for the initial fee paid for the balance transfer amount the money that would have been used to pay off the credit amount or money withdrawn from a can then be deposited in a savings account so you are now earning interest on the credit balance continuing to make monthly minimum payments via direct debit will help improve your credit rating and the savings money will earn interest it is also available if you suddenly need to pay off the 0 card

that is the best part everyone is brick and mortar stores are dead bandwagon reminds of the .com bubble the customer base that walmart is and will continue to be is the vast majority of not only the us but the world the thing is these people like going to the store and browsing around and entertaining the physical aspect of buying shit rather than just point and clicking the thing walmart is doing is playing on what think makes america they have heavy plans on american manufacturing and production which will be sold in their own stores which they will charge a slightly lower price for and make a stupid amount of money while at the same time buying up advanced auto parts and taking over their 5000 plus stores and capabilities and then diving in which is a prediction buying blue apron type operation and then simply taking over walmart does not need to get into the area of netflix or any of the like because they can simply buy out down the road a company they can make compete in that field to hold onto the market share   amazon is the single most inflated outrageously high stock that has ever existed because of peoples ignorance of what the internet brings they are rightfully and smartly playing on that but it wo n't pan out   walmart is smart by pushing partnerships with fed ex and ups which are 2 of the largest carries in the world and employee well payed middle class people that look for dedication and respect no matter what generation you belong to not to mention they contract out with multiple trucking companies

       what should i expect from therapy you should expect one or a series of confidential appointments of up to an hour in length in a suitable professional setting the process should also provide you with the opportunity to   make sense of your individual circumstances have contact with a therapist who will help identify the choices for change feel supported during the process of change reach a point where you are better equipped to cope with the future is counselling and psychotherapy confidential everything you discuss is confidential between you and the counsellor or psychotherapist there can be certain legal exceptions and the practitioner should clarify this with you prior to the establishment of any agreed contract for working you may have specific queries about confidentiality depending on the format of the therapy for example with online counselling you may wish to ask the following questions to your therapist   are the notes from therapy protected by passwords and encrypted are held in a secure cabinet what happens when there are technical problems should my therapist carry liability insurance professional liability insurance is not currently a legal requirement however a number of professional associations strongly recommend that therapists take out appropriate insurance coverage examples of insurance policies which a therapist might have are professional indemnity public and products liability libel and slander to name a few it is suggested that you check your therapist has appropriate and adequate insurance in place before engaging their services if you are unsure then you should consult an insurance professional or a legal expert for further guidance the insurance is not only intended to protect the therapist but offer peace of mind that if something should go wrong there are funds in place to compensate you in such an event for further information you may find the british insurance association website useful author professional risks

couple questions for clarification   1 investment firm is a pretty broad term do you mean registered investment advisory firm or broker dealer or something else   2 are you asking if they can reveal who they generally custody assets with if so yes they are always willing to give this out and many firms use multiple custodians if you are asking if they can reveal client information and where the assets are held then no absolutely not the only reason they could legally give this out is if the feds or if a court order was issued

below is just a little information on short selling from my small unique book the small stock trader   short selling is an advanced stock trading tool with unique risks and rewards it is primarily a short term trading strategy of a technical nature mostly done by small stock traders market makers and hedge funds most small stock traders mainly use short selling as a short term speculation tool when they feel the stock price is a bit overvalued most long term short positions are taken by fundamental oriented long short equity hedge funds that have identified some major weaknesses in the company there a few things you should consider before shorting stocks despite all the and blame surrounding short selling especially during bear markets i personally think regular short selling not naked short selling has a more positive impact on the stock market as lastly small stock traders should not expect to make significant profits by short selling as even most of the great stock traders jesse livermore baruch nicolas william and steven cohen have hardly made significant money from their shorts it is safe to say that odds are stacked against short sellers over the last century or so western large caps have returned an annual average of between 8 and 10 percent while the returns of small caps have been slightly higher   i hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful author of the small stock trader

you are missing a few variables from your calculation particularly implied volatility   even so it does not look like it would be too great a predictor even if incorporated   you should focus on calculating the option price at a different point in time with a different underlying price instead of using a total position value as that can be done afterwards i programmed and use the standard black scholes model to calculate expected returns    there are many tools online to help you without doing the programming or calculations yourself

an option gives you an option   that is you are n't buying any security you are simply buying an option to buy a security   the sole value of what you buy is the option to buy something an american option offers more flexibility i.e. it offers you more options on buying the stock   since you have more options the cost of the option is higher of course a good example makes sense why this is the case   consider the vix   options on the vix are european style   sometimes the vix spikes like crazy tripling in value in days   it usually comes back down pretty quick though within a couple of weeks   so far out options on the vix are n't worth just a whole lot more because the vix will probably   be back to normal   however if the person could have them right when it got to the top they would have made a fortune many times what their option was worth   since they are style though they would have to wait till their option was redeemable right when the vix would be about back to normal   in this case an american style option would be far more valuable especially for something that is difficult to predict like the vix

the dealership is getting a kickback for having you use a particular bank to finance through the bank assumes you will take the full term of the loan to pay back and will hopefully be a repeat customer this tactic is n't new and although it maybe does n't make sense to you the consumer in the long run it benefits the bank and the dealership they would n't do it otherwise these guys have a lot of smart people running s for them be sure to read the specifics of the loan contract there may be a penalty for paying it off early most customers wo n't be able to pay that much in cash so the bank makes a deal with the dealership to send clients their way they will lose money on a small percentage of clients but make more off of the rest of the clients if there 's no penalty for paying it off early you may just want to take the financing offer and pay it off asap if you truly can only finance $ 2500 for 6 mos and get the full discount then that might work as well the bank had to set a minimum for the dealership in order to qualify as a loan that earns the discount sounds like that 's it bonus info here 's a screenshot of blue book for that car car dealers get me up always have always will so i like doing this kind of research for people to make sure they get the right price fair price range is $ $ first time car buyers are a dealers dream come true do n't let them beat you down   and here 's more specific data about the florida area relating to recent purchases

the amount of money you have should be enough for you to live a safe but somewhat restricted life if you never worked again but it could set you up for just about any sort of financial goal short of island buying if you do just about any amount of work the basic math for some financial rules of thumb to keep in mind if your money is invested in very low risk ways such as a money market fund you might earn say 3 in interest every year that 's $ 36k but if you withdraw that $ 36k every year then every year you have the same principal amount invested and a dollar tomorrow ca n't buy as much as a dollar today because of inflation if we assume for simplicity that inflation is 1 every year then you need to contribute an additional $ 12k to your principal balance every year just so that it has the same buying power next year this leaves you with a net $ 24k of interest income that you can freely spend every year for the rest of your life without ever touching your principal balance if your money is invested more broadly including equity investments stocks you might earn say 7 every year some years you might lose money on your investments and would need to draw down your principal balance to pay your bills some years you might do quite well but would need to remain conservative and not withdraw your excess earnings every year because you will need that excess to make up for the bad years this would leave you with about $ of income every year before inflation and about $ after inflation but you would be taking on more risk by doing this if you work enough to pay your daily bills and leave your investments alone to earn 7 on average annually then in just 10 years your money would have doubled to ~ $ 2.4 million dollars this assumes that you never save another penny and spend everything you make it 's a level of financial security that means you could retire at a drop of the hat and if do n't start working for 20 years which you might need to do if you spend in excess of your means and your money dries up then the same will not be true starting work at 45 with no savings would put you at a much greater disadvantage for financial security every year that you work enough to pay your bills before retirement could increase your nest egg by 7 though again there is risk here but only if you do it now while you have a nest egg to invest now in terms of what you should do with that money you need to ask yourself what are your financial goals you should think about this long and hard and renew that discussion with yourself periodically as your goals will change over time you say university is n't an option but what other ways might you want to invest in yourself would you want to go on learning trips take a trade or learn a skill start a business do you want to live in the same place for 30 years and thus maybe you should lock down your housing costs by buying a house or do you want to travel around the world never staying in the same place twice in which case you will need to figure out how to live cheaply and flexibly without signing unnecessary leases if you want to live in the middle of nowhere eating ramen noodles and watching tv you could do that without lifting a finger ever again but every other financial goal you might have should be factored into your budget and work plan and because you do have such a large degree of financial security you have a lot of options that could be very appealing every low paying but desirable hard to get job is open to you you can pursue your interests even if they barely pay minimum wage and doing so may help you ease into your new life easier than simply retiring at such a young age when most of your peers will be heavy into their careers so that is my strongest piece of advice work now while you 're young and have motivation so that you can dial back later this will be much easier than the other way around as for where you should invest your money in look on this site for investing questions and ultimately with that amount of money i suggest you hire a paid advisor who works based on an hourly consultation fee rather than a management fee they can give you much more directed advice than the internet though you should learn it yourself as well because that will give you the best piece of mind that you are n't being taken advantage of

this question is very open ended but i 'll try to answer parts of it an employer can offer shares as part of a compensation package instead of paying cash the employer can use the money to buy up shares and give them to the employees this is done to keep employees for longer periods of time and the employer may also want to create more insider ownership for a number of reasons another possibility is issuance of secondary offerings that are partially given to employees secondary offerings often lower the price of the shares in the market and create an incentive for employees to stay until the stock price rises all of these conditions can be stipulated look up golden handcuffs usually stock gifts are only given to a few high level employees and as part of a bonus package it is very unusual to see a mature company regularly give away large amounts of stock as this is a frowned upon practice start ups often pay their employees with stock up until the company is acquired or goes public

i hope i 'm misunderstanding your plan you want to invest in a way that will make so much that you pay back all of the loan payments with investment gains like the answer i gave on the preceding question and like @littleadv 's comment mhoran 's answers do n't do this no good will come of it   this strategy requires higher returns but does not necessarily give you a better return    but because you asked the question again let me specify what you 're missing i do think that learning is a good thing it boils down to two very significant problems that you have n't addressed   1 where are you getting your monthly income from   2 realistic vs. how big do any gains have to be and does that exist in the real world in a way that you can capture   in a nutshell if my answer to the last question showed that it 's crazy to invest and pay back out of your capital and income since you 're trying to keep your capital and only pay back with monthly gains this one will require even higher and thus more unrealistic gains   the model you 're implying   if that 's what you mean with this model which i think you do then here are my two very key questions again how are you getting your monthly income financial investments i.e. stocks or bonds will have two components of value one component of value is the stream of payments such as a monthly dividend from stocks that pay those or the interest payment from a bond the other is the ability to resell a security to another investor receiving back your capital   so you either have to find stocks that pay > 52 returns tax free each year and pay this loan off with the payments or higher returns to cover taxes but these kinds of investments do not exist for you   or you can try to invest in something pray that it goes up per month and so that you can sell it pay back your loan payment with the proceeds and use the capital to buy your next investment that will go up per month to turn and sell it again   the pros that do model this type of speculation go into much more depth than you are capable of they build models that incorporate probabilities for rates of return based on historical data they have better information and have specialized in calculating this all out they even have access to better investment opportunities like pre ipo twitter or private notes you just wo n't find the opportunities to make this happen each month for 24 months again you wo n't find them they do not exist for you in as an investor in securities realistic vs. so clearly i hope that by now i have convinced you that these would be the required returns they simply are n't available to you if they were you would still run into obstacles with converting book returns into physical money that you could repay the loans with and then continuing that growth   and while i appreciate the notion that if i could just make the payments each month i 'd have $ 10,000 after 24 months i guarantee you that you 'll be better off finding another way to target that same investment   along the lines of what mhoran said if you aim for a basic 401 k or other similar investment account and target it into the s&p500 you might see returns of anywhere from to + 25 over the next 24 months but if things went like they tend to average for the s&p500 it 's more like annually check out a savings target calculator like this one from bankrate.com and put in the numbers if you can save about $ 390 a month you 'll be at $ 10 k in 24 months it 's not as fun as the other but you can actually expect to achieve that   you will not find consistent > 50 returns on your money annually

gt;the idea that extra bodies competing for jobs would drive down the price of labor also needs to be justified   basic supply and demand   if labor paribus then the price of labor falls   in reality the supply of labor and the demand for labor are constantly upwards   so if the supply of labor increases faster than the demand for labor does then the price of labor falls   if demand increases faster than supply then the price of labor goes up

from my limited experience having taken a class on bankruptcy in order to become a chapter 11 is the portion of the bankruptcy code that allows certain corporate entities to reorganize basically the entity files for bankruptcy protection to halt credit collections or any number of reasons and then work with the courts to get out if the entity can put together a reasonable sounding restructuring plan the court may allow them to do it a restructuring plan essentially is a plan of who to pay back when and by what means this is seriously a simple explanation it 's much more complex than this so if the court approves the plan the entity will attempt to carry it out and come out of bankruptcy several years down the road in a more solvent position if the court rejects the plan or the plan fails then the entity has to then engage in chapter 7 proceedings selling assets to pay off debts

hi u   short answer yes you do have to pay taxes in israel for all your   long answer all countries within the consider you as a fiscal resident in the country where you spend over half a year in 183 days and up if you do not spend that much time in any country there are other tying measures to avoid people not being fiscal residents in any country   since you are living in israel you will have to pay all your generated income in israel following the tax regulation that is in place there i am no tax lawyer so i can not help you there   having a lot of business internationally brings other headaches with it taking for example the u.s. there is a possibility that they taxes in their payments it is unlikely though as they have a tax treaty to prevent double taxation you can ask for this money to be returned from the u.s. or other countries through each country 's internal process   another thing to take into account is that you can be taxed in other countries for any revenue you generate in said country this is especially relevant for revenue that comes from real estate the country where the real estate is will tax you in the country and you will have to deduct these taxes paid in your country israel in this case if there is no tax treaty you might possibly be paying twice   i know you said you do promotion but i have to warn you about this because i ignore what other countries tax or do not tax so been giving more info wo n't hurt   if the us is the main and/or only country you will be doing business with i strongly recommend you real the tax treaty with lots of love and patience you can find it here or here   treaty amendment   if you are from israel and prefer it in here are the treaties in your language   treaty amendment    normally most irs departments have sections with very help on these sort of matters i 'd you to take a look at yours    last what i 've explained is the normal process that applies almost all over the world but each country has their own distinctions and you need to look carefully take what i said as a starting point and do your own research or ideally try to find a tax consultant lawyer who helps you   best of luck

pay off the highest interest loan rate first you must be doing something funky with how long your terms are if you give a bit more info about your loan 's such as the term and how much extra you have right now to spend it could be explained in detail why that would be the better choice using your numbers you have to make sure when you are analyzing your different loan options that you make sure you are comparing apples to apples ie make sure that you are either comparing the present value future value or amortization payments   edit using some of your numbers lets say you have 5000 dollars in your pocket you have 3 options excel makes these calculations easier do nothing in 80 months your student loan will be payed in full and you will have owing on your mortgage and 5000 in your no bank interest   for mortgage pay off student loan and allocate student loans amortization to mortgage in 80 months you will have $ owing on mortgage and student loan will be paid in full for mortgage pay 5000 on mortgage in 80 months student loan will be paid in full and you will have $ owing on mortgage for mortgage

difference between a limit and market order is largely a trade off between price certainty and timing certainty if you think the security is already well priced the downside of a limit order is the price may never hit your limit and keep trading away from you you 'll either spend a lot of time amending your order or sitting around wishing you 'd amended your order   the downside of a market order is you do n't know the execution price ahead of time this is typically more of a issue with illiquid instruments where even smaller orders may have price impact for small trades in more liquid securities your realized price will often resemble the last traded price hope that helps both have a purpose and the best tool for the job will depend on your circumstances

am i correct in understanding that a scrip dividend involves the issue of new shares instead of the purchase of existing shares yes instead of paying a cash dividend to shareholders the company grants existing shareholders new shares at a previously determined price this allows shareholders who join the program to obtain new shares without incurring transaction costs that would normally occur if they purchased these shares in the market does this mean that if i do n't join this program my existing shares will be diluted every time a scrip dividend is paid yes because the number of shares has increased so the relative percentage of shares in the company you hold will decrease if you opt out of the program the price of the existing shares will adjust so that the value of the company is essentially unchanged similar to a stock split but the number of outstanding shares has increased so the relative weight of your shares declines if you opt out of the program   what is the benefit to the company of issuing scrip dividends companies may do this to conserve their cash reserves also by issuing a scrip dividend corporations could avoid the advanced corporation tax act that they would normally pre pay on their distributions since the of the act in 1999 preserving cash reserves is the primary reason for a company to issue scrip dividends as far as i know whether or not scrip dividends are actually a beneficial strategy for a company is debatable this looks like a neat study even though i 've only skimmed it   the issue may be beneficial to you however because you might receive a tax benefit you can sell the scrip dividend in the market the capital gain from this sale may fall below the annual tax free allowance for capital gains in which case you do n't pay any capital gains tax on that amount for a cash dividend however there is n't a minimum taxable amount so you would owe dividend tax on the entire dividend and may therefore pay more taxes on a cash dividend

is there any practical reason to hold off on making payments until i receive a billing statement yes a few    as for a zero balance fico consumer affairs manager barry says the idea here is the lower the better in terms of the utilization percentage but something is better than nothing the score wants to see some kind of activity   how low should you go in a recent interview fico spokesman craig watts said if your utilization is 10 percent or lower you 're in great shape as far as utilization goes that being said there are downsides especially if you wind up forgetting to make a payment   the easiest thing to do also from a time management perspective is to get your billing statement once a month verify the purchases on it and at that time you receive the statement schedule an online bill payment so that it will be paid in full before the due date    as aganju points out you do n't have to wait for a paper bill in hand or even an e mail notification you can go online after your statement date to get the statement   this makes sure you wo n't have extra costs related to of mail if you still receive paper mail though it does require remembering to check and/or setting a recurring calendar reminder   paying much in advance of that as is your current practice might be a good idea to free up available balance if you are planning a purchase that would take you over your credit limit but this should be relatively rare and some credit card companies will raise that limit if you have been paying well and ask nicely though find out first if they do a hard pull of your credit report for that

owning a stock via a fund and selling it short simultaneously should have the same net financial effect as not owning the stock   this should work both for your personal finances as well as the impact of not owning the shares has on the stock 's price to use an extreme example suppose there are 4 million outstanding shares of evil oil company   suppose a group of concerned index fund investors owns 25 of the stock and sells short the same amount    they 've borrowed someone else 's 25 of the company and sold it to a third party   it should have the same effect as selling their own shares of the company which they ca n't otherwise do   now when 25 of the company 's stock becomes available for purchase at market price what happens to the stock   it falls of course    regarding how it affects your own finances suppose the stock price rises and the investors have to return the shares to the lender   they buy 1 million shares at market price pushing the stock price up give them back and then sell another million shares short subsequently pushing the stock price back down if enough people do this to effect the share price of a stock or asset class the managers at the companies might be forced into behaving in a way that satisfies the investors   in your case perhaps the company could issue a press release and fire the employee that tried to extort money from your wife 's estate in order to win your investment business back   okay well maybe that 's a stretch

you could end up with nothing yes   i imagine those that worked at enron years ago if their 401(k was all in company stock would have ended up with nothing to give an example here   however more likely is for you to end up with less than you thought as you see other choices as being better that with the benefit of hindsight you wish you had made different choices the strategies will vary as some people will want something similar to a set it and forget it kind of investment and there may be fund choices where a fund has a targeted retirement date some years out into the future   these can be useful for people that do n't want to do a lot of research and spend time deciding amongst various choices   other people may prefer something a bit more active   in this case you have to determine how much work do you want to do do you want to review fund reviews on places like morningstar and do periodic reviews of your investments etc   what works best for you is for you to resolve for yourself as for risks here are a few possible categories time how many hours a week do you want to spend on this   how much time learning this do you want to do in the beginning   while this does apply to everyone you have to figure out for yourself how much of a cost do you want to take here volatility some investments may fluctuate in value and this can cause issues for some people as it may change more than they would like   for example if you invest rather aggressively there may be times where you could have a -50 return in a year and that is n't really acceptable to some people inflation similarly to those investments that vary wildly there is also the risk that with time prices generally rise and thus there is something to be said for the purchasing power of your investment   if you want to consider this in more detail consider what $ 1,000,000 would have bought 30 years ago compared to now currency risk some investments may be in other currencies and thus there is a risk of how different denominations may impact a return fees how much do your fund 's charge in the form of annual expense ratio   are you aware of the charges being taken to manage your money here

the really simple answer is that compound interest is compound not linear   money invested for longer earns more interest and the sooner you start investing the longer it has to earn interest   these ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age and what you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension or any other compound interest fund accounts for over 50 of what you will get out 25 to 65 is forty years and $ 100 invested at 7 for 40 years is $ 1400   $ 100 invested every year for 40 years the pot would be worth just under $ 20,000 at 30 years it would be worth under $ 10,000 and at 20 years it would be worth only $   if you double your investment amount every 10 years you would have invested $ and the pot would be worth $ do exactly the same but starting at 35 instead of 25 and your pot would only be worth $

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

regarding the mortgage company they will want to know where the down payment came from and as long as you are honest about it there is no fraud it 's possible that the mortgage company may have some reservations about the deal now that they know where the down payment came from but that will depend on the size of the deal and other factors if everyone involved has decent credit and this is a fairly standard mortgage it will probably have no impact at all

if you were a business all your assets would have a dollar value so when you sold them you 'd decrease the amount of assets by that amount and increase in cash and if there was a profit on the sale it would go in as income if there was loss it would count as a cost or a loss so if there was a profit it would increase equity a loss then it would decrease equity   since it 's not really worthwhile doing a estimated cost for everything that you have i 'd just report it as income like you are doing and let the amount of equity increase proportionately so implicitly you always had roughly that amount of equity but some of it was in the form of assets and now you 're liquidating those assets so the amount shows up in gnucash when you buy new things you might sell later you could consider adding them as assets to keep track of this explicitly but even then you have the price of things changes with time and you might not want to keep up with those price changes it 's a lot of extra work for a family budget for stuff you already have it 's better to treat things as you are doing and just treat the money as it 's easier and does n't really change you always had that in equity some of it was just off the books and now you are bringing it into the books

it was the sole creditor we 're trying to avoid here is what i meant to say not the broker him herself   the reason a firm might extend their debt would be to extend their credit into monetary value in the scenario i just discussed and it would more often be the more well known firms that would be the most likely to provide a bond money supply think ibm bonds google bonds cheese board collective bonds tesla motor bonds ge bonds etc   all these firms would find a way to apply their bond funds in a way that would expand their output and make repaying the bonds much more likely just like a normal firm would today   the only difference is that in the mean time that bond becomes a monetary commodity which people can trade for goods and services until it is repaid once repaid people can see that the bond is worth using and the demand for that bond as money will increase just like how the demand for money will increase and that prompts a normal central bank to print more money   which means the firm is safe to take on stable debt again which people can reuse again   the major difference here is that we have a money supply that you can choose to participate in or not and it is up to the consumers of that currency how the money supply flows as opposed to a central authority   it does matter who 's first in line to get the new money in any economy and with multiple policies competing power is less concentrated

the way to resolve your dilemma is to consult the price to rent ratio of the property according to the price to rent ratio is a measure of the relative affordability of renting and buying in a given housing market it is calculated as the ratio of home prices to annual rental rates so for example in a real estate market where on average a home worth $ 200,000 could rent for $ 1000 a month the price rent ratio is that ’s determined using the formula $ 200,000 ÷ 12 x $ 1,000 also goes on to give a table comparing different cities price to rent ratio and then claim that the average price to rent ratio is currently if your price to rent ratio is lower than then yes your rents are more expensive than the average house claims that a high price to rent ratio is an argument in favor of tenants renting properties while a low price to rent ratio favors people buying either to live in the property or to just rent it out to other people so let 's apply the price to rent ratio formula towards the properties you just quoted there 's a specific house i could buy for 190 perhaps even less that rents for exactly 2000 month 12 = there 's a house for sale asking 400 been on the market 2 yrs could probably get for 350 which rents for 2800   12 = 12 = one can quite easily today buy a house for that would rent out for 1700 2100 month   lower bound 12 = upper bound 12 = even so the rental returns here seem ridiculously high to me based on other markets i 've noticed considering how the average price to rent ratio is and your price to rent ratio ranges from to you are indeed correct they are indeed ridiculously high qualification i was involved in real estate and used the price to rent ratio to determine how long it would take to recover a person 's investment in the property keep in mind that it 's not the only thing i care about and obviously the price to rent ratio tends to expenses involved in actually owning properties and trying to deal with periods of vacancy there 's also the problem of taking into account demand as well according to detroit mi has the lowest price to rent ratio with which should suggest that people should buy properties immediately in this city but that 's probably more of a sign of people not wanting to move to detroit and bid up the prices of properties edit i should also say that just because the properties are ridiculously expensive right now does n't mean you should expect your rents to decrease rather if rents keep staying at their current level i 'd predict that the property values will slowly increase in the future thereby raising the price to rent ratio to non ridiculous mode

insurance is n't a product designed to protect against financial loss the product is designed to allow people to pay a small fee the premium for peace of mind this allows the insured to feel as if their purchase was worthy they see the potential of loss as a concern and the premiums small enough to allow them to not worry about having a loss insurance companies will then seek out risks where the perceived losses far out weight the actual losses risk assessment so you answer is that your friends are paying for peace of mind

the 401(k contribution is federal tax free when you make the contribution and most likely state too   i believe that is true for california specifically there was a court case some years ago about people making 401(k or ira contributions in new york avoiding the new york state income tax   then they moved to florida no income tax and took the money out   new york sued saying they had to pay the new york income tax that had been deferred but the court said no   so you should be able to avoid california state income tax and then later if you were to move to for example texas no income tax have no state income tax liability at the federal level you will have different problems   you wo n't have the money it will be held by the 401(k trustee   when you try to access the money cash the account out you will have to pay the deferred taxes   effectively when you remove the money it becomes income in the year it is removed you can take the money out at any time but if you are less than 59 1/2 at the time that you take it there is a 10 penalty   the agreement is that the feds let you defer paying the tax because it is going to finance your retirement and they will tax it later   if you take it out before 59 1/2 they figure you are not retired yet and are breaking your part of the agreement of course you can generally leave the money in the 401(k plan with your old employer and let it grow until you are 59.5 or roll it over into another 401(k with a new employer if they let you or into an ira   but if you have returned to your own country having an account in the u.s. would introduce both investment risk and currency risk if you are in another country when you want the money the question would be where your u.s. residence would be   if you live in california then go to say france your u.s. residence would still be california and you would still owe california income tax   if you move from california to texas and then to france your u.s. residence would be texas    this is pretty vague as you might have heard in the case was he a resident of chicago or washington d.c.   same problem with howard who was born in texas but then spent most his life in california then to nevada then to nicaragua and the bahamas   when he died texas california and nevada all claimed him as a resident for estate taxes   the important thing is to be able to make a reasonable case that you are a resident of where ever you want to be driver 's license mailing address living quarters and so on

like others mentioned you need to look at the big picture personally i 'm not a fan of insurance based investments they tend to have horrible track records and you 're locked it and paying way to much money for them i had one for a number of years and when i finally cancelled it i pulled out almost the exact amount i put in so it basically grew at either zero or negative interest for 5 + years   i ended up buying term life and took the difference and invested it in a roth 401k. much better use of my money the reason why insurance people push these policies so hard is that they make insane commission on it over 2 3 years i asked my insurance guy about it and he admitted that plus doing some research you 'll find that out as well hope this helps somewhat

it 's important because you may be able to reduce the total amount of interest paid by paying the loan faster but you can do nothing to reduce the total of your principal repayments the distinction can also affect the amount of tax you have to pay some kinds of interest payments can be counted as business expenses which means that they reduce the amount of income you have to pay tax on but this is not generally the case for money used to repay the loan principal

i 'm assuming this was a cashless exercise because you had income show up on your w-2 when i had a similar situation i did the following if you made $ 50,000 in salary and $ 10,000 in stock options then your w-2 now says $ 60,000 you 'll record that on your taxes just like it was regular income   you 'll also get a form that talks about your stock sale    but remember you bought and sold the stock within seconds   your forms will probably look like this bought stock $ 10,000 sold stock $ 10,000 + $ 50 commission total profit loss $ 50 from the turbotax irs view point you lost $ 50 on the sale of the stock because you paid the commission but the buy and sell prices were identical or nearly identical

some basic thoughts mostly on fairness i guess the answer does n't really fit this site it 's more about ethics but this fits the question which is n't really just about money either so when both work the same amount it seems appropriate that both get the same mount of money does n't it that is the scheme of as already contained in your question and in some other answers is fair by this logic pay attention to hidden money for example the one who works more for money might automatically get a pension funded this way this is hidden money which already goes to only one partner so when dividing equally you 'll need to take that into account or just include equal pensions for both in the family 's needs directly

a lot of questions but all it boils down to is banks usually perform t+1 net settlements also called global netting as opposed to real time gross settlements   that means they promise the counterparty the money at some point in the future within the next few business days see delivery versus payment and collect all transactions of that kind for this example say they will have a net outflow of 10 m usd   the next day they will purchase 10 m usd on the fx market and hand it over to the global   note that this might be more than one transaction especially because the sums are usually larger another indian bank might have a 10 m usd inflow they too will use the fx market selling 10 m usd for inr probably picking a different time to the first bank   so the rates will most likely differ apart from the obvious bid ask difference the dollar rate they charge you is an average of their rate achieved when buying the usd plus some commission for their forex brokerage plus probably some fee for the service accessing the global netting system is n't free the fees should be clearly and separately stated on your bank statement and so should be the fx rate back to the second example obviously since it 's a different bank handing over or or if it was your own bank they would have internally netted the incoming with the outgoing the rate will be different but it 's still a once a day transaction   from the you get they will subtract the average fx achieved rate the fx commissions and again the service fee for the global netting   the fees alone mean that the usd inr sell rate is different from the buy rate

the link provided by dumbcoder below is only relevant to uk resident investors and does not apply if you live in malaysia   i noticed that in a much older question you asked a similar question about taxes on us stocks so i 'll try and answer both situations here the answer is almost the same for any country you decide to invest in   as a foreign investor the country from which you purchase stock can not charge you tax on either income or capital gains taxation is based on residency so even when you purchase foreign stock its the tax laws of malaysia as your country of residence that matter at the time of writing malaysia does not levy any capital gains tax and there is no income tax charged on dividends so you wo n't have to declare or pay any tax on your stocks regardless of where you buy them from the only exception to this is dividend withholding tax which is a special tax taken by the government of the country you bought the stock from before it is paid to your account you do not need to declare this tax as it his already been taken by the time you receive your dividend the rate of that will be withheld is unique to each country   the uk does not have any withholding tax so you will always receive the full dividend on uk stocks   the withholding tax rate for the us is 30   other countries vary for most countries that do charge a withholding tax it is possible to have this reduced to 15 if there is a double taxation treaty in place between the two countries and all of the following are true note although the taxation rules of both countries are similar i am a resident of singapore not malaysia so i ca n't speak from first hand experience but current malaysia tax rates are easy to find online the rest of this information is common to any non us uk resident investor as long as you 're not a us person

first assuming you are making payments for a savings deposit   the present value of the deposit is the sum of the all the payments discounted to present value   in this case they would be discounted by the rate of inflation £ 100 deposited next year is worth less than £ 100 today because it will be eroded by inflation   with a higher rate of inflation the payments are discounted more heavily so the present value decreases   a deposit or annuity due see calculating the present value of an annuity due can be expressed mathematically like   by induction   so for example the following annuity has a present value of £ the total amount that will be paid for the annuity is 12 x £ 100 = £ 1,200   with a higher rate of inflation say 2 per month and with the same 12 x £ 100 payments the present value of the annuity decreases in excel £ a similar case is that for a loan or ordinary annuity see calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity except the discounting factor is the loan interest rate rather than inflation and repayments are made at the end of each period rather than at the start the present value of a loan is the value of the all the future repayments discounted to present value   with a higher interest rate the payments are discounted more heavily so the present value decreases   a loan can be expressed mathematically like   by induction   so for example the following values fulfill a loan worth £ the total amount that will be paid for the loan is 12 x £ 100 = £ 1,200   with a higher rate of interest say 2 per month and the same 12 x £ 100 repayments the present value of the loan that can be obtained decreases in excel £
