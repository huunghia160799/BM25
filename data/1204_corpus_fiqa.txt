i have heard that people say the greater earning means greater    intrinsic value of the company then the stock price is largely based    on the intrinsic value so increasing intrinsic value due to    increasing earning will lead to increasing stock price does this make    sense yes though it may be worth portions here as a company generates earnings it has various choices for what it can do with that money it can distribute some to shareholders in the form of dividends or re invest to generate more earnings what you 're discussing in the first part is those earnings that could be used to increase the perceived value of the company however there can be more than a few interpretations of how to compute a company 's intrinsic value and this is how one can have opinions ranging from companies being overvalued to undervalued overall of mines forests and would be an article giving examples that make things a bit more complex consider how would you evaluate a mine a forest or a farm where each gives a different structure to the cash flow this could be useful in running the numbers here

you would think that share prices is just a reflection of how well the company is doing but that is not always the case sometimes it reflects the investor confidence in the company more than the mere performance so for instance if some oil company causes some natural disaster by letting one of there oil tankers crash into a then investor confidence my take a big hit and share prices my fall even if the bottom line of the company was not all that effected

in general over the longer term this is true as a company whom continuously increases earnings year after year will generally continue to increase its share price year after year however many times when a company announces increased earning and profits the share price can actually go down in the short term this can be due to the market for example expecting a 20 increase but the company only announcing a 10 increase so the price can initially go down the market could already have priced in a higher increase in the lead up to the announcement and when the announcement is made it actually the market so the share price can go down instead of up

with the information you have given i would say never remember the banker is a salesman and the line of credit is the product if you do n't need to borrow the money for something specific then you do n't need the line of credit in the first place even if you did need something i would tell you to save up and pay cash for it on the tax advantage there is none in the us you can deduct your mortgage interest on your taxes but it 's not a tax credit it 's a tax deductions let me explain further you spend $ 10,000 on mortgage interest and you 're in the 25 tax bracket you send the bank $ 10,000 in return you get at tax savings of $ 2500 you are still in the hole $ 7500 you would have been better off not taking out the loan in the first place on the emergency fund you should have 3 6 months of expenses in cash like a money market account   this money is n't for investing it 's like insurance and you do n't make money on insurance the last thing you want to do is have to go into debt right in the middle of an emergency say you lost your job the last thing you would want to do is borrow money right at the time you have no income to pay it back the bank is under no obligation to maintain you credit limit and can without notice reduce it they can in most cases call the loan balance due in full with little or no notice as well both of those are likely scenarios if the bank were to become aware of the fact that you were unemployed

to summarize there are three basic ways 3 is the truly dangerous one if there is a lot of short interest in a stock but for some reason the stock goes up suddenly a lot of people will be scrambling to buy that stock to cover their short position which will drive the price up even further making the problem worse   pretty soon a bunch of smart rich guys will be poor guys who are suddenly very aware that they are n't as smart as they thought they were   eight years ago such a short squeeze as it 's called made the price of vw quadruple in two days   you could hear the from to there are ways to protect yourself of course   you can go short but also buy a call at a much higher price thereby limiting your exposure a strategy called a straddle but you also reduce your profit if you guessed right it comes down to as it always does do you want to eat well or to sleep well

when the inflation rate increases this tends to push up interest rates because of supply and demand if the interest rate is less than the inflation rate then putting your money in the bank means that you are losing value every day that it is there so there 's an incentive to withdraw your money and spend it now if say i 'm planning to buy a car and my savings are declining in real value then if i buy a car today i can get a better car than if i wait until tomorrow when interest rates are high compared to inflation the reverse is true my savings are increasing in value so the longer i leave my money in the bank the more it 's worth if i wait until tomorrow to buy a car i can get a better car than i would be able to buy today also people find alternative places to keep their savings if a savings account will result in me losing value every day my money is there then maybe i 'll put the money in the stock market or buy gold or whatever so for the banks to continue to get enough money to make loans they have to increase the interest rates they pay to lure customers back to the bank there is no reason per se for rising interest rates to consumers to directly cause an increase in the inflation rate inflation is caused by the money supply growing faster than the amount of goods and services produced interest rates are a cost if interest rates go up people will borrow less money and spend it on other things but that has no direct effect on the total money supply except you may note i put a bunch of in that paragraph in the united states the federal reserve loans money to banks it creates this money out of thin air so when the interest that the federal reserve charges to the banks is low the banks will borrow more from the feds as this money is created on the spot this adds to the money supply and thus contributes to inflation so if interest rates to consumers are low this encourages people to borrow more money from the banks which encourages the banks to borrow more from the feds which increases the money supply which increases inflation i do n't know much about how it works in other countries but i think it 's similar in most nations

you can choose to place lower buy limit orders but whether they get filled or not is not a given it depends on whether sellers care to accept your bid in your example of a 49.98 spread if you place a buy with limit of 49.99 it wo n't get filled if the order reaches the market while still at 49.98 immediately but will be added to the order book   by being added to the order book the markets bid and ask become 49.99   your order wo n't get filled until some seller places a market order or a sell limit order of 49.99 or less   no guarantee that that will happen and even if it does there 's nothing to say that your follow up buy at 49.98 will ever be filled   in fact your 49.98 buy order queues up at the end of the line behind all previously pending 49.98 bids since your order arrived after those other bids   since the initial conditions you supposed had a 49.98 bid such an order exists or at least did exist it might have been cancelled in the intervening moment basically your first buy at 49.99 if it happens has essentially no influence on whether your second buy at 49.98 will happen   you ca n't expect to move the market lower by making a bid that is higher 49.99 than the existing best bid 49.98   whatever influence your 49.99 order has is to raise the market 's price not lower it

i think the key to this question is your last sentence because it 's applicable to everyone high net worth or not how would one determine whether they are better off without insurance in general insurance is a net good when the coverage would prevent a catastrophic event if a catastrophic event does n't happen oh well you wasted money on insurance if it does happen you just saved yourself from bankruptcy these are two separate outcomes so taking the average cost of a catastrophic event and weighing that against the more expensive insurance premiums is not practical this is a way of reducing risk not of maximizing returns let the insurance company take the risk they benefit from having a pool of people paying premiums and you benefit because your own life has less financial risk now for something like cheap home electronics insurance is a bad idea this is because you now have a pool of potential risks and your own life experience could be close to the average expected result meaning you 'll pay more for insurance than you would just replacing broken things this answer is another good resource on the topic so to your question at what point in terms of net worth does someone 's house become equivalent to you and your toaster remember that if you have home fire insurance you are protecting the value of your house because that loss would be catastrophic to you but a high net worth individual would also likely find the loss of their house catastrophic unless they are billionaires with multiple mansions then it is quite likely that regardless of wealth a significant portion of their worth is tied up in their home even 10 of your net worth would be a substantial amount   as an example would someone worth $ 1 m have only a 100k home would someone worth $ 10 m have only a $ 1 m home depends on where they live and how similarly if you were worth $ 10 m you might not need extra insurance on your toyota camry but you might want it if you drive a $ 1 m ferrari not to mention that things like auto insurance may cover you for liability which could extend beyond the value of your car into medical and disability costs for anyone in an accident in fact being high net worth may make you more vulnerable to lawsuits making this insurance even more important in addition high net worth individuals have insurance that you or i have no need of things like insurance business operation insurance life insurance used to secure bank loans   so yes even high net worth individuals may fear catastrophic events and if they have so much money why would n't they pay to reduce that risk insurance provides a service to them the same as to everyone else it 's just that the items they consider too cheap too insure are more expensive than a toaster edit to counter concerns in some other answers which say that insurance is always a bad idea imagine you are in a esque episode of let 's make a deal hall shows you two parallel universes each with 100 doors you must choose your universe then choose a door the first universe is where you bought insurance and behind every door is a penalty of $ 200 the second universe is where you did n't buy insurance and behind 99 doors is nothing with one random door containing a penalty of $ 10,000 on average playing the game times you will come out ahead 2:1 by not buying insurance but you play the game only maybe 3 times in your life so which universe do you choose   now you might say i can cover the cost of a 10k penalty if it happens but this is exactly the point insurance unless already required by law is a net good when it covers catastrophic losses if you are wealthy enough to cover a particular loss you typically should n't buy that insurance that 's why no one should insure their toaster this is not a question of average returns it is a question of risk reduction

first thing to know about investing is that you make money by taking risks that means the possibility of losing money as well as making it   there are low risk investments that pretty much always pay out but they do n't earn much making $ 200 a month on $ 10,000 is about 26 per year   that 's vastly more than you are going to earn on low risk assets if you want that kind of return you can invest in a diversified portfolio of equities through an equity index fund   some years you may make 26 or more   other years you may make nothing or lose that much or more   on average you may earn maybe hopefully overall investing is a game of making money over long horizons   it 's very useful for putting away your $ 10k now and having hopefully more than that when it comes time to buy a house or retire or something some years into the future   you have to accept that you might also end up with less than $ 10 k in the end but you are more likely to make money than to use it what you describe does n't seem like a possible situation   in developed markets you ca n't reliably expect anything close to the return you desire from assets that are unlikely to lose you money   it might be time to re evaluate your financial goals   do you want spending money now or do you want to invest for use down the road

a cfd broker will let you open a trade on margin as long as your account balance is more than the margin required on all your open trades if the required margin increases within a certain percentage of your account balance you will get a margin call if you then do n't deposit more funds or close losing trades out the broker will close all your trades note your account balance is the remaining funds you have left to open new trades with i always use stop loss orders with all my open trades and because of this my broker reduces the amount of margin required on each trade this allows me to have more open trades at the one time without increasing my funds effects of a losing trade on margin say i have an account balance of $ 2,000 and open a long trade in a share cfd of 1,000 cfds with a share price of $ 10 and margin of 10 the face value of the shares would be $ 10,000 but my initial margin would be $ 1,000 10 of $ 10,000   if i do n't place a stop loss and the price falls to $ 9 i would have lost $ 1,000 and my remaining margin would now be $ 900 10 of $ 9,000 so i would have $ 100 balance remaining in my account i would probably receive a margin call to deposit more funds in or close out my trade if i do n't respond the broker will close out my position before my balance gets to $ 0 if instead i placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 my initial margin might be reduced to $ 500 as the price drops to $ i would have lost $ 400 and my remaining margin would now only be $ 100 with my account balance at $ 1,500 when the price drops to $ 9.50 i will get stopped out my trade will be closed and i would have lost $ 500 with my account balance still at $ 1,500 effects of a winning trade on margin say i have the same account balance as before and open the same trade but this time the price moves up if i do n't place a stop loss and the price goes up to $ 11 i would have made a $ 1,000 profit and my remaining margin will now be $ 1,100 10 of $ 11,000 so my account balance would now be $ 2,000 + $ 1,000 $ 1,100 = $ 1,900 if i had placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 again and the price moves up to $ 10.50 i would have made a profit of $ 500 and my margin would now be $ 1,000 my account balance would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 1,000 = $ 1,500 however if after the price went up to $ 10.50 i also moved my stop loss up to $ 10 then i would have $ 500 profit and only $ 500 margin so my balance in this case would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 500 = $ 2,000 so by using stop losses as part of your risk management you can reduce the margin used from your balance which will allow you to open more trades without any extra funds deposited into your account

summary the phrase short sale circuit breaker rule normally refers to the sec 's recent adoption of a new version of the uptick rule the new uptick rule triggers a ban on short selling when the stock drops a certain amount the sec defines the process like this the circuit breaker is triggered for a security any day the price declines by 10 or more from the prior day 's closing price the alternative uptick rule which permits short selling only if the price of the security is above the current national best the rule applies to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day in general the rule applies to all equities 1 the national best bid is usually the bid price that you see in level 1 data    example if a stock closed at $ 100/share on monday the circuit breaker would be triggered if the stock traded at or below $ during tuesday 's session short selling would be disallowed until the start of trading on thursday unless the short sell price is above the national best bid i.e. on an uptick purpose the stated purpose of this rule is promote market stability and preserve investor confidence by restricting potentially abusive short selling from driving prices farther downward during periods of increased volatility and downward price pressure whether or not such rules succeed is a matter of some debate and the sec removed similar uptick rules in 2006 because they modestly reduce liquidity and do not appear necessary to prevent manipulation exceptions there are a few exceptions to the uptick rule that mainly revolve around when the short sell order was placed or when the securities will be delivered

economics will generally be more respected if it is a bachelors of science the bs will have in general more quantitative coursework as compared to a ba the reason that economics phds are often valued is for their quantitative skills hence why you have heard the economics ba can be a useless major this is not entirely true it can be a great start to a law or government career personally i paired an economics degree with mathematics to get a strong quant skillset    the truth is economics has little practical application in business and if you are truly interested in business that would be the best major to acquire well rounded skills in that area while you may learn some strategy and high level finance in an economics program you will know little about marketing accounting operations and other more nuanced areas

the treatment of employees has found a new low with the use of technology i was especially appalled by juice who schedules down to 15 minute increments with part time employees their rational is that it saves the company money and their employees do not have energy and during the second half of a shift   i own my company and have had the same employees for over 24 years through good times and bad they have always given me superior work with 150 effort clients ask me how i retain these great people here is the secret it is in the form of a story   two dog teams are in a race in the wilderness of alaska food is low and conditions are bad every night one of the made sure his dogs were feed and down first before he took care of himself with what little was left he loved his dogs and cared about his dogs well being every morning the dogs got up and pulled the through the deep snow they brought their master to the end of the race and saved his life    every night the other feed himself first and made sure he was warm after that he took care of his dogs with what little was left some of his dogs eventually ran away and some of his dogs died there were not enough dogs left to pull the and the froze to death in the alaska wilderness some of the last dogs ate him to survive   i doubt ms and ms from juice will grasp the moral of this story i am sure their turn over of employees is very high and the true cost of retraining new employees is not factored in to their fantastic business plan i find my clients are well pleased in part because they are assured they will have the services of my same employees who they know and trust to do a great job my employees have increased my business and its bottom line   advice to ms. and ms. 1 you best be and enthusiastic in the afternoon or a computer program may tell your boss to you and cut your pay 2 you better hope company is not hired by juice to create a program which does your jobs better and your services are no longer needed 3 watch your back and if you feel someone chewing on your leg you now know the reason why

going by the information from goods and services tax gst on the australian government website there seem to be a number of possibilities note first i am neither a tax expert nor a lawyer this is simply my interpretation of the rules on the page linked above second this interpretation is based on the assumption that a service means you at least technically buy the service from another company and sell it on to the users of your app depending on the nature of the service and possibly factors such as whether you are deemed to take possession during the transaction it might be that different rules apply your turnover is under 75,000 providing you 're not reselling taxi services you wo n't need to register for gst should not charge it and your invoices should show that gst was not included in the price however if the turnover of the company whose services you are reselling is registered for gst they will be charging you gst that you will not be able to claim back so you would need to factor this into the price you charge your users before any promotional discount for example your turnover is over 75,000 if your turnover is above the limit you would need to charge gst on the final sale amount and pay this amount one of the price your customer paid to the australian government you also have to send out properly formatted tax invoices however it 's probably safe to say the company you are buying the original service from will also be over the gst threshold so you should be able to reclaim the gst that was charged to you by them   for example here your overall profit loss is helped by the fact that you can reclaim the gst you were charged and can under some circumstances result in an overall rebate these figures assume you add 10 to your selling price to cover the gst you have to pay the government however this may make your offering uncompetitive so you may have to absorb some all of the gst yourself

as your main concern seems to be that you are not sure whether you can ever get a house and actually support the expenses it incurs when you have one here is a very simple answer   you say you are currently decreasing your creditcard debt by 2k per month at that rate it will be finished within 2 years try to pay it off completely if this succeeds in the next 2 years you can be confident that you can afford a 500k house paying back 50k high interest debt in 2 years is very roughly equivalent to back 500k low interest debt over 20 years a reasonable time period in my environment so just pay back the creditcard as fast as you can if two years sounds like a long time there is nothing stopping you to pay it back a little bit faster even   note this is written under the assumption that your student loan burden will not increase over time

these unclaimed wages were presumably yours for the taking in year x when employer paid your other wages   maybe this is just about uncashed paychecks   in that case they would have appeared on your w-2 for that year   if you filed your return including that w-2 income then this is likely not new income this would be a constructive receipt evaluation   income occurs when you have the right to income whether or not you have actual receipt of it   for example if you are paid via cash drops into a piggy bank but you wait a week for the start of a new tax period to withdraw your cash from the piggy bank then the money was constructively received on the day it went into the piggy bank   this prevents taxpayers from structuring their actual receipt of income for tax purposes or otherwise in ways at odds with their true economic position   you ca n't delay taxable income that is legally yours simply by refusing to accept it when you have the right to it the wages were income at the time your employer the paycheck   you did not cash it but i suspect that you filed it on that year 's taxes   there 's a slight wrinkle that when the check went stale your ability to access the money was not so straightforward   however you still had the legal right to the money so my perspective is that the analysis did not change when the check went stale

all other factors being equal owning your primary residence is almost always a good investment over the long haul why because you have to live somewhere and rentals especially long term leases that are important when you have kids in school etc   are generally in the same ballpark as a mortgage in most markets giving $ 1,500 to a landlord gets me 30 days of living somewhere giving $ 1,500 to the bank gets me a place to live and equity in an asset which requires maintenance but always has intrinsic value   detroit is one extreme manhattan or silicon valley is another real estate extreme everywhere else is somewhere in the middle what is n't always a good investment is speculating in highly elastic investment property like vacation condos as an amateur it 's a cyclical market but our attention spans are too short to realize that as most of the other answers to this question indicate people tend to be down in the dumps and see all of the problems with real estate when the market is not very good conversely people only see the upside and are oblivious to problems when the market is high

before going into specific investments i think it would be a good idea to assess how free is that $ 5000 how much do you have to rely on it in emergency you always want to buy low and sell high however if you need to make unplanned withdraw from an investment you risk unfavorable market conditions at the time when you need the money and lose money that way one common suggestion is to keep 3 6 months living expense in checking saving very very liquid short term investments after that you can invest the rest in more profitable ventures   assuming that you are all set in that regard next consideration is whether you have any goal for the money besides generating the maximum return is this for retirement buying a house apartment a few year down the road graduate school emergency cash store for the time between graduation and getting a job or traveling a year in europe after graduation there are myriad of other possible goals knowing that you get a better idea of the time frame involved in the investment and what you need to do with your money if this is for retirement you just need to generate the highest possible return for 40 50 years while minimize taxes when you have to withdraw that money there are more nuanced concerns but large idea wise that 's what you need to do if you want it for a trip to an exotic location in 2 year then your primary goal will be to preserve the value of your capital while assessing whether you need to manage foreign exchange risk   the time frame also rule in or rule out certain types of investments if you are planning to use the money to purchase a house in 5 years iras probably would not be what you are looking for if you are planning to retirement short term cd would not be the most effective way after figuring out a bit of what you are trying to do with the money i think how you want to invest it will be much more clear to you in case of retirement people seem to generally recommend no load index funds and mid cap growth funds nothing is really off the table since your investment time frame is so long and you can tolerate risk you might also be interested to check out i have no relation with them a friend recommended it to me and i think their pitch make sense   in other cases it really is case dependent and there might have more than one solution to any case there is just one more potential investment venture that people you might not immediately thinking of and that might be of interest to you that is to use the $ 5000 as your own budget to build maintain connections with people and network use it to take professors out to a meal to pick their brain travel to keep in touch with old friends network with potential future employers and peers to improve job prospect or get opportunities to meet interesting people   i hope this helps

during world war ii the united states us instituted wage and price controls   to attract better employees companies would offer benefits to get around salary limits   health insurance was one of the more successful benefits    at that time income taxes were newer and there were many ways to evade them   companies could generally deduct expenses   so at that time health care was deductible because everything was   and at that time only wages were taxable compensation from employer to employee    since that time many other benefits have become non deductible for employers e.g. housing or the reduced deduction for meals and entertainment   but health care is generally regarded as different as a necessity   while everyone needs to eat not everyone needs to eat at a $ 100 a meal restaurant   people who need expensive health care really need it   people who eat expensive food just prefer it    and of course health care is more intermittent where food is relatively consistent   you do n't need ten thousand calories one day and zero the next   but some families have no health care expenses in a year while another might have cancer or a pregnancy   note that medical care expenses can be deducted for individuals if they are large enough in aggregate and you itemize    and of course both businesses and workers have incentives to maintain the current system with deductibility   health insurance is a common benefit   housing is not although it 's worth noting that travel housing and meals are deductible   so there have been few people impacted by making housing taxable while many people would be impacted by taxable health insurance    you can deduct health insurance costs if self employed   it 's also not true that health insurance is the only benefit with preferential tax treatment   retirement and child care are also deductible   even meals and housing can be deducted in certain circumstances   the complex rules about what and how much is deductible    there have been about the tax treatment of health insurance and medical care but there is a lot of opposition   insurance companies oppose making all healthcare expenses deductible as that reduces their effective benefit   they would prefer only insurance premiums be deductible   traditionally employed individuals oppose making health insurance taxable as that would increase their taxes   so the situation persists   there is n't quite enough support to move in either direction although the current compromise is economically silly

gt;well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable   yes there is an aspect of it that i think is the equivalent to ocean there are winds and waves of fortune which are often mistaken as entirely due to merit when in fact the merit may have been only a minor factor   gt;as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    i 'd agree   i 've looked into and decided to pass on the whole buy up a bunch of homes amp rent them out line   there was definitely an opportunity with foreclosure distressed sale properties in the area but after and seeking advice from several experienced landlords i have concluded that it is not the risk free passive income mechanism that a lot of think it is and there is substantial risk effort involved both in the form of capital investment repairs maintenance requiring both time amp money as well as the probability of an interrupted revenue steam bad renters are difficult expensive to deal with as well as other costs significantly increased property taxes especially on rentals etc   the truly big gains to my understanding anyway of being a landlord are the windfall cash out phase where having had renters paying the mortgage interest you get the benefit of the capital gain on the sale of the property but due to what i think and sincerely believe based on the of boomer die off i am fairly certain that said payoff will not be anywhere near as large in the coming decades as it has been in the past if the payoff even exists at all and is n't a net loss especially in light of the work effort investment involved   will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    depends on what you mean by stocks the overall market is one thing specific stocks can be quite a different story while it is an extreme example note the dramatic difference between aapl vs the dow during the past = = = = nasdaq etc   basically the whole idea of passive mindless set it and forget it gains from investments being the path to wealth has to go bye bye it was never really real to begin with unless you timed the market just right and the vast majority of the gains were nominal anyway   gt;for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    i guess i take the long term historical view that the very concept of some guaranteed retirement was simply an a lucky generation or two got away with it by accident in the timing of their birth something they really had no input into   instead i think one will always need to be working in some manner or another actively overseeing ones investments and remaining agile in response   and of course there is risk involved in that as if there is really any reason we should expect there not to be anyone who thinks that way imo is simply ignorant of the vast scope of human history   the best i think one can do is to truly diversify and that does not mean mutual funds to separate your eggs into various baskets holding some major part in solid as solid as can be form even with the possibility of zero return and/or some loss i.e. owning primary housing clear of debt some pm 's in physical form etc having other assets in what are fairly solid bets based on demographic trends company quality etc and then some things several small bets that are long shots but potentially high return things where just one win can not only offset a dozen non performers losers but gain you a substantial real profit   basically i think one has to use their mind and available information which must be actively sought out and seriously analyzed considered and then even with all of that realize that there is a certain crap shoot aspect to everything and that big winners are just as often either scam artists who often get their think enron or who are just lucky shits who were in the right place at the right time were dealt the right cards and subsequently made the right bets due to wiki and other biases we just do n't often hear about the ones who hit 4 out of 5 of those things and who might have still been winners but just not large prominent enough to gain fame amp recognition much less the 3 out of 5 whose gains were minimal or a wash

it would be unusual but it is possible that the expenses could be very high compared to your income the irs in pub 529 explains the deduction you can deduct only unreimbursed employee expenses that are paid or incurred during your tax year for carrying on your trade or business of being an employee and ordinary and necessary an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade    business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate    and helpful to your business an expense does n't have to be required    to be considered necessary the next part lists examples i have cut the list down to highlight ones that could be large you may be able to deduct the following items as unreimbursed employee    expenses damages paid to a former employer for breach of an employment contract job search expenses in your present occupation legal fees related to your job licenses and regulatory fees malpractice insurance premiums research expenses of a college professor rural mail carriers vehicle expenses tools and supplies used in your work work clothes and uniforms if required and not suitable for everyday use work related education if the term of employment was only part of the year one or more of the these could dwarf your income for the year before deducting something that large be sure you can document it i believe the irs computers would flag the return and i would n't be surprised if they ask for additional proof

there are a few situations in which it may be advantageous to exercise early wikipedia actually has a good explanation option style difference in value to account for the american 's higher value there must be some    situations in which it is optimal to exercise the american option    before the expiration date this can arise in several ways such as an in the money itm call option on a stock is often exercised just    before the stock pays a dividend that would lower its value by more    than the option 's remaining time value   a put option will usually be    exercised early if the underlying asset files for   a deep itm currency option fx option where the strike currency has a    lower interest rate than the currency to be received will often be    exercised early because the time value sacrificed is less valuable    than the expected depreciation of the received currency against the    strike   an american bond option on the dirty price of a bond such as    some convertible bonds may be exercised immediately if itm and a    coupon is due   a put option on gold will be exercised early when deep    itm because gold tends to hold its value whereas the currency used as    the strike is often expected to lose value through inflation if the    holder waits until final maturity to exercise the option they will    almost certainly exercise a contract deep itm minimizing its time    needed

the good debt bad debt paradigm only applies if you are considering this as a pure investment situation and not factoring in a house is something you live in and a car is something you use for transportation these are not substitutes for each other while you can live in your car in a pinch you ca n't take your house to the shops looking at the car i will simplify it to 3 options you can now make a list of pros and cons for each one and decide the value you place on each of them e.g. public transport will add travel time per week $ x per hour how much you value your leisure time an expensive car will make me feel good and i value that at $ y. for each option put all the benefits together this is the value of that option to you then put all of the costs together this is what the option costs you then make a decision on which is the best value for you   once you have decided which option is best for you then you can consider how you will fund it

to optimize your return on investment you need to buy low and sell high   if you knew that one stock had hit rock bottom and the others had not buying the low stock would be the best however unless you can predict the future you do n't know if any individual stock has hit the bottom or if it will continue to drop if you decide to spend the same amount of money each month on stock purchases then when the price is low you will automatically buy more shares and when the price is high you will buy fewer shares   this strategy is sometimes called dollar cost averaging   it eliminates the need to predict the future to optimize your buying all that having been said i agree with that at the investment amount that you are talking about and the per transaction fee you listed a monthly investment in several stocks will cause you to lose quite a bit to transaction fees   it sounds like you need a different strategy

i need to see the policy you are referring to give a more accurate answer however what could be happening it ’s again the way these instruments are structured for example if the insurance premium is say 11,000 of which 1000 is toward expenses and term insurance amount the balance 10,000 is invested in growth the promise is that this will grow max of 9.5 and never below zero ie say if we are talking only about a year you can get anything between 10,000 to   the s p long term average return is in the range of 12 -15 i do n't remember correctly so the company by capping it at 9.5 is on average basis making a profit of 2.5 to 5.5 ie in a good year say the s p return is around 18 the company has pocketed close to 9 more money    on a bad year say the index gave a return of say 5 the insurance company would take this loss out of the good years if say when your policy at the s p for that year has given poor returns you would automatically get less returns   typically one enters into life insurance on a long term horizon and hence the long term averages should be used as a better reference and going by that one would make more money just by investing this in an index directly as you whether you want to invest in such a scheme should be your judgment in my opinion i prefer to stay away from things that are not transparent

economically you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes they are largely separate markets   only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is sticky for example once you buy a house prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment in both markets there is a supply and demand curve but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals the market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house   most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market   this describes a supply demand graph with a very steep demand curve   additionally because of the leverage provided by mortgages the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans   thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change on the other hand apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parent 's easily move into apartments if prices change   a small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded   this is the situation where the demand curve is shallow   in addition rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions in a recession people avoid buying but renters continue to rent

to me this sounds like a transaction where e already owns a company worth 400k and can therefore pocket the money from d and give d 25 of the profits every year there is nothing objective like a piece of paper that states the company is worth 400k. it is all about perceived value some investors may think it is worth something because of some knowledge they may have heck the company could be worth nothing but the investor could have some sentimental value associated to it so is it actually the case that e 's company is worth 400k only after the transaction it is worth what someone pays for it when they pay for it i the 400 k valuation is subjective in return the investor is getting 25 ownership of the product or company the idea is that when someone has ownership they have a vested interest in it being successful in that case the investor will do whatever he she can to improve the chances of success in addition to supplying the 100 k capital for instance the investor will leverage their network or perhaps put more money into it in the future is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash perhaps it is an asset that may later be used to fund inventory for instance and would the other 300k be listed as an ip asset no see what i said about the valuation just being perception note that the above analysis does n't apply to all dragons den deals it only applies to situations where capital is exchanged for ownership in the form of equity

i know this is heresy but if you have funds for significantly more    than 6 months of expenses let 's say 12 months how risky would it be    to put it all into stock index funds quite risky as if you do need to dip into it how fast could you get the cash also do you realize the tax implications when you do sell the shares should you have an emergency in the worst case scenario let 's say you have a financial emergency    at the same time the stock market crashes and loses half its value    you could still liquidate the rest and have sufficient funds for 6    months am i underestimating the risks of this strategy that 's not worst case scenario though worst case scenario would be another 9/11 where the markets are closed for nearly a week and you need the money but ca n't get the funds converted to cash in the bank that you can use this is in addition to the potential wait for a settlement in the case of using etfs if you choose to go that way in the case of money market funds cds and other near cash equivalents these can be accessed relatively easily which is part of the point a approach where some cash is kept in house some in accounts that can easily accessed and some in other investments may make sense though the breakdown would differ depending on how much risk people are willing to take if it truly is an emergency fund then the odds of needing it should be    very slim so why live with near zero return on that money something to consider is what is called an emergency here for some people a sudden $ 1,000 bill to fix their car that just broke down is an emergency for others there could be emergency trips to visit family that may have gotten into accidents or gotten a diagnosis that they may pass away soon consider what do you want to call an emergency here as chances are you may not be considering all that people would think is an emergency there is the question of what other sources of money do you have to cover should issues arise

stop loss orders are the exact opposite of what you should be doing if you are implementing a long term buy and hold strategy the motivation of a buy and hold strategy is that in the long term the market rises even despite the occasional crash or recession setting a stop loss simply increases the probability that you will sell for a low price in a temporary market downturn unless you are likely to need near term liquidity in which case you 're not a long term investor that makes no sense

you are right it is a ponzi scheme unless it pays all of the profits as dividends here 's why today 's millenials are saving a lot less and instead they choose to be spenders it 's just that their mentality is different if the trend continues there will be more spenders and less savers   that means that in 20 years from now a company might sell more and make more profits but because there are less investors on the market it will worth less judging by supply and demand this has to be true   does n't that seem like a disconnect to you guys does n't that just prove that all those profits are not really yours but instead you 're just sitting on the side making bets about them if i own a company from the point where it goes public and while the value goes up i hold on to it for 50 years let 's say for 45 years it made tons of profits but never paid a cent in dividend and then in 5 years it goes out of business what happened to all the profits they made throughout the 45 years   if you owned a restaurant that made a profit for 45 years and then went bankrupt you are fine you took your profits every year because why on earth would you reinvest 100 of the profit forever but what if you could sell of that restaurant on the stock market get all of that ipo money and still keep all of the profits while claiming that you reinvest it forever that 's exactly what they do they just buy expensive things for personal use from fancy cars to private jets they just write it down as an investment and you ca n't see what the money was spent on because you are not a majority stakeholder you have no power it was not like this forever companies used to pay all of their profits in dividends and be valued according to that not anymore now they are just in it for the growth it will keep growing as long as people keep buying into it and that 's the exact definition of a ponzi scheme

you probably want to think about pools of money separately if they have separate time horizons or are otherwise not interchangeable a classic example is your emergency fund which has a potentially immediate time horizon vs. your retirement savings the emergency fund would be all in cash or very short term bonds and would not count in your retirement asset allocation since the emergency fund usually has a capped value a certain amount of money you want to have for emergencies rather than a percentage of net worth value this especially makes sense you have to treat the emergency fund separately or you 'd have to keep changing your asset allocation percentages as your net worth rises hopefully with respect to the capped emergency amount similarly say you are saving for a car in 3 years you 'd probably invest that money very conservatively also it could not go in tax deferred retirement accounts and when you buy the car the account will go to zero so probably worth treating this separately on the other hand say you have some savings in tax deferred retirement accounts and some in taxable accounts but in both cases you 're expecting to use the money for retirement in that case you have the same time horizon and goals and it can pay to think about the taxable and nontaxable accounts as a whole in particular you can use asset location put less tax efficient assets in tax deferred accounts in this case maybe you would end up with mostly bonds in the tax deferred accounts and mostly equities in the taxable accounts for tax reasons the asset allocation would only make sense considering all the accounts since the taxable account would be too equity heavy and the tax deferred one too bond heavy there can be practical reasons to treat each account separately too though for example if your broker has a convenient automatic rebalancing tool on their website it probably only works within an account treating each account by itself would let you use the automatic rebalancing feature on the website while a more complicated asset location strategy where you rebalance across multiple accounts might be too hard and in practice you would n't get around to it getting around to rebalancing could be more important than tax motivated asset location you could also take a keep it simple attitude as long as your asset allocation is pretty balanced say 40 bonds and includes a cash allocation that would cover emergencies you could just put all your money in one big portfolio and think of it as a whole if you have an emergency withdraw from the cash allocation and then rebuild it over time if you have a major purchase you could redeem some bonds and then rebuild the bond portion over time when i say over time i 'm thinking you might start putting new contributions into the now assets or you might dollar cost average back into them by selling bits of the now assets anyway there 's no absolute rule it depends on what 's simple enough to be manageable for you in practice and what separate shorter horizon investing goals you have in addition to retirement you can always make things complex but remember that a simple plan that happens in real life is better than a complex plan you do n't keep up with in practice or a complex plan that takes away from activities you 'd enjoy more

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

hoping to get these questions answered by all probably geared more towards someone who has experience with a retailer   when a store physically closes does that effect business in that surrounding area this is kind of a branding issue i guess and or do online sales noticeably decline in that area   i got curious from this because i ’ve always noticed that l brands operates victoria ’s secret amp bath and body works seems to be in many malls even failing ones i ’ve since learned that this is actually their business model but why would they have high rates of return if they were online increases in damages hard to resell shower gel and even if you do n’t know if they were used   or for specialty retailers is it important to the brand that they have a physical location for brand recognition   thanks to anyone for their time

being a tax professional my understanding is that the threshold limit is a single limit for all your of income now many people who already draw salary which is liable to tax develop application for mobile and generate some income such income is liable to tax if along with other income they exceed the threshold limit   income will have surely related expenses and the expenses which are related to earning of the income are allowed to be deducted

i do n't recommend balance transfers like many credit card things they distract you with shiny 0 percent interest and you on a balance transfer fee   if you have a decent credit score and working relationship talk to banks about opening what 's called a signature loan and use that to shift the debt to a lower rate a local credit union advertises rates as low as 9.75 percent which is itself a shiny that you may not qualify for   the really low loans rates you see are secured loans if you do n't pay they can take the collateral

as pointed out they usually mean libor or the ffr or for other countries the equivalent risk free rate of interest i will just like to add on to what everyone has said here and will like to explain how various interest rates you mentioned work out when the risk free rate moves for let 's denote the risk free rate by rf the savings account interest rate as rs a mortgage interest rate as and a term deposit rate with the bank as savings account interest rate when a central bank the overnight lending rate or the prime rate repo rate etc in some countries banks are not obliged to increase the savings account interest rate usually a downward revision will force them to lower it because they net they will be paying out = rf rs on the other hand if rf goes up and if one of the banks increases the rs then other banks may be forced to do so too under competitive pressure in some countries the central bank has the authority to revise rs without the overnight lending rate term deposits with the bank or certificates of deposit usually movements in these rates are more in sync with rf than rs is the chief difference is that savings account offer more liquidity than term deposits and hence banks can offer lower rates and still get deposits under them the higher interest rate offered by the term deposit as a liquidity risk premium generally interest rates paid by instruments of similar risk profile that offer similar liquidity will move in parallel otherwise there can be arbitrage sometimes these rates can move to anticipate a future change in rf mortgage loan rates or other interests that you pay to the bank if the risk free rate goes up banks will increase these rates to keep the net interest they earn over risk free (= = rf the same if rf drops and if banks are not obliged to decrease loan rates then they will only do so if one of the banks does it first wherever i have said they will do so when one of the banks does it first i am not referring to a but merely to the competitive market theory under such a theory the first one to cut down the profit margin usually has a strong business incentive to do so e.g. gain market share or eliminate competition by lowering profit margins etc others are forced to follow the trend

typically preferred shares come with one or both different benefits a disproportionate share of votes say 10 votes per share vs the normal 1 or a preferred dividend   the vote preference is great for the owner(s looking to go public but not lose control of the company say i am a walton of walmart fame and when i went public i sold 80 of the 1000 share total company but in creating the share structure 20 of shares were assigned 10 votes each 800 shares now trade with 800 votes 200 shares have 10 votes each or 2000 votes so there are still the 1000 shares but 2800 votes the 20 of shares now have or 71 of the total votes so my shares are just less than half ownership but over 78 of votes   preferred dividend is as simple as that buy stock a for ownership or same company stock a preferred shares which have ownership and $ dividend   edited to show a bit more math i use a simple example to call out a total 1000 shares the percentages would be the same for a million or billion shares if 20 were a 10 vote preferred

everything that i 'm saying presumes that you 're young and wo n't need your money back for 20 + years and that you 're going to invest additional money in the future your first investments should never be individual stocks that is far too risky until you have a lot more experience in the market once you absolutely ca n't resist keep it to under 5 of your total investments that lets you experiment without damaging your returns too much instead you would want to invest in one or more mutual funds of some sort which spreads out your investment across many companies with only $ 50 avoiding a trading commission is paramount if you were in the us i would recommend opening a free online brokerage account and then purchasing a no load commission free mutual fund td ameritrade for example publishes a list of the funds that you can purchase without commission the lists generally include the type of fund index growth value etc and its record of return i do n't know if europe has the same kind of discount brokerages mutual funds the us has but i 'd be a little surprised if it did n't you may or may not be able to invest until you first scrape together a $ 500 minimum but the brokerages often have special programs accounts for people just starting out it should be possible to ask one more thing on picking a fund most charge about a 1 annual expense ratio that means that a $ 100 investment that had a 100 gain after one year would net you $ instead of $ 200 because 1 of the value of your asset $ 200 is $ 2 the math is much more complicated and depends on the value of your investment at every given point during the year but that 's the basic idea however there are index funds that track the market automatically and they can have much lower expense fees 0.05 vs 1 for the same quality of performance over 40 years the expense ratio can have a surprisingly large impact on your net return even 20 or more you 'll want to google separately about the right way to pick a low expense index fund your online brokerage may also be able to help finally ask friends or family what mutual funds they 've invested in how they chose those funds and what their experience has been the point is not to have them tell you what to do but for you to learn from the mistakes and successes of other experienced investors with whom you can follow up

brokerage firms are required to report the number of shares being shorted   this information is reported to the exchange nyse of nasdaq and is made public   most financial sites indicate the number of shares being shorted for a particular stock   the image below from yahoo finance shows million shares of cmg were being shorted at the close of 9 28 2012   this is over 12 of the total outstanding shares of cmg   for naked short selling additional information is tracked   if the brokerage is unable to borrow shares to deliver before the settlement date of a short sale then the transaction is recorded as fails to deliver   no money or shares are exchanged since the brokerage is unable to deliver the shares that were agreed upon   a large amount of fails to deliver transactions for a stock usually indicates an excessive amount of naked shorting   when investors and brokerage firms start to aggressively short a stock they will do so without having borrowed the shares to sell   this will result in a large amount of naked short selling   when there are a large number of naked short sellers not all the sellers will be able to borrow the necessary shares before the settlement date and many fails to deliver transactions will be recorded the sec records the number of fails to deliver transactions the table below summarizes the fails to deliver transactions from 1 1 2012 through 9 14 2012 data obtained from here the ext amount column shows the total dollar value of the transactions that failed i.e. fail qty share price   the volume column is the total number of shares traded in the same time period   the volume shows the percentage of shares that failed to deliver as a percentage of the total market volume the table orders the data in descending order by the quantity of shares that were not delivered   most of the companies at the top of the list no longer exist   for many of these companies the quantity of shares that failed to deliver where many multiples of the number of shares traded during the same time period   this indicates massive naked short selling as many brokerages where unable to find shares to borrow before the settlement date more information here

the independent contractor vs. employee distinction is a red herring to this discussion and not at all important just because someone suggested you use your llc to do the job is a very common way to do contracting and having an llc with business bank accounts provides you with more tax deductions such as deducting interest on credit lines some accounting practices prefer to pay entities by their tax id numbers instead of an individual 's social security number the actual reasoning behind this would be dubious but the llc only benefits you and gives you more advantages by having one than not for example it is easier for you to hire subcontractors through your llc to assist with your job due to the of the private entity similarly your llc can sign non disclosure and intellectual property agreements automatically extending the trade secrets to all of its members as opposed to just you as an individual by signing whatever agreement with the company that is paying you through your llc your llc will be privy to all of this next assuming you did have subcontractors or other liability inducing assets the llc limits the liability you personally have to deal with in a court system to an extent but even if you did n't the of an llc can deter potential creditors for example your client may just assume you are a in a wheel a random employee of the llc as opposed to the sole owner having a business account for the llc keeps all of your expenses in one account statement making your tax deductions easier if you had a business credit line the interest is tax deductible compared to just having a personal credit card for business purposes regarding the time costs of setting up and managing an llc this does vary by jurisdiction it can negligible or it can be complex you also only have to do it once hire an attorney to give you a head start on that if you feel that is necessary now back to the independent contractor vs. employee distinction it is true that the client will not be paying your social security but they expect you to charge more hourly than an equivalent actual employee would solely because you do n't get health insurance from them or paid leave or retirement plans or any other perk and you will receive the entire paycheck without any withheld by the employer you also get more tax deductions to utilize although you will now have self employment tax assuming you are a us citizen this becomes less and less important the higher over $ you make as it stops being counted slightly more complicated than that but self employment tax is it 's own discussion

thanks for the feedback    the cost is $ 20,000 to 50,000 sqft    ya i am just looking for a rough idea of what a similar newer building is costing i figured what we are paying is really high as the building is extremely old and designated as a heritage site so we ca n't just knock it down beautiful building just not very efficient    the newer building is the route i think we are gon na end up going not sure what we can do with the current building as not too many options for resale we ca n't adjust the lease rates to compensate for the cost as the tenants are all seniors and it is an integrated care home a change to apartments would prove difficult as there are no kitchens in 90 of the suites   we are currently paying approximately $ 0.40 a month to heat all electric and the estimate for the new building is $ so it is a pretty huge impact in comparison if it is possible but i have n't heard of a real building actually costing that little before    thanks for the suggestion for the ir i think i am gon na get some one in after the holidays to do a inspection to see if there is any short term fixes we can do with our system

thanks for your additional comments sam that is helpful here is an overview of what you can and can not do with an fsa as it applies to your situation the government intends that a general health fsa be used to cover expenses that are usually out of pocket when you are covered by a qualifying health plan it is funded with pre tax dollars and is on a use it or lose it basis however an hsa is itself a form of health coverage that is tax advantaged and the balance can be invested because of this an hsa is not considered by the government to be a health plan that qualifies for use with a general health fsa however this means that a given covered person can not have both of these simultaneously in your wife 's case if you have an hsa and she has traditional health benefits with an fsa this is not considered a problem since she can only use the fsa money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan however if she were to join you on the hsa which sounds like it could be a good idea overall she would need to wind down her fsa and would not be able to fund it for the next year this could be a problem if you have a lot of money in the fsa that she is n't able to spend prior to joining the hsa the reason why the government does n't want one given person covered by both an hsa and given access to an fsa at the same time is that they are both tax advantaged what they intend is that people can set aside money pre tax which they will use to pay their non covered health expenses if someone had both there would be two potential problems if you do ultimately want your wife to be on the hsa see if you can spend what is left in her fsa as it will end when she ends her health coverage with her employer if the amount you stand to lose is significant you may need to wait another year until your next open enrollment period or life event such as the birth of a child to enroll her on your hsa it is also likely that her premium on the hsa will be lower which could impact the effect of ending her fsa recently there has also been a rule change regarding what is called a limited use fsa these are fsas that are used for qualifying expenses such as dental and vision that can be used together with an hsa this may be something that is helpful to you and/or your wife on the hsa if your employer offers this as a possibility please note that unlike retirement accounts you can not rollover funds between fsa plans offered by two different employers as each fsa is a separate benefit fund that is on a use it or lose it basis again because the government wants to restrict tax advantaged contributions to what you are likely to spend you may also find the article here helpful to learn more about fsa hsa combinations and limited use fsas i hope this helps

the idea of education has never been to make stupid people smarter but to make uneducated people educated and ready to serve a greater good as an educated worker and member of the political spectrum   comparative economics tells us that as the manufacturing jobs that used to be in the us move overseas and equalize the wealth of the world with the people working to receive it as this happens jobs in manufacturing will leave the us and their educated and formerly employed workers with it my suggestion is that microsoft takes the already educated and gives them training to function in a new career in return for guaranteed service in the job they have been trained for there is no need to revamp any education system here but only to start a training program which microsoft would benefit greatly from

this has never really adequately explained it for me and i 've tried reading up on it all over the place for a long time i thought that in a trade the market maker pockets the spread for that trade but that 's not the case   the only sensible explanation i 've found which i 'm not going to give in full is that the market maker will provide liquidity by buying and selling trades they have no actual view on short or long and if the spread is higher that contributes directly to the amount they make over time when they open and close positions they 've made   it would be great to see a single definitive example somewhere that shows how a market maker makes money

is playing the lottery a wise investment not   is playing the lottery an investment at all not though i 'll make a remark on that further below   does it make any sense to play the lottery in order to improve your total asset allocation you follow the theory of the black swan it actually might   let me elaborate the black swan theory says that events that we consider extremely improbable can have an extreme impact so extreme in fact that its value would massively outweigh the combined value of all impacts of all probable events together in statistical terms we are speaking about events on the outer limits of the common distribution so called outliers that have a high impact   example if you invest $ 2000 on the stock market today stay invested for 20 years and reinvest all earnings it is probable within a 66 confidence interval that you will have an 8 expected return er per year on average giving you a total of roughly $ that 's very much simplified of course the actual number can be very different depending on the deviations from the er and when they happen now let 's take the same $ 2000 and buy weekly lottery tickets for 20 years for the sake of simplicity i will forgo an npv calculation and assume one ticket costs roughly $ 2 if you should win which would be an entirely improbable event your winnings would by far outweigh your er from investing the same amount   when making models that should be mathematically these outliers are usually not taken into consideration standard portfolio management pm theory is only working within so called confidence intervals up to 99 everything else just would n't be practical in other words if there is not at least a 1 probability a certain outcome will happen we 'll ignore it in practice most analysts take even smaller confidence intervals so they ignore even more   that 's the reason though why no object that would fall within the of this outer limit is an investment in terms of the pm theory or at least not a one having said all that it still might improve your position if you add a lottery ticket to the mix the black swan theory specifically does not only apply to the risk side of things but also on the chance side so while standard pm theory would not consider the lottery ticket an investment thus not accept it into the asset allocation the black swan theory would appreciate the fact that there is minimal chance of huge success   still in terms of valuation it follows the pm theory the lottery ticket while it could be part of some investment balance sheet would have to be written off to 0 immediately and no expected value would be attached to it consequently such an investment or gamble only makes sense if your other safe investments give you so much income that you can easily afford it really without having to give up anything else in your life in other words you have to consider it money thrown out of the window   so while from a psychological perspective it makes sense that especially poorer people will buy a lottery ticket as eric very well explained it is actually the wealthier who should consider doing so if anyone

the reason i do n't want to get into here it is because internet debates over these things turn into an absolute shit show instantly    in a nutshell the sane parts of argument comes down to very difficult to prove assumptions about how perfectly fiat currency can will be implemented   the sane case for gold is that it is very difficult to get into the kind of money printing that places like zimbabwe and argentina have got into when your currency is based on something with a finite and slow growing supply it 's hard to print more gold    the sane case for fiat currency is that it is ridiculous to the entire economy by tying it to one arbitrary commodity with a fluctuating value and supply that does not correlate well with overall economic output    a perfectly implemented fiat currency printed and by a perfectly perfectly competent and perfectly benevolent central bank let 's call it god money is the ideal that 's pretty much axiomatic and even sane gold bugs would tend to allow the above so far as it goes including all stipulations    in fact someone inclined to believe in divine intervention might make a case that gold is precisely that a hard to forge easy to detect easy to handle metal placed on earth by god in quantities just right to serve as currency   the problem is that a really bad fiat currency is absolutely terrible leads to nightmare scenarios people starving on one side of a fence while tons of crops are being burned on the other side because of price discrepancies stuff like that again even sane keynesians will allow as much    the problem is that the crazies and single issue come out of the woodwork when you start getting into this stuff and tend to dominate the conversation if conversation is a fair word to use in a sense the sane spectrum of debate boils down to an almost ideological divide    whether you believe that a sort of permanent central bank currency issuer is possible plausible   because if it is achievable it is almost certainly better than just tying the whole economy to the price of a single commodity if it is not achievable then it is almost certainly better to let the markets adjust and correct however than to tie the whole economy to the whims and wishes of incompetent and politically motivated money printers i hope that makes sense and that it is a fair representation of the conundrum   the problem with making an argument is that you 've got a of technical and sometimes fairly complicated nitty gritty plus a certain amount of starting assumption worldview ideological stuff all together and almost all of it is very hard impossible to prove via scientific testing    both the technical and historical stuff have strong conflicting indicators and it 's obviously not possible to say set up two identical societies and let them run for a thousand years controlling for everything but monetary policy and see what happens    macro economics is a very imperfect science it has certainly given the world some very useful and valuable insights and axioms but the testing methods are extremely indirect and heavily subject to interpretation you really have only the historical record to draw on and it is almost impossible to find examples that control for whatever variable is in question    macro ideally tries really hard to be science but you 're always kind of picking from bad examples when testing a hypothesis trying to line up vaguely similar historical periods to isolate for some common factor it 's kind of like or theoretical physics except with much smaller and data sets ten thousand years from now it will be much easier to look at the historical data and isolate for particular variables over multiple hundred year spans across a variety of cultural political and socio economic backgrounds    for now the peanut gallery is full of questions that the experts can not answer and the record is full of exceptions to every rule and a lot of it frankly boils down to worldview and ideology with a healthy of i 'm smarter than you to finish the sauce    since i personally prefer technical questions to politics i will leave it to others to formulate and debate those things

insurance is to mitigate risk you ca n't handle yourself   all insurance not just car insurance   the expected value of the insurance will always cost more than the expected value of your loss that 's how the insurance company makes money   but sometimes the known fixed cost is better for your ability to sleep at night than the unknown though likely lower variable cost if you were suddenly hit with a bill the size of your car tomorrow would you be ok   if so then you can handle the risk yourself and do n't need insurance   if not then you need the insurance the insurance company sells thousands of policies and it 's much easier to predict the number out of 1000 people that will get in an accident tomorrow than the chance that you specifically will get in an accident tomorrow   so they can manage the risk by making a small amount of money from people and buying the other guy a new car

there are several factors here firstly there 's opportunity cost i.e. what you would get with the money elsewhere if you have higher interest opportunities investing paying down debt elsewhere you could be paying that down instead there 's also domino effects by reducing your liquid savings to or below the minimum you ca n't move any of it into tax advantaged retirement accounts earning higher interest then there 's the insurance costs you are required to buy extra insurance to protect your lender you should factor in the extra insurance you would buy vs the insurance required given that you can buy the car yourself catastrophic insurance may not be necessary or you may prefer a higher deductible than your lender will allow if you 're not sufficiently capitalized you may need gap insurance to cover when your car depreciates faster than your loan is paid down a 30 percent payment should be enough to not need it though finally there 's some value in having options if you have the loan and the cash you can likely pay it off without penalty but it will be harder to get the loan if you do n't finance it maybe you can take out a loan against the car later but i have n't looked into the fees that might incur   if it 's any help i 'm in the last stretch of a 3 year car loan at the time paying in cash was n't an option and having done it i recognize that it 's more complicated than it seems

i do n't believe saturday is a business day either when i deposit a check at a bank 's drive in after 4 pm friday the receipt tells me it will credit as if i deposited on monday   if a business computer does n't adjust their billing to have a weekday due date they are supposed to accept the payment on the next business day else as you discovered a sunday due date is really the prior friday in which case they may be running afoul of the rules that require x number of days from the time they mail a bill to the time it 's due   the flip side to all of this is to pick and choose your battles in life just pay the bill 2 days early the interest on a few hundred dollars is a few cents per week you save that by not using a stamp just charge it on their site on the friday keep in mind you can be right but their computer still you so you call and spend your valuable time when ever the due date is over a weekend getting an agent to reverse the late fee the cost of right is wasting ten minutes which is worth far more than just avoiding the issue altogether   but if you are in the us you did n't give your country we have regulations for everything hr aka the card act of 2009 offers 2 weekend or holiday due dates if the payment due date for a    credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan is a day on    which the creditor does not receive or accept payments by mail    including weekends and holidays the creditor may not treat a    payment received on the next business day as late for any purpose so if you really want to pursue this you have the power of our congress on your side

no one can advise you on whether to hold this stock or sell it your carried losses can offset short or long term gains but the long term losses have to be applied to offset long term gains before any remaining losses can offset short term gains your question does n't indicate how long you have to hold before the short term gains become long term gains obviously the longer the holding period the greater the risk you also must avoid a wash sale selling to lock in the gains reset your basis then repurchasing within a month all of those decisions hold risks that you have to weigh if you see further upside in holding it longer keep the investment do n't sell just to try to maximize tax benefits

i have had this happen a couple of times because of splits or sales of portions of the company   the general timeline was to announce how the split was to be handled then the split then a freeze in purchasing stock in the other company then a freeze in sales followed by a short blackout period then the final transfers to funds options cash based on a mapping announced at the start of the process you need to answer two questions to determine if the final transactions will make the market move you have to understand how many shares are involved compared to the typical daily volume there are two caveats professional investors will be aware of the transaction date and can either ignore the employee transactions or try and take advantage of them there may also be a set of transactions if the people left in the old company were awarded shares in your company as part of the sale if you are happy with the default mapping then you can do nothing and let the transaction happen based on the announced timeline it is easy and you do n't have to worry about deadlines if you do n't like the default mapping then you need to know when the blackout period starts so you do n't end up not being able to perform the steps you want when you want   timing is up to you if the market does n't like the acquisition split it make make sense to make the move now or wait until the last possible day depending on which part they do n't like only you can answer that question

closed accounts are used when calculating average age of accounts aaoa by fico they will drop off your report 7 years after their closure at which time your aaoa will decrease and most likely lower your credit score keeping your oldest card with an annual fee af is a tough question since the exact calculations are a secret it 's hard to quantify the value of that card keep in mind that if you do decide to close it now or right before the next af it will continue to count for the next 7 years what you can do is the following assume you wo n't be applying for any new cards in the next 7 years look at all your current accounts and calculate the aaoa of all of them that would still be on your report 7 years from now calculate it with and without your oldest card the difference will show you the effect closing the card today will have there is a potential way to raise your aaoa depending on if you have an amex card amex reports all accounts as being open from your original member since date if your oldest amex ever not necessarily still open is older than your aaoa opening a new amex will actually raise your average   age of accounts is 15 of your score note that some websites that calculate your aaoa for you like creditkarma do n't count closed accounts but since fico does the age those websites generate should be ignored

i 've never had to ask these questions facebook is a beautiful thing   from a entrepreneur to a employer you 're asking for a lawsuit i 'd say a couple of lawsuits and i highly recommend that you stop this practice before you get in hot water here 's why    first   facebook terms of use makes it a violation for anyone to ask users for their facebook password so facebook can sue employers for requesting said password due to the employer violating the terms all the user would have to do is contact facebook 's legal department that you asked for their password    second   there is often information provided in facebook profiles that you can not ask a perspective employee during the hiring process mandated by federal law facebook records locations of where the user has logged into their account so all the job applicant would have to do is produce that evidence which is readily accessible via your facebook profile for free     that information consist of the following   race sex orientation pregnancy religion national origin disability physical or mental including hiv status age for workers over 40 military service or affiliation anticipated deployment with the reserves or national guard bankruptcy or bad debts genetic information citizenship status for citizens permanent residents temporary residents refugees and   if someone is not hired after an employer has accessed this information via use of the job applicant 's facebook account the employer is opening themselves up to an accusation lawsuit that something in the facebook profile was used as the basis of a decision not to hire as an employer how do you prove to the court judge that you didn't use the applicant 's information on facebook for making your hiring choice do you as an employer really want to be put into this position you 'd have to be crazy or not mind lawsuits if you say yes     so it 's just better for both the employer and the applicant for the employer to not ask for the password     tl;dr as a employer do n't ask for a facebook user 's password unless you like lawsuits

the money is transferred through an electronic funds transfer which is an umbrella term that encompasses wire transfers direct debits etc the application form for key trade bank the only place i can find that uses that exact phrasing lists a swift number this usually indicates that the transfer of funds is done through an international wire transfer   in the most basic sense the process works like this key trade bank uses the swift number to notify your current bank of the transfer   your bank instructs the settlement bank e.g. the central bank of your country where your bank is located to transfer funds to key trade   if key trade is in another country from your current country your central bank will send money to the central bank where key trade is located which will in turn send the money to key trade otherwise your central bank deposits the money into the account that key trade also has with them and the transfer is complete

i think a lot of people would respond with something like you use bank machines and online banking do n't you   that is the same reason i hear people supporting voting machines and even online voting but the problem is that there are significant differences take a service like mint.com compared with your bank for example   the bank is a regulated company with insurance to back up your money should they make a mistake   even if someone steals your debit card and drains your account you will usually get all your money back   banks have deep pockets and even the government has a vested interest in making sure the banks stay afloat   when they do make a mistake and they will you are usually quite safe on the other hand mint.com is a third party that you are just going to hand over your bank passwords to   i think it is reasonable to ask i am not saying not to use mint.com but it is certainly reasonable to ask these questions

the fed has $ 2 trillion and they loan out $ 1.9 trillion which then is eventually makes it way back to their which they loan out another $ 1.8 trillion the money goes to whoever they are loaning it to the is determined by the treasury directly printing 0 's and and putting it into the fed 's bank which then they loan out that 's last part is what quantitative easing is   in short the at the top then the fed then the branch banks then corporations then the executives then the middle lower class generally when the treasury prints the money it trickles down problem is the higher up in the tree the more purchasing power you have the lower the less   comparing it to the spanish would n't be far off perhaps someday the government will let the people choose their own currency

no a jump in market capitalization does not equal the amount that has been invested   market cap is simply the stock price times the total number of shares this represents a theoretical value of the company i say theoretical because the company might not be able to be sold for that at all   the quoted stock price is simply what the last buyer and seller of stock agreed upon for the price of their trade they really only represent themselves other investors may decide that the stock is worth more or less than that   the stock price can move on very little volume in this case amazon had released a very good earnings report after the bell yesterday and the price jumped in after hours trading the stock price is up but that simply means that the few shares traded overnight sold for much higher than the closing price yesterday   after the market opens today and many more shares are traded we 'll get a better idea what large numbers of investors feel about the price but no matter what the price does the change in market cap does not equal the amount of new money being invested in the company market cap is the price of the most recent trades extrapolated out across all the shares

if the federal reserve were to pay banks to hold money they would need to get the money from somewhere to do so   they would have three options go to congress and request and authorization of funds as an quasi independent entity however it would be both highly for an institution to diminish its own authority by requesting funding and politically difficult for the congress to appropriate it transfer held assets   after qe qe2 the fed is now the holder of several assets mortgages and the like that are already for it to hold it acquired these assets in the first place to soak up excess demand   if these assets were transferred back to banks it would have exactly the opposite effect increasing supply and further suppressing the value of the assets they would be trying to shore up by lowering the interest rate print money   the fed could raise the money supply by issuing new bonds this is inherently inflationary and while pretty much everyone agrees this is n't bad in the short run there is already widespread fear that in the long run qe by itself is going to unleash massive inflation once growth returns anyway   to keep pushing on this string would only these fears and quite likely turn it into a self prophecy in short the fed could pay banks to hold money but the political and economic consequences of raising the needed funds to do so would all undermine the institution or the desired effect

1 as i said the above is not actually anything like a genuine history of how money emerged it 's an explain it to a five year old parable to answer where does the money go in an economic contraction   2 it 's also not defense endorsement apology for any particular set of policies or historical theory of money it 's a picture book describing the workings of an internal combustion engine using cartoon characters not a on the social and environmental implications of american car culture    that said in the parable the reasons why the simplified in the town chose to accept the fiat currency are pretty straightforward and are actually explained   they were previously using a system of a whole bunch of separate privately issued currencies each with complex and hard to evaluate credit risks bob 's potato certificate versus jane 's potato certificate versus your apple certificate versus my deer certificate this was causing problems and confusion about how much any given certificate was actually worth    the system proposed was proposed in a way that was at least as credible as the best existing system    last but not least they accepted the new currency for exactly the same reason that you accept dollar euros or whatever because everyone else does    there was no law preventing any of them from still trading apple ious in fact we still traded them later in the example except denominated in loddars i could have asked you for the last note to denominated in apples but that would probably have been harder to trade than the currency that everyone else is using    i said i would n't get into the gold standard debate and i wo n't and here 's why the debate hinges entirely and solely on whether you believe that a good fiat currency is possible and realistically sustainable if you do then fiat currency makes a lot more sense in every respect if you do n't then fiat currency is always just a catastrophe waiting to happen    my parable shows the mechanics of how money works it does n't say whether the system is good or bad or whether they should have accepted the fiat system proposed or held out for a better one or rejected it altogether    you can argue that internal combustion engines are bad or that much better alternatives are available or that nobody should use them but that does n't make a description of they work incorrect

the value of a stock ultimately is related to the valuation of a corporation   as part of the valuation you can estimate the cash flows discounted to present time of the expected cash flows from owning a share   this stock value is the so called fundamental value of a stock   what you are really asking is how is the stock 's market price and the fundamental value related   and by asking this you have implicitly assumed they are not the same    the reason that the fundamental value and market price can diverge is that simply most shareholders will not continue holding the stock for the lifespan of a company indeed some companies have been around for centuries   this means that without dividends or buybacks or liquidations or mergers acquisitions a typical shareholder can not reasonably expect to recoup their share of the company 's equity in this case the chief price driver is the aggregate expectation of buyers and sellers in the marketplace not fundamental evaluation of the company 's balance sheet    now obviously some expectations are based on fundamentals and expert opinions can differ but even when all the experts agree roughly on the numbers it may be that the market price is quite a ways away from their estimates   an interesting example is given in this survey of behavioral finance   it concerns palm a wholly owned subsidiary of   when palm went public its shares went for such a high price they were significantly higher than 's shares   this mispricing persisted for several weeks note that this facet of pricing is often given short in standard explanations of the stock market   it seems despite decades of academic research and nobel prizes being handed out to behavioral economists the knowledge has been slow to trickle down to laymen although any person will realize something is with the standard explanations    for example before 2012 the last time apple paid out dividends was 1995   are we really to believe that people were pumping up apple 's stock price from 1995 to 2012 because they were waiting for dividends or hoping for a merger or liquidation   it does n't seem plausible to me especially since after apple announced dividends that year apple stock ended up taking a deep dive despite wall street analysts stating the company was doing better than ever   that the stock price reflects expectations of the future cash flows from the stock is a thinly disguised form of the efficient market hypothesis emh and there 's a lot of evidence contrary to the emh see references in the previously linked survey   if you believe what happened in apple 's case was just a rational re evaluation of apple stock then i think you must be a hard core emh advocate basically and this is at length in the survey above fundamentals and market pricing can become   this is because there are in the marketplace making it difficult for people to take advantage of the mispricing   in some cases this can go on for extended periods of time possibly even years   part of the friction is caused by strong beliefs by market participants which can often shift pressure to supply or demand   two   popular on wall street are it does n't matter if you 're right   you have to be right at the right time   and it does n't matter if you 're right if the market disagrees with you   they suggest that you can make the right decision with where to put your money but being right is n't what drives prices   the market does what it does and it 's subject to the whims of its participants

as long as you 're not trying to get a higher limit in order to actually spend more money or might be tempted to do so it 's generally advantageous to have a higher limit if available a large part of credit score is based on utilization rate balance due at statement closing divided by credit limit basically you want more than 0 and less than 30 or preferably less than 10 used doubling your credit limit halves your utilization rate and it can be comforting to have it there in case you need it in some sort of emergency scenario caveats there 's no right or default amount of credit that you should have at any given point in your life if you 're using credit responsibly and do n't need more credit there 's no particular reason to ask for more credit if you work at it and are patient it 's easy to eventually have tens of thousands of dollars of unused credit limits but that does n't really get you anywhere you need to be by itself

you get to keep the money if and only if you confirm with both parties the loan and the mattress companies that you received a refund twice and both parties agree that they know that with no and they both agree to let you keep it   in writing   and even then it might be depending on amounts generally speaking you should not consider the money yours   it was refunded in error after all   and it would have made more sense to confirm your communication before you deposited it and you maybe should n't have moved it into savings either that looks kinda like keeping the money unavailable   planning to keep it or even just keep it till the shoe drops looks an awful lot like fraud   as in the crime   taking or keeping money that does n't belong to you when you know it does n't belong to you is stealing    since you know you got the payment in error it is your responsibility to make at minimum a reasonable effort to make sure the money goes where it was intended to go and by reasonable effort i mean roughly what kind of effort the companies should put in in your view if the error had worked out the other way with neither paying you back    at what point if any should they consider the money theirs in the reversed situation depending on the amount involved and the companies attitudes it is possible not necessarily likely but possible that each company will hear your story and respond confirmed in writing that they have no problem letting you keep the payment from their company   in the companies view this might be about how much it would cost to recoup the amount and is thus more likely for very small amounts or else writing off the cost for customer service or pr if both companies do this you have the money free and clear   but i would not depend on this companies have just as much reason to want money as you do especially when belongs to them

a bit of poking around brought me to this thread on the motley fool asking the same basic question i think the problem is the stock price for a stock to be sold short it has to be marginable which means it has to trade over $ 5.00 the broker therefore ca n't borrow the stock for you to sell short because it is n't held in their clients margin accounts my guess is that etrade along with other brokers simply exclude these stocks for short selling has an explanation of non marginable securities specific to stocks under $ 5 other securities such as stocks with share prices under $ 5 or with extremely high betas may be excluded at the discretion of the broker itself

if and only if there is a zero interest installment plan available technically the only risk is that there will likely be a hard inquiry on your credit report which may or may not also have a corresponding debt obligation attached to it personally i recently signed up for one such plan with google and i had a hard inquiry but no debt added to my report the other risks are that 1 your monthly payment goes up so if you are living on a tight budget the added payment might make it harder to meet your next bill and 2 you could miss a payment which generally triggers interest to accrue retroactively at a high rate and in some cases could be grounds for immediate repayment the pro reward of these plans is that you have to spend less of your capital upfront which you may be able to use for other purposes presumably with a higher net present value than purchasing the item you 're considering outright a larger example would be purchasing a new car you want to buy a $ 50k car and you have the cash on hand to pay in full but you are being offered 0 interest for 36 months you may be more inclined to take a loan at 0 with 0 down payment and invest your money in another vehicle no pun intended that offers you a decent rate of return and you will come out ahead in the end of course this example works in a perfect world where you can get such an offer there are no extra fees available you are n't worrying about your debt to income ratio in preparation for a big purchase like a house there is n't a higher insurance premium to consider etc in short 0 financing be it for a phone or a car can be a nice perk for the informed consumer who is not using the financing as a way to purchase outside their financial means but it is offered by companies as a way to make people buy things they normally would not and hopefully capitalize on people missing payments in order to reap the sweet 20%+ interest rates generally seen with these offers   in your specific situation with the phone you should consider if you get a discount on your monthly plan for purchasing outright or if you can get the phone subsidized if you sign a contract and you know you like your provider enough to stay for its duration if the monthly plan rate stays the same and you 're looking at either $ 500 now or $ 500 over 24 months and you do n't mind a hard inquiry there 's not much of compelling reason to pass on the financing and hold on to your $ 500

in june 2016 the american institute of cpas sent a letter to the irs requesting guidance on this question    quoting from section 4 of this letter which is available at if the irs believes any property transaction rules should apply differently to virtual currency than to other types of property taxpayers will need additional guidance in order to properly distinguish the rules and regulations section 4 of notice 2014 21 states that general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency which is guidance that is generally helpful in determining the tax consequences of most virtual currency transactions however if there are particular factors that distinguish one virtual currency as like kind to another virtual currency for section 1031 purposes the irs should clarify these details e.g. allowing the treatment of virtual currency held for investment or business as like kind to another virtual currency in the form of published guidance similarly taxpayers need specific guidance of special rules or statutory interpretations if the irs determines that the installment method of section is applied differently for virtual currency than for other types of property so at the very least a peer reviewed committee of cpas finds like kind treatment to have possible grounds for allowance    i would disagree with calling this a loophole however edit at least from the viewpoint of the taxpayer   at a base technological level a virtual currency to virtual currency exchange consists of exchanging knowledge of one sequence of binary digits private key for another   what could be more like kind than this

this is not a direct answer to your question but you might want to consider whether you want to have a financial planner at all would a large mutual fund company or brokerage serve your needs better than a bank you are still quite young and so have been contributing to iras for only a few years also the wording in your question suggests that your ira investments have not done spectacularly well and so it is reasonable to infer that your ira is not a large amount or at least not as large as what it would be 30   years from now at this level of investment it would be difficult for you to find a financial planner who spends all that much time looking after your interests that you should get away from your current planner presumably a mid level employee in what is typically called the trust division of the bank is a given   but to go to another bank or even to a different employee in the same bank where   you will also likely be towards investing your ira in cds annuities and a few mutual funds with substantial sales charges and   substantial annual expense fees might just take you from the pan into the fire you might want to consider transferring your ira to a large mutual fund company and investing it in something simple   like one of their low cost meaning small annual expense ratio index funds the couch potato portfolio suggests equal amounts invested in a no load s&p 500 index fund and a no load bond index fund or a split favoring the stock index fund in view of your age and the fact that the ira should be a long term investment   but the point is   you can open an ira account have the money transferred from your ira account with the bank and make the investments on line all by yourself instead of having a financial advisor do it on your behalf and charge you a fee for doing so not to mention possibly screwing it up you can set up automated investment too the mutual fund company will gladly withdraw money from your checking account and invest it in whatever fund(s you choose   all this is not complicated at all   if you would like to follow the couch potato strategy and rebalance your portfolio once a year you can do it   by yourself too if you want to invest in funds other than the s&p 500 index fund etc most mutual fund   companies offer a portfolio analysis and advice for a fee and the fee is usually waived when the assets increase above certain levels varies from company to company   you could thus have a portfolio analysis done each year and hopefully it will be free after a few more years   indeed at that level you also typically get one person assigned as your advisor just as you have with a bank once you get the recommendations you can choose to follow them   or not but you have control over how and where your ira assets are invested   over the years as your ira assets grow you can branch out into   investments other than index funds but right now having a financial planner for your ira might not be worth it later when you have more assets by all means if you want to explore investing in specific stocks with a brokerage instead of sticking to mutual funds only but this might also mean phone calls urging you to sell stock a right now or buy hot stock b today etc so one way of improving your interactions and have a better experience with your new financial planner is to not have a planner at all for a few years and do some of the work yourself

i 'm not an attorney or a tax advisor the following is not to be considered advice just general information in the us putting your name on the deed would mean making you a co owner absent any other legal agreement between you e.g. a contract stating each of you owns 50 of the house both of you would then be considered to own 100 of the house jointly and in addition the irs would almost certainly interpret the creation of your ownership interest as a gift from your partner to you making them liable for gift tax the gift tax could be postponed by filing a gift tax return which would reduce partner 's lifetime combined gift estate tax exemption and if you sought to get rid of your ownership interest by giving it to your partner it would again be a taxable gift with the tax or loss of estate tax exemption accruing to you however it is likely that this is all moot because of the mortgage on the house any change to the deed would have to be approved by the mortgage holder and if so approved executed by a title company registered closing agent or similar depending on the laws of your state in my similar case the mortgage holder refused to add or remove any names from the deed unless i refinanced at a higher rate naturally making the new partners jointly liable for the mortgage we also had to pay an additional title fee to change the deed

yes you often can buy stocks directly from the company at little or no transaction cost   many companies have either a dividend reinvestment plan drip or a direct stock plan   with these plans you purchase shares directly from the company although often there is a third party transfer agent that handles the transaction and the stock is issued in your name   this differs from purchasing stock from a broker where the stock normally remains in the name of the broker generally in order to begin participating in a drip you need to already be a registered stockholder   this means that you need to purchase your first share of stock outside of the drip and get it in your name   after that you can register with the drip and purchase additional shares directly from the company   if the company has a you can begin purchasing shares directly without first being a stockholder with the advent of discount brokers drips do not save as much money for regular investors as they once did   however they can still sometimes save money for someone who wants to purchase shares on a regular basis over even a discount broker if you are interested in drips and and want to learn more there is an informative website at that has lots of information on which drips are available and how to get started

many mortgages penalize early payment and i assume it 's possible to disallow it altogether it makes sense why they do n't want early payment if you pay off the loan early it is usually because you re financed it to a loan with a lower rate you would do this when the interest rate is low lower than when you got your original loan if you pay it off early that means they will have to re invest the money again or they will lose money if they just have it sitting around however recall above that people pay it off early when the interest rate is low that is the worst time for them to re invest this into another mortgage because the rate will not be as good for them as the one you were originally going to keep paying

i think you understood much of what i say in general unfortunately i did n't follow patches math   what i from your summary is a 1 match to the 10 invested but a .8 expense the etf voo has a .05 annual fee a bit better than spy   a quick few calculations show that the 10 bonus does offset a long run of the .75 excess expense compared to external investing after decades the 401(k appears to still be a bit ahead not the dramatic delta suggested in the prior answer but enough to stay with the 401(k in this situation the tiny match still makes the difference edit the question you linked to the 401(k had no match and an awful 1.2 annual expense this combination is deadly for the younger investor always an exception to offer a 25 marginal rate earner close to retiring at 15 the 401(k deposit saves him 25 but can soon be withdrawn at 15 it 's worth a a few years of that fee to make this happen for the young person who is planning a quick exit from the company same deal

do not directly create value for the company   oh my of course they do now i ca n't say that all of them do there are certainly bad managers out there that destroy value but it 's management 's goal to organize the labor and resources in the most efficient way possible thus creating value if you put 100 workers in a factory and leave them alone for a week they 're not going to know what the hell to do they need someone to direct them and make sure they stay the course an entrepreneur is needed to create a business model that inputs land labor and capital and outputs a product or service that people want

i still do n't understand this you have an option between two cars they are exactly the same except for one is cheaper and has less battery capacity that means the company who built it is making less money on the cheaper one and you have the choice between the two cars you could very easily just buy the more expensive one if you have the money then or you can afford it now until you have the money later always your choice if you do n't like it buy the more expensive bigger battery not the cheaper car that costs the same net price after the upgrade what 's wrong with that

the way the wash sale works is your loss is added to your cost basis of the buy   so suppose your original cost basis is $ 10,000   you then sell the stock for $ 9,000 which accounts for your $ 1,000 loss   you then buy the stock again say for $   and sell it for $ 9,000   since your loss of $ 1,000 is added to your cost basis you actually still have a net loss of $ 500 you then buy the stock again for say $ 10,500   then sell it for $ 9,500   your $ 500 loss is added to your cost basis   and you have a net loss of $ 1,500 since you never had a net gain you will not owe any tax for these transactions

if you have money and may need to access it at any time you should put it in a savings account   it wo n't return much interest but it will return some and it is easily accessible    if you have all your emergency savings that you need at least six months of income buy index based mutual funds   these should invest in a broad range of securities including both stocks and bonds three dollars in stocks for every dollar in bonds so as to be robust in the face of market shifts    you should not buy individual stocks unless you have enough money to buy a lot of them in different industries   thirty different stocks is a minimum for a diversified portfolio and you really should be looking at more like a hundred   there 's also considerable research effort required to verify that the stocks are good buys   for most people this is too much work   for most people broad based index funds are better purchases   you do n't have as much upside but you also are much less likely to find yourself holding worthless paper    if you do buy stocks look for ones where you know something about them   for example if you 've been to a restaurant chain with a recent ipo that really you with their food and service consider investing   but do your research so that you do n't get caught buying after everyone else has already the price   the time to buy is right before everyone else notices how great they are not after    some people benefit from joining investment clubs with others with similar incomes and goals   that way you can share some of the research duties   also you can get other opinions before buying which can restrain risky impulse buys    just to reiterate i would recommend sticking to mutual funds and saving accounts for most investors   only make the move into individual stocks if you 're willing to be serious about it   there 's considerable work involved   and do n't forget diversification   you want to have stocks that benefit regardless of what the overall economy does   some stocks should benefit from lower oil prices while others benefit from higher prices   you want to have both types so as not to be caught flat when prices move    there are much more experienced people trying to guess market directions   if your strategy relies on outperforming them it has a high chance of failure   index based mutual funds allow you to share the diversification burden with others   since the market almost always goes up in the long term a fund that the market is much safer than any individual security can be   maintaining a three to one balance in stocks to bonds also helps as they tend to move in opposite directions   i.e. stocks tend to be good when bonds are weak and vice versa

from an article i wrote a while back dalbar inc. a boston based financial services research firm has been measuring the effects of decisions to buy sell and switch into and out of mutual funds since 1984 the key finding always has been that the average investor earns significantly less than the return reported by their funds for the 20 years ended dec. 31 2006 the average stock fund investor earned a paltry 4.3 average annual compounded return compared to percent for the standard poor ’s 500 index it 's one thing to look at the indexes but quite another to understand what other investors are actually getting the propensity to sell low and buy high is proven by the data dalbar publishes and really makes the case to go after the magic s&p 0.09 gotten from an etf

gt productivity can increase but it does n't have to productivity can remain the same but if you 've got two people competing for one job they bid wages lower since even a lower wage is better up to a point in welfare state to no wage at all   but regardless of decreases in wages productivity should still increase since there are more people working on a fundamental level labor and capital combine to create products if you add more potential labor and keep capital constant you 'll only have the same number of products being produced if increase in potential labor is n't used since unemployment has n't increased to compensate for women entering the work force there should be more goods produced

the stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock 's current profitability and prospects but is also based on prediction of how the stock 's prospects might change in the future in almost every case there are professional investors analysing the stock 's future prospects and considering whether it 's over or under values for its current price however even professionals can be totally wrong   if you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time then you might be if you 're right equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not if you do n't think you have a good understanding about the stock then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding otherwise you are simply taking a if you know of another stock that has better prospects then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse   but also bear in mind that in my understanding research has shown that on average people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection and more stock trades means more brokerage which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market

the idea here is to get an idea of how to value each business and thus normalize how highly prized is each dollar that a company makes   while some companies may make millions and others make billions how does one put these in proper context   one way is to consider a dollar in earnings for the company   how does a dollar in earnings for google compare to a dollar for coca cola for example   some companies may be valued much higher than others and this is a way to see that as share price alone can be rather misleading since some companies can have millions of shares outstanding and split the shares to keep the share price in a certain range thus the idea is n't that an investor is paying for a dollar of earnings but rather how is that perceived as some companies may not have earnings and yet still be traded as start ups and other companies may be running at a loss and thus the p e is n't even meaningful in this case assuming everything but the p e is the same the lower p e would represent a greater value in a sense yes   however earnings growth rate can account for higher p es for some companies as if a company is expected to grow at 40 for a few years it may have a higher p e than a company growing earnings at 5 for example

with my experience because i hate generalizations of an entire country   i 'm indian born and raised but came to the us to do my undergrad uni and now work out of the us i had a lot of the same qualms about working with my indian peers but i 've found that it also depends on the support structure that companies offer high turnover is definitely an issue but that seems to be because companies focus more on hiring and less on retention offering signing bonuses but then little to no continued progress limited growth opportunities rigid hierarchy terrible working hours   i have someone who reports to me in india now and it 's an experiment on how to better engage them and it 's worked better turns out you can expect more when you also treat them like an american employee while expecting american results there are definitely still cultural in work ethic etc but they can be overcome if you get people to stick around long enough   of course this is anecdotal but that 's my two cents

title agencies perform several things research the title for defects you may not know what you 're looking at unless you 're a real estate professional but some titles have strings attached to them like conditions for resale usage changes etc research title issues like misrepresentation of ownership misrepresentation of the actual property titled misrepresentation of conditions again not being a professional in the domain you might not understand the text you 're looking at research liens those are usually have to be recorded i.e. the title company wo n't necessarily find a lien if it was n't recorded with the county cover your and the bank 's they provide title insurance that guarantees your money back if they missed something they were supposed to find the title insurance is usually required for a mortgaged transaction while i understand why you would think you can do it most people can not even if they think they can they can not in many areas this research can not be done online for example in california you have to go to the county recorder office to look things up for legal reasons in ca counties are not allowed to provide access to certain information without verification of who 's accessing it may be worth your while   to pay someone to do it even if you can do it yourself because your time is more valuable also keep in mind that while you may trust your abilities your bank wo n't so you may be able to do your own due diligence but the bank needs to do its own specifically to detroit the city is bankrupt every $ 100 k counts for them i 'm surprised they only charge $ 6 per search but that is probably limited by the state law

cheapest is one thing   you can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price   i can think of three places to shop each with an up and downside i would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service   just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have decide what features you need   do you need long distance   do you need caller i d   do you need to call friends and family find out what you have available to you through associations   often schools work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts   look at your insurance plan or aaa membership for the crazy discounts decide what kinds of service will meet your needs buy the cheapest service do not enter a contract   even if the price is slightly lower   at least not at first   if you try out your service and love it enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less   with cell phones especially it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract   even when you buy equipment for full price up front ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company because phone companies are often regulated monopolies they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality   they probably do n't advertise it or push it but it might exist if you call and ask   you basically get a dial tone price is dictated by a government board so you do n't have to worry about shopping for deals not the cheapest possible solution this is popular plan the youth oriented market but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only   there are downsides 911 etc and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to cellphones require batteries and can go dead not good for emergencies voice over internet protocol uses your existing internet connection   you can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the voip box and use it like any other phone   voip can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get or just plain inexpensive   there are providers who sell a monthly service yearly service or no service plan at all you buy a device and get service as long as you own the device   taxes to the government are always due so nothing is ever free sometimes the provider is just computer software so a minimalist would like that emergency services are more reliable than cellular if you follow extra steps to set them up can be confusing to buy   some require contracts some special devices some require a bit of technical know how to setup   be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices

the number one rule of thumb that will generally answer the is it taxable question for any money you may have or receive did you pay taxes on it already pretty much any money you actually get in your paycheck dd has already been taxed or at least the projected amount of tax has been withheld is your money to dispense with as you will or according to your pre arranged obligations for most of it deposits paid are one such example if you wrote a check or obtained a money order that they then cashed that 's still your money until it is n't the contract states that it is being held effectively in escrow though the landlord has free use of it so long as he can pony up according to the contract anything not used to pay for damages is yours and you get it back the atm fee refund is trickier but basically this is a benefit offered to you as a service by your bank you front for the atm fees incurred when withdrawing and then those fees are refunded to you by your bank effectively increasing the number of atms you can withdraw from for free as long as there is no net income it 's treated like a mail in rebate you did n't gain any money so there 's nothing new to tax there are a couple of specific exceptions to this otherwise overarching rule of thumb one is roth iras typically on investments you either pay income tax on the money going in and capital gains tax on the money coming out or you pay nothing going in and income tax coming out with a roth however you pay income tax going in and nothing coming out even though you 're eventually getting back more than you put in   another is gifts whoever gave you the gift paid the taxes on it or the money to buy it however if they give you a gift valued more than a certain limit changes every year and there 's a lifetime limit they have to pay an additional gift tax of 35 on any amount over the limit that 's taxing taxed income usually   there are other examples but for the overwhelming majority of situations if it 's money you already had after any and all applicable taxes it 's not taxable even if you have n't seen that money for a while

there are various exchanges around the world that handle spot precious metal trading for the most part these are also the primary spot foreign exchange markets like thomson reuters website seems to be down etc you can trade on these markets through brokers just like you can trade on stock markets   however the vast majority of traders on these exchanges do not intend to hold any bullion ownership at the end of the day they want to buy as much as they sell each day   a minority of traders do intend to hold metal positions for longer periods but i doubt any of them intend to actually go collect bullion from the exchange   i do n't think it 's even possible really the only way to get bullion is to pay a service fee to a dealer like you mentioned   but on an exchange like the ones above you have to pay three different fees so in the end you ca n't even get the spot price on the exchanges where the spot prices are determined   you might even come out ahead by going to a dealer you should try to find a reputable dealer and go in knowing the latest trade prices   an honest dealer will have a website showing you the current trade prices so you know that they expect you to know the prices when you come in for example here 's a well known dealer in chicago that happily shows you the spot prices from so you can decide whether their service fee is worth it or not

a stock buy back reduces the number of stocks available on the open market   since stocks are literally a share in ownership a buy back of the stock then when the company repurchases it has the effect of increasing the percent of ownership of the company of each stock zynga has a market cap of m so a 200 m buy back will increase the ownership value of each stock by ~12   this has had the effect of an immediate stock price bump of around 12 which is to be expected as the value becomes the expected post buyback value however long term gains will require zynga to turn around their business   this bump will only be sustainable if they can   if their business continues to decline then its stock price will continue to slide   there are some who would rather see zynga invest that 200 m in getting a new product to market to bring revenues up rather than spending precious capital on a plan to temporarily bump a stock that is headed towards the floor   if on the other hand the revenue is poised to recover and the company has the excess capitol buying back stock low is a great way to get the most back for your shareholders bucks can they repurchase at any price and any time they can write a buy order for any price at any time in the future though they have some restrictions from the sec mostly involving disclosures   but it is up to the sellers to choose to sell at that price   if they execute the buy back at a rate comparable to market rate then they are more likely to get takers than if they attempt to buy it back at a significant reduction from market price   so since 25 2012 the it is selling for   a buy order for 2.30 is going to get more action than one at 2.00   investors will often look at the companies buy back offer for a company in zynga has been as the true value of the company   if so then a lowball buyback offer could add downward pressure on the stock price

i am using my debit card regularly in atm 's with a pin in stores with my signature and online but later you say   but from what i recall from starting my own business a long time ago for debit cards there 's only a per transaction fee of like $ 0.25 not a percentage cut only pin transactions have just a per transaction fee paid by you to the merchant and you are reimbursed by schwab   if you use your card with just a signature or online without a pin then it is a credit transaction from the merchant 's perspective   the merchant pays a fee and schwab gets its cut of that   so for two of the transaction types that you describe the merchant pays schwab indirectly out of your payment   only when you enter your pin does it process as a debit transaction where schwab pays the merchant    because check cards withdraw the money from your account immediately you do n't even get the twenty to fifty day grace period   so those merchant fees are pure profit for schwab offsetting the loss from the atm fees    you claim $ 4 5k in fees at $ .25 each   that 's sixteen to twenty thousand transactions   assuming that several is four to five years that 's more than ten transactions a day   that seems like a lot   i can see three for meals one for miscellaneous and maybe some shopping   but if i go shopping one day i do n't normally go again for a while   i have trouble seeing a consistent average of five or more transactions a day    even if we use just the higher atm fees e.g. $ 2 that 's still more than a transaction a day   that 's an extreme level of usage particularly for someone who also makes frequent purchases via card    i have n't done any other business with them i find this confusing   how does money get into your account   at some point you must have deposited money into the account   you ca n't debit from an account without a positive balance   so you must have done or be doing some kind of business with them   if nothing else they can invest the balance that you deposit   note that they make a profit off such investments   they share some of that profit with you in the form of interest but not that much really    of course schwab may still be losing money on your transactions   we ca n't really tell without more information on how much of each transaction type you do and how much of a balance you maintain   perhaps they are hoping that you will do other more profitable activities in the future    i doubt there are that many schwab customers like you describe yourself   as best i 've been able to see they advertise their banking services just to investment customers   so it 's unlikely that many customers who do n't use their investment services use their banking services just for atm reimbursements

there are a few ways to look at this question assumptions per the original post 's assumptions this answer in other words if the owner paid the mortgage on its original schedule the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for $   200,000 of equity after 30   years   or the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for a $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years while the owner is paying down the mortgage the return on equity is the principal payment divided by the equity   the principal payment is the net rent minus non financing costs and interest so it is actually a profit the initial return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   210.70 monthly principal payment by the initial $   40,000 equity and converting from monthly return to annual return after 30 years the return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   810.70 monthly cash flow which is no longer reduced by mortgage payments by the $   200,000 equity after 30 years and converting from monthly return to annual return the cap rate is the same as the return on equity in the absence of debt   in this example   apr or   apy the return on equity declines from   apy initially to   apy after 30 years this is because the cap rate exceeds the note rate   apy vs.   apy and the leverage decreases from 5x to 1x the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the equity during the 30 years is   apy   per the original poster 's answer this is computed by taking the 30th root of the increase in equity   because the owner made no extra principal payments besides those already discussed the relevant amounts are the initial $   40,000 owner payment and the final $   200,000 owner equity     apy corresponds to a   apr the internal rate of return if the owner never sells can be computed by treating the deal as a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for an $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years   the internal rate of return irr is not a very useful number because it assumes that you can somehow reinvest the eventual dividends at the same rate   in this example the irr is   apr or   apy   in this example the irr is calculated by finding an interest rate for which initial investment 1 + irr ^ number periods before dividends start = periodic dividend irr growth rate of dividend   for example $   40,000 = $   810.70 0 = $   i then converted the   monthly irr to an annual irr the deal can be thought of as a return on equity plus a return on paying down the mortgage when computing the return from paying down the mortgage the initial equity is irrelevant   it does not matter whether you start with a $ 160,000 mortgage on a $   160,000 property a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   200,000 property or a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   1,000,000 property   all that matters is the note rate on the mortgage which is the applicable compound interest rate the return on paying down the mortgage equals the note rate of the mortgage   for a 4.5 note rate this works out to a annual percentage yield apy you can confirm this by looking at your amortization schedule   suppose you have a $   160,000 mortgage with a fixed 4.5 apr note rate for 360 months   your monthly payment is $   810.70   in the first month $   600 goes toward interest and $   210.70 reduces the principal   in other words the $   210.70 principal payment eliminated the need for a $ 810.70 payment 30 years later   notice that $ 210.70 1 + = $ 210.70 = $ 210.70 = $ which is within rounding error of $   810.70 the interest rate is   per month which is an apr of 4.5 and an apy of

it 's possible   our healthcare systems is a serious mess but universal healthcare could also make things worse   the problem is that our healthcare system is by a of regulations neither guarantee care to the most vulnerable nor allow the market mechanisms to work   the mises institute has a few good pieces on this here 's blog how government regulations made healthcare so expensive but to put it very simply the issue is we are letting bureaucrats run our healthcare instead of leaving medical choices to physicians     i 'd wager that nz physicians have greater freedom to practice than us ones but that 's only a guess   that 's the key though   medical choices need to be left up to doctors and patients whether we adopt a market oriented system or a universal care scheme   if this is n't done quality of care will be poor and costs direct or indirect will be high   at the end of the day we could screw up either approach     i will say that i 've read rand paul 's imo media doc not the current republican plan and it seems like a good example of practical market reforms

as i see it the two main considerations are   total amount of money received for which the key variable is life expectancy 0.8 = so at £ 86 week she would only be better off with the lump sum if she expected to live for less than years obviously none of us have a crystal ball but you could make some assessment based on her current health risk factors etc to see whether that seemed feasible also you do have to bear in mind that the value of £ 86 in 7 years time will be less than it is now but i guess the £ 86 would be inflation adjusted her need for income versus capital if she takes a lump sum and invests it in a house that is great but does n't provide any income at all if she has sufficient income from other sources and forecasts this other income to continue until her death then the lump sum might be more attractive but if not then she would need to be sure that she was n't tying up the money unnecessarily another option here would be using the lump sum to buy an annuity and it might be exploring this but i doubt whether the rates would be good enough to beat the £ 86 week she is being offered as an alternative another lesser consideration is her future entitlement to state funded care if needed in her later years if you have assets above a certain amount you are expected to fund your own care in which case having an expensive house might actually be more of a liability than a help

the biggest reason why one might want to leave 401k money invested in an ex employer 's plan is that the plan offers some superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere e.g. some mutual funds that are not open to individual investors such as s&p index funds for institutional investors these have expense ratios even smaller than the already low expense ratios of good s&p index funds or hot funds that are usually temporarily closed to new investors etc the biggest reason to roll over 401k money from an ex employer 's plan to the 401k plan of a new employer is essentially the same the new employer 's plan offers superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere of course the new employer 's   401k plan must accept such roll overs i do not believe that it is a requirement that a 401k plan must accept rollovers but rather an option that a plan can be set up to allow   for or not   another reason to roll over 401k money from one plan to another   rather than into an ira is to keep it safe from creditors if you are   sued and found liable for damages in a court proceeding the plaintiff can come after ira assets but not after 401k money   also you can take a loan from the 401k money subject to various rules about how much can be borrowed payment requirements etc which you can not from an ira that being said the benefits of keeping 401k money as 401k money must be weighed against the usually higher administrative costs and usually poorer and more limited choices of investment opportunities   available in most 401k plans as muro has said already

it seems like there are   a few different things going on here because there are multiple parties involved with different interests the car loan almost surely has the car itself as collateral so if you stop paying the bank can claim the car to cover their costs   since your car is now totaled however that collateral is essentially gone and your loan is probably effectively dead already   the bank is n't going let you keep the money against a totaled car   i suspect this is what the meant when he said you can not keep the car because of the loan the insurance company sounds like they 're going to pay the claim but once they pay on a totaled car they own it   they have some plan for how they recover partial costs from the wreck   that may or may not allow you or anyone else to buy it from them   for example they might have some bulk sale deal with a salvage company that does n't allow them to sell back to you they may have liability issues with selling a wrecked car etc   whatever is going on here should be separate from your loan and related to the business model of your insurance company   if you do have an option to buy the car back it will almost surely be viewed as a new purchase by the insurances company and your lender as if you bought a different car in similar condition

first it 's an exaggeration to say every dollar traditional mutual funds including money market funds keep a small fraction of their assets in cash for day to day transactions maybe 1 if you invest $ 1 they put that in the cash bucket and issue you a share if you and 999 other people invest $ 100 each   not offset by people redeeming they take the aggregated $ 100,000 and buy a bond or two conversely if you redeem one share it comes out of cash but if lots of people redeem   they sell some to cover those redemptions which works as long as the can in fact be sold for close enough to their recorded value and this does n't mean they ca n't fail even though they are almost totally invested in securities   that are thought to be among the safest and most liquid available   in sufficiently extreme circumstances those investments can fall in market value   or they can become illiquid and unavailable to cover withdrawals redemptions etfs are also fully invested but the process is less direct you do n't just send money to the fund company instead thus as long as the underlyings for your etf hold their value which for a money market they are designed to and the markets are open and the market maker firms are operating your etf shares are well backed see for more

this sometimes happens to me it depends on how liquid the option is normally what i see happening is that the order book itself around my order i interpret this to mean that the order book is primarily market makers they see a retail investor me come in and since they do n't have any interest in this illiquid option they back off some other retail investor or whatever steps in with a market order and we get matched up i get a fill because i become the market maker for a brief while on highly liquid options buy limits at the bid tend to get swallowed because the market makers are working the spread with very small orders a contract or two on very liquid options i 've had luck getting quick fills in the middle of the spread which i attribute to mm 's rebalancing their holdings on the cheap although sometimes i like to think there 's some other anal like me out there that hates to see such a lopsided book i have n't noticed any particular tendency for this to happen more with puts or calls or with buy vs sell transactions for a while i had a suspicion that this was happening with strikes where iv did n't match iv of other strikes but i never cared enough to chase it down as it was a minor part of my overall p l.

the mortgage i got last year through wells fargo explicitly indicates in its terms that excess payment will be considered against future payments i.e. pay $ 500 extra in january and you owe $ 500 less in february unless indicated otherwise it goes on to state that with electronic payments you do not get to specify where excess payment goes so excess payment made electronically always goes toward future payments if you want to make excess payments toward principal you must actually send them a check and your payment stub with the appropriate box   this wo n't be very different for other major banks i would n't imagine

the $ 20k limit seems to be from another answer the threshold for gofundme to report the campaign however such a report does not change the taxability of the income the income is either taxable or non taxable regardless of whether the amount is $ or $ this is a common misconception commonly seen when people think that income or gambling winnings are not taxable below $ 600 when in reality $ 600 is the threshold for issuing a form 1099 given that it would be foolish to close a wildly successful gofundme campaign because closing the campaign wo n't change the taxability of the income but it will probably cut off the continued donations you may have received with the amount of money at stake you should spend the couple hundred dollars to hire a cpa to look at your specific situation your uncle 's comments are not specific to your situation at best incorrect at worst so do n't hire him i do n't know what the median gofundme campaign raises but i strongly suspect it 's well below the $ donor reporting limit just because you have one campaign that 's gone viral enough to approach that limit does n't mean if you close that one and start a new one that it will go viral again especially if it 's under a new username

from some background reading i 'm doing it sounds like the union has people by the proverbial balls anyway even in an agency shop where union membership is optional non members must pay for the collective bargaining done by the union and union shop just means that the employer can hire anybody but they must join the union in order to be employed all of those seem to indicate that every worker in the represented class must accept the terms of the collective bargaining wiki   part of the reason that i 'm curious is that once i 've decided that i 'm done being an engineer i think it might be fun to teach but every time i hear about union negotiations it makes me think that operating in that system would be lame going from a world where merit is the primary differentiator to a world where years in the system count for more would kinda suck

profit has nothing to do with the level of interest rates is this correct in theory yes the difference that you 're getting at is called net interest margin as long as this stays constant so does the bank 's profit according to this article as long as the interest rate charged on loans does n't decline faster than the interest rate received on deposit accounts banks can continue to operate normally or even reduce their bad loan exposure by offering lower lending rates to already proven borrowers so banks may be able to acquire the same net interest margin with lower risk however the article also mentions new research from a federal agency their findings show that net interest margins get worse during low rate environments defined as any time when a country 's three month sovereign bond yield is less than 1.25 so in theory banks should remain profitable when interest rates are low but this may not actually be the case

is it equity or debt understanding the exact nature of one 's investment equity vs. debt is critical when one invests money in a company presumably incorporated or limited by buying some or all of it as opposed to lending money to the company then one ends up owning equity shares or stock in the company in such a situation one is a shareholder not a creditor as a shareholder one is not generally owed a money debt just by having acquired an ownership stake in the company shareholders with company equity generally do n't get to treat money received from the company as repayment of a loan unless they also made a loan to the company and the payment is designated by the company as a loan repayment rather shareholders can receive cash from a company through one of the following sources loan repayment is n't one of those options it 's only an option if one made a loan in the first place anyway each of those ways of receiving money based on one 's shares in a company has distinct tax implications not just for the shareholder but for the company as well you should consult with a tax professional about the most effective way for you to repatriate money from your investment considering the company is established overseas you may want to find somebody with the appropriate expertise

the different things in each calculator are showing you a bunch of different things in the roth ira calculator it is comparing what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a roth ira with what you would have in the end with a taxable account i.e. an investment outside of any iras in the traditional ira calculator the ira after taxes shows you what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a pre tax traditional ira the ira before taxes simply shows the same amount before you pay the taxes on withdrawal which is not a useful number so if you want to compare roth ira vs. traditional ira you want to compare the roth ira from the roth ira calculator and the ira after taxes from the traditional ira calculator but there are some things you need to be aware of to make a fair comparison because if you just plug in the same numbers you are going to get a very unfair comparison it will look like roth ira is a lot better even though it 's not the roth ira contribution is after tax whereas a pre tax traditional ira contribution is pre tax and an after tax dollar is much more than a pre tax dollar so if you put in the same nominal contribution amount you are actually contributing much more from your wallet in the roth ira case to make a fair comparison you would need to start with the same pre tax amount and put in a roth ira contribution amount that corresponds to the equivalent amount after taxes so for example a $ 5000 pre tax amount with 25 taxes is equivalent to $ 5000 0.75 = $ so you would put in $ 5000 for traditional ira contribution vs. $ for roth ira contribution note that if you have the same flat tax rate at contribution and at withdrawal pre tax traditional ira and roth ira are exactly the same and you can see this by putting in 25 for the retirement tax rate in the traditional ira calculator we already assumed 25 tax rate for roth ira when calculating the contribution you will see that traditional ira would be better in a lower retirement tax rate e.g. 15 whereas roth ira would be higher in a higher retirement tax rate

this is a short diagonal put spread generally you 're writing that long dated one at the money and buying the short dated one out of the money   the maximum amount that can be made is if the stock breaks out strongly to the upside and you keep the upfront credit minus whatever small amount it took to buy the april puts back   you can also make money if it breaks strongly to the downside but only if the credit when you opened your positions was more than $ 10 example   now say the stock falls to $ 500 by the time of that march expiration you 'd make $ on the march put and lose $ 100/share on the april put or a little more but that deep in the money there wo n't be much premium on it that 's a loss of $ 10/share or so i make a point of pointing this out because in that article i linked to the fact that your upfront credit needs to be greater than the strike spread in order to profit to the downside is not clearly mentioned

with no match the traditional 401(k for someone otherwise in the 15 bracket makes little sense i 'd suggest contributing just enough if you were in the 25 bracket to be in the taxable 15 but no more use a roth ira if you are saving more than that   i 'm adding this based on op 's statement that the fees on the 401(k range .8 1.4 i wrote an article are you in which i discuss how fees of this range negate the benefit of the mantra save at 25 to withdraw at 15 and if one were in the 15 bracket to start this level off fee will cost you money in no time at all   the people advising you to max out the 401(k first given the rest of your situation and that of the account are misguided i 'd given them the benefit of the doubt and assume they do n't have all the details   and with all due respect to the other posters here everyone of them a bright valued colleague your answers should be addressed to the op 's exact situation 15 bracket no match high fees i suspect some of answers will change on reviewing this

only select items first i agree beware the factor any of those items may very well lead to greater consumption which will impact your worse than your bottom line and in this category chips and snacks in general you 'll typically get twice the size bag for the same price as supermarket for a large family this might work ok if one is interested in saving on grocery items the very first step is to get familiar with the unit cost often cents per ounce of most items you buy warehouse store or not this knowledge will make you a better buyer   in general the toiletries are cheaper than at the store but not as cheap as the big sale coupon cost at the supermarket or pharmacy cvs so if you pay attention you may always be stocked up from other sources all that said there are many items that easily cover our membership cost for costco the meat beef $ i can pay up to $ 18 at the supermarket or big 12 to the lb $ easily $ 15 at fish dept funny i buy the carrots mentioned they are less than half supermarket price per lb so i am ahead if we throw out the last 1/4 of the bag more often than not it 's used up 100   truth is everyone will have a different experience at these stores costco will refund membership up to the very end so why not try it and see if the visit is worth it last year i read and wrote a review of a book titled the paradox of choice the book 's premise was the diminishing return that come with too many things to choose from in my review i observed how a benefit of costco is the lack of choice there 's one or two brands for most items not dozens if you give this a bit of thought it 's actually a benefit

while i ca n't say how it is in the philippines my wife the insurance broker leads me to believe that individual insurance is more expensive than group coverages in the us almost always   so much so that people will go to great to form any sort of business just to insure themselves if however it is cheaper ca n't you simply opt out of your employer 's plan   if you can opt out will your employer give you any of the money they are n't paying for your insurance if you ca n't opt out or if you paycheck does n't grow i ca n't see why you would want additional coverage especially at such a young age   should you lose your job in the near future and you worry about go get the insurance then edit one big advantage is if you get personal insurance you might need to get an exam to qualify and it is likely the younger you are the better you will qualify but again you already have insurance that covers you so i would advise keeping the group policy is probably better

in the case of wells fargo i believe that free trading is linked to your overall banking relationship with the firm so if you have a checking account with a balance of $ x or   a total relationship with the bank relationship is usually defined as loan balances + deposit balances over a certain amount they give you a like free stock trades the theory behind this approach is that banks want to be a one stop shop for you the idea is that they can market the banks products to you over a period of years lowering customer acquisition cost and offer you a level of convenience that allows them to charge a premium for services for example many people will pay a rate or fee premium on a mortgage or car loan so that they can do all of their business in one place in other cases free trading is linked to marketing campaigns by funds charles schwab started this with the no transaction fee mutual fund store many years ago transaction fees are actually paid for by the mutual funds who pay for placement in the program free etf trade programs are similar

i would recommend not paying it off early for 2 key reasons if you are a resident of the u.s. you get tax deductibility of mortgage interest which as pointed out in previous posts reduces the effective interest rate on your mortgage never in your life will you ever be allowed to obtain such high leverage at such a low rates you can probably get higher returns with not much risk @joetaxpayer mentioned various statistics regarding returns when investing in equities even though they are a decent bet over the long term you can get an even better risk reward tradeoff by considering municipal bonds if you are in the u.s. and invest in the municipal bonds of your state the interest income will be both federal and state tax free   in other words if you were making 3.5 investing in equities your after tax returns would be significantly less depending on your tax bracket whereas investment grade municipal bond etfs will yield probably the same or higher and have no tax they are also significantly less volatile even though they have default risk the risk is small since most of these bonds are backed by future tax obligations or other income streams derived from hard assets such as tolls or property furthermore an etf will have a portfolio of these bonds which will also dampen the impact of any individual defaults in essence you are getting paid this spread for simply having access to credit take advantage of it while you can

thank you for your service   my first suggestion since your car is a planned for the near future is keep that amount in savings and just pay cash there are plenty of attractive offers to entice you to finance your vehicle but there really is no compelling reason to do it considering the savings you have   second i would keep an additional portion of savings as a rainy day emergency fund how much is based mostly on what you feel comfortable with the number of possible emergencies that can come up is limited and your expenses are limited which is normal given your age this fund might be for something such as emergency travel for a sick family member cover a deductible for an auto accident whatever unforseen event might occur hence the name emergency fund what investments you are comfortable with will be determined by risk tolerance while in the military individual stocks that are aggressive risky investments may not be a good idea because of the extra attention they require and you ca n't really babysit a portfolio while deployed but there are many good low or no cost mutual funds or etfs that you could get into   i would look into setting up a recurring purchase with a set dollar amount monthly so you will continue to accumulate whatever option you are investing in regularly even if you are deployed which fund or etf you pick will depend on your goals and risk tolerance but you could very easily pick several for diversity good luck and thank you again for your service

first of all i am sorry for your loss at this time worrying about money is probably the least of your concerns it might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once and while that would be satisfying it would be a poor investment of your inheritance when you have debt you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open since you have on your student loan it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments you may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts the interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently this will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable you can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well you may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car but that would also not be a good idea at all you should shop for a vehicle based on your current income and not your savings i believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car it would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer if it is a certified used car you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty the biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401(k account find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions if possible max out or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching you should also stick with your job until you become fully vested the money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal and that age is currently 59 1/2 doing the math it would be around when you would be able to have access to that money you should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account or a money market account you say that your living situation will change in the next year as well take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can do n't make any unnecessary purchases try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out etc save as much as you can and put it into a savings account you can use that money to put a down payment on a house or for the security and first month 's rent try not to spend any money from your savings and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month do n't factor in your savings into it your savings should be treated as an emergency fund since you have just completed school and this is your first big job out of college your income will most likely improve with time it might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position you are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career this generally is true even if you are promoted at the by the same employer if you do leave your current job you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested even if that happened you would still keep the portion that you contributed

you should total the items first to get $ 3.00 then add the tax then round up down accordingly   your two examples above do n't offer this option even though your second example arrives at the same result   in your first example a number of items taxed one at a time might result in many results which would round to .01 a long enough list of items would result in an error of many cents depending how many items there are totaling first then applying tax results in your saving or losing cents maximum due to rounding   see a guide to sales and use tax which is a document put out by the massachusetts dept of revenue in the chart for tax it shows that $ is taxed at five cents but at 5 it would be so at least for this state i believe i correctly stated the rounding process

this is an all too common problem and is not easy to resolve divorce agreements do not alter prior mortgage contracts most importantly the bank is not required and will not normally remove the girlfriend from the mortgage even if she it to her ex if he has abandoned the property there is a good chance he will not make any more future payments she should be prepared to make the payments if he does n't or expect her credit to continue to deteriorate rapidly she needs to contact her divorce attorney to review their mutual obligations a court can issue orders to try to force the ex to fulfill the divorce agreement   however a court can not impose a change to the mortgage obligations the borrowers made to the bank focus on this it 's far more important than adding her to a car loan or credit card sorry for the bad news as for the car loan it 's best to leave her off the loan you will get better terms without her as a joint owner you can add her as an additional driver for insurance purposes adding her to your credit cards will help her credit but not a lot if the mortgage goes to default or foreclosure

you can increase your monthly cash flow in two ways it 's really that simple i 'd even argue that to a certain extent decreasing expenses can be more cash positive than increasing income by the same amount if you 're spending post tax money because increasing income generally increases your taxes so if you have a chunk of cash and you want to increase your cash flow you could decrease debt like chris suggested and it would have the same effect on your monthly cash flow or you could invest in something that pays a dividend or pays interest there are many options other than real estate including dividend paying stocks or funds cds bonds etc to get started you could open an account with any of the major brokerage firms and get suggestions from their financial professionals usually for free they 'll help you look at the risk reward aspects of various investments

you will get periodic statements from the bank telling you about interest paid and your current balance you should be fine unless you plan on becoming lost yourself if you 're worried about losing your mind back it up somewhere

the main pros are more than that they are   1 stability of prices and interest rates otherwise these would swing wildly with the economic cycle 2 guarantee of trustable legal tender otherwise what 's to say for sure that paper money would be any better than say paying in chicken feed 3 the employment and output effects of monetary policy 4 currency price stability relative to foreign currencies     also it might be a good idea to look who is in favor of central banks and who is against   in favor   all mainstream economists from any of the major schools keynesian austrian neo classical historical monetarist ect   against ron paul and right wing conspiracy nuts    also last time i checked currency value of the usd was n't really the us 's biggest problem even even a problem at all really also consider what currency actually is before worry about its value

a bank is putting money on the line for you when they loan you money which is not something they have to do not telling them what you intend to do with the money they are giving you when asked is fraud which if you are caught will put you into very deep trouble

most of the people who in will probably tell you to spend as little as possible on a car but that is a really personal decision since you live with your parents you can probably afford to waste a lot of money on a car on the other hand you already have a large income so you do n't really have the normal graduate excuses for deferring student loans and retirement savings for the sake of other people in a less comfortable position here is a more general algorithm for making the decision

yes the source is pushing a agenda and feeding whatever story they can coerce into that agenda yet the article directly linked the federal reserve economic well being us the numbers came from at the start of the second paragraph something news articles rarely do whether it be economics legal judgements or whatever hence the bullshit underneath is itself bullshit i just wish all such articles from all sources would do the same

how is this not a breach of contract is it just because the corporate entity you 're doing business with has gone out of business is n't the parent company still responsible   it seems to me that if it 's not there are a lot of ways that an unethical person company could game the system
# 545497
yes you will have to file taxes   each gets a standard deduction   by claiming you your parents are applying your standard deduction to their taxes meaning that you can not use that same deduction on your taxes   you still must pay taxes on your income   this generally works out best overall assuming that your parents are in a higher tax bracket have a higher income than you

gt my only argument is that the degree alone does n't define competence   of course but degrees determine interests   and it seems that you are trying extremely hard to not understand what i said if someone has degrees in music and has proven skill and knowledge in security i will hire them   but not as chief information security officer for this you need someone who took many specialized training and got their end dirty working designing planning and setting security systems   so we both agree mainly based on the stupid things that susan said that susan was not qualified for her job   gt i also never agreed that she got the job due to connections    so give me a possible way how susan got her job   gt hr   contractors on the other hand perfectly fine   omg contractor or temps or outsourcing is not fine especially by the hr department because it all means trying to save money on workers not giving any benefits or security and shoddy work   contractors except it are paid less than permanent employees   all i can wish for you that you will work as a contractor all your life and you will see how great it is yourself

so you feel the proper response is to people    perhaps you can watch the long version of what happened in this watch?v = = feel free to skip around if you want   the point is the police made the children were blocking them and the children were warned they were warned so many times it 's their own stupidity that got them pepper empty threats are empty beats a night stick to the head   i am worried about the that might occur when we have to fight off the black bloc idiots that want more free stuff   gt;what prevents a race to the bottom with wages and benefits if people do n't collectively bargain   what prevents public sector employees from outpacing wages and benefits of the private sector due to collective coercion they 're already doing it   we can not pay our debts by creating government jobs we can not continue to afford in a down economy let alone the lifetime benefits some of them get what happens when they collapse the system out of their own stupid greed   that seems to be the goal of many on the left   edit not sure if osha is actually getting cuts but eeoc is expanding and nlrb is really screwing things up

how should i allocate short term assets in a rising interest rate    environment assuming that the last part is correct there could be bear bond funds that short bonds that could work well as a way to invest however bear in that the the rising interest rate environment is part of the basis that may or may not be true in the end as i 'm not sure i 've seen anything to tell me why rates could n't stay where they are for another couple of years or more long term capital management would be a cautionary tale before about bonds that had assumptions that when something that was n't supposed to happen happened thus while you can say there is rising interest rate environment what else are you prepared to assume and how certain are you of that happening an alternate theory here would be that junk bonds may do well because the economy has to be heating up for rates to rise and thus the bonds that are priced down so much because of default risk may turn out to not go bust and thus could do well course this would carry the your mileage may vary and without a working time machine i could n't say which funds will be good and which would suck as for what i would do if i was dealing with my own money money market funds and cds would likely be my suggestion for the short term where i want to prevent principal risk this is likely what i would do if i believed the rising rate environment is here
