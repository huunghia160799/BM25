outside of a tax sheltered ira or 401(k type of account your transactions may trigger tax liability   however transactions are not taxed immediately at the time of the transaction and up to a certain limits capital gains can be offset by capital losses which can mitigate your liability at tax time   also remember that dividend receipts are taxable income as well as others have said this has nothing to do with whether or not money has been moved out of the account

taxes are triggered when you sell the individual stock       the irs does n't care which of your accounts the money is in   they view all your bank and brokerage accounts as if they are one big account together    that kind of is standard accounting practice for businesses p l balance sheets cash flow statements etc will cash accounts as cash   taxes are also triggered when they pay you a dividend   that 's why etfs are preferable to mutual funds etfs automatically fold the dividends back into the etf 's value so it does n't cause a taxable event   less paperwork   none of the above applies to retirement accounts   they are special   you do n't report activity inside retirement accounts because it would be very hard for regular folk to do that reporting so that would discourage them from taking iras    taxes are paid at withdrawal time or in roth 's never

it is not a dump question because it concerns your most important invisible financial partner the taxman the answer depends of the legal status of this account if your account is 401(k in usa or rrsp in canada the answer is no no capital gain taxes if your money is registered for retirement you 'll pay later on as taxes are like death unavoidable yes capital gain if your money is not in an retirement account as soon as you realize a capital gain it becomes taxable in that fiscal year

have a business plan even if this is just a piece of paper that you and your friend on you want a document that describes what you 're going to do and how you 're going to do it also have some note of how profits will be shared most likely this will be 50/50 but write it down   plan ahead and have some cash not every one of your expenses will be something you will know about in advance plan your expenses so that you have money to cover them but also have an emergency fund you can build this with the profits you get in the beginning in case your rake breaks and you do n't have a backup also if you use your emergency fund replace it   trust each other and communicate all businesses should run on trust you and your friend should trust that the other person is going to work hard and put in the work if you do n't trust that he will show up on time the burden falls to you and you will need to work harder if you 're having problems with him trust that you 'll be able to approach him be and respectful though and work it out    have fun ultimately starting a business like this should be fun yes the work may seem like a drag but if you and your friend are able to have fun while working you 'll enjoy it more and it wo n't seem so bad also do n't be afraid to spend your profits on yourselves i 'm not saying blow every dollar you make but going to dinner or going to see a movie together with your hard earned profits from that day 's work can make it all worth it   these are just some ideas that i came up with at my desk at work if you have any other questions feel free to pm me i 'm happy to help out good luck

you are faced with a dilemma if you use a 529 plan to fund your education the short timeline of a few years will limit your returns that are tax free most people who use a 529 plan either purchase years of tuition via lump sum when the child is young or they   put aside money on a regular basis that will grow tax deferred tax free some states do give a tax break when the contribution is made by a state taxpayer into a plan run by the state the long term plans generally use a risk profile that starts off heavily weighted in stock when the child is young and becomes more fixed income as the child reaches their high school years the idea is to protect the fund from big losses when there is no time to recover if you choose the plan with the least risk the issue is that the amount of gains that are being protected from federal tax is small if you pick a more aggressive plan the risk is that the losses could be larger than the state tax savings look at some of the other tax breaks for tuition to see if you qualify credits an education credit helps with the cost of higher education by    reducing the amount of tax owed on your tax return if the credit    reduces your tax to less than zero you may get a refund there are    two education credits available the american opportunity tax credit    and the lifetime learning credit who can claim an education credit there are additional rules for each credit but you must meet all    three of the following for either credit if you ’re eligible to claim the lifetime learning credit and are also    eligible to claim the american opportunity credit for the same student    in the same year you can choose to claim either credit but not both    you ca n't claim the if you were a nonresident alien for any part    of the tax year unless you elect to be treated as a resident alien for    federal tax purposes for more information about and foreign    students visit american opportunity tax credit information for    foreign students deductions tuition and fees deduction you may be able to deduct qualified education expenses paid during the    year for yourself your spouse or your dependent you can not claim    this deduction if your filing status is married filing separately or    if another person can claim an exemption for you as a dependent on his    or her tax return the qualified expenses must be for higher    education the tuition and fees deduction can reduce the amount of your income    subject to tax by up to $ 4,000 this deduction reported on form    tuition and fees deduction is taken as an adjustment to income this    means you can claim this deduction even if you do not itemize    deductions on schedule a form 1040 this deduction may be beneficial    to you if for example you can not take the lifetime learning credit    because your income is too high you may be able to take one of the education credits for your    education expenses instead of a tuition and fees deduction you can    choose the one that will give you the lower tax

i have a quick question about statement of cash flows and how account receivable net and affect it i 've already asked the accounting subreddit but was wondering if anyone who does fundamental analysis etc would have a take on it    it stems from a homework problem where i have to a cash flow statement using two comparative balance sheets end of period 2013 and end of period 2014 and a change in retained earnings statement   the following transaction took place in 2014    the firm wrote off accounts receivable as totaling $ in 2013 and $ in 2014 it recognized expired insurance of $ in 2013 and $ 3,900 in 2014   my understanding is that the write offs have already been subtracted in order to yield account receivable net and therefore i can just take the change in that account and make the appropriate entry   for the recognition of expired insurance i can simply take the change in the prepayment account and record the appropriate cash flow entry   am i correct in assuming this or did they give me those amounts in order to figure out accounts receivable gross and take the change in that

number 2 can not occur you can buy the call back and sell the stock but the broker wo n't force that 2 choice to trade options you must have a margin account no matter how high the stock goes once in the money the option is n't going to rise faster so your margin is not an issue   and your example is a bit troublesome to me why would a $ 120 strike call spike to $ 22 with only a month left you 've made the full $ 20 on the stock rise and given up any gain after that that 's all the call owner may exercise at any time edit is right there are circumstances where an option price can increase faster than the stock price options pricing generally follows the black scholes model since the op gave us the current stock price option strike price and time to expiration and we know the risk free rate is < 1 you can use the calculator to change volatility the number two scenario wo n't occur however because a covered call has no risk to the broker they wo n't force you to buy the option back and the option buyer has no motive to exercise it as the entire option value is time premium

it 's pretty simple the 10 is any savings for retirement   preferably it 's in a retirement account but that 's not mandatory it 's great that you save for a vacation computer house deposit etc but that 's not what these articles are referencing   edit in response to the running comments on 's answer the mortgage issue is worth further discussion i 'm saving toward a home purchase it may be $ 50 k saved but that 's not money for retirement the house savings never is i get the $ 200 k mortgage my balance sheet is net neutral less fees closing costs of course but my retirement savings again is unchanged i put $ 10 k toward principal the balance sheet again is $ 10 k better but retirement account unchanged last i pay off the mortgage retirement account unchanged but my retirement budget requirement is $ 1000/mo less the mortgage payment and my number drops by $ 300 k or so this is based on the 4 rule to withdraw $ 1000/mo requires $ 300 k in retirement assets it may seem pedantic but there 's an important distinction to be made here it 's easy to distinguish retirement savings from all other wise financial transactions paying debt off is wise but not retirement savings any actions that reduce your ongoing expenses clearly wise and it reduces the number needed to cover your retirement budget but it 's distinct from retirement savings for those that enjoy the intellectual exercise of insisting there 's always a grey area i 'll give it to you the family with 3 kids in the $ 1.2 m 5 bedroom house the parents know they will move into their paid off summer house upon retiring and sell this family house in his wisdom hubby has planned for the mortgage to be paid in full well ahead of retirement and for purposes of planning only view the house as worth $ the house does have a relationship to the retirement savings but the action of planning for alice 's retirement the maid they will no longer need once they move is not savings but rather an adjustment down in their retirement budget   i think you 'll find most conflicts regarding this issue resolved by understanding this distinction

as you can see by his username this guy works in it   i will explain for those who are n’t in the industry   in it demand for employees has never been higher   it is crazy right now this means it is hard to get talent particularly good talent which can be many times more productive than bad ones   now amazon is a tech company fundamentally   what many may not realize is amazon is also the world ’s largest hosting platform too   for example reddit and netflix are on their systems   so they are n’t just a store they do a lot of everyone else 's tech too   this means they need a shit tonne of good tech and related people   so the location will likely hinge on where the can find good staff   however as op just said amazon has a terrible reputation in the industry   so this makes this even more difficult as everyone hates them and no one will move for them and they need a lot of good people which are in high demand elsewhere   this is what their decision will rest on   tax breaks and all are perks but they need to find 50,000 experienced employees to fill this thing everything else is secondary

granted this is an article on argentina 's debt but something that is not mentioned here is how vulture funds work it is my understanding that vulture funds purchase debt which is considered weak or on the verge of default at discounted prices with the sole intention of holding out on the debt and blocking any settlements until they can get significantly higher payment on their bonds than their original investment plus interest on the amount plus profits essentially then vulture funds sole purpose is to profit off financially distressed debtors so the court is ruling that all the shareholders who agree to the payout must wait until those shareholders that do not agree to the payout are those shareholders who bought their debt cheap from debt holders that   wanted to sell and get out while the getting out was good so much for the concept of risk or investing into the project that speculators and financiers out whenever they want to describe the benefits their activities bring to the economy

as a minor you certainly can pay tax the government wants its cut from you just like everyone else however you do get the personal allowance like everyone else so you wo n't have to pay income tax until your net income reaches £ that 's the figure for the tax year from april 2015 to april 2016 it 'll probably change in future years once you 're 16 you will also have to pay national insurance which is basically another tax at a lower threshold the current rates are £ if you are making £ a year or more and also 9 on any income above £ up to £ your net income or profits are the income you receive minus the expenses you have to support that income note that the expenses must be entirely for the business they ca n't be for personal things the most important thing to do immediately is to start keeping accurate records keep a list of the income you receive and also the expenses you pay for hardware etc make sure you keep receipts perhaps just electronic ones for the expenses so you can prove they existed later keep track of that net income as the year goes on and if it starts collecting at the rate you 'd have to pay tax and national insurance then make sure you also put aside enough money to pay for those when the bill comes there 's some good general advice on the government 's website here in short as well as keeping records you should register with the tax office hmrc as a sole trader this should be something that anyone can do whatever their age but it 's worth calling them up as soon as you can to check and find out if there are any other issues they 'll probably want you to send in tax returns containing the details of your income and expenses if you 're making enough money it may be worth paying an accountant to do this for you

there are a few main economic reasons given why investors show a strong home bias interestingly though if you ask investors about the future of their home country compared with other countries they will generally though not always significantly overestimate the future of their own country   it is difficult to definitively say what drives investors but this psychological home bias could be one of the larger factors edit in response to the bounty maybe this vanguard article on their recommended international exposure is what you are looking for though they only briefly speculate about why people so consistently show a home bias in investing   the wikipedia article mentioned above has some very good references and while there may be no complete answer with the certainty that you seek as there are as many reasons as there are investors a combination of the above list seems to capture much of what is going on across different countries

this depends on a combination of factors what are you charged call it margin interest to hold the position how does this reduce your buying power and what are the opportunity costs what are the transaction costs alternative ways to close the position what are your risks exposure while out for alternative ways to close finally where is the asset closing relative to the strike generally if asset price is below the put strike then the call expires worthless and you need to exercise the put if asset is above the call strike then put expires worthless and you 'll likely get assigned   given this framework   if margin interest is eating up your profit faster than you 're earning theta a convenient way to represent the time value then you have some urgency and you need to exit that position before expiry i would not exit the stock until the call is covered keep minimal risk at all times if you are limited by the position 's impact on your buying power and probable value of available opportunities is greater than the time decay you 're earning then once again you have some urgency about closing instead of unwinding at expiry same as above cover that call before you ditch your hedge in the long stock playing the tradeoff game of expiration exercise cost against open market transactions is tough you need sub penny commissions on stock and i would say a lot of leverage and most importantly you need options charges much lower than ib to make that kind of trading work ib is the cheapest in the retail brokerage game but those commissions are n't even close to what the traders are getting who are more than likely on the other side of your options trades

alright my dude i looked over it   not sure what the project proposal is so it 's hard to sanity check your numbers you also do n't include a growth percentage in those operations so i assume that is correct or under contract and i have no idea if the 250k year is reasonable for library materials on the but i would totally expect the internal service charges to vary would you expect either model to effect them more why or why not and provide a model for   also you have some english i would recommend you clean up before sharing good luck

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

theory of levered investing borrowing in order to increase investment exposure is a time honored and legitimate activity   it 's the optimal way to increase your exposure according to finance theory which assumes you get a good interest rate more on this later   in your case it may or may not be a good idea   based on the information in your post i believe that in your case it is not a good idea   consider the following concerns risk in finance reward comes with risk and in no other way   investing borrowed money means there is a good not small chance that you will lose enough money that you will need to pull significant wealth from your own savings in order to make up the difference   if you are in a position to do this and ok with that possibility then proceed to to the next concern   if losing a lot of money means financial calamity for you then this is a bad idea   you have n't described your financial situation so i do n't know in which camp you fall   if the idea of losing say $ 100 k means complete financial failure for you then the strategy you have described simply has too much risk make no mistake just because the market makes money on average does not mean it will make money or as much money as you expect over your horizon   it may lose money perhaps a lot of money make sure this idea is very clear in your mind before taking action rewards your post implies that you think you can reliably get on an investment this is not the case   there are many years in which a reasonable portfolio makes this much or more but on average you will earn less no ones knows the true long term market risk premium but it is definitely less than 10   a better guess would be 6.5 plus whatever the risk free rate is currently about 0   buying riskier investments means from the optimal portfolio meaning you took on more risk than is justified by how much extra money you expect to make   i never encourage people to invest based on optimistic or unrealistic goals   if anything you should be conservative about how you expect things to go   and remember these are averages any portfolio that earns also has a very good chance of losing 25 or more   people who sell or give advice on investments frequently get you charged up by pointing at times and investments that have done very well   unfortunately we never know whether the investments and time period in which we are investing will be a good one a bad one or an one   the reality of investing is well more realistic than what you have described costs i ca n't imagine how you could borrow that much money and only have an annual payment of $ 2000 as you imply that must be a mistake   no individual borrows at a rate significantly below 1   it sounds like it 's not a collateralized loan of any kind so unless you are some kind of prime loan customer your interest rate will be significant   subtract whatever rate you actually pay from 6.5 to get a rough idea of how much you will make if things go as well as they do on average   you will pay the interest whether times are good or bad if your rate is typical of personal loans there 's a good chance you will lose money on average using the strategy you have described   if you are ok with taking risk with a negative expected return consider a trip to las vegas   it 's more exciting ethics i 'm not one to make people feel guilty for doing things that are legal but of questionable morality   if that 's the case and you are ok with it more power to you i 'm not sure under what pretense you expect to obtain the money but it sounds like you might be crossing legal lines and committing actual crimes like fraud   make sure to check on whether what you intend is a white lie or something that can get you thrown in prison for example if you are proposing obtaining a subsidized education loan and using it for speculation i could easily see you spending serious time in prison and permanently ruining your life even if your plan works out   a judge and 12 of your peers are not going to think welfare fraud is a harmless twist of the truth summary i 've said a lot of negative things here   this is because i have to guess about your financial situation and it sounds like you may have unrealistic expectations of the safety and generosity of investing   quite frankly people for whom borrowing $ 250 k is no big deal do n't normally come and ask about it on stackexchange and they definitely do n't tend to lie in order to get loans   also $ 18 k a year does n't change their quality of life however i do n't know   if $ 250 k is small relative to your wealth and you need a good way to increase your exposure to the market risk premium then borrowing and investing may well be a good idea

the fed controls the base interest rate for lending to banks it raises this rate when the economy is doing well to limit inflation and lowers this rate when the economy is doing poorly to encourage lending raising the interest rate signals that the fed believes the economy is strong strengthening    obviously it 's more complicated than that but that 's the basic idea

there is a lot misinformation in this thread that i 'd like to clear up in fact you 're more than welcomed to pm me if you wish to see any backup to the statements i 'm about to make    first i 'd like to say that as an uber lyft driver the experience has been nothing short of i normally work in the l.a. and areas of so cal and the amount of interesting super successful and wonderful people i meet on a daily basis is off the charts it 's as if i 'm some sort of talk show host on wheels    initially i applied for lyft as the social and community angle of its service intrigued the hell out of me i 'm an outgoing guy and i 'm also an artist of some type who receives a royalty check only once a month instead of doing and begging for money i thought doing lyft would be a great idea instead so far my customers have been nothing short of an inspiration anyway after passing a background check a driving test with my mentor a driving record check alongside submitting all my documentation license registration insurance and a quick vehicle inspection my car is rather new and in great condition i was hired quickly    that same day i decided to get to work quickly see how the whole system works as soon as i got to the destination i wanted to get to i got my first call on my phone within 5 minutes i use my gps and rush to pick my customer up while obeying all traffic laws of course after a couple of minutes of chit chat i come to find out my first lyft customer ever is an uber recruiter she likes my car and my approach so she hands me a uber black bag with an iphone a car charger and a mount i asked her if this means i have to work exclusively for uber she says nope   my eyes then light up like some medieval lights in the sky chicken little for the ancient aliens approved phenomena when i realize i 'll have access to both customer bases just one week removed from not being able to pay my phone bill    after submitting a background check a driving record check and pretty much all the stuff lyft asked for i was driving for both uber and lyft a week after i was hired for lyft    the good news for you the consumer is that both companies are being cut throat because they want your money there 's never been a better time to hitch a ride on the cheap both companies have thrown millions of dollars over the past couple of months through social media   driver bonuses and other venues so you 're able to get a free ride or a deep discount off a long ride   if you have n't tried both services now 's the time do n't want to risk getting a dui just for driving down a couple of blocks to your favorite bar this weekend you 'll probably be able to get a free ride there if you gently for specials and pay between $ 7 13 for the trip back better than getting your car losing your license and paying $ 10,000 + in penalties and court fees eh you have no idea how many poor i take to and from work who ca n't drive because they just got a and who are now $ 25 35 per ride just to get to where they got ta go      insurance   as for insurance both companies have given me supplemental insurance i have full coverage on my car for when i 'm off the clock which was required at time of hiring btw so here 's how the insurance for lyft and uber works    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability    1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury   1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury   1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination    excessive liability amp um   1 up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive    1 up to $   $ 2500 deductible    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability   1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury 1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury 1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination   excessive liability amp um   up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive   up to $ $ 1000 deductible   other than the deductible as you can see both plans are pretty much the same which in my opinion should be more than enough    services amp expectations   both apps are easy to use and within 5 10 minutes sometimes much sooner there 've been many times where i get a call and the customer is on the sidewalk a few feet from where i was parked waiting for my next call both passengers and drivers adhere to a rating system as of today if either driver or passenger fail to maintain a rating of 4.6 and above they risk being booted from using the app so it 's important that drivers know what the hell they are doing like being courteous respectful professional clean and know how to use a gps while driving accurately and safely and/or knowing their routes and passengers should also be polite respectful very important since drivers are n't also do n't be so drunk that you either pass out or throw up in the back and make sure that if your bring your friends along for the ride that they adhere to the code of conduct expected of passengers i 've run into numerous instances where an otherwise perfect passenger gets dinged for their drunk and/or rude friends     also as a driver for your insurance to work do n't ever end a drive early because you made a wrong turn or were late for a pick up you 're risking an insurance hiccup in the event of an incident and passengers should also make sure that their driver has their app online throughout the entire trip as well as making sure the driver 's pic of him her and his her car match the profile you see on the app    as for safety i 've yet to hear from a passenger they felt they were ever in immediate danger did they get a creepy vibe from one of their drivers sure not everyone is a social butterfly and there has been an of ex cab drivers going over to uber which is good cause the service is getting pro drivers with experience but could prove detrimental since they 're gon na have a hard time competing with lyft on the charisma side of things    however i 've already numerous accounts from young women in hollywood who are now refusing to call for a yellow cab or taxis on hollywood blvd and sunset and the surrounding areas due to unwelcome sexual advances by drivers looking to take advantage of their sometimes solitary and drive home it 's and great to hear whenever you drop one of these young women off at their places and they thank you for being both professional courteous welcoming and above all else trustworthy all while paying a fraction of the cost of what a cab would normally run at that time of night    my personal experience in summary   i 'm literally having the time of my life my other job requires me to interact with humanity pick its brain and then express those experiences to everyone else in an positive and inspirational manner what better way to do it while earning some decent money than driving around for uber and lyft    these services are without a doubt revolutionary and are being used and employed by both young and old men and women struggling students and strategically utilized by incredibly wealthy and successful hollywood types and investment bankers it 's cheap reliable and very fun too it 's also bringing back the long lost art of human interaction and conversation back into our daily lives    so far so good and it breaks my heart whenever i hear misinformation and astroturfing about these services throughout the internet and i 'm supremely as to how certain municipalities are colluding with taxi cab lobbies to prevent uber and lyft and other ride share services from competing fairly at a time where cities are desperate to ease reduce dui 's and make sure their citizens are happy and are left with more money in their

as others have said if you do n't have dependents there 's little need for life insurance if you ca n't think of any obvious beneficiary for an insurance policy than you probably do n't need one dependents here should be understood broadly it would n't necessarily be limited to wife and children if you 're the only support for your handicapped cousin for example you might want to provide for him but i take it from your question that you have no such special case of course even if you have no dependents now you might pick some up in the future and if and when that does happen your medical situation may have changed making it difficult to get life insurance but if you have no immediate plans so that any such even is likely to be far away a serious alternative to consider would be to invest the money you would have paid in insurance premiums then if someday you do acquire dependents you have a pot of money set aside to provide for them in case something happens to you if it 's not enough and you can get insurance at that time then great but if you ca n't get insurance at least there 's something if you never do acquire dependents you can consider that pot of money part of your retirement fund

from the banks point of view the point of a current account like this is to get you as a regular customer they want to be your main bank the bank you interact with the most the bank you turn to first when you need financial products and services the bank whose advertising you see every time you log into online banking or walk into a branch the bank knows that if they just offer the high interest rate or other perks with no strings that people will open the account and dump a bunch of savings in it but wo n't actually move their financial life over their old bank will still be their main bank so they strings like a required minimum deposit a minimum number of direct debits and similar these have minimal effect on people actually using the account as their main current account while being a pain for people trying to game the system of course as you point out it is still possible to game the system but they do n't need to make gaming the system impossible they just need to make it enough that most people wo n't bother

condensed to the essence if you can reliably get more income from investing the cost of the house than the mortgage is costing you this is the safest leveraged investment you 'll ever make there 's some risk of course but there is risk in any financial decision taking the mortgage also leaves you with far greater flexibility than if you become rich but cash poor note that you probably should n't be buying at all if you may need geographic flexibility in the next five years or so that 's another part of the liquidity issue also it does n't have to be either or i borrowed half and paid the rest in cash though i could have taken either extreme because that was the balance of certainty that i was comfortable with i also took a shorter mortgage than i might have again trading off risk and return i decided i would rather have the house paid off at about the same time that i retire

why would anyone ever get a 15 year instead of just paying off a 30 year in 15 years because the rate is not the same never that i 've seen in my 30 years of following rates i 've seen the rate difference range from .25 to .75 in march 15 the average rate in my area is 30yr 3.75 15yr 3.00 for a $ 150 k loan this puts the 15yr payment at $ with the 30 at higher rate paid in 15 years at $ 1091 this $ 55 difference can be considered a flexibility premium as it offers the option to pay the actual $ in any period the money is needed elsewhere   if the rate were the same i 'd grab the 30 and since i ca n't say invest the difference i 'd say to pay at a pace to go 15 unless you had a cash flow situation a spouse out of work an emergency that you funded with a high interest rate loan etc the advice to have an emergency fund is great until for whatever reason there 's just not enough   on a personal note i did go with the 15 year mortgage for our last refinance i was nearing 50 at the time and it seemed prudent to aim for a mortgage free retirement

you will maximize your expected wealth by investing all the money you intend to invest as soon as you have it available do n't let the of dollar cost averaging induce you to allocate more much money to a savings account than is optimal   if you want the positive expected return of the market do n't put your money in a savings account   that 's especially true now when you are certainly earning a negative real interest rate on your savings account dollar cost averaging and putting all your money in at the beginning would have the same expected return except that if you put all your money in earlier it spends more time in the market so your expected return is higher   your volatility is also higher because your savings account would have very low volatility but your preference for investment tells me that you view the expected return and volatility tradeoff of the stock market as acceptable if you need something to help you feel less stress about investing right away think of it as dollar cost averaging on a yearly basis instead of monthly   further you take take comfort in knowing that you have allocated your wealth as you can instead of letting it away in real terms in a bank account

one of things i 've learned about trading on the stock market is not to let your emotions get to you greed and fear are among them you may be overthinking why not keep it simple if you think it can go up to $ 300 a share put in a stop loss at $ x amount where you would secure your invested money along with some gains if it goes up let it go up if it does n't well you got an exit   then if it goes up change your stop loss amount higher if you are feeling more optimistic about the stock   and by the way a disciplined investor would stick to their strategy but also have the to rethink it on the fly such as in a situation like you are in just in my opinion anyway but congrats on the gain some gains are better than none

what you need to know about estate magazines including why you may need a will and assigning a power of attorney   1 no matter your net worth it 's important to have a basic estate plan in place   such a plan ensures that your family and financial goals are met after you die   2 an estate plan has several elements   they include a will assignment of power of attorney and a living will or health care proxy medical power of attorney for some people a trust may also make sense when putting together a plan you must be mindful of both federal and state governing estates   3 taking inventory of your assets is a good place to start   your assets include your investments retirement savings insurance policies and real estate or business interests ask yourself three questions whom do you want to inherit your assets whom do you want handling your financial affairs if you 're ever whom do you want making medical decisions for you if you become unable to make them for yourself   4 everybody needs a will   a will tells the world exactly where you want your assets distributed when you die it 's also the best place to name for your children dying without a will also known as dying can be costly to your heirs and leaves you no say over who gets your assets even if you have a trust you still need a will to take care of any holdings outside of that trust when you die   5 trusts are n't just for the wealthy   trusts are legal mechanisms that let you put conditions on how and when your assets will be distributed upon your death they also allow you to reduce your estate and gift taxes and to distribute assets to your heirs without the cost delay and publicity of probate court which administers wills some also offer greater protection of your assets from creditors and lawsuits   6 discussing your estate plans with your heirs may prevent disputes or confusion   inheritance can be a loaded issue by being clear about your intentions you help potential conflicts after you 're gone   7 the federal estate tax exemption the amount you may leave to heirs free of federal tax is now set permanently at $ 5 million indexed for inflation   in 2013 estates under $ 5.25 million are exempt from the tax amounts above that are taxed up to a top rate of 40   8 you may leave an unlimited amount of money to your spouse tax free but this is n't always the best tactic   by leaving all your assets to your spouse you do n't use your estate tax exemption and instead increase your surviving spouse 's taxable estate that means your children are likely to pay more in estate taxes if your spouse leaves them the money when he or she dies plus it defers the tough decisions about the distribution of your assets until your spouse 's death   9 there are two easy ways to give gifts tax free and reduce your estate   you may give up to $ 14,000 a year to an individual or $ 28,000 if you 're married and giving the gift with your spouse you may also pay an unlimited amount of medical and education bills for someone if you pay the expenses directly to the institutions where they were incurred   10 there are ways to give charitable gifts that keep on giving   if you donate to a charitable gift fund or community foundation your investment grows tax free and you can select the charities to which contributions are given both before and after you die

inflows to the us equity market can come from a variety of sources for instance you were paid a year end bonus and decided to invest it in us equities instead of foreign equities bonds savings or debt reduction you sold foreign equities bonds or other non us equities and decided to invest in us equities you decided a better use of cash in a savings account cd or money market fund was to invest in us equities if for every buyer there 's a seller does n't that also mean that    there were $ in outflows in the same time period not necessarily generally the mentions we see of inflows and outflows are net that is the gross investment in us equities minus gross sales of us equities equals net inflows or outflows the mere fact that i sold my position in say caterpillar does n't mean that i had to re invest in us equities i may have bought a bond or a cd or a house because of fluctuations in existing stocks market value bankruptcies and new issues us equities never are and never will be a zero sum game

for restricted stock i think the vesting date meets the requirements of the second wash sale trigger from irs pub 550 wash sales acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade i base this on these two quotes from irs pub 525 restricted property any income from the property or the right to use the property is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property until the property becomes substantially vested it is owned by the person who makes the transfer to you usually your employer   so on the vest date the transfer is taxable ownership is transferred to you that seems close enough to a fully taxable trade for me   maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date see pub 525 restricted property choosing to include in income for year of transfer obviously if this is important you should consult your tax advisor   technicalities aside i do n't think it passes the sniff test you 're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests if you 're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date that smells like a wash sale to me

it starts here   you said you are a high earner but high is relative this tax table will show what marginal rate you have for your taxable income look at your 2015 return to get a better idea what taxable means vs gross income for starters with a standard deduction and just the two of you $ 20 k comes off your gross even so let 's assume you are in the marginal 25 bracket   the w4 form does offer instructions on how to calculate how much extra to withhold but to your point and brilliant criticism of the process withholding is not available as a percent only as normal withholding i.e. if spouse 's income were a flat predictable number or as an extra fixed number per check   you shared with us in your other question she expects to earn $ the average of these 2 numbers is $ 11 k which at 25 is $ i 'd divide that over the number of checks remaining this year 20 and just withhold that much extra use your tax software from last year or an online calculator and in 3 months see if you are on track you can adjust the w4 any time to get as close to the actual total year tax due as you 'd like my answer focuses on the adjust repeatedly part of keshlam 's own answer his quarterly payments suggestion also works and you might prefer it in general mine would only take 1 2 adjustments per year at most   if you withhold too much as most people seem to do you 'll get it back when you file but worst case you withhold $ and she makes just $ 8000 this is $ too much the average refund is over $ 3000 too little and mhoran 's answer explains when you 'd owe a penalty

for a $ 350 monthly payment she is currently paying $ 200 monthly in interest you say that no bank will refinance her but that is not true i 'm sure many banks are happy to refinance her to the value of the car she should start that process you 'll find that your suggestion to pay $ 5000 down on the current loan is pretty similar to what she would need to bring to a bank to refinance maybe as much as $ 7000 to refinance after that she would be paying a much lower amount in interest and she could still retire the loan a year or two but she would be paying even less in interest the advantage to borrowing from her emergency fund is that she retires the loan 14 months earlier the problem is that you are prioritizing the least amount paid and she is prioritizing an emergency fund emergency funds are also very important you might have better success if you prioritize paying back the emergency fund in your plan if she puts $ 7000 down to refinance assume a 3 year loan at 4.5 with a $ 150 monthly payment instead of paying down the remaining $ 5000 quickly what if she put the extra $ 200/month toward paying back her emergency fund it would take the same 3 years to fully pay it back without impacting the rest of her budget at all if she has extra room in her budget she could pay back that emergency fund even faster many of us who prioritize minimizing interest paid and maximizing interest earned already have a robust emergency fund your girlfriend is n't wrong to value that unexpected emergencies can cause much more interest to be paid if there is no way to deal with them that 's how paycheck and title lenders capture their customers talk to her about what emergencies she might need the money for and make a plan to replenish the fund and you 're much more likely to have her buy in

elliott was arguing from the position of an original creditor   they still had the same rights and obligations as if they bought the bond directly from the government   so buying the bonds at a huge discount did not mean that they gave up rights under the law   would your opinion differ if it was the original bondholders in the lawsuit and not these vulture funds   think of it this way elliott paid less because the original bondholders rights were judged by the market to be unlikely to result in being paid in full   but paying less did not extinguish any of the original bondholders rights    and anytime a bond holder is forced to accept modified terms that they did not agree to the borrower is unilaterally changing the terms   there is an argument that this is necessary for businesses and individuals but sovereigns that can raise revenue as a matter of policy have no excuse

it 's not unusual undesirable if everyone prepaid their mortgage banks would not like this but we 're in no danger of that also the amount you are pre paying is not so significant as to make them pay special attention in many cases when a borrower pre pays they will not continue to do so over the life of the loan since it 's so easy to stop at any time and the extra payments are voluntary depending on who originated the it might be sold even more often than in your case it 's no longer commonplace for a bank to hold a mortgage to maturity now that banks and other institutions have separated the origination of the loan from its servicing it 's likely that your mortgage was bundled with others through a process called securitization and will be bought sold based on the bank 's need for or to balance out the maturity of its assets and liabilities whether they need more cash now versus later or based on the types of ways your bank has decided that it wants to make money versus farming out other types of business to others what would substantially change the value of your mortgage to a bank is if it were performing ie you are paying on time but then became non performing ie you fall behind in your payments it 's also possible that if you have a very small mortgage or principal balance that there is very little risk to the bank and little difference between the present and future values of your loan but banks do n't typically make these types of transactions based on the characteristics of an individual loan

in the uk at least dealers definitely want you to take finance they get benefits from the bank which are not for doing this these benefits translate directly to increased commission and internal rewards for the individual salesman it 's conceivable that the salesman will be less inclined to put himself out for you in any way by your deal as much as you 'd like if he 's not going to get incentives out of it indeed since he 's taking a hit on his commission from you paying in cash it 's in his best interests to perhaps be with you during price negotiation so will the salesman be frustrated with you if you choose to pay in cash yes absolutely though this may manifest in different ways in some cases the dealer will offer to pay off the finance for you allowing you to pay directly in cash while the dealer still gets the bank referral reward so that everyone wins this is a behind the scenes secret in the industry which is not made public for obvious reasons it 's arguably on fraud if the salesman likes you and trusts you then you may be able to get such an arrangement if this does not seem likely to occur i would not go out of my way to disclose that i am planning to pay with cash that being said you 'll usually be asked very early on whether you are seeking to pay cash or credit the salesman wants to know for the reasons outlined above and there is little use lying about it when you 're shortly going to have to come clean anyway

yes merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card for a credit card transaction interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer this is why australians are seeing a boom in debit mastercard visa cards the issuing banks make income when you select credit   these costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a credit card fee for an transaction the interchange flows the other way from the card issuer to the acquiring bank the merchant 's bank   as an aside the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in australia restrict you from selecting credit with a scheme debit card mastercard and visa are schemes   they are in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit savings and pay if you hit credit therefore where you can hit either credit or savings they prefer and may force you to press savings

1 yes in theory that is right minus any state taxes as well        2 they could since there is an unknown amount outside of the us and probably it will be a percentage and not all most of these companies that make a difference are already international companies        3 they would most likely still do it for any money kept offshore and it does n't prevent them from continuing to do it again i did n't say this was a good solution they are just hoping to ward off economic collapse a little longer by doing this or perhaps hire more accountants to be able to look at their books to figure out how much they are hiding to punish them there could be many motivations for doing this tax but i doubt any of the motivations intend to stop it from continuing to happen after the tax the problem is any company that takes advantage of it basically says yes i broke the law in this amount thus it might be a good way to get a list of companies to audit more thoroughly

just came across this news companies moving abroad no substitute corporate tax reform how stop article they make it sound quite straight forward and i do n't think they can be called totalitarian leftists by any stretch   here is the money quote   gt america ’s corporate tax has two horrible flaws the first is the tax rate which at 35 is the highest among the 34 mostly rich country members of the oecd yet it raises less revenue than the oecd average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to nascar race tracks last year these breaks cost $ 150 billion in forgone revenue more than half of what america collected in total corporate taxes gt   gt the second flaw is that america levies tax on a company ’s income no matter where in the world it is earned in contrast every other large rich country taxes only income earned within its borders here too america ’s system is absurdly ineffective at collecting money firms do not have to pay tax on foreign profits until they bring them back home not surprisingly many do not american multinationals have some $ 2 trillion sitting on their foreign balance sheets and growing    it seems clear that the 35 rate is not the driving reason for these huge companies doing inversions that 35 rate should almost certainly be cut down but the loopholes and tax breaks need to stop as a condition of a rate cut    clearly this is not a dead simple issue but i just do n't want to hear the silly argument of oh our poor mega corporations are having to pay the highest taxes in the world when the tax environment in the us is clearly rigged in their favor small and mid sized companies that ca n't afford their own congressman sure are getting fucked though and that makes me sad

zero ten grand somewhere in the middle it depends your stated salary in u.s. dollars would be high five figures you certainly should not be starving but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement money can indeed be tight month to month at that salary level especially since even in you 're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most u.s. markets edit actually apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on food

i assume you are referring to multi level marketing which have organizational structures that look like pyramids   as others have pointed out ponzi schemes often referred to as pyramid are illegal     the key to multi level marketing is understanding the true objective   it is not to sell soap vitamins cell phone plans or whatever   the key is to understand that you are building a marketing organization   you must motivate and train others to do the same   you can not rely on others to do it for you you must do it yourself if you just are there to sell product you wo n't make any money   if you have a lot of friends that you can convince to sign up you wo n't make any money   if you can build a marketing organization you can make a lot of money while the marketing for mlms often say anyone can do it such things waste people 's time   there are certain personality types that are not suited for such skills   also if one those types of skills there may be better opportunities in traditional companies   maybe

the reason that the rich were so rich reasoned was because they managed to spend less money   take boots for example he earned thirty eight dollars a month plus allowances a really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars but an affordable pair of boots which were sort of ok for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out cost about ten dollars those were the kind of boots always bought and wore until the were so thin that he could tell where he was in on a night by the feel of the   but the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years a man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that 'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years time while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet   this was the captain samuel boots theory of socioeconomic unfairness   men at arms the play

the short answer is that the people who know are n't saying lisa blog author at ft has made a effort at figuring it out but working from what is publicly known and making some reasonable assumptions she ca n't even find $ 1 billion of losses much less 9    all we know for sure is that jpm sold massive amounts of protection on a particular cds index roughly that means that they sold insurance on a group of 125 companies and they would lose money if one of those companies went bankrupt or looked like it might go bankrupt and make money if those companies look less likely to go bankrupt    however they were certainly combining that position with other offsetting positions since their banking business loses money when companies go bankrupt it would make sense if they protected themselves with an even more massive position that made money when companies went bankrupt    a common strategy is to bet that the price of 1 thing will go up and the price of a very similar thing will go down so you are protected and can make money if both prices go up or if both go down however if the 2 things are not as similar as you thought you can lose money from both bets that 's what seems to have happened to jpm   dimon has basically said that jpm screwed up their calculations and positions that they thought were offsetting were not     what also seems likely is that other companies figured out that jp morgan had massive amounts of certain things that they needed to sell so jpm was forced to sell at bad prices you never want to play poker against someone who can see your hole cards   so my speculative theory is that the main point of the trading was to protect jpm if other companies went bankrupt but they did it with a complicated strategy that included selling protection they got the calculations wrong and then they were forced to sell at bad prices to other companies who knew they had to sell

it 's impossibly difficult to time the market generally speaking you should buy low and sell high picking 25 as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you 'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner and those decisions should be based on your research or if you need the money not an arbitrary number to answer your questions if the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid then you should hold and/or buy more if something has changed and you ca n't find a reason to buy more then consider selling keep in mind you 'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax deferred e.g. retirement account no it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock capital gains taxes are one reason i 'm not sure why you would ever want to do this what reasons were you considering you can always sell just some of the shares see above and link regarding wash sales buying more of a stock you already own is called dollar cost averaging it 's an effective method when the reasons are right dca minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time all that said there 's nothing wrong with locking in a gain by selling all or some shares of a winner buy low sell high

to get a credit history you need to use credit from someone that reports to the major credit agencies   i do n't suppose you have to buy anything you could just get a cash loan and hold it for a long time but it seems silly to pay interest only for the purpose of building credit the student loan should help you build credit also i 'm assuming you buy things all the time like gas groceries etc why not put those on a credit card and pay the balance off every month that way you are n't buying anything specifically to get credit also there are numerous other benefits another suggestion set up your cards so the full balance is drafted from your bank automatically on the due date that will ensure that you always pay on time helping your credit and also make you think twice about putting things on the card that you ca n't afford with the cash you have in the bank

but in the debt payoff first scenario i 'd be wiping out my debt in    two years it would take several more years if i were to just pay the    minimums and put the extra money toward investing instead right the idea is that in 2 years you are likely to have more in the savings stock account than you owe on the loan but the range of returns for x years has a smaller standard deviation the greater x is e.g. any year has about a 1 in 3 chance of being negative a 10 year period had a negative return -1 cagr in the recently but the 15 year return even around that decade would have been successful jan 1 96 dec 31 2010 returned cagr jan 1 2001 dec 31 2015 returned cagr   this tells you that the time frame is as important as your sleep factor your 2 years i 'd just kill the loans a 10 15 year horizon i 'd ask how you feel about that debt the cost of going after a potential higher return may not be worth the risk to many for some it 's fine i retired with a mortgage still in place but the money in my 401(k that could have paid off the mortgage is now about twice the remaining balance so i sleep like a baby   in the end i 'm a fan of investing for the long term vs paying off low rate debt but it 's a choice based on the individual

i do n't think you should mix the two notions   not starting out with at least   it takes so much money time and expertise to invest for income that starting out at least you should view it as a goal not a starting point save your money in the lowest cost investments you can find   if you are like me you ca n't pick a stock from a bond so put your money into a target retirement fund   let the experts manage the risk and portfolio   start early and save often   at only 35 you have lots of time perhaps you are really into finance in which case you might somebody manage your own portfolio   great but for now let an expert do the heavy lifting you are an app developer   your best bet to increase your income stream with via your knowledge and expertise   while you are still so young you should use labor to make money and then save that money for retirement   i am going to make an assumption that where you are will software development means you can become a great developer long before you can become a great financier   play to your strengths i am also afraid you are over estimating how comfortable you are with risk   any investment that has the kinds of returns you are looking for is going to be wildly risky   i would say those types of opportunities are more speculation rather than investments   there is n't necessarily anything wrong with speculations but know the difference in risk   are you really willing to gamble your retirement

the first method is the correct one you bought an asset worth of $ 1000 and you put it on your depreciation schedule what it means is that you get to write off the $ 1000 over a certain period of time and not at once as you do with expenses but the value you 're writing off is the $ 1000 regardless of how much you 've written off already assume you depreciate in straight line over 5 years that 's how you depreciate computers for federal tax purposes most states follow for the simplicity of the calculation assume you depreciate each year as a whole year no mid year mid quarter conventions the calculation is like this if you sell the computer the proceeds above the adjusted basis amount are taxed as depreciation recapture up to the accumulated depreciation amount and as capital gains above that so in your case book value is the adjusted basis at the end of the year depreciation this year is the amount you depreciate in the year in question out of the total of the original cost and the accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation including the current year in maryland they do not allow depreciating to $ 0 but rather down to 25 of the original cost so if you bought a $ 1000 computer you depreciate until your adjusted basis is $ 250 depreciation rates are described here page 5 for computers except for large you get 30 depreciation with the last year probably a bit less due to the $ 250 adjusted basis limitation

most of the time you 're selling to other investors not back to the company the stock market is a collection of bid buy offers and asks sell offers when you sell your stock as a retail investor at the market price you 're essentially just meeting whatever standing bid offers are on the market   for very liquid stocks e.g. apple you can pretty much always get the displayed price because so many stocks are being traded however during periods of very high volatility or for low volume stocks the quoted price may not be indicative of what you actually pay   as an example let 's say you have 5 stocks you 're trying to sell and the bid side order book is 2 stocks for $ 105 2 for $ 100 and 5 for $ 95 in this scenario the quoted price will be $ 105 the best bid price but if you accept market price you 'll settle 2 for 105 2 for 100 and 1 for 95 after your sell order goes through the new quoted price will be $ 95 for high volume stocks there will usually be so many orders near the midpoint price $ 105 in this case that you wo n't see any price slippage for small orders   you can also post limit orders which are essentially open orders waiting to be filled like in the above example they ensure you get the price you want but you have no way to guarantee they 'll be filled or not   edit as a cool example check out the bitcoin on coinbase for a live example of what the order book looks like for stocks you 'll see that the price of bitcoin will drift towards whichever direction has the less dense order book e.g. price upwards when there are far more bids than asks

if you do business in a state then you need to register your business in that state   i suspect that you have a misconception of what it means to do business in a state   if you are a shop then you very likely are not doing business in any state except the one state where you work examples of when you are doing business in a state include having an office in the state or having employees in the state   merely selling something to a client in that state is not enough to be doing business in the state each state is different but unless you are doing something that is in some sense close to having an office or an employee in a state then you have nothing to worry about   for example if you regularly travel to a state to do work for a client then it is possible that you could be doing business in that state i have no idea if that would be sufficient in any state   but if you are just working out of your basement running a website then you are only doing business in your own state

the way i read the title i thought the game was trading stocks in other redditors for example you could invest a certain amount in other redditors and depending on the net karma for the duration of the game you would make gains or losses you could put all your money into someone with a two month old account and hope they hit the front page or invest in   someone like and have a safe bet that you 'd have at least marginal increases studying trends on the redditors past posts would influence you to buy or sell then i realized this would pretty much be impossible to pull off and that i have absolutely no idea what i 'm talking about

i love giving non answer answers   it will depend on you   suppose you are embarrassed by driving older cars your significant other does n't like having you drive an older car you do n't really maintain the car well it develops a variety of problems acquires a few dents and you really worry about reliability   then the value of the car will probably drop rather quickly below the blue book value and you should sell it on the other hand if you do n't care how the car looks it runs pretty well fewer repairs than you would expect you maintain it yourself aka cheaply and do a good job at that and have plenty of friends who owe you a favor and will give you a ride if your car wo n't start there will probably never be a time that the value to you drops below the official blue book value what others will pay so you would drive it until the engine drops out of the   the blue book value represents some kind of rough consensus about what a car of that age and exterior condition is worth to the typical person it will be the discrepancy between the typical person and you that determines whether you 'll sell an illustration of this   i know a few people who 1 do n't care what their car looks like and 2 are very handy at repairs   these people started out by buying cheap used cars and ran them until they basically fell to pieces   however even though their taste in cars did n't changes as their incomes increased it finally reached the point where doing their own repairs was too much of a time sink so the value of really old cars dropped in their minds and they shifted to buying newer cars and selling them before they completely fell apart   that 's why this is a hard question to answer

lets say you owed me $ an wanted to mail me a check i would then take the check from my mailbox an either take it to my bank or scan it and deposit it via their electronic interface prior to you mailing it you would have no idea which bank i would use or what my account number is in fact i could have multiple bank accounts so i could decide which one to deposit it into depending on what i wanted to do with the money or which bank paid the most interest or by coin flip now once the check is deposited my bank would then stamp the check with their name their routing number the date an my account number eventually an image of the canceled check would then end up back at your bank which they would either send to you or make available to you via their banking website you do n't mail it to my bank you mail it to my home or my business or wherever i tell you to mail it some business give you the address of another location where either a 3rd party processes all their checks or a central location   where all the money for multiple branches are processed if you do owe a company they will generally ask that in the memo section in the lower left corner that you include your customer number this is to make sure that if they have multiple the money is accounted correctly in all my dealings will paying bills and mailing checks i have never been asked to send a check directly to the bank if they want you to do exactly as you describe they should provide you with a form or other instructions

based on your comment that you were not owed the money yes you do have to return it   the paperwork you agreed to when you setup the direct deposit gives them the ability to reverse the transaction i do not know the maximum time they have to pull it back but they could do it without warning if you spend the money and they pull it back you will not be warned and you might overdraw the account they might not notice for days or weeks depending on how they do their audits it is unusual for a large company to do this because their time card systems are designed to prevent this problem   if they are on us government contacts this would be bad for them if they then billed the government for work that was not done or they billed the wrong customer they can face fines if the government finds out you probably have some time before you have to tell them but i would wait no more than a business day or two before contacting them you might find out that they do owe you the money

this is a legal issue or possibly an ethical issue and not really a finance issue and i am not a lawyer but for what it 's worth did you sign a written contract with h&r block if so then the terms of that contract would govern if you signed a contract saying that you agree to file your taxes through them if they meet such and such conditions and they met these conditions then you are legally obligated if there was no written contract then i think any court would take the conversation between you and h&r block as an oral contract if h&r block said basically okay we 'll calculate what we think your taxes are and if we come up with something better than what you had before then you agree to file your taxes through us and you said oh okay then that 's an oral contract you agreed to their conditions legally oral contracts are just as binding as written contracts the only difference is that it is difficult to prove exactly what was said if you really did agree to these conditions i suppose you could lie and say you did n't and then try to convince a court that they are the ones lying obvious ethical problems there there are also implied contracts if 's advertising or paperwork says that you 're agreeing to file through them if they meet the conditions i thing that a court would likely rule that you implicitly agreed to their terms by doing the review in any case when you go to some place like mostly what you are paying for is their knowledge and expertise so if they give you the benefit of their expertise they tell you how to reduce your taxes and then you do n't pay them that seems rather unethical to me the situation is by the fact that you paid $ 100 for the review is that paying for the basic information the tax tip and paying for them to file is then a contract for additional work under some circumstances i 'd say yes that 's additional work and thus an additional contract so in the absence of a contract me i do n't have to do that the catch in this case is that at that point they must have already pretty much taken all your information and filled out all the forms all that 's left is to press the send button and submit the return right

the best ask is the lowest ask and the best bid is the highest bid   if the ask was lower than the bid then they crossed and that would be a crossed market and quickly resolved so the bid will almost always be cheaper than the ask a heuristic is that a bid is the revenue of the stock at any given time while the ask is the cost so the market will only ever offer a profit to itself not to the liquidity seeker if examining the book vertically all orders are usually sorted descending since the best ask is the lowest ask it is on the bottom of the asks and vice versa for the best bid the best bid best ask will be those closest since that 's the spread and price time priority will promise that a bid that crosses the asks will hit the lowest ask the best possible price for the bidder and vice versa for an ask that crosses the best bid

what you propose is to convert unsecured debt into secured debt conversion of unsecured debt into secured debt is not generally a good idea several reasons   the debt you currently owe does not have assets securing the debt so the creditor knows they are exposed to risk and may be more willing to negotiate or relax terms on the debt should you encounter problems   when you provide an asset to secure debt you lose freedom to sell that asset   when you incur debt their is usually a spending problem that needs to be corrected which is typically not fixed when a refinance solution is used   you do not mention interest rate which would be one benefit to conversion of unsecured to secured debt so you probably are not gaining adequate benefit from the conversion strategy this strategy is often using cash out refinancing to borrow against a home you already own and the claimed benefit is often to lower the interest rate on the debt   your scenario is more complicated in that you have not purchased the home yet   though it may be a good idea to purchase a home that choice depends on a different set of considerations children job stability rental vs. buy costs lifestyle expected appreciation etc from how to best handle a large debt income vs. expenses how to increase income or reduce expenses lifestyle priorities etc another consideration is that you already have a problem with the large debt owed to one set of and you have a plan which would shift the risk exposure to another set of who may have been less complicit in accruing the original debt   was the debt incurred jointly during the marriage and something you accepted responsibility to repay you mention that you make great income and you specify one expense rent but you neither provided the amount of income total of all your expenses nor your free cash flow amount nor any indication of percentages spent on rent essential expenses lifestyle nor amount available to retire debt   since you did not provide specifics we can take a look at three scenarios scenario 1 $ income scenario 1 $ income scenario 1 $ income depending upon your income and choices you might have < $ 500/month to pay towards debt or as much as $ to pay towards debt and depending upon interest rate which op did not provide this debt could take < 2 years to pay or > 5 years to pay have you accepted the responsibility for the debt   it will be a tough task to repay the debt   and you will learn that debt comes with a cost as you repay it   one problem people often encounter when they refinance debt is they have not changed the habits which produced the debt   so they often continue their spending habits and incur new unsecured debt landing them back in the same problem position but with the increased secured debt combined with additional new unsecured debt   challenge yourself to repay a specific portion of the debt in a specific time and consider ways to reduce your expenses and/or increase your income to provide more money to repay the debt quicker as you also did not disclose your assets it is hard to know whether you could repay a portion of the debt from assets you already own   it makes sense to sell assets that have a low or zero return to repay debt that has a high interest rate   perhaps you have substantial assets that you are reluctant to sell but that you could sell to repay a large part of the debt

title agencies perform several things research the title for defects you may not know what you 're looking at unless you 're a real estate professional but some titles have strings attached to them like conditions for resale usage changes etc research title issues like misrepresentation of ownership misrepresentation of the actual property titled misrepresentation of conditions again not being a professional in the domain you might not understand the text you 're looking at research liens those are usually have to be recorded i.e. the title company wo n't necessarily find a lien if it was n't recorded with the county cover your and the bank 's they provide title insurance that guarantees your money back if they missed something they were supposed to find the title insurance is usually required for a mortgaged transaction while i understand why you would think you can do it most people can not even if they think they can they can not in many areas this research can not be done online for example in california you have to go to the county recorder office to look things up for legal reasons in ca counties are not allowed to provide access to certain information without verification of who 's accessing it may be worth your while   to pay someone to do it even if you can do it yourself because your time is more valuable also keep in mind that while you may trust your abilities your bank wo n't so you may be able to do your own due diligence but the bank needs to do its own specifically to detroit the city is bankrupt every $ 100 k counts for them i 'm surprised they only charge $ 6 per search but that is probably limited by the state law

unless you are investing an insignificant amount of money for the home and renovations you need title insurance   without it multiple other parties can claim ownership in this property you are purchasing and investing in   also you can know if there are any liens against the property which can cost you a significant amount in addition to the costs you are budgeting    for example liens against a property i bought a while back amounted to 26 of the price i paid   in my case the seller a bank paid those while in your case you may need to pay any liens as i suspect the seller has little money that bone in your body that has you worried about this transaction is really good   pay attention to it

as noted above this is likely going to need several lawyers to straighten out   i am not a lawyer but i think one should be retained asap however in the meantime the authorized user should not be making any charges   continuing to do so at this point may be a criminal offense   for the protection of any other heirs this should be brought to the attention of the credit card issuer and law enforcement authorities   as it stands the account holder 's estate will be liable for the full debt and the authorized user 's estate would be untouched    of course all this could change if other heirs challenge the estate and file civil suits in which case it 's likely that both estates will be eaten up with legal fees anyway

similar premise yes it 's an investment so you 're definitely hoping it grows so you can sell it for a profit gain public stock market vs. private shark tank are a little different though in terms of how much money you get and the form of income     with stocks if you buy x number of shares at a certain price you definitely want to sell them when they are worth more however you do n't get say 0.001 or whatever percentage you own it would be trivial of the profits they just pay a dividend to you based on a pre determined amount and multiply it by the number of shares you own and that would be your income unless you 're like warren buffet and berkshire who can buy significant stakes of companies through the stock market then they can likely put the investment on the balance sheet of his company but that 's a different discussion it would also be expensive as hell to do that     with shark tank investors the main benefit they get is significant ownership of a company for a cheap price however the risk can be greater too as these companies do n't have a strong foundation of sales and are just beginning investing in apple vs. a small business is pretty significant difference haha these companies are so small and in such a weak financial position which is why they 're seeking money to grow so they have almost no leverage mark cuban could swoop in and offer $ 50k for 25 and that 's almost worth it relative to what $ 50k in apple shares would get him it 's all about the return apple and other big public companies are mature and most of the growth has already happened so there is little upside with these startups if they ever take off then and you own 25 of the company it can be worth billions

the new information helps a little but you 're still stuck as far as doing exactly what you asked   the question that you really should be asking is how do i deposit money into my bofa checking account from italy   if you can figure that out then the whole part about your father 's amex card really becomes irrelevant   he might get that money from a cash advance on his amex card or he might get it from somewhere else i think there 's some small chance that if you call bofa and ask the right question they may give you an answer that will let you make this deposit   i tend to doubt it but this would at least give you a chance other than that you should probably look into some options based in italy   for example get the cash from your father and open a bank account in italy   maybe you can buy a pre paid visa card with the cash to use while you 're there   maybe use traveler 's checks for the rest of your trip   etc what is available and what makes sense will still depend on a lot of details that we do n't have like how long you 're staying and what type of entry visa you got when you entered italy

if there was no question of improvements to the property the problem would be simple each person invests whatever amount calculate the percentage of each person 's investment out of the entire investment and that 's what share each one owns like a puts in $ 10,000 for the deposit and pays $ 5,000 toward the mortgage over the next however many years b puts in $ 5,000 toward the deposit but pays $ 7,000 of the mortgage c puts in $ 15,000 but pays only $ 1,000 of the mortgage payments so total investments a $ 15,000 b $ 12,000 c $ 16,000 total $ so a 's share of the house is = etc if you then sell it you pay off any outstanding debt and then everybody gets their share of what 's left but once you start making improvements there is no simple formula suppose you put down new flooring in the dining room you pay $ 500 for materials and put in 20 hours of labor presumably you have now added something more than $ 500 to your share but how much more how much are the hours worth what if someone damages the house puts a hole in the all or something and then fixes it does the time and effort they put into fixing it add to their investment or did that just cancel out the damage they did what if one person does a lot to keep the house in generally good condition in small snippets of time like cleaning furnace filters and polishing the floors while another does nothing and lets their share get run down and dirty it gets very complicated theoretically you could come up with a rate at which you value your work like say every hour spent maintaining the house is worth $ 10 or $ 20 or whatever but who 's going to keep track of it over the course of potentially many years and what if one person does a small number of big easily quantifiable jobs while another does many small hard to count jobs like if a the floor every week for 2 years is that worth more or less than b installing 3 ceiling fans a door and 2 windows you could go around and around on this sort of thing

this is probably exactly how this type of thing developed in the first place    it 's a relatively recent last 30 40 years accounting concept and was only really developed because like you said someone somewhere said wait a minute let 's break this down economically also the larger the company and more divisions more parts more countries varying tax codes etc the exponentially more complex this stuff gets   one example that comes to mind verizon 's back haul division operates at a huge loss because they charge so little to the cell division for line usage the cell division makes 100 of the companies profits although is technically a 40 minority shareholder which really complicates things because it 's costs are so low if verizon spun off the back haul division however the cell division would make a lot less    most likely verizon wants to lose money on back haul operations as it gives them political leverage pipes are full we need subsidies just thought you might find it interesting

you 'd be moving from k of taxable income + 16.5 k of income to 65 k of taxable income worst case so the question is whether the net from the extra k of taxable income is more than the 16.5 k and since marginal tax rates in the relevant brackets are no more than 32 according to the table you posted 22 federal and 10 provincial it 's definitely a win to move jobs more precisely the marginal tax rate is 25 on the first and 32 on the rest making for total extra tax of about 9.5 k and thus net income beyond the k baseline of compared to the 16.5 k this leaves you 5.5 k up if you end up at the 70 k end you 're another 3.4 k up beyond that

for the period 1950 to 2009 if you adjust the s&p 500 for inflation and account for dividends the average annual return comes out to exactly source currently inflation is around 2   so your 2 apy is a 0 real return where the stock market return is 7   i.e. on average stocks have a return that is higher by 7    if you mix in bonds 70 stocks to 30 bonds your real returns will drop to around 5.5 but you are safer in individual years bonds often have good years when stocks have bad years    we 're making a bit of a false dichotomy here   we 're talking about returns on stocks in retirement accounts versus returns on cds in regular accounts   you can buy stocks in regular accounts and it is legally possible to have a cd in a retirement account   so you can get bankruptcy protection and tax advantages with a cd

i had been pondering this recently myself too   this question motivated me to do a little research   it appears that what happens is that take a deep breath the capital gain does push you into the next tax bracket but the capital gain is always interpreted as the last income you received so that if your non capital gains income is less than the threshold it will all be taxed in the lower bracket and only your capital gain will be taxed in the higher bracket but it will be taxed at the capital gains rate of that higher bracket in short a capital gain can only push capital gains into higher capital gains tax brackets it can not push ordinary income into higher ordinary income tax brackets   in addition the amount of the capital gain is taxed in a marginal fashion such that any portion of the gain that will fit into a lower bracket will be taxed at a lower level with only the portion of any gain being taxed at the top rate this site is one claiming this will capital gain or dividend income push my other income into a higher tax bracket no the tax rates apply first to your ordinary income income from sources other than long term capital gains or qualifying dividends so these items that are taxed at special rates wo n’t push your other income into a higher tax bracket if my ordinary income puts me in the 15 tax bracket can i receive an unlimited amount of long term capital gain at the 0 rate no the 0 rate applies only to the amount of long term capital gain and dividend income needed to fill up the 15 tax bracket for example if your ordinary income is $ 4,000 below the figure that would put you in the 25 bracket and you have a $ 10,000 long term capital gain you ’ll pay 0 on $ 4,000 of your capital gain and 15 on the rest there are several bogleheads forum threads here here here and here that also touch on the same issue the last of those links to the irs capital gains worksheet   i traced through the logic and i believe it confirms this   here 's how it works in conclusion we now know mitt romney 's secret

this is why i 've come into the view that most companies should be worker co ops   there are a few key sectors of the economy like health care and banking that probably should n't have a profit motive to them   turn everything else into worker co ops   that way you as the workers do earn that money through your own blood sweat and tears with the added benefits of not having a ceo that makes over as much as you while doing away with wage slavery   its strange that we say we value democracy in our society except in our companies which look more like

a few points that i would note call options could the bond be called away by the issuer this is something to note as some bonds may end up not being as good as one thought because of this option that gets used tax considerations are you going for corporate treasury or different ones may have different tax consequences to note if you are n't holding the bond in a tax advantaged account e.g roth ira ira or 401k convertible or not some bonds are known as since the bond comes with an option on the stock that can be worth considering for some kinds of bonds inflation protection some bonds like tips or series i savings bonds can have inflation protection built into them that can also be worth understanding in the case of tips there are principal adjustments while the savings bond will have a change in its interest rate default risk some of the higher yield bonds may have an issuer go under which is another way one may end up with equity in a company rather than getting their money back on the other side for some one could have the risk of the bond not quite being as good as one thought like some detroit bonds that may end up in a different result given their bankruptcy but there are also revenue bonds that may not meet their target for another situation that may arise some bonds may be insured though this requires a bit more research to know the credit rating of the insurer as for the latter question what if interest rates rise and your bond 's value drops considerably do you hold it until maturity or do you try to sell it and get something that has a higher yield based on face value

how accurate is implied volatility in predicting future moves how would you measure this   if the implied volatility says that there 's a 1 chance that a stock will double and it doubles was it right   you could also say that it says there 's a 99 change that it does n't double so was it wrong    what you could measure is the variance of daily returns over a time period and see how well that compares to implied volatility but there 's no way to compare iv with the absolute price movement   if a stock goes up 0.01 each day then the variance is 0 the daily returns are the same each day but over 250 the stock would go up $ 2.50

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

the safest investment is probably a money market fund originally i said a tips fund but they appear to be riskier than i had thought   but you might not want to invest everything there because the returns are not going to be great   high returns come with high risk the best portfolio has some percentage which may be 0 of your money in a safe asset like a money market and some in a risky portfolio this percentage may also be zero for some people   you should consult your own risk aversion and decide how much money to put in each   if you are super risk averse put almost all of it in the money market   if you want a little more return put more of it in the risky portfolio   this is a fundamental result of finance theory what 's the risky asset   a fully diversified portfolio of bonds and stocks   people do n't agree on exactly what the weights should be   the rule of thumb back in the day was 60 stock and 40 bonds   these days lots of financial planners recommend 120 minus your age in stock and the rest in bonds   but no one really knows what the perfect weights in the risky portfolio should be the rules of thumb i just gave have little or no theoretical foundation so you have to choose for yourself what you think makes sense

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

alright bud i 'm sure you 're a smart and nice person who just wants people to earn as much as they possibly can at least i hope you are so let 's look at it logically    you are suggesting people that are unskilled uneducated lack the ability to negotiate in their favor and a government law must be placed to help them however the effect of a higher minimum wage means you now force that very individual to compete with more people for that same position this is because there 's not a lot of competition for a job that pays say $ because skilled people do n't apply to them the higher you set that minimum wage like the livable wage of $ 15/hr that i hear so much about the more skilled people will apply to these positions because they now pay more what makes you think an unskilled uneducated individual will be able to find employment in this competitive environment you are assuming that people earning minimum wage today will continue earning a minimum wage even if a higher minimum wage law is passed    also remember that employment goes both ways just as a potential employee has the freedom to walk away from a wage he does n't like an employer is free to not hire an employee for a given wage an employer does not hire personnel that provides value less than the wage paid because that employee now costs the employer to keep him retained so when you enforce a minimum wage which states an employer must at a minimum pay a certain wage you forcibly fire all the employees that do not merit that wage you effectively take away the 1 bargaining chip unskilled and uneducated individuals can offer which is offering to work for lower wages

i ca n't find the underlying legislation but a few online resources suggest that if you contact a lender about a payment plan they should put repayments on hold temporarily we do n’t think it ’s fair if your lender does n’t help you    get on top of things if you ask for help or breathing space to sort    things out if you 've had problems repaying the loan you can complain if your payday lender did not offer to freeze interest and charges if you are able to make payments under a reasonable repayment plan by law they must suspend recovery of the debt for a reasonable period if you ’re developing a repayment plan with a debt adviser or on your own i 'd start by making an immediate complaint to the lender make them aware that you 're unable to meet basic living expenses because of the money they took and ask for them to suspend collection temporarily and for the money to be returned i would also dispute the charge with your bank on the grounds that it should not have been taken given the circumstances and ask for them to credit your account while they investigate the dispute they may not be too keen given it 'll leave you overdrawn if they later reject the dispute but it 's worth asking in parallel with that contact citizens advice and/or the financial ombudsman details in the links and see if there 's anything they can do or suggest

if you invest in a foreign bank you are subject to their financial rules and regulations if you put your money with their cd it will be converted to and you will be paid back in which introduces the exchange rate risk   fdic is not the only reason why a cd in a us bank pays a lower interest but it could be seen as a contributing factor   it all comes down to risk and what the bank is willing to pay for your money when a bank issues a cd they are entering the debt market and competing against other banks governments or anyone looking for money if the yield from lending to one bank is the same as the yield of another the logical choice would be whichever loan is less risky so in order for the riskier bank to receive loans they must entice investors by offering a greater rate of return in addition if a bank is n't looking for loans they might be less inclined to pay for them see what is the bernanke twist and operation twist what exactly does it do if your looking to invest in the cd 's of foreign banks i would suggest doing research on their regulations especially if and how your money is protected in the event the bank goes bust

yea but they might feel and that you pulled a fast one on them and not be as willing to give you good deals in the future    like as a totally non mathematical example they have a car for $ 50k they lower the price to 40k with a financing that will bring total payment to 60k their break even on that car is let 's say 45k the financier cuts them a commission on expected profits of maybe 7k they made an expected 2k on the car but if you pay it all off asap they may lose that commission be 5k in the hole on the sale and pretty upset even more upset if they finance in house    so when you go back to buy another car they 'll say fuck this guy we need to recoup past lost profits do n't go below 4 k above break even    i 'm not really 100 on how financing workings when it comes to cars but from my background in sales this is the bar i would set for a customer that made me take a loss by doing business with them if they tried to come back in the future   this does n't take into account how car dealerships do n't own their inventory finance all of their cars and actually are willing to take a loss on a car just to get it off the lot some times

there is a problem with grouping them all as dismantling as many are and are wasteful   the epa itself can not get out of it 's own way     i worked on one project recently 2 years ago where we were designing a cooling tower huge ac for power plant for goose creek sc where we were going to add another tower so that they could eventually switch to a close loop system keeps all water in system no dumping in river   the city of goose creek went to court because the epa made a rule that by a certain date a company could no longer use an open system on a cooling tower if it dumped into a   the city got their wish and they won and the epa backed off and the town of goose creek gets to keep the dirty warm water that was is being dumped into the river so that the fishermen would have better catches no shit this is how it was and they wanted to keep it they did n't want to chance losing the warm waters that drew more fish   well jokes on the town as we are now building a tower in that location that will have an open system to dump into the river   here 's the catch before it was to be a tower where the water must be better quality as the media in the tower could foul and impact the thermal rating of the tower now they are going with a type tower and the media on those can accept the worst fucking water you can think of and still perform properly   so now the fishermen will get some nasty water that will be just below the allowable amount set by the epa so that some lazy people can catch fish easier   that is what i consider a wasteful government program   but that is just my opinion based on an interaction i had with a project where the epa stuck there big head where they did nt even know what they were doing

as a lifetime car driving racing enthusiast   the modern driving experience is such shit traffic is terrible everywhere you go there is constant road construction our crumbling infrastructure ruins once you actually manage to break out of traffic and build some speed for pleasure you get beat to death and tar paint road debris ruin your cars finish   assuming you find a nice stretch of that has been maintained since the eisenhower administration with no traffic there are overly aggressive speed cameras in place or some dickhead with a badge out to make a quota   i got a speeding ticket last year for 3 over 3 fucking mph over and it cost me almost $ 200   tl;dr cars are awesome driving anymore is no fun

while nothing is guaranteed any stock market or country could collapse tomorrow if you have a fairly long window 15 + years is certainly long etfs are likely to earn you well above inflation   looking at long term etfs you typically see close to 10 annual growth over almost any ten year period in the us and while i do n't know european indexes they 're probably well above inflation at least the downside of etfs is that your money is somewhat less liquid than in a savings account and any given year you might not earn anything you easily could lose money in a particular year   as such you should n't have money in etfs that you expect to use in the next few months or year or even a few years perhaps but as long as you 're willing to play the long game ie invest in etf do n't touch it for 15 years except to reinvest the dividends as long as you go with someone like vanguard and use a very low expense ratio fund mine are 0.06 and 0.10 i believe you are likely in the long term to come out ahead   you can diversify your holdings hold 10 to 20 in bond funds for example if you 're concerned about risk look at how some of the target retirement funds allocate their investments to see how diversification can work target retirement funds assume high risk tolerance far out and then as the age grows the risk tolerance drops do n't invest in them but it can be a good example of how to do it    all of this does require a tolerance of risk though and you have to be able to not touch your funds even if they go down studies have repeatedly shown that trying to time the market is a net loss for most people and the best thing you can do when your diverse investments go down is stay neutral talking about large funds here and not individual stocks i think this answers 3 and 4    for 1 share price and quantity matter assuming no splits   this depends somewhat on the fund but at minimum funds must dividend to you what they receive as dividends   there are dividend focused etfs which are an interesting topic in themselves but a regular etf does n't usually have all that large of dividends   for more information investopedia has an article on the subject   note that there are also capital gains distributions which are typically distributed to help offset capital gains taxes that may occur from time to time with an etf   those are n't really returns you may have to hand most or all over to the irs so do n't consider distributions the same way the share price tracks the total net asset value of the fund divided by the number of shares roughly assuming no supply demand split   this should go up as the stocks the etf owns go up overall this is for non dividend etfs more often the larger volatility both up and down for vanguard 's s&p500 etf which you can see here there were about $ 3.50 in dividends over 2014 which works out to about a 2 return $ share price   on the other hand the share price went from around $ at the beginning of 2014 to $ 190 at the end of 2014 for a return of 13    that was during a good year for the market of course there will be years where you get 2 3 in dividends and lose money in 2011 it opened at 116 and closed the year at 115 i do n't have the dividend for that year certainly lower than 3.5 i 'd think but likely nonzero the one caveat here is that you do have stock splits where they cut the price say in half and give you double the shares   that of course is revenue neutral you have the same value the day after the split as before net of market movements all of this is good from a tax point of view by the way changes in price do n't hit you until you sell the stock fund unless the fund has some capital gains while dividends and distributions do   etfs are seen as tax friendly for this reason for 2 vanguard is pretty good about this in the us i would n't necessarily invest monthly but quarterly should n't be a problem   just pay attention to the fees and figure out what the optimal frequency is ie assuming 10 return what is your break even point   you would want to have some liquid assets anyway so allow that liquid amount to rise over the quarter then invest what you do n't immediately see a need to use you can see here vanguard in the us has no fees for buying shares but has a minimum of one share so if you 're buying their s&p500 voo you 'd need to wait until you had $ 200 or so to invest in order to invest additional funds

you are correct that over a short term there is no guarantee that one index will out perform another index every index goes through periods of feat and famine that why the advice is to diversify your investments every index does have some small amount of management for the parent index the s&p 500 in this case there is a process to divide all 500 stocks into growth and value pure growth and pure value this rebalancing of the 500 stocks occurs once a year rebalancing the s&p style indices are rebalanced once a year in december the    december rebalancing helps set the broad universe and benchmark for    active managers on an annual cycle consistent with active manager    performance evaluation cycles the rebalancing date is the third    friday of december which coincides with the december quarterly share    changes for the s&p composite 1500   style scores    market capitalization weights growth and value midpoint averages and    the pure weight factors where applicable across the various    style indices are reset only once a year at the december rebalancing other changes to the u.s. style indices are made on an as needed    basis following the guidelines of the parent index changes in    response to corporate actions and market developments can be made at    any time constituent changes are typically announced for the parent    index two to five days before they are scheduled to be implemented please refer to the s&p u.s. indices methodology document for    information on standard index maintenance for the s&p 500 the s&p    midcap s&p smallcap 600 and all related indices as to which is better 500 growth value or growth and value that depends on what you the investor is trying to do

i used to be in research department for big financial data company    tell your son that there are three factors most people think that net sales vs. expectations is the only factor   it might not even be the biggest   it is simply how much money did company make   note that this is not how many units they sold   for most companies they will have adjustable pricing and incentives in their sector   for example let 's talk about a new company selling superman kid 's bikes with a cape the flips out when you hit a certain speed   the company has it in walmart at one price target at another toys r us even cheaper amazon making more profit there and other stores   they are doing ok come dec. 1 but holiday season being half way over they slash price from $ 100 to $ 80 because they have tons of inventory   what are looking at her is how much money did they make   note that marketing advertising legal setting up contracts are a bit fixed in my opinion consumer sentiment is the 1 thing for a company that sells a product   incredible consumer sentiment is like millions of dollars in free advertising   so let 's say dec. 15th comes and the reviews on the superman bike are through the roof   every loves it no major defects   company ca n't even supply the retailers now because after slashing the price it became a great buy   a common investor might be pissed that some dummy at the company slashed the prices so they could have had a much better profit margin but at the same time it would n't have led to an of sales and consumer sentiment and the last area is product sell off   this does n't apply to all product but most   some products will only have a technology shelf life some will actually go bad or out of fashion and even selling superman bikes you want to get those to the store because the product is so big   so ignoring making a profit can a company sell off inventory at or around cost   if they ca n't even if they made a profit their risk factor goes up so let 's get back to superman bikes   this is the only product company abc has   they had expected holiday sales at 100 million and profits at 40 million   they ended up at 120 million and 44 million    let 's say their stock was $ 20 before any information was gathered by the public remember for most companies info is gathered daily now so this is rather simplistic   so you might expect that the stock would rise to maybe $ 24 to which if you were an investor is a great profit however this company has a cult consumer following who are waiting for the captain america bike shoots discs and the bike turns green when you go fast   let 's say consumer sentiment and projections base off that put next holiday sales at $ 250 million   so maybe the company is worth $ 40 a share now   but consumer sentiment is funny because not only does it effect future projections but it also effects perceived present value of company which may have the stock trading at $ 60 a share think earnings and companies like google   having a company people feel proud owning or thinking is cool is also a indicator or share worth i gave you a really good example of a very successful company selling superman bikes there are just as many companies that have the opposite happening   imagine missing sales goals by a few million with bad consumer feedback and all of a sudden your company goes from $ 20 to $ 5 a share

it is important to first understand that true causation of share price may not relate to historical correlation just like with scientific experiments correlation does not imply causation but we use stock price correlation to attempt to infer causation where it is reasonable to do so and to do that you need to understand that prices change for many reasons some company specific some industry specific some market specific companies in the same industry may correlate when that industry goes up or down companies with the same market may correlate when that market goes up or down in general in most industries it is reasonable to assume that competitor companies have stocks which strongly correlate positively with each other to the extent that they do the same thing   for a simple example consider three resource companies oil ltd. 100 of its assets relate to oil oil and iron inc. 50 of its value relates to oil 50 to iron and iron and copper ltd. 50 of its value relates to iron 50 to copper for each of these companies there are many things which affect value but one could naively simplify things by saying value of a resource company is defined by the expected future volume of goods mined drilled the expected resource price less all fixed and variable costs so one major thing that impacts resource companies is simply the current projected price of those resources this means that if the price of oil goes up or down it will partially affect the value of the two oil companies above but how much it affects each company will depend on the volume of oil it and the timeline that it expects to get that oil for example maybe oil and iron ltd. has no currently producing oil rigs but it has just made massive investments which expect to drill oil in 2 years and the market expects oil prices to return to a high value in 2 years   in that case a drop in oil would impact oil inc. severely but perhaps it would n't impact oil and iron ltd. as much in this case for the particular share price movement related to the price of oil the two companies would not be correlated iron and copper ltd. would be unaffected by the price of oil this is a simplification oil prices impact many areas of the economy and therefore there would be no correlation at all between this company 's shares it is also likely that competitors face similar markets if consumer spending goes down then perhaps the stock of most consumer product companies would go down as well there would be outliers because specific companies may still succeed in a falling market but in generally there would be a lot of correlation between two companies with the same market   in the case that you list sony vs samsung there would be some factors that correlate positively and some that correlate negatively a clean example would be blackberry stock vs apple stock because apple 's success had specifically negative ramifications for blackberry and yet other tech company competitors also succeeded in the same time period meaning they did not correlate negatively with apple

for the vast majority buying a house via a mortgage is not an investment   i use quotes around buying because from a technical perspective you do n't own anything until you 've paid it off this is often an important point that people forget it 's highly unlikely you 'll make more on it than the amount you put into it interest repairs etc   even with relatively low interest rates the people who successfully invest in homes are those that use actual cash not borrowed to buy a home at well below market value   they then clean it up and make enough repairs to make it marketable and sell it shortly there after   sometimes these people get hosed if the housing market to the point that the home is now worth less than the amount they put into it   this is especially problematic if they used bank loans to get the process going   they were actually the hardest hit when the housing bubble popped several years ago   well them and the people who bought on interest only loans or had balloon payments whereas the people who use a mortgage are essentially treating it like a bank account with a negative interest rate   for example $ 180k loan on a 30 yr fixed at 4 will mean a total payout of around $ excluding normal repairs like roofs carpet etc   due to how mortgage 's work most of the interest is collected during the first half of the loan period   so selling it within 2 to 5 years is usually problematic unless the local housing market has really skyrocketed housing markets move up and down all the time due to a hundred different things completely out of your control   it might be a regional depression weather events failed large businesses failed city local governments etc   it could go up because businesses moved in a new highway is built state local taxes decline etc my point is homes are not long term investments   they can be short term ones but only in limited circumstances and there is a high degree of risk involved   so do n't let that be a driving point of your decision instead you need to focus on other factors   such as what is really going on with the house you are currently in   why would they lose it   can you help out and should you help out   if things are it might make more sense to sell that home now and everyone move into separate locations possibly different rentals or apartments   if they are foreclosed on then they will be in a world of financial hurt for a long time if we ignore your parents situation then one piece of advice i would give you is this rent the cheapest apartment you can find that is still a safe place to live in   put every dollar you can into some type of savings investment that will actually grow   stay there for 5 + years then go pay cash for a nice home   making $ 75k a year while single means that you do n't need much to live on   in other words live extremely cheap now so you can enjoy a fantastic living experience later that is free from financial fear   you should be able to put $ per year aside going this route edit a bit of support data for those that somehow think buying a home on a mortgage is somehow a good investment    robert shiller who won a nobel prize in economics and who predicted the bursting of the housing bubble has shown that a house is not a good investment   why   first home prices adjusted for inflation have been virtually unchanged for the past 100 years   link 1 link 2   second after you add in the costs of maintenance alone then those costs plus what you 've paid for the home will exceed what you get out of it   adding in the cost of a mortgage could easily double or even triple the price you paid which makes things even worse   maintenance costs include things like a new roof carpet flooring water heater appliances etc yes a home might cost you $ 100k and you might sell it for $ 200k after 15 years   however during that time you 'll likely replace the roof $ 10k to $ 20k replace appliances $ 2k to $ 5k water heater $ 1k carpet flooring $ 5k to $ 20k paint $ 3k to $ 6k and mortgage related costs assuming 30 yr fixed   so your costs are between $ 180k and $ 200k just on those items   there are many more that could easily escalate the costs further   like a fence $ air conditioner $ windows etc the above is assuming the home actually appreciates in value faster than inflation which they historically have n't over the long term    so you have to consider all of the costs ultimately paid to purchase and maintain the home vs the costs of renting during the same time period    point is do your research and be realistic about it   buying a home is a huge financial risk

you 're going to have a huge problem getting approved for anything as long as you have an unpaid bill on your report pay it and make sure its reported as paid in full asap once that settled your credit will start to improve slowly ca n't do anything about that it will take time you can make the situation improve a bit faster by lending money to yourself and having it reported regularly on your report how easy get a secured credit card what does it mean you put x amount of money in a cd and the bank will issue you a credit card secured by that cd your credit line will be based on the amount in that cd and you 'll probably pay some fees to the bank for the service shop around you might get lucky and find a secured card without fees if you look hard enough secured cards are reported as revolving credit just as any other credit card and are easy to get because the bank does n't take the risk you do   if you default on your payments your cd goes to cover the debt and the card gets cancelled but make absolutely sure that you do not default charge between 10 and 30 of the credit limit each month not more pay the balance shown on your credit card statement in full every month and by the due date shown on your monthly statement   it will take a while but you would typically start noticing the improvement within ~6 12 months stop applying for stuff not store cards not car loans you 're not going to get anything and will just keep dragging your scores down each time you have a pull on your report the score goes down a lot of pulls frequent pulls the score goes down a lot lenders can see when one is desperate and no one wants to lend money to desperate people   optimally lenders want to lend money to people who does n't need loans but in order to keep the business running they 'll settle for slightly less people who do n't usually need loans and pay the loans they do have on time you fail on both as you 're desperate for a loan and you have unpaid bills on your report

you may not have a good choice until you start that job $ 2,000 is awfully low for a car so it could be very risky but you may not be able to get a loan until you start the new job i would talk to a bank or credit union to get an idea of how much if anything you could borrow at this time if you have a letter offering you the job that might help to get a loan there are dealers who will finance a very cheap used car for anybody but that kind of deal is likely to be at a very high interest rate and should be avoided you could wind up with a debt and no car one other possibility is to have a co signer such as a parent or other relative that could make getting a car loan easy

the idea that individuals control the housing prices through supply and demand is hilarious that 's like saying prisoners control the quality of their food   somehow blaming banks and real estate agents is going to hurt you and make you a victim that 's not fear mongering at all clearly everything was so very plainly laid out for every buyer in the entire us that all they had to do was sign a single piece of paper that was written in plain english and of course they were never told anything like just a formality or just paperwork and all of them were smart enough to read through the work anyway and of course the bank associates were nice enough to reject a loan if they thought the people did n't understand the terms properly and etc etc   tl;dr good job shifting the blame surely your well reasoned arguments with summarized will get people on your side

it might not be for first time payers but they do have programs some federal some local that help the poor and elderly complete their tax forms there are also programs that allow the poor to file electronically for free for most people the first time they file their taxes they are using the ez form which is rather easy to do even without the use of either web based or pc based software the software tools all ask enough questions on the ez forms to allow the user to know with confidence when their life choices have made it advantageous to use the more complex forms the web versions of the software allow the taxpayer to start for free thus reducing their initial investment for the software to zero because the first time filer is frequently a teenager the parents are generally responsible for proving that initial guidance   the biggest risk for a young taxpayer might be that the first year that itemizing deductions might be advantageous they might never consider it so they over pay or they discover in april that if they had only kept a receipt from a charity six months ago they could deduct the donation so they are tempted to   claim the donation without proof regarding and assistance there is an interesting tax credit the earned income tax credit it gives a tax credit to the working poor they alert people that they need to check your eligibility for the earned income tax credit they know that significant numbers of taxpayers fail to claim it eitc can be a boost for workers who earned $ or less in 2012    yet the irs estimates that one out of five eligible taxpayers fails to    claim their eitc each year the irs wants everyone who is eligible for    the credit to get the credit that they ’ve earned the rules for getting the credit are simple all the information needed to claim it is already on the basic tax forms but you have to know that you need a separate form to get the credit but instead of making the credit automatic they say if you use irs e file to prepare and file your tax return the    software will guide you and not let you forget this important step    e file does the work and figures your eitc for you and then   with irs free file you can claim eitc by using brand name tax    preparation software to prepare and e file your tax return for free    it 's available exclusively at irs.gov free help preparing    your return to claim your eitc is also available at one of thousands    of volunteer income tax assistance sites around the country to find    the volunteer site nearest to you use the locator tool on    irs.gov but if you do n't use free file you might never know about the form apparently it escapes 20 of the people who could claim it

per the irs instructions on filing as head of household as a citizen living abroad if you choose to file only your own taxes and you qualify for head of household without them the irs does not consider you married if you are a u.s. citizen married to a nonresident alien you may qualify to use the head of household tax rates you are considered unmarried for head of household purposes if your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the year and you do not choose to treat your nonresident spouse as a resident alien however your spouse is not a qualifying person for head of household purposes you must have another qualifying person and meet the other tests to be eligible to file as a head of household as such you could file as married filing separately if you have no children or head of household if you have one or more children a parent etc for whom you paid more than half of their upkeep see the document for more information    you also may choose to file as married filing jointly if it benefits you to do so it may if she earns much less than you   see the irs document nonresident spouse treated as resident for more information   if you choose to treat her as a resident then you must declare her worldwide income   in some circumstances this will be beneficial for you if you earn substantially more than her and it lowers your tax rate overall to do so   married filing separately severely limits your ability to take some deductions and credits so it 's well worth seeing which is better

is it really so important to have good credit with so much collateral yes it is important to have good credit the bank may not lend or may charge higher for bad credit if you were to default the bank will get all that equity so you are missing the fundamental bank can not take more than what they are owed when they take possession of house they auction it take what was due from the sale and return any surplus to the owner this entire process takes time and hence bank wants to avoid giving loan to someone who they feel is risky edit there are different aspects of risk that the bank factors

if you sold the stock for a profit you will owe tax on that profit whether it is taxed as short term or long term capital gains depends on how long you held the stock before selling it presumably you 're going to invest this money into mutual funds or something of that sort those may pay dividends which can be reinvested and will grow in value you hope just as the individual stock shares would you hope assuming the advice you 've been given is at all reasonable there 's no need for buyer 's remorse here you 're just changing your investing style to a different point on the risk versus return curve if you have to ask this question i tend to agree that you should do more homework before playing with shares in individual companies unless you 're getting shares at employee discount in which case you should still seriously consider selling them fairly quickly and reinvesting the money in a more structured manner in a very real sense your job is itself an investment in your employer if they ever get into trouble you do n't want that to hit both your income and investments

this will continue happening i 'm not sure why people are surprised   1 wealth attracts wealth once you have billions you can use the millions you make from interest without ever touching your capital for many new endeavors it 's pretty hard to lose everything once you 're worth billions   2 it 's easier to become a billionaire faster than what it was 20 years ago and will continue to increase in pace instagram was sold for $ 1b before 2 years of being founded     3 people are living longer and having less children in combination with 2 in the past the distribution of wealth through inheritance happened quicker than the creation takes you 30 years to create a $ 5b estate and it 's then divided into 5 today it takes you 15 years to create a $ estate and it 's divided into 2 after 40 more years    4 it 's easier to add more value than 50 years ago today a software engineer can develop software that automatically does what a whole company did in the past adding value generates wealth    5 it 's easier to stay on top of more things in combination with 4 you can now use technology to add much more value in bigger enterprises consider musk as an example being the ceo of tesla spacex and finding time for the and boring projects that would have been impossible 50 years ago    in general innovation creates value globalization creates a much larger marker for that value to be applied in technology makes it for more innovation to happen in an ever increasing pace    world living standards are at an all time high but the leaders can separate themselves farther from the pack not because it is unfair but because technology allows them to    in order to innovate you must take some risks and be able to step away from your day to day obligations to analyze opportunities that 's why i believe a better social safety net is required but this will only increase the amount of billionaires out there and will increase living standards for everyone it will not necessarily decrease inequality

the two things are materially different point number 1   with a credit card the bank and card network earn a fee every time you spend on your card   you swipe a $ 100 dinner the credit card company makes about $ 3   you pay it back they may not make any interest but they 've made their $ 3   additionally if you have a $ 1,000,000 credit limit you 've only actually borrowed $ 100 which brings me to point number 2    point number 2   a credit limit of $ x is not in any way the same as a loan for $ x.   when you seek a personal loan the lender hands you money in equal amount to your loan less any origination fees that may apply   your loan for $ 8,000 results in $ 8,000 being wired to your account   your credit limit is only a loan when you actually charge something   until then its a simple adjustable risk limit set by the bank 's underwriters point number 3   your credit report contains no income information   it 's up to the lender to determine what sort of risk they 're willing to take   some personal lenders are just fine with stated income and employer contact information   some lenders want to see some pay stubs   some lenders will lend $ x on stated income but wo n't lend $ x+1 without income verification   some will lend the money at a lower interest rate if you do prove your income and employment   it 's all lender specific   credit card issuers are clearly lax on the income verification piece of the equation because of points number 1 and 2 point number 4   if you 're getting a loan for your required mortgage down payment you are a much bigger repayment risk than you realize

littleadv is incorrect because receiving a 1099 means she will be taxed self employment tax on top of federal income taxes your employer will automatically withhold 7.65 of payroll taxes as they pay you each paycheck and then they 'll automatically pay the other half of your payroll tax an additional 7.65 to bring it to a total of 15.3 in other words because your wife is technically self employed she will owe both sides of payroll tax which is 15.3 of $ 38k = $ 5,800 on top of your federal income tax which is the only thing the w-4 is instructing them about what amount to withhold the huge advantage to a 1099 however is that she 's essentially self employed which means all of the things she needs to run her business are deductible expenses this includes her car computer home office supplies sometimes phone gas maintenance travel expenses sometimes entertainment etc which can easily bring her income down from $ 38k to lets say $ 23k reducing both her federal income tax and self employment tax to apply to $ 15k less saving lets say 50 of $ 15k = $ with federal and self employment because your income is so high she is actually supposed to pay quarterly taxes to make up for all of this the easy way to do this is each quarter plug your total salary + bonus and the tax you have paid so far check your into turbotax along with her income so far and all of her expenses this will give you how much tax you can expect to have left to owe so far this would be your first quarter when you calculate your other quarters do it the exact same way and just subtract what you 've already paid so far that year from your total tax liability

say your bank gives you a loan at a fix interest rate   they can loan money themselves for a floating interest rate   so they try to find someone who will pay or take the difference between the fix and the floating interest rate on your loan     that 's an interest rate swap and there is nothing evil about it per se   derivatives are like knives you can use them for live saving heart surgery or just a kid in a back alley     the inherent danger lies in the fact that it is easier to create than to understand complex derivatives   this can lead to both sides believing they made on the derivative transaction a logically impossible situation   therefore it is always good when derivatives are traded in a transparent well regulated market where current market price is determined   but then the expected profit margins are small so investment bankers will always try to find more exotic derivatives think of a kid using for brain surgery     we need standard derivatives or we have to re think the whole finance world from grounds up without any guarantee we 'll find anything working any better   we do n't need exotic derivatives they 're almost exclusively there because people shoot for bonuses

i doubt that this exists but it could theoretically after all a share is kind of an option to a company 's future success and so a call is already a second level on the better approach would be to create your own put puts by investing less money a in the put you wanted to invest into and put the smaller rest b in the share itself or a call that way if the original put is successful at max b is lost and if it is unsuccessful the loss on a is covered by a gain on b potentially if you do the math you can reach a mathematical equivalent situation to a put put by buying the right amount and kind of calls however we know already that buying a put and a call is a poor strategy so that would mean a put put would also be a poor strategy

okay so   gt lifting the offer hit bids lift offers and i suppose that 's a albeit a somewhat simple one passive routing strategies differ from firm to firm and algo to algo what is your customer going to think if you bid up a new price level only for the stock to rally completely away from it   i mean if you have an open order for more than 10 times the amount currently offered with a limit above the offer and you have nt gotten filled on the bid what can you do but lift the offer and try to be first at the next price level up at least you would have gotten some at the price they quoted or are they fill or kill   gt bidding it up to attract sellers sounds an awful lot like spoofing just a heads up sure though if you want to tighten a spread or create new levels with aggressive passive liquidity that is a strategy the same caveats as i mentioned above apply   just to be clear aggressively adding passive liquidity is the more apt way to put it i 'm talking about when you actually want to get filled on those bids but you 're having trouble finding sellers   could you give me an example of what you might consider passive or aggressive just for scale would a mkt impact of .10 raise any how do you gauge fair value or does that matter less to you than just accumulating selling what you can for what you were asked to   gt anyway if market impact is n't an issue for the customer sure take liquidity until you 're filled do n't forget about getting good size done in the opening and closing auctions moc if you 're too passive you risk the market moving away from you and pissing off the customer if you 're too aggressive you risk moving the market too much and pissing off the customer   so then is the question more how motivated is the buyer or seller   i 'm glad you bring up the moc are there certain securities that do n't have much of a market in those auctions   trying to out how a large firm can hold a position in some of the less popular names with next to no liquidity and little in the way of dark pool auction block sales etc

if it 's just an ordinary credit card i 'd think he could merely dispute the charges since he 's saying they created which i presume means applied for and received a card it should not affect his accounts directly   and especially since application details may be bogus he should be able to prove it was not him even if they got his credit card number he should be able to dispute those charges that are not his especially if they went to a different address or were charged someplace like another city where he was not present at that time otoh if they created a debit card that was linked to his bank account somehow well then that could be a lot more difficult to recover from but even then if it 's not his signature that was used to apply for the card or on any charges that had to be signed for etc he should be able to dispute it and get the bank to put the money back in his account since it will be a case of forgery etc the big problem with id theft is people tend to ruin your credit rating and you end up having to fend off bill collectors etc the primary thing it costs you speaking from experience of having checks stolen and forged using a fake drivers license is the time and hassle of getting everything straightened out and put right   in my case it took a few hours at the credit union and all the money was back in a new account the old one having been closed when i left   dealing with all the poor merchants that were taken and with bill collectors on the other hand took months   but i never once in the process needed quick money from anyone so the need for quick money seems a bit doubtful   i 'd want a lot more details of exactly why he needs money from you refer your friend to this federal trade commission site and make sure he takes the steps listed and especially pays attention to the parts about keeping notes of every single person he talks with including name date time and pertinent details of the conversation   if he has some idea how this happened as in a robbery then report it to the proper authorities and insist on getting a case number talking with bill collectors is the worst just trying to get ahold of them when they send you letters and talk to a person not a recorded number with instructions on how to pay them is sometimes nearly impossible google was my friend   and a lot of times they did n't want to back off till i gave them the case number with the police that somehow magically made it real to them and not just my telling them a story

the total limit book is a composite of all the orders on all of the exchanges while it 's uncommon for a limit order posted beyond the nbbo to fill outside of the nbbo it does occur for example the best ask may be on exchange x but for some reason the smart order routing algorithm may select exchange y if it judges the net trade to be less costly etc and hfts will immediately arbitrage the order between two exchanges or the best order on exchange x disappears causing the order to fill above the nbbo the system is n't perfect because there are multiple exchanges but that eventuality is extremely rare with equities since nearly every exchange will have orders posted at the nbbo because exchange equity fee and rebate schedules are extremely competitive nearly identical   it is however more common with options since less exchanges as a percentage of the total will have orders posted at the nbbo because of very wide exchange rebate and fee schedules how a single exchange handles a new order that crosses an existing limit order is already addressed here how do exchanges match limit orders

a the credit rating agencies only look at the month end totals that are on your credit card as this is all they ever get from the issuing bank so a higher usage frequency as described would not make any direct difference to your credit rating b the issuing bank will know if you use the credit with the higher frequency but it probably has little effect on your limit typically after two to three month they reevaluate your credit limit and it could go up considerably if you never and at this time it could indirectly positively affect your credit rating you could consider calling the issuing bank after two month and try to explain the history a bit and get them to increase the limit but that only makes sense if your credit score has recovered your business paperwork could go a long way to convince someone if you do so well now c if your credit rating is still bad you need to find out why it should have normalized to a medium range with the bad historic issues dropped

if you buy a townhouse you often are in a condominium arrangement in the us when you 're really in a in particular   so that 's a downside right away you have to have a hoa or at least some sort of common agreement though it might not have formal meetings   everyone who owns an interest in the entire group of townhouses gets some say in landscaping and such beyond that though townhouses and similarly are often easier to own as they do n't have as much maintenance that you have to do but more expensive because you pay someone to do it the landscaping the external repairs etc   you likely do n't have as much control over what the external looks like because you have to be in agreement with the other owners but you also do n't have to do the work unless your agreement is to collectively do the mowing landscaping which you should know in advance    i would n't underestimate the value of easier by the way it 's very valuable to not have to deal with as many repairs and to be able to go a week without thinking about mowing or watering   in that sense it can be a nice transition into ownership getting some but not all of the obligations   but if that 's something you really value doing the landscaping and mowing and whatnot that 's relevant too   you can always tell your realtor to look for townhouses where the owners do some all of the landscaping though that opens up a different can of worms where you rely on others to do work that they may not do or do well they 're also somewhat you may be sharing a wall but not necessarily air gap townhouses do exist and either way will be closer to your neighbors   does noise bother you   conversely are you noisy   in a college town this is probably something to pay attention to price wise of course stay well within your means if being close to the city center is important that may lead you to buy a townhouse in that area   if being further out is n't a problem you 'll probably have similar choices in terms of price as long as you look in cheaper areas for single family homes

it 's really not possible to know what your best investment strategy is without knowing more about you which is n't the place of a site like this however i 'll make some general comments about insurance policies as savings insurance policies are extremely inflexible they lay down specific payments and specific returns that you will get back however typically if you do n't follow the of payments laid down you will lose almost all the benefit of the investment since you say you are a beginner i 'll assume you are young too maybe in a few years you will want to buy a house or a nice car or get married or put money into some other investment opportunity if you are committed to making   insurance policy payments you will have less available for the other things you want to do related to this is the estimated returns you say the bonus is around but because an insurance policy locks you in if it turns out that it 's the low end of that or worse you ca n't get out even if other investments are outperforming it

life insurance is not required to be used to pay the debts of the estate life insurance proceeds are not part of your estate they go    directly to the beneficiary and are their property   your daughter    can do whatever she wants with the proceeds she can pay off your credit cards if she wants but she does n’t have    to even if your will said she should use the insurance money to pay    your debts if that ’s what you really want you should make your    estate not your daughter the beneficiary of your insurance policies    then the proceeds will become part of your estate so they ’d be    available to repay your debts source if the deceased owned life insurance and nominated a beneficiary    of the policy the proceeds of that policy would not pass into the    deceased 's estate but would go directly to the nominated beneficiary source the amount of the life insurance is included in the estate for the purpose of calculating estate tax but not for the purpose of debt repayment the estate for the purpose of estate tax is called the gross estate and includes many things that are not included in a probate estate   source

no they are n't they either ca n't afford fast food burgers anymore or they are willing to pay a little extra because they are ashamed of eating at mcdonald 's   all fast food is roughly equivalent the differences are just perception and marketing   we probably all share the same concept of what taco bell and chipotle represent taco bell 's are dirty and filled with while chipotle 's are for younger people who enjoy fresh food that wo n't make you shit yourself   they both sell fake mexican food with ingredients that come from god knows where and are hastily assembled by surly teenagers   is one better than the other   that 's entirely subjective   is one more likely to make your sick   probably not both companies probably have roughly equivalent quality control procedures   does one have a better atmosphere   personally i think that can be up to confirmation bias   you see taco bell 's at gas stations and highway rest stops in poorer neighborhoods and taco bell has also been around for almost 40 years longer than chipotle so of course some of the stores are a bit more run down   americans are n't over fast food at all there is just more competition and the competition has great marketing

an accounting general ledger is based on tracking your actual assets liabilities expenses and income and gnucash is first and foremost a general ledger program while it has some simple budgeting capabilities they 're primarily based around reporting how close your actual expenses were to a planned budget not around forecasting eventual cash flow or saving a portion of assets for particular purposes i think the closest concept to what you 're trying to do is that you want to take your real checking account and segment it into portions you could use something like this as an account hierarchy the total in the checking account parent represents your actual amount of money that you might reconcile with your bank but you have it allocated in your accounting in various ways you may have deposits usually go into the available funds subaccount but when you want to save some money you transfer from that into a savings subaccount you could include that transfer as an additional split when you buy something such as transferring $ 50 from assets checking account available funds sending $ 45 to expenses groceries and $ 5 to assets checking account long term savings this can make it a little more annoying to reconcile your accounts you need to use the include subaccounts checkbox and i 'm not sure how well it 'd work if you ever imported transaction files from your bank another option may be to track your budgeting which answers how much am i allowed to spend on x right now separately from your accounting which only answers how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now using a different application or spreadsheet using gnucash to track budget envelopes is kind of twisting it in a way it 's not really designed for though it may work well enough for what you 're looking for

tl;dr get a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state for tax issues and a lawyer for the operating agreement labor law and contract related issues some things are not suitable for diy unless you know exactly what you 're doing we both do freelance work currently just through our personal names    what kind of taxes are we looking into paying into the business    besides setup of everything compared to being a self proprietor    i 'm seeing that the general answer is no as long as income is < 200k    but not certain unless you decide to have your llc taxed as a corporation there 's no change in taxes llc by default is a pass through entity and all income will flow to your respective tax returns from tax perspective the llc will be treated as a partnership it will file form 1065 to report its income and allocate the income to the members partners on schedules k-1 which will be given to you you 'll use the numbers on the k-1 to transfer income allocated to you to your tax returns and pay taxes on that being out of state will she incur more taxes from the money being now    filtered through the business your employee could n't care less about your tax problems she will continue receiving the same salary whether you are a sole proprietor or a llc or what kind of forms are we looking into needing providing when    switching to a llc from freelance work normally we just get 1099 's    what would that be now your contract counterparts could n't care less about your tax problems unless you are a corporation people who pay you more than $ 600 a year must file a 1099 since you 'll be a partnership you 'll need to provide the partnership ein instead of your own ssn but that 's the only difference are llc 's required to pay taxes 4 times per year we would definitely    get an accountant for things but being as this is side work there    will be times where we choose to not take on clients which could    cause multiple months of no income obviously we would save for when    we need to pay taxes but is there a magic number that says you must    now pay four times per year unless you choose to tax your llc as a corporation llc will pay no taxes you will need to make sure you have enough withholding to cover for the additional income or pay the quarterly estimates the magic number is $ 1000 if your is $ 1000 less than what your tax liability is you 'll be penalized unless the total is more than 100 of your prior year tax liability or 110 depending on the amounts the llc would be 50 50 but that work would not always be that we    will be taking on smaller project through the company so there will    be times where one of us could potentially be making more money are    we setting ourselves up for disaster if one is payed more than the    other while still having equal ownership partnerships can be very flexible and equity split does n't have to be the same as income loss or assets split but you 'll need to have a lawyer draft your operational agreement which will define all these splits and who gets how much in what case make sure to cover as much as possible in that agreement in order to avoid problems later

if you 're worried about investing all at once you can deploy your starting chunk of cash gradually by investing a bit of it each month quarter etc dollar cost averaging   the financial merits and of this have been debated but it is unlikely to lose you a lot of money and if it has the psychological benefit of inducing you to invest it can be worth it even if it results in slightly less than optimal gains more generally you are right with what you say at the end of your question in the long run when you start wo n't matter as long as you continue to invest regularly   the boglehead style index fund based theory is basically that yes you might save money by investing at certain times but in practice it 's almost impossible to know when those times are so the better choice is to just keep investing no matter what   if you do this you will eventually invest at high and low points so the ups and downs will be moderated also note that from this perspective your example of investing in 2007 is incorrect   it 's true that a person who put money in 2007 and then sat back and did nothing would have barely broken even by now   but a person who started to invest in 2007 and continued to invest throughout the economic downturn would in fact reap substantial rewards due to continued investing throughout the lows   happily i speak from experience on this point

basically no you have retirement plan options and can either go with a roth option which wo n't change your current tax burden or go with a traditional plan which is tax deductible   but wo n't change your business deductions or self employment taxes this article has an explanation of options for setting up sep or solo 401k plans key quote for all the pre tax retirement plans because pre tax employer and employee contributions are deducted in    the same way neither one is more tax efficient than the other the article goes on to say that if you were an s corp or llc that elected to be taxed as an s corp a solo 401(k plan would allow the business to make an employer contribution to your 401(k and even then there 's no tax advantage to the employer contribution conclusion for s corps employer contributions would reduce the amount of income from the s corporation that    would be passed through to you as the owner thereby reducing your    income tax but because this income is not subject to payroll taxes    in the first place these contributions will not reduce your payroll    taxes

keep in mind that you need to have a cash reserve   blindly applying all stray cash to debt reduction is a bad idea   your lenders do not care about your balance   all they care about is your next payment   it is therefore imperative that you have a cash reserve that can carry these payments for several months   having zero cash reserves puts you at high risk for such simple things as the payroll clerk at work missing the monthly deposit rare but it happens i 've also been in situations where a major client had a cash flow issue and delayed payment and our company had to borrow to meet payroll that month   fortunately we were in good standing with the bank and had low debt but it could have been catastrophic for any employees living paycheque to paycheque

the hst is a sales tax levied on most goods and services it is important to realize that in both bc and ontario the new hst does not in most cases result in an increase in sales tax paid for example in ontario the pst is 8 and when combined with the gst the sales tax is 13 with the hst the gst and pst are replaced by a single hst of 13 so the tax bill does not change some services that were previously not subject to pst such as mutual fund service fees and labour will now be subject to the hst so some things will increase over time this should not have a material impact on the consumer due to the way businesses remit gst hst

i would suggest you forget everything you learned in economics the only applicable knowledge is accounting 101   step 1 an accrual basis financial statement there is no step 2 if you do n't do this most small business do everything cash basis simpler cheaper but useless for analysis you would get better answers from the local fortune teller than a cash basis statement    make one change from the general rules if you have debt or are paying interest for inventory include that in your cost of sales this is actually proper but the rule is little known and often ignored interest on debt up to the amount of inventory is a cost of inventory   step 2 gross profit if you seem to be working hard and still losing money it may be because you are selling products for less than they cost you in this case the more you sell the more you lose so suggestions like advertising or doing anything to increase sales are actually destructive   step 3 price products at the level necessary to turn a profit at current sales and overhead when we have enough sales we will make a profit is the philosophy of a start up business it is toxic for a going concern   step 4 if sales are unsustainable at the price that produces a profit have the courage to sell or close the business i have seen people waste their lives on futile endeavors just because they ca n't make that tough decision   finally step 0 ignore all other suggestions but this they are well meaning but ill informed to reiterate growing sales while losing money on every transaction is a huge mistake trends books charts and graphs analytics and market research are the tools of con men and fortune tellers business is arithmetic and nothing more or less   fyi if i do n't get at least one upvote this is the last time i am giving my valuable professional advice away for free on reddit folks will have to rely on the suggestions of their fellow college kids

it could be a a way to preserve the value of your money but depends upon various factors if a country defaults and it leads to hyper inflation by definition that means that money loses its purchasing power   in even simpler terms it can not buy as much tomorrow as i could today therefore people can be to either hoard physical goods or other non perishable items real estate may well be such an item   if you are resident in the country you have to live somewhere   it is possible that a landlord might try to raise rent beyond what your job is willing to pay   of course in a house you might have a similar situation with utilities like electricity assuming some kind of re stabilization of the economy and currency even with several more zeros on the end it is conceivable that the house would subsequently sell for an appropriately inflation adjusted amount as other in demand physical goods may lots of variables good luck

my understanding is that when you die the stocks are sold and then    the money is given to the beneficiary or the stock is repurchased in    the beneficiaries name this is wrong and the conclusion you draw from michael 's otherwise correct answer follows your false assumption   you seem to understand the estate tax federal threshold jersey would have its own and i have no idea how it works there if the decedent happened to trade in the tax year prior to passing normal tax rules apply   now if the executor chooses to sell off and liquidate the estate to cash there 's no further taxable gain a $ 5 m portfolio can have millions in long term gain but the step up basis pretty much negates all of it   if that 's the case the beneficiaries are n't likely to repurchase those shares in fact they might not even know what the list of stocks was unless they through the asset list but that sale was unnecessary assets can be up and distributed in kind each beneficiary getting their fraction of the number of shares of each stock and then your share of the $ 5 m has a stepped up basis meaning if you sell that day your gains are near zero you might owe a few dollars for whatever the share move in the time passing between the step up date and date you sell   i hope that clarifies your misunderstanding   by the way the irs is just an intermediary it 's congress that writes the laws including the tangled web of tax code the irs is the moral equivalent of a great customer service team working for a company we do n't care for

you will be rolling over the proceeds since you can only deposit cash into an ira however this should probably not affect your considerations much since the pre rollover sale is non taxable within the 401k and the period of roll over itself when the cash is uninvested is relatively short so whatever investments you choose in your 401k you 'll just sell them and then buy them or similar investments back after the rollover to the ira if you 're worrying about a flash crash right on the day when you want to cash out that can definitely happen but it is not really something you can prepare for you can consider moving to money market several weeks before the potential date of your withdrawal if you think it will make you feel safer otherwise i do n't think it really matters

all of these answers are great but i wanted to add one piece of advice from someone who has been married 8 years and been in various financial situations have one of you whoever the two of you feel is more organized and more financially responsible be solely in charge of paying the monthly bills but keep a spreadsheet or some other tracking mechanism so that the other can monitor this as well that way if you guys ever decide to switch roles there wo n't be much of a learning curve also do n't do three bank accounts one or two is enough more than that starts becoming more difficult to keep track of and if you have any sort of monthly fees on the accounts it also wastes money my wife and i each have our own account and we get money for each other if necessary she handles paying the bills but keeps a monthly spreadsheet that has all pertinent info we have a number and color coding system to determine which paycheck 1st or 2nd of the month the bill is paid in and whether it has been paid not paid or past due green yellow red hopefully you do n't ever have to see the red color :p

debit cards have a certain processing delay lag time before the transaction from the vendor completes with your bank in the us it 's typically 3 business days but i have seen even a 15 day lag from panera bread i guess in the uk payment processors have similar processing delays a business is not obliged to run its payment processing in realtime as that 's very expensive whatever be the lag time your bank is supposed to cover the payment you promised through your card now if you do n't have agreements in place for example overdraft with your bank they will likely have to turn down payments that exceed your available balance here is the raw deal in the end the responsibility to ensure that your available balance is enough is upon you and whether you have agreements in place to handle such situations so what happened is very much legal a business is not obliged to run its payment processing in realtime and no ethics are at stake to ensure such things do not happen to me i used to use a sub account from which my debit card used to get paid i have since moved to credit cards as the hassle of not overdrawing was too much and overdraft fees from banks in the us are disastrous especially for people who actually need such a facility

tax concerns aside there are managerial pros and cons for internal billing   for cost control purposes it 's common to break individual business activities into divisions sections which have a p&amp;l or are cost centers at that point if you know for example that your quality control inspections cost on average 1 of your product cost then one might bill internally for use of this cost center   one argument for doing this is it makes those who are billed more cautious about using internal resources as there 's a direct cost allocation it also benchmarks that resource against for example it may be significantly cheaper to use an external resource there can therefore be a healthy tension between the cost center and user which in theory results in pressure for the cost center to improve efficiency    in practice i 've found there are some significant cons first issue is with cost allocation the cost center in an attempt to make their service appear more efficient will battle to get minimal overhead costs allocated to them creating friction between departments second and i think a major issue is a blanket cost for use of a service invariably winds up with a lot of exceptions in the previous example there may be some very large programs where a 1 inspection fee winds up with a huge sum of money one that the product team may argue unfairly reduces their net income and therefore compensation then there 's the administrative cost of what essentially is passing money from the left hand to the right even if just on paper third issue is with some activities you might not want to provide a disincentive for people to use the for example charging a product team for quality assurance may result in skipped qa processes for the benefit of cost savings   what i 've found works better is creation of cost centers with management of those centers this is common in companies that have a matrix organizational structure using the same example again qa costs are broken out and completely separated from other areas and qa management is independently

it means that at the end of each month the apy divided by 365 for leap years is multiplied by your account 's ending balance on each day of that month then those interest amounts are summed up and paid out it 's exactly equivalent to the average daily balance method at the end of each month the balance of your account on each day is summed divided by the number of days in the month then that number is multiplied by the apy 365 number of days in the month if you write out all these terms and simplify you 'll find the two boil down to exactly the same calculation being performed in different order possibly with differing potential for rounding error the only difference between them is whether the daily interest percentage is distributed to each daily balance or applied to the sum and whether there 's an additional redundant pair of steps of dividing and then multiplying by the number of days in the month
