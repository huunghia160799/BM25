there 's no limitation on what you can invest in including trading stocks as long as trading is not a business activity like day trading or investing for others you just need to make sure you have a tax id either itin or ssn and pay taxes on all the gains and dividends also consider your home country tax laws since you 're still tax resident in your home country most likely

people treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace in the hole when it comes to financial difficulty but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize what is an emergency first you have to define what an emergency is   is it a lost job   is it an unplanned event pregnancy perhaps   is it a medical emergency   is it the death of you or your spouse also what does it mean to be unplanned   is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency   is one month of planning an emergency   two only you can answer these questions for yourself but they significantly shape your financial strategy   planning is highly dependent on your cashflow and for some people it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work   for others they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month also you have to consider the length of the emergency   job loss is rarely permanent but it 's rarely short as well   the current average is weeks that 's 7 months money in an emergency there are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency a good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account   some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other   however some of these are correlated for example in 2008 three things happened   the stock market crashed unsecured debt dried up and people faced financial emergency lost jobs cut wages   if you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit you 'd be up a creek because the value of your investments suddenly decreased and you ca n't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit however if you had a one or more of cash savings unemployment income and unemployment insurance you would probably have been ok budgeting for an emergency when you say financial emergency most people think job loss   however the most common cause of bankruptcy in the us is medical debt   depending on your insurance situation this could be a serious risk or it may not be    people say you should have of your monthly income in savings because it 's an easy back of the envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk but it 's not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you to properly budget for an emergency you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency generally having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk mitigation strategy   but it 's not a panacea for every kind of emergency

to my knowledge there 's no universal equation so this could vary by individual company    the equation i use outside of sentiment measurement is the below which carries its own risks this equations assumes two key points anything over 1.2 is considered oversold if those two conditions apply   the reason for the bear market is that that 's the time stocks generally go on sale and if a company has a solid balance sheet even in a downturn while their profit may decrease some a value over 1.2 could indicate the company is oversold an example of this is warren buffett 's investment in wells fargo in 2009 around march when wfc hit approximately 7 9 a share   although the banking world was experiencing a crisis buffett saw that wfc still had a solid balance sheet even with a decrease in profit   the missing logic with many investors was a decrease in profits if you look at the per capita income figures americans lost some income but not near enough to justify the stock falling 50%+ from its high when evaluating its business and balance sheet   the market quickly caught this too within two months wfc was almost at $ 30 a share as an interesting side note on this wfc now pays $ 1.20 dividend a year   a person who bought it at $ 7 a share is receiving a yield of on their $ 7 a share investment still this equation is not without its risks   a company may have a solid balance sheet but end up borrowing more money while losing a ton of profit which the investor finds out about ad hoc seen this happen several times   suddenly what appeared to be a good sale turns into a person buying a penny with a dollar   this is why to my knowledge no universal equation applies as if one did exist every hedge fund mutual fund etc would be using it one final note with becoming more common i 'm not sure we 'll see this type of opportunity again   2009 offered some great deals but a could easily be built with the above equation or a similar one meaning that as soon as we had that type of environment all stocks fitting that scenario would be bought pushing up their   some companies might be willing to take an all risk if they assess that this equation works for more than n% of companies especially if that n% returns an that outweighs the loss   the only advantage that a small investor might have is that these large companies with are over leveraged in bad investments and with a decline they ca n't make the good investments until its too late   remember the equation ultimately assumes a person company has free cash to use it this was also a problem for many large investment firms in 2009 they were over leveraged in bad debt

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had nâ€™t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

i 'm mostly guessing based on existing documentation and have no direct experience so take this with a pinch of salt my best understanding is that you need to file form 843 the instructions for the form say that it can be used to request a refund or of a penalty or addition to tax due to     reasonable cause or other reason other than erroneous written     advice provided by the irs allowed under the law the reasonable cause here is a good faith confusion about what line 79 of the form was referring to in form 843 the irc section code you should enter is estimated tax for more see the irc section note however that if you already received a notice from the irs you should cross check that this section code is listed on the notice under the part that covers the estimated tax penalty if your request is accepted the irs should issue you notice item 17 penalty removed you can get more general information about the tax collection process and how to challenge it from the pages linked from understanding your notice

to answer the heart of your question it would be illegal for any credit bureau or creditor to somehow penalize you just for trying to make sure that what 's being reported about you is accurate   that 's why the fair credit reporting act exists that 's where the rights and mechanisms come from for letting you learn about and request accurate reporting of your credit history every creditor is responsible for reporting its own data to the bureaus using the format provided by those bureaus for doing so a creditor may not provide all of the information that can be reported and it may not report information in as timely a manner as it could or should e.g. payments made may not show up for weeks or even months after they were made etc the bottom line is that the credit bureaus are not of the data they report   they simply report   they do n't draw conclusions they do n't make decisions on what data to report   if a creditor provides data that is within the parameters of what the bureaus ask to be provided then the bureaus report precisely that nothing more nothing less if there is an or mistake on your report it is the fault and responsibility of the creditor and it is therefore up to the creditor to correct it once it has been brought to their attention   federal laws spell out the process that the bureau has to comply with when you file a dispute and there are strict standards requiring the creditor to promptly verify valid information or remove anything which is not correct the credit bureaus are simply automated clearinghouses for the information provided by the creditors who choose to subscribe to each bureau 's system   a creditor can choose which or none of the bureaus they wish to report to which is why some accounts show on one bureau 's report on you but not another 's what i caution is just because a credit bureaus reports on your credit does n't mean they have anything to do with the accuracy or detail of what is being reported   that 's up to the creditors

the government forced jpm to buy bear stearns essentially acquire its assets otherwise the bank 's liquidity would have which would have threatened the entire system basically bear stearns could n't service its own loans or leverage so it had to be bought otherwise those loans and leverage would appear as a default consequently the us government gave them the money to do it and forced them to do so without regard to what jpm wanted to do the government the treasury and the fed then proceeded to attack jpm for being too big to fail something that the government literally forced it to become i 'm not a banking apologist or a crazy libertarian i would vote democrat if i lived in the us but this is not accurate the purchase of bear stearns was forced it would've made more sense for jpm to just let bear stearns fail   following your analogy it 's actually more like you already having a million dollar house while the government forces you to take money to purchase the house across the street while leaving you with the bill for your properties into one huge estate then the government tells you your property is too big that you are a threat to the neighbourhood and have to all over again

those advantages you 've described tax treatment and employee match are what you receive in exchange for locking up the money ultimately it 's a personal choice of whether that tradeoff makes sense for you situation i 'll echo the response that the real answer to your question is planning roth options either 401 k or ira may be good compromises for you since you can withdraw those contributions but not the earnings without any penalty since you 've already paid taxes on them another avenue to explore may be a self directed ira or a solo 401(k depending on your circumstances and eligibility in both cases there are plan providers that structure the plan to allow you to use the money to invest in things besides traditional stocks bonds and mutual funds often referred to as checkbook control accounts they are very commonly used among real estate investors this thread from has quite a bit of info you 'd want to consult with an accountant or financial adviser before going down that path
# 99137
other people have pointed this out but there are a few considerations in whether you should do a roth or traditional ira such as one of the major arguments for using a traditional ira is that you can at least in theory afford to contribute more money initially than you 'd be able to afford if you were using a roth ira while this is in theory true i 'm not at all convinced that using a traditional ira will actually cause people to contribute more to it realistically how many people will actually contribute say $ 500 more to their ira because they knew that their contribution for this year will save them $ 500 to know if this is the case consider the last time that you actually invested some of your tax refund in your retirement account i have n't seen any actual statistics on this but i 'm guessing that very few people do this please see other people 's answers for details on the mathematics behind that the second argument for contributing to a traditional ira is if you expect your future income tax rate to be lower than your current tax rate for some reason e.g. due to a change in government policy e.g. replacing income taxes with value added tax or something like that the fact that you 're doing the contribution relatively close to when you 're planning on withdrawing it etc please see this question for more discussion about this keep in mind that while a traditional ira saves you tax money this year a roth ira saves you money when you withdraw it so it 's not really a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now or $ 5000 later it 's a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now vs. for example $ 50,000 later or however much the money 's grown by the time you withdraw it maybe the traditional ira is still worth it though if there are changes to tax policy or you end up with a lot more money in your traditional ira due to being able to contribute more

you 're being too hard on yourself you 've managed to save quite a bit which is more than most people ever do you 're in a wonderful position actually you have savings and time you do n't mention how long you want need to continue working but i 'll assume 20 years or so you do n't have to invest it all at once like pete b says index funds just read what mr. buffett said in recent news he 'd tell his widow to invest in the s&p 500 index and not berkshire hathaway should be a decent percentage you can also pick a target fund from any of the major investment firms fees are higher than an index but it will take care of any asset allocation decisions put some in each also look at retirement accounts to take advantage of tax deferred or tax free growth but that 's another question and country specific in any case do n't even blink when the market goes down and it will go down if you 're still working earning and saving it 'll just be another opportunity to buy more at lower prices as for the house no reason you ca n't invest and save for a house invest some for the long term and set aside the rest for the house in 1 5 years if you do n't think you 'll ever really buy the house though invest the majority of it for the long term i have a feeling from the tone of your question that you tend to put off the big financial decisions so if you wo n't really buy the house just admit it to yourself now

the answer seems to depend on where you live   perhaps you already found this but the summary from the irs is the insurance laws in some states do not allow a corporation to purchase group health insurance when the corporation only has one employee therefore if the shareholder was the sole corporate employee the shareholder had to purchase his health insurance in his own name the irs issued notice 2008 1 which ruled that under certain situations the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction even if the health insurance policy was purchased in the name of the shareholder notice 2008 1 provided four examples including three examples in which the shareholder purchased the health insurance and one in which the s corporation purchased the health insurance notice 2008 1 states that if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name and paid for it with his own funds the shareholder would not be allowed an above the line deduction on the other hand if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name but the s corporation either directly paid for the health insurance or reimbursed the shareholder for the health insurance and also included the premium payment in the shareholder â€™s w-2 the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction the bottom line is that in order for a shareholder to claim an above the line deduction the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the s corporation and must be reported as taxable compensation in the shareholder â€™s w-2 i understand this to mean that you can only get the deduction in your case having purchased it in your own name if your state does not allow your s corp to purchase a group health plan because you only have one employee i do n't know specifically if illinois fits that description or not   in addition there are rules about reporting health insurance premiums for taxes for s corp share members that you should also check   personally i think that it 's complicated enough that advice from a cpa or other tax advisor specific to your situation would be worth the cost

if i understand correctly the traditional ira if you have 401k with an employer already has the following features actually 1 and 2 are characteristics of roth iras not traditional iras only 3 is a characteristic of a traditional ira whether you have a 401(k with your employer or not makes absolutely no difference in how your iras are taxed for the vast majority of people the rules for iras are different if you have a very high income though you 're allowed to have and contribute to both kinds of accounts in fact i personally have both traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free as people sometimes mistakenly call them they 're very different meaning that you do n't have to pay taxes on the contributions or profits you make inside the account e.g. from dividends interest profits from stock you sell etc rather you pay taxes on any money you withdraw for roth iras the contributions are taxed but you never have to pay taxes on the money inside the account again that means that any money you get over and above the contributions e.g. through interest trading profits dividends etc are genuinely tax free also if you leave any of the money to people they do n't have to pay any taxes either important point there are no tax free retirement accounts in the u.s. the distinction between different kinds of iras basically boils down to pay now or pay later many people make expensive mistakes in their retirement strategy by not understanding that point please note that this applies equally to traditional and roth 401(k)s as well you can have roth 401(k)s and traditional 401(k)s just like you can have roth iras and traditional iras the same terminology and logic applies to both kinds of accounts as far as i know there are n't major differences tax wise between them with two exceptions you 're allowed to contribute more money to a 401(k per year and you 're allowed to have a 401(k even if you have a high income by way of contrast people with very high incomes generally are n't allowed to open iras a primary advantage of a traditional ira is that you can in theory at least afford to contribute more money to it due to the tax break you 're getting also you can defer taxes on any profits you make e.g. through dividends or selling stock at a profit so you can grow your money faster

the bottom line is something in your story is not adding up    you had two checks one that is voided and one that is not   lets say they are both written against your account for $ 100   lets also assume that have exactly $ 100 in your account you give the liquor store the voided one they give you $ 100 but when they attempt to cash the check at their bank they are denied and assessed a $ 20 fee   you spend the $ 100 they gave you however you still should have $ 100 in your account as the check was not cashed you want to make things right with the liquor store   you should be able to withdraw the $ 100 you still have in the bank and give them that much   while they will still be out the $ 20 fee that should make them feel much better about you as a customer   tell them when you will be paid and that you will give them the $ 20 on that date   then do so the only way this problem is not is that you spent the $ 100 that was left in the bank   in that case the liquor store is correct you stole the money   more accurately you spent money that was n't yours

it depends to some extent on how you interpret the situation so i think this is the general idea say you purchase one share at $ 50 and soon after the price moves up say to $ 55 you now have an unrealized profit of $ 5 now you can either sell and realize that profit or hold on to the position expecting a further price appreciation in either case you will consider the price change from this traded price which is $ 55 and not the price you actually bought at hence if the price fell to $ 52 in the next trade you have a loss of $ 3 on your previous profit of $ 5 this even though your net p&l is calculated from the initial purchase price of $ 50 allows you to think in terms of your positions at the latest known prices this is similar to a markov process in the sense that it does n't matter which route the stock price and your position 's p&l took to get to the current point your decision should be based on the current latest price level

kinda i 'd   be interested in seeing broader studies because minimum wage also influences other pay as well   i work in the medical field and most insurances base their rates off of what medicare medicaid pay in each geographic area by artificially setting the min wage too high you 're going to influence the jobs that require marginally more skills and experience than min wage jobs   obviously this influence has less effect the higher skilled and experience the position is but nonetheless influences them    moreover there are other things that minimum wage influences such as here in california the government thought it was a bright idea to require servers be paid the regular minimum wage plus tips instead of the lower federally legal server min wage this has had the effect that there are significantly more servers than low to mid skilled workers in ca because you can easily earn $ 20 30   or more per hour   not to mention they get ot for every minute over 8 hours they work   not to mention iirc cali requires that salaried employees must be paid twice min wage    so yeah while it does n't directly affect a lot of people but it indirectly affects a lot    but ask me if i think raising the min wage is a good idea fuck no

as other people have said a few thousand dollars is n't going to make any significant difference in what you pay if you put an extra 1 down and redraw all the documents accordingly your payments are going to be roughly 1 less per month   so for example $ 1800 per month would become $ or so per month    you 're much better off keeping the money as an emergency fund when you buy a house there are a lot of things that can go wrong as is the case with your car if you have one and with medical expenses and helping out a relative not to mention losing your job and so on   it does n't sound like you have all that much money because if you did you would have put 20 down and avoided private mortgage insurance saving yourself a lot more money than 1 so having a few more thousand in the bank sounds like a good thing

disclaimer this should go without saying but this answer is definitely an opinion i 'm pretty sure my current accountant would agree with this answer and i 'm also pretty sure that one of my past accountants would disagree when i started my own small business over 10 years ago i asked this very same question for pretty much every purchase i made that would be used by both the business and me personally i was and naive then and i just assumed everything was deductible until my accountant could prove otherwise at some point you need to come up with some rules of thumb to help make sense of it or else you 'll drive yourself and your accountant here is one of the rules i like to use in this scenario if you never would have made the purchase for personal use and if you    must purchase it for business use and if using    it for personal use does not increase the expense to the business it    can be fully deducted by the business even if you sometimes use it personally too here are some example implementations of this rule note about partial expenses i did n't mention partial deductions above because i do n't feel it applies when the criteria of my rule of thumb is met note that the irs states personal versus business expenses generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part at first read that makes it sound like some of my examples above would need to be split into partial however i think the key distinction is that you would never have made the purchase for personal use and that the cost to the business does not increase because of allowing personal use partial deductions come into play when you have a shared car or office or something where the business cost is increased due to shared use in general i try to avoid anything that would be a partial expense though i do allow my business to reimburse me for mileage when i lend it my personal car for business use

to be able to truly short something you technically need to be able to borrow the security so you can sell it   there needs to be a system for borrowing in place to be able to do this which is very robust for large u.s. stocks but does n't exist for cdos mainly due to the complex legal structures around them    however the word short is commonly used in finance to mean profiting from a loss of value of something   so the use in the movie title though a bit confusing was fine credit default swaps are not technically insurance as you do n't need own the thing you are insuring and for a few other reasons   however i agree with the movie that thinking of them as insurance is a pretty good way to understand them   as you are playing a monthly premium to for a contract that pays out when something goes very wrong    however the movie was a little fast a loose as cds of various types were regularly traded well before the bubble even started   though maybe not that particular type of cds   so while they may have been expensive it was the easiest route and reasonable idea

here 's some way of thinking about it and i 'm not really sure if it 's completely correct but sometimes we oversimplify when trying to tell a five year old   say there are two people in the world you and me we both have $ 100 a total of $ 200 in the world   suddenly a wild bank appears i deposit my $ 100 in the bank i still have $ 100 and you still have $ 100 now you want to buy something from me that costs $ 150 you go to the bank to loan money the bank has $ 100 available so gives you $ 50 you give me $ 150 now i have $ 250 and you are $ 50 in debt i deposit the $ 150 in the bank   we do this again and again until i have $ 1000 on my bank account and you are $ 900 in debt i want to buy a house of $ 500 and go to my bank demanding to take out $ 500 but there is only $ 200 in the whole world so the bank can only give me $ 200   money has been created out of thin air but it 's actually you who are in debt if you go bankrupt the bank has a big debt it wo n't get back and is in deep shit when i come around to demand my money back at that point governments step in to loan the bank money for cheap because if the bank fails i will lose all my pension savings i put into that bank as well as my companies and a lot of my employees   and other banks loaned this bank money so if this bank fails the other banks will be in the exact same position and will also fail because then they will also have debts that wo n't be paid back   there are regulations minimizing this i.e. a bank is required to keep a percentage of the amount of money on its accounts so there 's a maximum limit of money created

bonds are priced very high because their price is compared to their yields with the current interest rates which are very low the bond yields will be low however bond issuers still need the money so there still will be high par value and investors will not sell bonds at a loss unless there 's a better investment = bonds with better yields once the rates start going up you 'll see bonds with current rates dropping in value significantly once alternatives appear people holding them will start dumping them to move the money somewhere more profitable similarly the stocks since there 's no other investment alternatives yields on the bonds are low interests are low people invest more in the stocks once the rates go up the investors will start rebalancing portfolios and cashing out

wow it 's clear i 'm outnumbered   when i 'm approached with the question and keep in mind it 's usually a couple data points and little else i am getting started with no other money do i fund a retirement or emergency account i often suggest they put the funds into a roth in a money market fund and treat it like an emergency account if there 's in fact an emergency there 's no penalty to withdraw the deposit and we 're talking peanuts for interest today   with no emergency two things could happen a as the account grows beyond what 's needed for emergencies the excess can be invested long term b as the investor earns more money and saves up enough to have a true emergency account separate from the ira the roth can be fully invested long term the bad idea stems from the view that one is using their roth as an emergency account which of course is bad the subtle difference is one has no retirement savings and puts their emergency account into the otherwise unused roth as time passes they 've protected more funds to grow tax free   in the end the most important thing is whether the person is saving and not tapping for simple non emergency things i 'd rather see a guy with $ 25 k in his roth and no other funds than to have $ 5000 in his bank account because every time it gets larger he feels compelled to spend it   my answer to matt is to treat it for now as you intended low risk cd or cash money market

why would you want to withdraw only the company match and presumably leave your personal contributions sitting in your ex company 's 401k plan generally 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an ira so unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to and you think those investments are where you want your money to be roll over part or all of your 401k assets into an ira and withdraw the rest for personal expenses   if your personal contributions are in a roth 401k roll them over to a roth ira but as i remember it company contributions are not part of the roth 401k and must be rolled over into a traditional ira perhaps this is why you want to take those in cash to pay for your personal purchase also what is this 30 hit you are talking about you will owe income tax on the money withdrawn from the 401k and custodians traditionally withhold 20 and send it to the irs on your behalf plus penalty for early withdrawal which the custodian may also withhold if you ask them but the tax that you will pay on the money withdrawn will depend on your tax bracket which may be lower if you are laid off and do not immediately take on a new job that is the 30 hit may be on the cash flow but you may get some of it back as a refund when you file your income tax return

if the company reported a loss at the previous quarter when the stock what at say $ 20/share and now just before the company 's next quarterly report the stock trades around $ 10/share there is a misunderstanding here the company does n't sell stock they sell products or services stock share traded at equity market here is the illustration to give you better insight    now addressing the question what if the stock 's price change let say its drop from $ 10 to $ 1 is it affect xyz revenue no why because xyz selling ads not their stocks the formula for revenue revenue = products in this case ads quantity the equation does n't involve capital stock 's purchasing

apple does not have a philosophy of at any cost they have a goal of making a healthy profit from whatever they do so the only share they do care about is profit share and they are winning that and samsung profits among top mobile phone   this race to the bottom that android makers might be participating in is not interesting for apple to take part of they want the status of a luxury item and have people desire to at some point have an iphone of their own    they are already making the iphone more accessible on the marked by keeping production of older models and selling them for a reduced price but is only as long as those models can keep a good profit margin and keep up sales

from my understanding by paying your bills more than 5 days late will not lead you into bankruptcy or stop you from getting a new loan in the future however it may mean that lenders offer you credit at a higher interest rate this of course would not help you as you are already struggling with your finances however no matter how bad you think things might be for you financially there are always things you can do to improve your situation set a budget the first thing you must do is to set a budget list down all sources of income you receive each month including any allowances then list all your sources of expenses and spending list all your bills such as rent telephone electricity car maintenance credit card and other loans keep a diary for a month for all your discretionary spending including coffees lunches and other odd bits and ends you can also talk with your existing lenders and come to some agreement on reducing you interest rates on your debts and the repayments but remember any reduction in repayments may increase your repayment period and the total interest you have to pay in the long term if you need help setting up your budget here are some links to resources you can download to help you get started once you set up your budget you want your total income to be more than your total expenses if it is n't you will be getting further and further behind each month some things you can do are to increase your income get a job second job sell some unwanted items or start a small home business some things you can do to reduce your expenses make coffees and lunches at home before going out and buying these pay off higher interest debts first consolidate all your debts into a lower interest rate loan reduce discretionary spending to an absolute minimum cancel all unnecessary services etc debt consolidation in regards to a debt consolidation for your existing personal loans and credit cards into a single lower interest rate loan can be a good idea but there are some pitfalls you should consider if you are taking out a loan with a lower interest rate but a longer term to pay it off you may end up paying less in monthly repayments but will end up paying more interest in the long run if you do take this course of action try to keep your term to no longer than your current debt 's terms and try to keep your repayments as high as possible to pay the debt off as soon as possible and reduce any interest you have to pay again be wary of the fine print and read the of any products you are thinking of getting refer to money smart website for more valuable information you should consider before taking out any debt consolidation assistance improving your skills and getting a higher paid job if you are finding it hard to get a job especially one that pays a bit more look into your options of doing a course and improving your skills there is plenty of assistance available for those wanting to improve their skills in order to improve their chances of getting a better job check out centrelink 's website for more information on payments for students and other action you can take if you are finding that the repayments are really getting out of hand and no one will help you with any debt consolidation or reducing your interest rates on your debts as a last resort you can apply for a part 9 debt agreement but be very careful as this is an alternative to bankruptcy and like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever further assistance and help if you have trouble reading any or want further information or help regarding any issues i have raised or any other part of your financial situation you can contact centrelink 's financial information service they provide a free and confidential service that provides education and information on financial and lifestyle issues to all australians learn how to manage your money so you can get out of your debt and can lead a much more comfortable and less stressful life into the future

student loan is a class of unsecured loan   the characteristics that define a student loan are primarily that it is a loan that is intended to be used by someone who is currently a student   beyond that though there are many variations the different kinds of requirements usually have to do with who is eligible for the loan and with what the loan is allowed to be used to pay   some loans have other limitations such as only being allowed to be directly paid to the institution some student loans are federally guaranteed meaning the federal government will repay the bank if you default   those have a lower interest rate typically and often have more stringent requirements such as only full time students being eligible being need based and limitations on what the loan 's funds can be used for   see for more information many private student loans have quite lax limitations some for example have nearly no limitation as to what they can fund many are allowed to be taken out by part time students and even non degree seeking students in some cases   private loans usually have somewhat higher rates as they 're entirely unsecured to go along with the lower restrictions and higher borrowing limits   you 'd have to see the specific details of any particular loan to know what it 's allowed to pay for so if you choose this route know what you plan to use it to pay for before you go looking

i notice that a lot happened four months ago you were denied credit twice your income went up from $ 20k to $ 60k i 'm wondering if you were denied credit based on your $ 20k income since you could n't provide proof of your income i wonder if they used $ 0 for your income   debt to income ratio is one significant factor included in the credit score calculation you may not have a lot of debt but if you do n't have any income even a few hundred dollars on a credit card would throw your debt to income ratio into a panic i 'm assuming that your change from $ 20k to $ 60k income involved a change of jobs perhaps now you can provide proof of income you would certainly need to do that before being approved for a mortgage   well that 's my two cents about what may or may not have gone wrong last time as for what to do next i would agree that the most helpful thing you could do is check your credit score and fix any errors that might negatively impact your credit score there might also be non errors that need addressed such as open credit accounts that you thought you had closed when building credit history time is on your side if you just go on living your life and paying your bills promptly your credit will slowly climb to an acceptable level unfortunately in the time frame you mentioned ~1 year there is n't really enough time to build it significantly   you bring up a valid point about credit applications reducing your credit score of course that effect is somewhat minimal and temporary 2 yrs according to the thread linked to above but again 1 year is not enough to recover if you 're considering applying for additional credit as a means to improve your credit score it may be too late to reap the benefits before your mortgage application of course if you could pay off any debts that would help your debt to income ratio but it would also reduce any house down payment you could save up and thereby increase the amount of your mortgage   better just save those pennies or preferably and to put toward a down payment

i like your enthusiasm and initiative however there are a few things you need to consider that you have n't yet thought about first it is important to remember that trading with fake money is not the same as trading with real money   in the fake world you have $ 100k   with this fake money you can do reckless things with it such as put it all on one stock   if you lose it costs you nothing so you do n't have an emotional attachment to it   with real money it will feel different and that is something you have n't experienced yet second you mentioned that you are good at making picks   with all due respect i suggest that you are n't old enough to make that determination   you have n't been trading for long enough to determine if you are doing well at it     that having been said i do n't want to completely discourage you from trying something new third you mentioned long term investing but you also said that you need to make your money back quick and mentioned trading daily   those things are n't really compatible   i would n't consider what you are doing as long term investing   with the type of investing you are doing picking individual stocks and hoping for the value to go up in a relatively short time frame it is similar to gambling   the risk of losing is very much there and you should n't be investing money this way that you are n't prepared to lose   if you need the money for something soon do n't put it in the stock market never forget this   what can happen is that you start with small amounts of money do well and then thinking that you are good at this put in larger amounts of money   you will eventually lose   if you put in money that you need for something else you have a problem if you are trying this out for education and entertainment purposes that is great   but when it starts to get serious make sure that you are aware of the risks   educate yourself and be smart here is what i would suggest if you want to try this short term day trading type investing and you understand that the money can easily be lost i would balance that with investing in a more traditional way set aside an amount each month to put in a low expense index mutual fund   doing this will have several benefits for you   as for your specific questions about stock trading with small amounts yes you can trade with small amounts however every time you trade you will be paying a commission   even with a discount broker if you are trading frequently the commissions you will be paying will be very significant at the dollar amounts you are talking about   the only way i can see around this would be to try the robinhood app which allows you to trade without paying sales commission   i have no experience with that app

i have my safe money in index funds but like to dabble in individual stocks my criteria and thought process are usually like this let 's use sbux as an example understand what the company does also paraphrased as buy what you know a profitable growing business does n't need to be complicated open stores sell coffee for sbux my decision process literally started inside a store rocky why are you standing in line to overpay for coffee wow look at all these people hmmm i wonder if this is a good stock to buy check out their fundamentals are they profitable book value and peg are helpful and i tend to use them as a gauge for whether i think the stock is overpriced or not i compare those values to others in the industry sbux right now has a pe of ~30 which looks about average for its peers so far so good does it pay a dividend this is n't necessarily good or bad just useful to know i like dividend paying stocks even if it means the stock price might not grow as aggressively also a company that pays a dividend is naturally confident in its ability to turn a profit and generate cash so it 's a safer pick in my opinion sbux pays a dividend a small one but that 's a plus for me am i willing to watch the stock with my index funds i buy and forget with my stocks i keep an eye on the situation read the news and have to make a buy sell decision regularly with sbux i do n't watch all that closely i just keep up with the news imo it 's still a buy based on all the above criteria and i feel less silly now standing in line to overpay for coffee

firstly it is n't so generous   it is a win win but the bank does n't have to mail me a free box of checks with my new account or offer free printing to compete for my business   they already have the infrastructure to send out checks so the actual cost for my bank to mail a check on my behalf is pretty minimal   it might even save them some cost and reduce exposure   all the better if they do n't actually mail a check at all per my bank individuals and most companies you pay using send money will be mailed    a paper check your check is guaranteed to arrive by the delivery date    you choose when you create the payment a select number of companies very large corporations such as telecoms    utilities and cable companies are part of our electronic biller    network and will be paid electronically these payments arrive within    two business days so the answer to your question depend on what kind of bill pay you used   if it was an electronic payment there is n't a realistic possibility the money is n't cashed if your bank did mail a paper check the same rules would apply as if you did it yourself   i suppose it would be up to the bank   when i checked with my bank 's support this was their answer therefore per this answer do personal checks expire us it is really up to your bank whether or not they allow the check to be cashed at a later date   if you feel the check is n't cashed quickly enough you would have to stop payment and contact whoever you were trying to pay and perhaps start again   or ask them to hustle and cash the check before you stop it finally i would bet a dime that your bank does n't pre fund your checks   they are just putting a hold on the equivalent money in your account so you do n't overdraw   that is the real favor they do for you   if you stopped the check your money would be and available edit please read the comment about me losing a dime seems credible

can i deduct the money that i giving to my team mates from the taxes    that i pay if yes how should i record the transaction why why are you giving money to your team mates that 's the most important question and any answer without taking this into account is not full you would probably have to talk to a professional tax adviser a cpa ea licensed in your state about the details but in general you can not deduct money you give someone just because you feel like it moreover it may be subject to an additional tax the gift tax ps we do n't have any partnership or something similar it is just    each of us on his own assuming you want to give your team mates money because you developed the project together then you do in fact have a partnership in order to split the income properly you should get a tax id for the partnership and issue a 1065 and k-1 for each team mate in most states you do n't need to register a partnership with the state mere lets do things together creates a partnership otherwise if they work for you as opposed to with you in the case above you can treat it as your own business income and pay your team mates who are now your contractors employees accordingly be careful here because the difference between contractor and employee in tax law is significant and you may end up being on the hook for a lot of things you 're not aware of bottom line in certain situation you can not deduct in others you can you have to discuss it with a professional doing these things on your own without fully understanding what each term means is dangerous and irs does n't forgive for honest mistakes

with a $ 40,000 payment there is a 100 chance that the owner will be claiming this as a business expense on their taxes   the irs and the state will definitely know about it and the risk of interest and penalties if it is not claimed as income make the best course of action to see a tax adviser because taxes will not be taken out by the property owner the tax payer should also make sure that the estimated $ 10,000 in federal taxes if they are in the 25 tax bracket does n't trigger other tax issues that could result in penalties or the need to file quarterly taxes next year this kind of extra income could also result in a change or an elimination of a health care subsidy a unexpected mid year   change could trigger the need to refund the subsidy received this year via the tax form next april

i 'm not an attorney or a tax advisor the following is not to be considered advice just general information in the us putting your name on the deed would mean making you a co owner absent any other legal agreement between you e.g. a contract stating each of you owns 50 of the house both of you would then be considered to own 100 of the house jointly and in addition the irs would almost certainly interpret the creation of your ownership interest as a gift from your partner to you making them liable for gift tax the gift tax could be postponed by filing a gift tax return which would reduce partner 's lifetime combined gift estate tax exemption and if you sought to get rid of your ownership interest by giving it to your partner it would again be a taxable gift with the tax or loss of estate tax exemption accruing to you however it is likely that this is all moot because of the mortgage on the house any change to the deed would have to be approved by the mortgage holder and if so approved executed by a title company registered closing agent or similar depending on the laws of your state in my similar case the mortgage holder refused to add or remove any names from the deed unless i refinanced at a higher rate naturally making the new partners jointly liable for the mortgage we also had to pay an additional title fee to change the deed

there are two main ways of transferring large sums of money between banks in such a situation 1 have your bank mail a cashier 's check   they may or may not charge you for this some banks charge up to $ 6 the bank i work at does n't charge at all   you have to wait for the check to go through the mail but it usually takes just a few days 2 wire the money   this could cost $ 50 or more in combined fees usually around $ 30 to send and $ 20 to receive but you get same day credit for the funds the limits to online transfers are in place to protect you so that if someone gets into your account the amount of damage they can do is limited   if you need those limits lifted temporarily check with your bank about doing so they may be willing to adjust them for you for a brief period a day or two

there are a number of ways to get out of debt first stop spending on that card you could apply for a 0 apr credit card and if you qualify with a credit limit equal or higher than what you have now then you could transfer the balance and start on paying that down you could also work out a payment plan with chase they would rather have some of the money vs. none of it but you need to reach out sooner rather than later to avoid having it sent to collections   since your cash flow is terrible you could also pick up a second or third part time job deliver pizzas work at the mall whatever to help increase your cash flow and use that money to pay down your debts   the federal trade commission has some resources on how to cope with debt

the closest thing to a libertarian society to my mind the american revolution was relatively stable and amazingly prosperous for hundreds of years to my mind the shows that it is possible at least to some extent   the defining characteristic of a government is that the majority of people perceive their usage of aggressive force as legitimate without that sense of legitimacy no government could ever rule that is why i think that anarchy is stable coercion is just vastly more expensive than co operation without a body of people willing to pay for their own coercion organisations that seek to coerce will be at an incredible economic disadvantage   you want to be careful writing things off as impossible just because of history before the wright brothers all attempts at powered flight had failed as well we must always keep the goal in mind even if we are still unsure of how to attain it

i 'm not sure what you expect in terms of answers but it depends on personal factors it pretty well has to depend on personal factors since otherwise everyone would want to do the same thing either everyone thinks the current price is one to sell at or everyone thinks it 's one to buy at and there would be no trades you would n't be able to do what you want except on the liquidity provided by market makers once that 's hit the price is shifting quickly so your calculation will change quickly too purely in terms of maximising expected value taking into account the time value of money it 's all about the same the market should already know everything you know which means that one time to sell is as good as any other the current price is generally below the expected acquisition price because there 's a chance the deal will fall through and the stock price will plummet that 's not to say there are n't clever sure fire trading strategies around acquisitions but they 're certain to be based on more than just timing when to sell an existing holding of stock if you have information that the market does n't and assuming it is legal to do so then you trade based on that information if you know something the market does n't that 's going to be good for price hold if you know something that will reduce the price sell now and know can be used in a loose sense if you have a strong opinion against the market then you might like to invest based on that nothing beats being paid for being right finally bear in mind that expected return is not the same as utility you have your own investment goals and your own view of risk if you 're more risk averse than the market then you might prefer to sell now rather than wait for the acquisition if you 're more risk prone than the market then you might prefer a 90 chance of $ 1 to that 's fine hold the stock the extreme case of this is that you might have a fixed sum at which you will definitely sell up put everything into the most secure investments you can find and retire to the caribbean if that 's the case then you become totally risk averse the instant your holding crosses that line sell and order cocktails

us treasury securities are the safest investment you can buy short term by buying t bills   you buy t bills at a discount to face for example to buy a four week t bill the treasury will take $ out of your account in four weeks the treasury will deposit $ 100 into your account the $ 0.02 difference is your intrest on the loan compounded over a year 13 four week periods you get a interest but presumably more importantly to you you get your original $ back   your government can not nationalize money that you have on loan to the united states government   edit oops i dropped a decimal position in my original calculation of compounded rate of interest it is now corrected

there are many shariah compliant investments so that could direct your resulting searches shariah compliance is a very strict interpretation of islam and for investing offers strict guidelines in what to invest in and excludes investments in companies that engage in certain businesses such as gambling tobacco pork and trading of gold and silver on a deferred basis and more many multinational financial service companies such as the standard poors s&p offer shariah compliant funds and indices as such it makes it easier to invest in a variety of different assets through them you can also look at their fund 's constituents and invest in those assets directly secondly going back to your original question about a compound interest equivalent you can look at the products offered by shariah compliant banks now if it is really important for you to adhere to the strictest interpretations of your faith you should know that most islamic banks have interest bearing assets within them and that they disguise that fact the global financial system is based on interest bearing instruments such as bonds and islamic banks are large holders and issuers of those instruments and all of their consumer products are also based on the interest rates of them even convoluted alternatives such as islamic mortgages where they are advertised as non interest bearing equivalents many times are also the interest bearing version unfortunately these lies are enough for the banks to continue to get business from their target audiences but outside of islam this is a very standard and stable business practice the point is that you should look very carefully at the alternatives you find

yes you can make contributions to your hsa for 2013 until april 15 2014   however when you make the contribution you need to explicitly tell the financial institution that your deposit is for tax year 2013 as they will be reporting to the irs your total 2013 contributions after april 15 if you have n't filed your tax return for 2013 yet you can wait until you make your final hsa contribution for 2013 and then file before april 15   otherwise if you have already filed for 2013 and you make another hsa contribution for 2013 you 'll need to file an amended return in order to claim the additional deduction one more piece of advice do n't wait until the last day to make this contribution   make your final contribution at least a week early   each year here on the site we get some questions from people who made an hsa or ira contribution on april 15 only to be told by the bank that they missed some internal bank deadline by a few hours   there is no need to wait until the last day do n't cut it too close

this seems like a risky setup   all it takes is one missed or delayed transfer for you to overdraw your savings   there is a benefit to keeping your regular expenses and savings separate and i can see some benefits in having multiple checking accounts depending on how you organize your finances but i do n't see a benefit to having a paycheck go to one account and all regular spending and savings come from another   it requires some regular maintenance to transfer money over to use for regular spending   i suppose if you have a checking account that earns interest but requires direct deposits and a savings account that earns slightly higher interest you could squeeze out a bit but it 's probably not worth the effort these days unless you have a lot of money going in and out also it should not be easy to tap into savings but your day to day spending should be very accessible   all those factors suggest to me that your paycheck should go into your regular spending account and keep your savings separate

gaining traction is your first priority warning as explains in his answer the tax penalty for withdrawing from a 401(k can easily exceed the apr of the credit card making it a very bad strategy consult in depth with a financial advisor to see before taking that path   as @joetaxpayer has noted a loan is another alternative the 401k is no good to you if you ca n't have shelter or comfort in the mean time   the idea is to look at all the money as a single thing and balance it together   there is no credit and retirement just a single target that you can hit by moving the good money to clear the bad consolidating the credit card debt somehow would be very wise if you can   assuming it is 30 apr shrinking that quickly is the first priority you may be able to justify a hardship withdrawal to finance the reduction consolidation of the credit card   it may be worth considering negotiating a closure arrangement with a reduced principal   credit card companies can be quite open to this as it gets their money back you may also be able to negotiate a lower interest rate you may be able to negotiate a non credit affecting debt consolidation with a debt   they want to make money and a 25 k loan to a person with sound credit is a pretty good bet moving buying a house or any of that may just relocate the problem    you may be able to withdraw $ 25 k from your 401k under hardship pay the credit card and come up with a payment plan for the medical debt it 's a retirement setback for sure but retirement is an illusion with that credit card shark eating all of your hard earned money   you got ta that beast quick again be sure to fully analyze whether the penalty on the 401(k withdrawal exceeds the apr of the credit card

the average person does n't care nor are they affected by how much their employer spends in healthcare it may be true that the average person does n't care how much their employer spends on healthcare but it 's not true that we are n't affected   from an employer 's perspective healthcare wages and all other benefits are part of the cost of having an employee   when healthcare goes up it increases the total employee cost    employers can handle this in several ways   they could reduce the amount they give investors as dividends stock buybacks etc   but then the stock is worth less and they have to make up the money somewhere else   they could pass the expense on to customers   but then the loss in business can easily cost more than the revenue raised   they can cut wages or other benefits   then the average person will start caring and might get a different job    i found this article saying that 12 m households spend > = 50 of income on rent so i 'm assuming that an even greater number spend more than the recommended 30 which means rent should be weighted as high as it is in cpi according to the census that 's only about 10 of households   it also notes that of households are owner occupied   they do n't pay rent   the cpi makes up a number called owner 's equivalent rent for those households to get to the higher percentage    the cpi is intended for things like wages   this makes it a good choice for a cost of living adjustment but it does n't quite represent the overall economy   and for investments it 's the broader economy that matters   household consumption is less important    what the fed says

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

i think you 're missing a couple of things first why do you think its a reverse mortgage more likely than not its a regular mortgage home equity loan if so if they expect the stock market to rise significantly more than the amount of interest they pay on the loan then its a totally sensible course of action second the purchase in cash only to take out a loan later can definitely be a sensible way to do things for example if the seller wants to close fast or if there are competing offers where not having a contingency is the tipping point another reason might be purchasing in an entity name for example holding the title as an llc and in this case it is easier to get a loan if you already have the house since the banks see the owner 's actual commitment and not just promises

this was a good move by amazon   if you do n't already get your groceries delivered you should really give it a shot   it 's often free delivery a few times for new signups   your produce meat everything is picked from the very best   it 's delivered in a fridge freezer truck to your home   i just have them hand bags off to me quick and done in a few minutes   the amount of money i 've saved from using grocery delivery is amazing   i 'm a single guy i do n't shop all to well myself when i 'm actually in a store   i grab expensive chips and stuff i did n't plan on buying    this way i plan out meals google recipes for what 's on sale and do n't even need to leave the house the entire time   amazon 's trying to do exactly this   that 's great but it 's so cheap and awesome right now you should really give it a shot to see what all the fuss is about   edit talking about king safeway etc i 've tried all who offer it service and experience is great across them all so far

as it stands equity contracts in startups are by default structured differently the standard equity is shares or convertible notes   having equity that 's structured in the way you propose is a bad idea for both sides vc do n't like equity that 's not done with standard equity contracts if the lawyer of the vc has to review your equity document and understand how the exact terms work that makes it more complicated to invest money into the startup on your end it might not be fair because a company does n't need to make any income to be successful various companies manage to reduce their tax burden to next to nothing by clever accounting that results in having no taxable income uber brought the domain name with 2 equity at the beginning so there are certainly deals that get made with equity there are also other kinds of deals where domain names do n't get sold for a one time payment but with regular payment for 8 years where the domain names goes back to the seller if the company folds or otherwise does n't want to pay anyone

unless your investments are held within a special tax free account then every sale transaction is a taxable event meaning a gain or loss capital gain loss or income gain loss depending on various circumstances is calculated at that moment in time gains may also accrue on unrealized amounts at year end for specific items in general in the us gains do not accrue at year end for most things moving cash that you have received from selling investments from your brokerage account to your checking account has no impact from a tax perspective

most articles on investing recommend that investors that are just starting out to invest in index stock or bonds funds   this is the easiest way to get rolling and limit risk by investing in bonds and stocks and not either one of the asset classes alone    when you start to look deeper into investing there are so many options small cap large cap technical analysis fundamental analysis option strategies and on and on   this can end up being a full time job or chewing into a lot of personal time   it is a great challenge to learn various investment strategies frankly for the average person that works full time it is a huge effort   i would recommend also reading the intelligent asset allocator to get a wider perspective on how asset allocation can help grow a portfolio and reduce risk   this book covers a simple process

the statement finance is something all adults need to deal with but almost nobody learns in school hurts me however i have to disagree as a finance student i feel like everyone around me is sound in finance and competition in the finance market is so stiff that i have a hard time even finding a paid internship right now i think its all about perspective from your circumstances but back to the question personally i feel that there is no one size fits all financial planning rules it is very subjective and is absolutely up to an individual regarding his financial goals   the number 1 rule i have of my own is do not ever spend what i do not have your reflected point is always pay off your credit card at the end of each month to which i ask why not spend out of your savings plan your grocery monies necessary monthly expenditures before spending on your wants should you have any leftovers that way you would not even have to pay credit every month because you do n't owe any secondly when you can get the above in check then you start thinking about saving for the rainy days i.e. emergency fund this is absolutely according to each individual 's circumstance and could be regarded as say 6 months monthly income start saving a portion of your monthly income until you have set up a strong emergency fund you think you will require after you have done than and only after should you start thinking about investments personally health > wealth any time you ask i always advise my friends family to secure a minimum health insurance before into investments for returns you can choose not to and start investing straight away but should any adverse health conditions hit you all your returns would be wiped out into paying for treatments unless you are earning disgusting amounts in investment returns this risk increases when you are handling the bills of your family when you stick your money into an index etf the most powerful tool as a retail investor would be dollar cost averaging and i strongly recommend you read up on it also because i am not from the western part of the world i do not have the cultural mindset that i have to move out and get into a world of debt to live on my own when i reached 18 i have to say i could not be more glad that the culture does not exist in asian countries i find that there is absolutely nothing wrong with living with your parents and i still am at age 24 the pressure that culture puts on teenagers is uncalled for and there are no obvious benefits to it only mortgage rent payments arise from it with the entry level pay that a normal 18 year old could get

i do not meet your qualifications but this is what i would do 1   save an amount that can replace your bike and accessories if it is stolen   do n't touch it for anything but that 2   compute an average monthly cost for maintenance items double that for a couple of months until you have the account built up then budget that amount every month if your bike front tire get stolen or broken beyond repair take it out of the first account   then your savings priority should be to rebuild that account   i would be a bit alarmed if you have to keep hitting this account for legitimate reasons when a tire goes flat or other normal wear and tear item occurs take it out of the second account   this account should fluctuate regularly and it is normal   during certain months you may want to increase this amount more glass on the street because of outdoor events means more flat tires the same kind of thing holds true for a car putting numbers to some figures would help i think the most alarming thing about your post is that a theft is somewhat ordinary   yikes

wire transfers are the best method   costs can vary from $ 10 to $ 100 or more depending on the banks and countries involved   there 's rarely any saving using the same bank although hsbc may have reduced charges if you have premier accounts in both countries for a one off transaction it may not be worth the effort to open an account however that cost is insignificant compared to your possible losses on the currency exchange   assuming your money is currently in hong kong dollars hkd it will need to be converted to us dollars usd one place where it could be converted is at your hong kong bank   you 'll get their retail rate make sure you are aware of the rate they will use and any fees in advance   expect to pay around 2 3 from the mid market rate the rate you see quoted online which does n't fluctuate much for hkd usd as the currencies are linked another place where the currency could be converted is at your us bank   you really do n't get any control over that if it arrives as hkd and is then automatically converted into your usd   the rate and fees could be quite poor especially if it is a minor us bank that has to deal with anther bank for foreign currency for amounts of this size it 's worthwhile using a specialist currency conversion company instead   currency fair in ireland is one   it 's a peer to peer exchange that is generally the best deal at least for the currency pairs i use   you wire the money to them do the exchange on their site at a rate that is much closer to 0.5 from the then the money is transferred out by wire for a few dollars   adds a few days to the process but will possibly save you close to us$ 1000   another established option is currency online in new zealand there are probably also specialist currency exchange companies in hong kong the basic rule is do n't let the banks exchange currencies at rates that suit them use a third party that offers a better rate and lower fees

obviously the best way to consolidate the real estate loans is with a real estate loan mortgages being secured loans provide much better interest rates also interest can be deducted to some extent depending on how the proceeds are used but up to $ 100 k of the mortgage can have deductible interest just for using the primary residence as a collateral last but not least in many states mortgages on primary residence are non recourse again may depend on the money use that may prove useful if in the future your mother runs into troubles repaying it so yes your instincts are correct how to convince your mother that 's between you and her

the common opinion is an oversimplification at best the problem with buying a house using cash is that it may leave you cash poor forcing you to take out a home equity loan at some point which may be at a higher rate than the mortgage would have been on the other hand knowing that you have no obligation to a lender is quite nice and many folks prefer eliminating that source of stress if you can get a mortgage at a sufficiently low rate using it to leverage an investment is not a bad strategy average historical return on the stock market is around 8 so any mortgage rate lower than that is a relatively good bet and a rate much lower as now is that much better a bet there is of course some risk involved and the obligation to make mortgage payments and your actual return is reduced by what you 're paying on the mortage but it 's still a pretty good deal as far as investment vehicles the same answers apply as always you want a rate of return higher than what you 're paying on the mortgage preferably market rate of return or better cds wo n't do it as you 've found you 're going to have to increase the risk to increase the return that does mean picking and maintaining a diversified balance of investments and investment types working with index funds makes diversifying within a type easy but you 're probably going to want both stocks and bonds rebalancing between them when they drift too far from your desired mix   my own investments are a specific mix with one each of bond fund large cap fund small cap fund reit and international fund bonds are the biggest part of that since they 're lowest risk but the others play a greater part in producing returns on the investments the exact mix that would be optimal for you depends on your risk tolerance i 'm classified as a moderately aggressive investor the time horizon you 're looking at before you may be forced to pull money back out of the investments and some matters of personal taste i 've been averaging about 10 but i had the luxury of being able to ride out the depression and indeed invest during it against that my mortgage is under 4 interest rate and is for less than 80 of the purchase price so i did n't need to pay the surcharge for mortgage insurance in fact i borrowed only half the cost of the house and paid the rest in cash specifically because leveraging does involve some risk and this was the level of risk i was comfortable with i also set the duration of the loan so it will be paid off at about the same time i expect to retire again that 's very much a personal judgement if you need specific advice it 's worth finding a financial counselor and having them help you run the numbers do not go with someone associated with an investment house they 're going to be biased toward whatever produces the most income for them select someone who is strictly an advisor they may cost you a bit more but they 're more likely to give you useful advice do n't take my word for any of this i know enough to know how little i know but hopefully i 've given you some insight into what the issues are and what questions you need to ask and answer before making your decisions

all of the provided advice is great but a slightly different viewpoint on debt is worth mentioning here are the areas that you should concentrate your efforts and the rough order you should proceed much of the following is predicated upon your having a situation where you need to get out of debt and learn to better budget and control your spending you may already have accomplished some of these steps or you may prioritize differently many people advise prioritizing contributing to a 401(k savings plan but with the assumption that you need advise because you have debt trouble you are probably paying absurd interest rates and any savings you might have will be earning much lower rates than you are paying on consumer debt if you are already contributing continue the plan but remember you are looking for advice because your financial situation is in trouble so you need to put out the fire your present problem and learn how to manage your money and plan for the future compose a budget comprised of the following three areas the exact percentages are fungible fit them to your circumstances here is where planning can get fun when you have freed yourself from debt and you can make choices that with your individual goals once you have put out the fire of debt then you should do two things at the same time as you pay off debt and avoid further debt you will find that saving for both independence and retirement become easier   the average american household may have $ 8000 + credit card debt and at 20 30 the interest payments are $ 150 200/month and the average car payment is nearly $ 500/month   eliminate debt and you will have $ 500 800/month that you can comfortably allocate towards retirement but you also need to learn educate yourself how to invest your money to grow your money and earn income from your savings this is an area where many struggle because we are taught to save but we are not taught how to invest choose investments wisely and carefully and how to decide our goals   investing needs to be addressed separately but you need to learn how live in an affordable house and pay off your mortgage   consider that the payment on a mortgage on even a modest $ 200 k house is over $ 1000/month combine saving the money you would have paid towards a mortgage payment with the money you would have paid towards credit card debt or a car loan saving becomes easy when you are freed from these large debts

no but it is certainly a possibility the efficient market hypothesis would say that this means that the market perceives the present value of all future earning as negative these earnings might take the form of a of assets at some point companies carry a goodwill asset that is generally imaginary   they book that asset when they buy companies for more than they are worth it would be as if was a stock tracking my life   if i bought my house in 2006 for $ 1 million cash i might have a book value of $ 1 million   however might trade at $ 500k because the market knows that my asset is n't really worth $ 1 million and at some point my earnings will take a hit to reflect that it might also mean that future real earnings ie actual profit and loss on sales are going to be negative this would mean bankruptcy is more likely

i guess i was n't clear i want to modestly leverage 3 4x my portfolio using options i believe long deep in the money calls would be the best way to do this let me know if not   it 's important to me that the covariance matrix from the equity portfolio scales up but does n't fundamentally change i it to systemic change as opposed to idiosyncratic change    this is what i was thinking   for the same expiry date find each positions lowest lambda match all option to the the highest of the lowest lambda adjust number of contracts to compensate for higher leverage   i do n't think this will work because if i matched the lowest lambda of options on bond etfs to my equity options they would be out of the money   by the way thanks for your time

ignore sunk costs and look to future returns   although it feels like a loss to exit an investment from a loss position from a financial standpoint you should ignore the purchase price   if your money could be better invested somewhere else then move it there you should n't look at it as though you 'll be more financially secure because you waited longer for the stock to reach the purchase price   that 's psychological not financial some portion of your invested wealth is stuck in this particular stock   if it would take three months for the stock to get back to purchase price but only two months for an alternate investment to reach that same level then obviously faster growth is better   your goal is greater wealth not arbitrarily returning certain investments to their purchase price investments are just instrumental   you want more wealth   if an investment is not performing then ignore purchase price and costs   look at the reasonable expectations about an investment going forward

there is no rule of thumb although some may suggest there is everybody will have different goals investment preferences and risk tolerances you need to figure this out by yourself by either education yourself in the type of investments you are interested in or by engaging and paying for a financial advisor you should not be taking advice from others unless it is specifically geared for your goals investment dna and risk tolerance the only advice i would give you is to have a plan whether you develop it yourself or pay a financial advisor to develop one also do n't have all your savings sitting in cash as long term you will fall behind the eight ball in real returns allowing for inflation

the government pays interest on its debts just like anyone else but since it 's already the government and already taking advantage of credit your money loaned to it through the bonds it does n't need the extra benefit of taxing the interest it pays it 's better off just issuing bonds at a lower interest rate and letting you keep all the interest instead of a higher interest rate which will have some amount taxed and returned to it anyway the government wants a cut of private loan interest just like any other income which is why interest on private bonds loans is taxable   edit what about municipal bonds would n't the federal government benefit from taxing interest on municipal bonds    municipal bonds are issued to support public infrastructure amp services such as construction of water supply infrastructure since the goal is to improve facilities for the public benefit and government programs ostensibly aim to provide public benefits as well it allows the full proceeds of the bonds to go to the designated projects at the lowest possible interest rate and the public pays the interest through city rates taxing municipal bonds would result in a higher cost to the public for the same end result because of higher interest rates with the net interest going to the federal amp state governments via income tax on the interest

saying that sales go online does n't mean that a typical jc penny shopper just goes to their site   these people are going to google shopping engines and amazon    upping your online sales is n't that simple   if the majority of shoppers are searching google and your listings do n't show up then that potential customer is going else where    you could pay for ppc ads but return on investment on ppc can suck depending on your market and for products that have a long life cycle return happy customers could be years before they return   even worse if jc penny and sears did want to compete online their prices are n't really all that great either so even if you landed on their site chances are you can find it cheaper else where and their overhead from stores and employees makes it hard to cut prices to compete

it sounds cold but the law has to hold people to their agreements there are exceptions for unconscionable terms but i do n't think this gets close to that level this is certainly but not quite shocking to the conscience maybe there 's an argument to be made regarding whether a reasonably prudent person in the party 's position would have known what they were agreeing to under the circumstances depending upon how the provision was presented but without a lot more information we ca n't say whether that angle has a snowball 's chance in hell   you should read the terms governing every important agreement you enter into it sounds like a huge burden but for any major undertaking you really do need to grit your teeth and through the whole thing if you do n't like what you find ask for a second look from a lawyer to confirm your suspicions or just walk away    bank service agreements loan mortgage applications major venue reservations and employment contracts especially employment contracts all deserve that much time typically the terms you might not like are address circumstances that as a practical matter do n't really concern you but you might be surprised at how often you find deal breakers like this around in the woodwork

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

on reading couple of articles some research over internet i got to know about diversified investment where one should invest 70 in equity related rest 30 in debt related funds yes that is about right although the recommendation keeps varying a bit however your first investment should not aim for diversification putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues my suggestion would be to start with an index eft or large cap then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc   on this site we do n't advise on specific funds you can refer to or or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly ps rather than buying paper buy it electronic better you can now buy it as demat if you already have an demat account it would be best to buy through it

in orange county southern california one agent has pretty extensively about using rental parity to determine when it is time to rent or buy rental parity is achieved when the cost of renting is equal to the cost of owning in theory if you buy when a home is selling above rental parity you 're overpaying and you 'd be better off renting he has many posts on the subject a few you might care to read would be this one and this other one you might get a better sense of how to calculate rental parity by looking at an example or two there is also the ny times calculator mentioned in other responses and the calculator be aware the calculators are garbage in garbage out in other words you have to consider the input carefully in particular i found the defaults on the calculator were not realistic so far as i am aware the agent at does not make his calculations public though i have never actually asked he 's using a spreadsheet which i have never seen that is another option if you care to do this kind of analysis yourself search around you can find a spreadsheet that someone has posted here and there but keeping something like that updated is not trivial in my experience in practice it 's difficult to be totally rational and mathematical when it comes to many decisions and as other respondents have noted where you live is one of those decisions too saying buy when rental parity is achieved is sort of like saying buy low sell high as though it were perfectly clear when stocks are at a bottom and/or a peak in our case we bought a house about 12 years ago before rental parity was being discussed in the looking back we supposedly bought at the wrong time according to that agent 's rating system but it turned out fine for us our house has appreciated whereas the s&p 500 is basically where it was 12 years ago had we been thinking in terms of rental parity we might not have bought at that time of course your mileage may vary and hindsight is always 20/20 i think the most helpful advice i can offer was something i got from a real estate agent around the time we were looking he told me when you 're looking at houses be sure you like the floor plan and the location because those two things are not easily changed that advice really helped us to see things more clearly

because interest is tax deductible i do n't know much about the chevron deal but i 'm an em debt analyst and typically the issue you have is that dividends are taxed but interest is not so to move money from a subsidiary instead of putting in equity and getting dividends tax inefficient instead you give debt and get interest back you get a little less flexibility on payment but you more than make up for that on average with tax efficiency    do n't think of it as a loan at all think of it as a pseudo equity investment with required dividends   revenue is not taxed profit is interest comes out of profit dividends however are issued after profit   this could all be wrong vis a vis chevron this is just how most of the companies i look at work

sounds like your grandmother 's estate had taxable income and the estate did not pay the estate income tax   rather the estate shifted the burden to pay that tax on the beneficiaries which is why you received a k1   if that k1 reports income received by you then yes you would have to amend your tax return   i am in exactly that same situation now   after the october 15 deadline to file 2012 tax returns i received a k1 for income received from my dad 's estate   i now have to file a late amended 2012 income tax return and pay income tax on what i inherited my dad had a small estate but the money that made up that small estate all came from an ira he had   he designated the estate as his beneficiary   so when the stocks in the ira were sold that all became taxable income to the beneficiaries of the estate anything involving taxes is confusing at best   but do not confuse estate income tax with estate tax they are two different taxes hope this helps

while derivative pricing models are better modeling reality as academia invests more into the subject none sufficiently do if for example one assumes that stock returns are for the purposes of pricing options like black scholes does the only true dependent variable becomes log standard deviation otherwise known as volatility producing the infamous volatility smile which disappears in the cases of models with more factors accounting for other mathematical moments such as mean skew and etc   still these more advanced models are flawed and suffer the same extreme time mispricing as black scholes   in other words one can model anything however one wants but the worse the model the stranger the results since volatility for a given expiration should be constant across all strikes and is with better models in the case of pricing dividends these can be adjusted for the many complexities of taxation but the model becomes ever more complex and extremely expensive for each eventuality   furthermore with more complexity in any model the likelihood of discovering a closed form in the short run is less for equities in a low interest rate not high dividend yield not low volatility low dividend tax environment the standard swap pricing models will not provide results much different from one where a single low tax rate on dividends is assumed if one is pricing a swap on equity outside of the bounds above the dividend tax rate could have more of an effect but for computational efficiency applying a single assumed dividend tax rate would be optimal with instead of d in a formula where d is the dividend paid and x is the tax rate in short a closed form model is only as good as its assumptions so if anomalies appear between the actual prices of swaps in the market and a swap model then that model is less correct than the one with smaller anomalies of the same type   in other words if pricing equity swaps without a dividend tax rate factored more closely matches the actual prices than pricing with dividend taxes factored then it could be assumed that pricing without a dividend tax factored is superior   this all depends upon the data and there does n't seem to be much in academia to assist with a conclusion if equity swaps do truly provide a tax advantage and both parties to a swap transaction are aware of this fact then it seems unlikely swap sellers would n't demand some of the tax advantage back in the form of a higher price   a model is no defense since volatility curves persist despite what black scholes says they should be

gt;now if we convert the average income in 1965 into today 's dollars we get an average salary of $ pretty low right well today in the year 2012 the average income is somewhere around $ which means that over almost half century the average income grew by a mere 35 or only $ 11,000   in some ways it 's actually a lot worse than that   the numbers you cite are gross average income   first of all the average part is a problem since outliers greatly affect it one ought to be looking at median income   and second the fact that it is gross income before taxes rather that net income after taxes this is really critical when you look not at income taxes but rather payroll taxes and the rate changes over the years while in 1965 the payroll tax was all of total it was essentially doubled to 7.65 by 1990 and actually 15.3 if you include the employer contribution   and of course many other taxes have increased as percentages during those same years back in 1965 sales taxes were either minimal say 1 or non existent whereas now most states tax sales at somewhere between 5 and 10   but at the same time it is actually a lot better than the raw numbers make it seem   that many goods especially electronics related have continued to become cheaper even in nominal unadjusted dollars and in conjunction with that lower price much more widely available    in part that was due to continued productivity increases in farming and manufacturing and lower in real inflation adjusted terms cost of energy plus of course integrated and computers dramatically improved efficiency of operations in everything from the of cad to the mundane aspects of tracking amp controlling inventories so all hail to farmers to oil and to moore 's law else you probably would n't be able to afford a color tv much less a computer video game dvd player and many of the rest of the relatively affordable amenities including non electronic things that have been made cheaper and more widely available due to the use of computers in business amp industry that make life today more enjoyable than it was circa 1965

the net return reported to you as a percentage by a mutual fund is the gross return minus the expense ratio   so if the gross return is x% and the expense ratio is y% your account will show a return of x   be aware that x could be negative too so with y = 1 if x = 10 as you might get from a stock fund if you believe historical averages will continue then the net return is 9 and you have lost y x times 100 = 10 of the gross return if x = 8 as you might get from a bond fund if you believe historical averages will continue then the net return is 7 and you have lost y x times 100 = 12.5 of the gross return and so on and so forth   the numbers used are merely examples of the returns that have been obtained historically though it is worth emphasizing that 10 is an average return averaged over many decades from investments in stocks and to believe that one will get a 10 return year after year is to mislead oneself very badly i think the point of the is that expense ratios are important and should matter a lot to you but that their impact is proportionately somewhat less if the gross return   is high but very significant if the gross return is low as   in money market funds   in fact some money market funds which   found that x < y have even foregone charging the expense ratio   fee so as to maintain a fixed $ 1 per share price   personally   i would need a lot of to invest in even a stock fund with 1 expense ratio

these rates are so low because the cost of money is so low specifically two rates are near zero   the federal reserve discount rate which is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional federal reserve bank 's lending facility the discount window the effective federal funds rate which is the rate banks pay when they trade balances with each other through the federal reserve banks want to profit on the loans they make like mortgage loans to do so they try to maximize the difference between the rates they charge on mortgages and other loans revenue and the rates they pay savings account holders the federal reserve or other banks to obtain funds expenses this means that the rates they offer to pay are as close to these rates as possible as the charts shows both rates have been cut significantly since the start of the recession either through open market operations the federal funds rate or directly the discount rate the discount rate is set directly by the regional federal reserve banks every 14 days    in most cases the federal funds rate is lower than the discount rate in order to encourage banks to lend money to each other instead of borrowing it from the fed in the past however there have been rare instances where the federal funds rate has exceeded the discount rate and it 's been cheaper for banks to borrow money directly from the fed than from each other

your question reminds me of a will rogers quote buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up then sell it if it do nâ€™t go up do nâ€™t buy it there 's no way to prevent yourself from buying a stock that goes down   in fact all stocks go down at some times   the way to protect your long term investment is to diversify which increases the chances that you have more stocks that go up than go down   so many advisors will encourage index funds which have a low cost which eats away at returns and low rick because of diversification   if you want to experiment with your criteria that 's great and i wish you luck but   note that historically very few managed funds meaning funds that actively buy and sell stocks based on some set of criteria outperform the market over long periods   so do n't be afraid of some of your stocks losing if you diversify enough then statistically you should have more winners than losers it 's like playing blackjack   the goal is not to win every hand the goal is to have more winning hands than losing hands

in the short term what does it matter if she has poor credit   just let it ride and focus on the important things in the long term the most important part is completing the divorce   that is separating all parts of her financial life from her ex husband   this might mean she takes possession of the house and has him off the loan or she gets off the loan and this may mean forcing a sale if there are children or alimony involved she needs to build her income to the point that paying child support or alimony does not impact her budget   if she is on the receiving end then she should budget so those items are bonus money and not counted on she is flat broke and does not need to worry about borrowing money at this juncture   in this case a low credit score is a blessing

here 's a different take   look through the lists of companies   that offer shareholder perks here 's one from hargreaves lansdown   see if you can find one that you already spend money with with a low required shareholding where the perks would actually be usable   note that in your case being curious about the whole thing and based in london you do n't have to rule out the agm based perks unlike me my reason for this is simple with 3 out of 4 of the companies we bought shares in directly all for the perks we 've made several times the dividend in savings on money we would have spent anyway either with the company in which we bought shares or a direct competitor   this means that you can actually make back the purchase price plus dealing fee quite quickly probably in in our case and you still have the shares we 've found that pub restaurant hotel brands work well if you use them or their equivalents anyway caveats it 's more enjoyable than holding a handful of shares in a company you do n't care about and if you want to read the annual reports you can relate this to your own experience which might interest you given your obvious curiosity

i can only share with you my happened with my wife and i. first and foremost if you think you need to protect your assets for some reason then do so be open and honest about it if we get a divorce x stays with me and y stays with you   this seems silly even when your doing it but it 's important you can speak with a lawyer about this stuff as you need to but get it in writing now i know this seems like planning for failure but if you feel that foo is important to you and you want to retain ownership of foo no mater what then you have to do this step it also works both ways you can use with some limitations this to insulate your new family unit from your personal risks for example my business is mine if we break up it stays mine the income is shared but the business is mine this creates a barrier that if someone from 10 years ago sues my business then my wife is protected from that keep in mind different countries different rules next and this is my advise give up on his and hers everything it 's just ours together you make 5400 â‚¬ decide how to spend 5400 â‚¬ together pick your goals together the pot is end of line it does n't matter how much from one person or how much from another unless your talking about mitigating losses from sick days or injuries or leave etc all that matters is that you make start your budgeting there   next setup an equal allowance that is money set aside for non sense reasons i like to buy video games my wife likes to buy books this is not for vacation or stuff together but just little tiny stuff you can do for your self without asking   permission the number should be small and equal maybe   finally setup a budget house stuff 200 â‚¬ car stuff etc etc then it does n't matter who bought the house stuff you only have to coordinate so that you do n't both buy house stuff after some time took us around 6 months you will find out how this works and you can add on some rules for example i do n't go to best buy alone i will spend too much on house stuff my wife does n't like to make the budget so i handle that then we go over it things like that

would the net effect really be worse though   if everyone stopped paying back loans and banks stopped lending people would have to live within their means   prices would fall and nobody would be in debt slavery for the rest of their lives   as for allocating capital to new businesses there would still be the option of a kickstarter like model plus both private and public equity and the rules could be changed so there could be more than 500 investors without being forced public   a lot of options currently on the table would disappear sure but on balance would it actually be worse   as both government and wall street say it 's bad that seems to automatically suggest the opposite   there has been a push to make it a crime to walk away from a mortgage even though banks get the house back   the fact that they desperately tried to paint it as morally wrong to walk away from a mortgage is a big red flag   in any case this is all going to be in the near future because of automation   there wo n't be a need to borrow when your material needs are automatically met and there wo n't be much of a point to promising your labor when machines are doing the jobs already   the transition to a post scarcity economy over the next 20 years is going to be interesting

the worth of a share of stocks may be defined as the present cash value of all future dividends and liquidations associated   without a crystal ball such worth may generally only be determined but even though it 's generally not possible to know the precise worth of a stock in time for such information to be useful it has a level of worth which is absolute and not unlikely market price is generally unaffected by people buying and selling the stock except insofar as activities in company stock affect a company 's ability to do business if a particular share of stock is worth $ 10 by the above measure but joe sells it to larry for $ 8 that means joe gives larry $ 2   if larry sells it to fred $ 12 fred gives larry $ 2   the only way fred can come out ahead is if he finds someone else to give him $ 2 or more   if fred can sell it to adam for $ 13 then adam will give fred $ 3 leaving fred $ 1 better off than he would be if he had n't bought the stock but adam will be $ 3 worse off the key point is that if you sell something for less than it 's worth or buy something for more that it 's worth you give money away   you might be able to convince other people to give you money in the same way you gave someone else money but fundamentally the money has been given away and it 's not coming back

it might seem like the pe ratio is very useful but it 's actually pretty useless as a measure used to make buy or sell decisions and taken largely on its own pretty useless becomes utterly and completely useless stocks trade at prices based on future expectations and speculation so that means if traders expect a company to double its profits next year the share price could easily double there are reasons it might not increase so much and there are reasons it could increase even more than that but that 's not the point the price is now double but the earnings is still the same so the pe ratio is double and this doubling is based on something some traders know or think they know but other traders might not know or not believe once you understand that what use is a pe ratio really the pe ratio of a company might be low because it is in a death spiral with many traders believing it will report lower and lower profits in years to come and the lower the pe ratio of a given company gets probably relatively the more likely it is to go bust if you buy a stock with a low pe ratio you must do so because you feel you understand the company understand why the market is viewing it negatively believe that the negativity is wrong or over done and believe that it will turn around equally a pe ratio might be high but be an excellent buy still because it has excellent growth prospects and potential even beyond what is priced in already lets face it someone has been buying at the price that 's put that pe ratio where is is right they might be wrong of course or not or they might be justified now but circumstances might change before earnings ever reach the current priced in expectation you 'll know next year probably to answer your actual question first you should now understand there is no such thing as a stock that is on sale just stocks that are priced broadly according to the markets consensus on its value in years to come the closest thing being a stock that is over sold but one man 's over sold is another man 's train crash remember so what to actually look for the only way to on average make good buy and sell decisions is to know about investing and trading buy some books i have 12 understand the businesses you propose to invest in and understand their which may also mean understanding national and international economics somewhat

now to buy in full and essentially have zero savings buy in part Â£ 10000 deposit followed by a loan of Â£ 4000 or hp more of the value so you are assessing if the car is worth having with either none or only 4,000 in savings this is the most critical information you have provided    my outright opinion is to always buy a mildly used car as i hate the idea of loans and interest with the amount of money that you currently possess i believe the buy in part option is best as it reduces your interest liability but i do n't believe you should do it currently 4,000 is a rather small cash fund for if something were to go boom in the night    as for your question of interest this is completely dependent on the amount you are able to pay per period and the total interest you are willing to spend rows four and seven respectively this is your money and no one can tell you what 's best to do with it than yourself keep looking for good leasing deals or if you think you can survive financial strife with 4,000 then follow your heart depreciation fluctuates to the buyer so never assume what the car may lose in the next 2 3 years hope it all goes well my friend

that 's not what he 's saying at all   basically most of his argument 4 of 6 points is the connection between bond prices and equity prices it 's not particularly interesting but it definitely does n't always apply either if bond yields fall then so too should equity earnings yields if spreads remain relatively constant i.e. higher equity prices additionally if bond yields are low then any future equity growth gets capitalized at a much higher value because discount rates are much lower again not particularly insightful   the two interesting comments were about oil and cash as a of assets at financial institutions both of these are likely linked to falling or low rates above because banks ca n't invest profitably at low rates and hence hold cash and equivalents instead and oil prices are more likely to fall in a low or falling inflation environment implied by the low rates or fed tightening   really i think he s 's saying something more obvious but not necessarily trivial which is if one asset class goes up so too is another related one

do you guys know any options that are accessible to any global citizen prepaid and stored value cards are anonymous for an arbitrary reason the really anonymous ones only allow you to load $ 500 but there is no regulation that dictates this amount in the usa these cards are exempt from being declared at border not because they look like credit cards but because they are exempt by the us treasury and customs the cons is that there are generally fees to use them us doj has done research showing that some groups take advantage of the exemption moving upwards of $ 50,000 a day between borders but congress is fine with this exemption and the burden is always on the government to determine illicit origin how money is moved is only a 30 year old phenomenon but many free nations do not really have capital controls they only care that you pay taxes and that the integrity of their stock markets are upheld aside from that there are no qualms about anonymity except from your neighbors but they do nt matter for a global citizen in theory the uk should have more flexibility in anonymity options such as stored value cards with higher limits

there is no ideal number of stocks you should own there are several factors you should consider though first how actively do you want to manage your portfolio if you want to be very active then the number of stocks you own should be based on the amount of time you have to research the company by reading sec filings and listening to conference calls so you are not surprised when the company reports every quarter if you do n't want to be very active then you are better off buying solid companies that have a good reputation and good history of performance   second you should decide how much risk you are willing to take if you have $ 10,000 that you can afford to lose then you can put your money into more risky stocks or into fewer stocks which could potentially have a higher return if you want your $ 10,000 grow or lose with the market better off again going with the good rep and history stocks or a variety of stocks   third this goes along with your risk to some extent but you should consider if you are looking for short term or long term gains if you are looking to put your money in the market for the short term you will probably be looking at fewer stocks with more money in each if you are looking for long term you will be around 5 stocks that you swap as they reach goals you set out for each stock   in my opinion and i am not a financial expert i like to stay at around 5 companies mostly for the fact that it is about the ideal number of companies to keep track of

a lot of these schemes fail to take into account the time effort you have to spend in order to extract the small amount of profit you would get   if there were easy money to be made people would start making it and the company that was allowing themselves to be would put an end to that deal   so these things usually do n't last you used to be able to order dollar coins from the mint via credit card with no shipping   this was risk free and allowed you to earn credit card points   but the mint has effectively plugged this hole

a proper commercial bank will charge lower fees for currency exchange than most other banks and banks will charge less than places that just do currency exchange actually i 've usually found that the best way to get currency is to use the atm credit card networks and withdraw money from my own bank

there some specific circumstances when you would have a long term gain option 1   if you meet all of these conditions then you 've got a long term gain on the stock   the premium on the option gets rolled into the capital gain on the stock and is not taxed separately   from the irs if a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss the gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock option 2 if you did n't hold the underlying and the exercise of the call that you wrote resulted in a short position you might also be able to get to a long term gain by buying the underlying while keeping your short position open and then crossing them to close both positions after one year in other words do n't buy to cover just buy so that your account shows both a long and a short position in the same security   your broker probably allows this but if not you could buy in a different account than the one with the short position   that would get you to this rule as a general rule you determine whether you have short term or long term capital gain or loss on a short sale by the amount of time you actually hold the property eventually delivered to the lender to close the short sale option 1 is probably reasonably common   option 2 i would guess is uncommon and likely not worthwhile i do not think that the wash sale rules can help string along options from expiration to expiration though   option 1 has some elements of what you wrote in i find that paragraph a bit confusing but the wash sale does not help you out

it 's a serious problem for traditional cinema while i personally really enjoyed some recent films less critically like ghost in the shell 's remake and more widely well received films like it and blade runner the industry is clearly in a slump numbers wise   with netflix amazon hulu youtube and of course it is harder to get as many people to the cinemas consistently    it 's a bit sad at the surface it would seem that if a series of really quality however imperfect fall blockbuster films like it and and can not sufficiently act as a for the industry it 's not the type quality of movies that are the only problem    we 're still getting plenty of action movies superhero movies disney family movies war movies classic and but people are choosing to go less     for the foreseeable future this is the new normal   fewer people are to movie theatres and the ones that do will go less often   cinema and film companies are going to need to work within a model where a film opens to less people and will still be able to make money on the back end with digital online release   i think there will always be a niche for people who want to see a movie when it 's new on the big screen so in the long run i think the more premium cinemas like with the more premium experience with stylish contemporary theaters with comfortable seats food alcohol etc will still get people in the door   amc and will need to adapt to this model too and in some major cities already are trying amc might be having slightly more success at this so far but we 'll see   the industry will probably need to begin to operate more like a niche premium product in order to survive

the point i made is it is n't free trade it 's a race to the bottom where workers in the most developed countries are the ones that pay at the same time that they are supposed to be consuming those products   so as you follow it through its pretty obvious that in the end it falls apart and that in the meantime it 's the businesses that benefit and the workers everywhere who pay there 's nothing free about it   fair trade is better than free trade

first keep in mind that there are generally 2 ways to buy a corporation 's shares you can buy a share directly from the corporation this does not happen often it usually happens at the initial public offering the first time the company becomes public where anyone with access to the stock exchange can become a part owner plus maybe a few more times during the corporations existence in this case the corporation is offering new ownership in exchange for a price set the corporation or a broker hired by the corporation   the price used for a public offering is the highest amount that the company believes it can get this is a very complicated field and involves many different methods of evaluating what the company should be worth if the company sets the price too low then they have missed out on possible value which would be earned by the previous private shareholders they would have gotten the same share of a corporation which would now have more cash to spend because of increased money paid by new shareholders if the company sets the price too high then the share subscription might only be partially filled so there might not be enough cash to do what the company wanted you can buy a share from another shareholder this is more common when you see the company 's share price on the stock exchange it is this type of transaction buying out other current shareholders the price here is simply set based on what current owners are willing to sell at the bid price listed by an exchange is the current highest bid that a purchaser is offering for a single share the ask price is the current lowest offer that a seller is offering to sell a single share they currently own when the bid price = the ask price a share transaction happens and the most recent stock price changes

so my advice for your financial situation depends on your aims are you aiming to    completely clear your debt    clear one card to free up more monthly income      clear some debt to allow further controlled spending    clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency there are other things you may wish to do but you said to pay off some all of 2 credit card bills if you want to contact me i can plan this more precisely some seem the same but other factors can come into play as well differing rates of interest make the options clearer my first advice would be to call the card companies and see if you can get better rates first scenario some figures made up for visual credit card debts     8,000        8,000 monthly payment        100            100 apr 10              10 ignoring apr this will be 80 months to repay otherwise 140 months using my example amounts above Â£ 28,000 repaid over 11 years 8 months   your suggestion as per your suggestion originally paying off cards equally will allow smaller debt on both cards credit card debt       3,000       3,000 monthly payment        100           100 apr 10             10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with the 10 apr this would take 3 years 1 month Â£ 10,000 lump and Â£ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving Â£ and 8 years 7 months aim to clear debt completely my advice here is to use the Â£ 10,000 lump sum to pay off one credit card the remaining Â£ 2,000 can then come off the other card this will free up your outgoings was 2 x Â£ 100 by Â£ 100 but then use this Â£ 100 to pay off the card this will result in the following credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        200 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with 10 apr this would take roughly 3 years 1 month Â£ 10,000 lump and Â£ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving Â£ and 8 years 7 months    this option is the same as above but you have the options on the odd tight month to reduce payments to Â£ 100    this also will allow the 2nd card to be used interest free for an emergency purchase to be paid off without any interest charge    if rates are different pay of the one with the higher apr aim clear one card to free up more monthly income   aim clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency same as above but do nâ€™t increase to Â£ 200 leave monthly payment at Â£ 100 credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        100 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 5 years with the 10 apr this would take 88 months 7 years 4 months Â£ 10,000 lump and Â£ repaid over 7 years and 4 months saving Â£ and 4 years 4 months    this also allows for some extra spending even racking back up the debt although not advised aim clear some debt to allow further controlled spending as above apart from this will allow you to spend to get back up to full Â£ 16,000 debt note my figures are theoretical paying off Â£ 500 Â£ a month instead of the Â£ 100 would take lump sum 10,000 remaining 6,000 14 months Â£ 17,000 paid lump sum 5,000 remaining 2 x 5,500 26 months Â£ 18,000 paid lump sum 0 remaining 2 x 8,000 40 months Â£ 20,000 paid now i have finished i hope you have an idea on what you are aiming to achieve and a better idea of what to do when you receive the income stephen

house prices do not go up   land prices in countries with growing economies tend to go up   the price of the house on the land generally depreciates as it wears out houses require money they are called money pits for a reason   you have to replace hvac periodically roofs repairs rot foundation problems leaks electrical repair and all of that just reduces the rate at which the house not the land loses value to maintain value of the house proper you need to regularly rebuild parts of the house   people expect different things in kitchens bathrooms dining rooms doors bedrooms today than they do in the past and wear on flooring and fixtures accumulate over time the price of land and is going to be highly determined by the current interest rates   interest rates are currently near zero if they go up by even a few percent we can expect land prices to stop growing and start shrinking even if the economy continues to grow   so the assumption that prices go up is predicated on the last 35 years of constant rigorous economic growth mixed with interest rate decreases   this is a common illusion that people assume the recent economic past is somehow the way things are naturally   but we can not decrease interest rates further and rigorous economic growth is far from guaranteed this is because people price land based on their carrying cost the cost you have to spend out of your income to have ownership of it   and that is a function of interest rates   throw in no longer expecting land values to constantly grow and second order effects that boost land value also go away depending on the a mortgage is a hugely leveraged investment   it is akin to taking 10,000 $ borrowing 40,000 $ and buying stock   if the stock goes up you make almost 5x as much money if it goes down you lose 5x as much   and you owe a constant stream of money to service the debt on top of that if you want to be risk free work out how you 'd deal with the value of your house dropping by 50 together with losing your job getting a job paying half as much after a period of 6 months unemployment   the new job requires a 1.5 hour commute from your house   interest rates going up to 12 and your mortgage is up for renewal in 15 years they climbed gradually over the time say optionally that is a medium bad situation not a great depression scale problem but is a realistic bad luck event that could happen to you   not likely but possible can you weather it   if so the risk is within your bounds   note that going bankrupt may be a reasonable plan to such a bit of bad luck   however note that had you not purchased the house you would n't be bankrupt in that situation it is reasonably likely that house prices will after you spend ~3 of the construction cost of the house per year pay the mortgage on the grow at a rate sufficient to offset the cost of renting and generate an economically reasonable level of profit   it is not a risk free investment if someone tries to sell you a risk free investment they are almost certainly wrong

my experience with owning a home is that its like putting down roots and can be like an anchor holding you to an area   before considering whether you can financially own a home consider some of the other implications once you own it you are stuck for awhile and can not quickly move away like you can with renting   so if a better job opportunity comes up or your employer moves you to another office across town that doubles your commute time you 'll be regretting the home purchase as it will be a barrier to moving to a more convenient location    i along with my fiancÃ©e and two children are being forced to move out of my parents home asap   do not rush buying a home   take your time and find what you want   i made the mistake once of buying a home thinking i could take on some diy remodeling to correct some features i was n't fond of   life and finding extra time for diy house updates does n't come easy especially with children    speaking of children consider the school district when buying a home too   often times homes in good school districts cost more   if you do n't consider the school district now then you may be faced with a difficult decision when the kids start school    if you are confident you wo n't want to move anytime soon and can find a house you like and want to jump into home ownership there are some programs that can help first time buyers but they can require some effort on your part   fha has a first time buyer program with a 3.5 down payment   you will need to search for a lender that offers fha loans and work with them   fha covers this program by charging mortgage insurance every month that 's part of your house payment fannie mae has the program where first time home buyers can purchase a foreclosed home from their inventory for as little as 3 down and possibly get up to 3 from the seller to apply toward closing costs   private mortgage insurance pmi is required with this program too   their inventory of homes can be found on the website there is also which requires attending workshops and creating a detailed plan to prove you 're ready for homeownership   this might be a good option if they have workshops in your area and you want to talk with someone in person

sometimes what happens is that a creditor will hand over accounts to a collection agency for action and after a period of time it may be to yet another collection agency if the first one was not successful   theoretically this should not be cause to reset the date of collections on your bureau file but that very well could have happened here another instance when this happens is when someone contacts a creditor about a collection item on their report either to pay or dispute it   either way this the clock on that collection item so if a debt is old enough sometimes the best course of action is to let it go   if a debt has been in collections for 4 years let 's say and you decide to pay it off now your score is n't going to improve because you paid the collection enough to offset the effect of having it refreshed on your bureau file   besides creditors know how old the debt is so waiting 4 years to pay it is n't going to win you any favors in their eyes anyway to your question though it seems to me the most likely thing is that somehow the debt was refreshed through some action by the creditor or one of the agencies assigned to collect on it i hope this helps good luck

there are a number of ways trading stocks is easier than commodities but the main and most important reason is that over long periods stocks in general will tend to outperform inflation as you are investing money in enterprises that generally try to become more productive over time   whereas commodities in the long term tend to rise only at the pace of inflation this is kind of the definition of inflation actually   so even uninformed investors that pick stocks at random will generally do better than someone doing the same in commodities even before the higher commodities trading fees are taken into account also your orange example may be harder than you think   once the news that a drought is an issue the price of oranges will almost immediately change well before the oranges come to market   so unless you can predict the drought before anyone else can you wo n't be able to make money this way

a short sale will be pretty bad for your credit report it will for 7 years   this may ruin your opportunity to buy in the new area on the other hand you need to run the numbers the last i looked into this the bank will look at rent and discount it by 25 so the shortfall of $ 800/mo after adjustment will reduce your borrowing power if you rent it out   in general this is the idea you rent for a year and buy into the new area if you short sell after this while your credit is trashed you still have your new home and $ 50 k less debt   disclaimer there are those who question the ethics of this a willing short sale i am offering a purely business answer and making no judgment either way i owed $ 90 k on a condo where others were selling for $ 20k. i paid until it came up enough that a lump sum got me out upon sale the bank got its money in full   an article on the differences between foreclosure and short sale

you are right in saying that you can not go over limit on most credit cards however with a debit card the majority of banks will extend an overdraft to you if your account goes overdrawn less than 0 the amount of overdraft extended will depend on your credit rating and standing with the bank and may not be extended if they think that the amount is too large or that you are a credit risk the drawbacks of overdrafts are that they are very expensive usually having a fixed fee for going into overdraft and charging a high rate of interest if this overdraft has not been with the bank these costs are usually much higher

i would not assume they would pay for any benefits you will be responsible for paying entirely for health insurance and social security and medicare this move is most likely not in your best interests at a minimum i would charge double your current hourly rate and would charge for all hours worked including time and half for overtime   3 times is actually probably a better choice if you want to cover holidays which they will not pay you for vacation time etc i know when i did project bids we always priced at 2 3 times the salary we paid the employees

according to the fair credit reporting act any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to a person which it has reason to believe intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and    involving the extension of credit to or review or collection of an account of the consumer see section the usual interpretation of this that i 've heard is that a debt collection agency that owns or has been assigned a debt can make hard pulls on your credit report without your consent this link seems to support that and references the same part of the act among others according to the fair credit reporting act any business can access your credit history without your permission provided the business has a valid permissible purpose the fcra notes that one such permissible purpose is to review your credit information in connection with the collection of a debt thus if you owe money to a debt collector the debt collector has the legal right to pull and review your credit report if they have n't been assigned the debt or own it outright i believe you have a legal right to dispute it consult a lawyer if this is actually a situation you face   once use for this is if the debt collection agency has trouble locating you since your credit report normally contains current and past addresses this is one way to locate you

the issues of trading with unsettled funds are usually restricted to cash accounts   with margin i 've never personally heard of a rule that will catch you in this scenario   you wo n't be able to withdraw funds that are tied up in unsettled positions until the positions settle   you should be able to trade those funds   i 've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds but that does n't mean there is n't a broker somewhere that does brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions however since margin is basically offering you a line of credit   you should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules i 'd guess that you may have heard about restrictions that apply to cash accounts and think they may also apply to margin accounts   if that 's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally try searching for these terms you should be able to find a lot of clear resources on those terms   here 's one that 's current and provides examples on a margin account you avoid these issue because the margin essentially a loan from your broker provides a cushion additional funds that avoid the issues   it is possible that if you over extend yourself that you 'll get a margin call but that seems to be different than what you 're asking and maybe worth a new question if you want to know about that

in march the news it shaping up data giving rise new economy did a feature on data and had an interesting take on antitrust rules    as with other laws including tax the statute is woefully behind the market i think the implications of big data require the concept monopolies to be as companies can gather data across the multitude of platforms you 're ok with they are able to better understand consumers the threat is if everyone uses google maps or waze owned by google google could create a monopoly on traffic driving human habits data   an analog to this is thinking about insurance large insurance companies can rely on huge amounts of data to model out their risk reward on policies this will allow them to make better decisions and price themselves better in the market than smaller competitors without this data some governments require large insurance companies to share data with smaller ones as a form of antitrust rules   i agree that sheer size is n't an issue however i think more thought has to be put on the monopoly of data

you do n't have to wait   if you sell your shares now your gain can be considered a capital gain for income tax purposes unlike in the united states canada does not distinguish between short term vs. long term gains where you 'd pay different rates on each type of gain   whether you buy and sell a stock within minutes or buy and sell over years any gain you make on a stock can generally be considered a capital gain i said generally because there is an exception   if you are deemed by cra to be trading professionally that is if you make a living buying and selling stocks frequently then you could be considered doing day trading as a business and have your gains instead taxed as regular income but you 'd also be able to claim additional deductions   anyway as long as your primary source of income is n't from trading this is n't likely to be a problem here are some good articles on these subjects

the answer would depend on the equities held some can weather inflation better than others such as companies that have solid dividend growth and even outpace inflation some industries are also safer against inflation than others such as consumer staples and utilities since people usually have to purchase these regardless of how much $ they have in looking over the data comparing s&p 500 returns dividends and inflation the results are all over the map in the 50 's the total return was with inflation at 2.2 then in the 70 's returns were 5.8 with inflation at percent leading one to think that inflation diminished returns but then in the 80 's inflation was 5.1 yet the return on the s&p was up to either way aside from the 70 's every other decade since 1950 has outpaced inflation as long as you are including dividends hence my first paragraph s&p 500 total and inflation adjusted historical returns also the 7 average stock appreciation you mention is just that an average you are comparing a year over year number 7 inflation with an aggregated one stock performance over x number of years and that is a misrepresentation and is not being weighted for the difference in what those numbers mean finally there are thousands of things that have an effect on the stock market and stocks some are and others are not the idea that any one of them such as inflation has any sort of long term effect on prices that they can not is improbable this is where researching your stocks comes in and if done prudently who cares what the inflation rate is

they do n't actually need to they accept deposits for historical reasons and because they make money doing so but there 's nothing key to their business that requires them to do so here 's a decent summary but i 'll explain in great detail below by making loans banks create money this is what we mean when we say the monetary supply is at least if you believe sir king who used to run england 's central bank the only real checks on this are regulatory capitalization requirements and reserve requirements which impose a sort of tax on a bank 's circulating loans i 'll get into that later let 's start with why should you believe that story that loans create deposits it seems like a bizarre assertion but it actually matches how banks behave in practice if you go borrow money from a bank the loan officer will do many things she 'll want to look at your credit history she 'll want to look at your income and assets she 'll want to look at what kind of collateral or guarantees you 're providing that the loan will be repaid what she will not do is call down to the vaults and make sure that there 's enough bills stacked up for them to lend out loans are judged based on a profitability function determined by the interest rate and the loan risk if those add up to profitable the bank makes the loan so the limiting factor on the loans a bank makes are the available creditworthy borrowers not the bank 's stock of cash further the story makes sense because loans are how banks make money if a bank that was short of money suddenly stopped making loans it 'd be screwed no new loans = no way to make money to pay back depositors and also keep the lights on = no more bank and the story is believable because of the way banks make so little effort to solicit commercial deposit business oh sure they used to give you a free toaster if you opened an account but now it 's really quite challenging to find a no fee checking account that does n't impose a super high deposit limit and the interest paid on savings deposits is approaching zero if banks actually needed your deposits they 'd be making a lot more of effort to get them i mean they wo n't turn up their noses your deposited allowance is a couple basis points cheaper to the bank than borrowing from the fed but banks seem to value small potatoes depositors more as a source of fees and sales opportunities for services and consumer credit than as a source of cash it 's a bit different if you get north of seven figures but smaller depositors are n't really worth the hassle just for their cash this is where someone will mention the regulatory requirements of fractional reserve banking banks are obliged by regulators to keep enough cash on hand to pay out a certain percentage of deposits note nothing about loans was said in that statement this requirement does not serve as a check on the bank making bad loans because the bank is ultimately liable to all its depositors for the full value of their deposits it 's more making sure they have enough liquidity to prevent bank runs the self fulfilling prophecy in which an bank could be forced into bankruptcy as you noted in your question banks can always borrow from the fed at the fed discount rate or from other banks at the interbank overnight rate which is a little lower to meet this requirement they do have to pledge collateral but loans themselves are collateral so this does n't present much of a problem in terms of paying off depositors if the bank should collapse and minimizing the amount of fdic insurance payout from the government it 's really capital requirements that are actually important i.e. the bank has to have investors who do n't have a right to be paid back and whose investment is on the hook if the bank goes belly up but that 's just a safeguard for the depositors it does n't really have anything to do with loans other than that bad loans are the main reason a bank might go under banks like any other private business have assets things of value and liabilities obligations to other people but banking assets and liabilities are counterintuitive the bank 's assets are loans because they are theoretically recoverable the principal and also generate a revenue stream the interest payments the money the bank holds in deposits is actually a liability because it has to pay that money out to depositors on demand and the deposited money will never by itself bring the bank any revenue at all in fact it 's a drain because the bank needs to pay interest to its depositors well they used to anyway so what happens when a bank makes a loan from a balance sheet perspective strangely enough the answer is nothing at all if i grant you a loan the minute we shake hands and you sign the paperwork a teller types on a keyboard and money appears in your account your account with my bank my bank has simultaneously created an asset the loan you now have to repay me and an equal sized liability the funds i loaned you which are now deposited in your account i 'll make money on the deal because the interest you owe me is a much higher rate than the interest i pay on your deposits or the rate i 'd have to pay if i need to borrow cash to cover your withdrawal i might just have the cash on hand anyway from interest and origination fees and whatnot from previous loans from an accounting perspective nothing has happened to my balance sheet but suddenly you owe me closing costs and a stream of extraneous interest payments nice work if you can get it okay so i 've demonstrated that i do n't need to take deposits to make loans but we live in a world where banks do here 's a few reasons you can probably think of more but at the end of the day a bank should be designed so that if every single non borrowing depositor withdrew their deposits the bank would n't collapse or cease to exist

listing on nyse has more associated overhead costs than listing on nasdaq   in the case of young technology companies this makes nasdaq a more attractive option perhaps the most important factor is that nyse requires that a company has an independent compensation committee and an independent committee while nasdaq requires only that executive compensation and decisions are made by a majority of independent directors   no self respecting would be instant tech is going to want some independent committee it over their pay packet   additionally listing on nyse requires a company have stated guidance for corporate governance while nasdaq imposes no such requirement   similarly nyse requires a company have an internal audit team while nasdaq imposes no such requirement    fees on nyse are also a bit higher than nasdaq but the difference is not significant a good rundown of the pros cons

i 'm no expert on this but i would say that if you own the business entirely yourself there is nothing terribly wrong with using it for your own purposes as you would any other asset that you own   what is wrong is not keeping accurate records that distinguish between your money and the business 's   as you say this is wrong strategically but it can also be dangerous legally because if you mix your money and the business 's money and do n't keep track you could find for instance that you 've failed to pay the taxes you were supposed to there is also a concern that might not fall under what people refer to as ethics but more good corporate citizenship   basically people tend not to like companies that just shovel all their gains into the owners pockets   this is especially true if there are ways the money could be used to improve the business   in other words if you 're able to live high on the hog with the profits while paying all your employees a pittance the public may not look favorably on your business

your cpa does n't need to file anything so do n't worry about him being you are the one doing the filing since the amended returns have to be filed on paper you 'll actually go and mail a package to the irs each return in a separate envelope the reason the cpa suggests to file the amended returns after the current one is to ensure the nol is registered in the system before the amended returns are processed the irs does n't have to automatically accept the amended returns and if there 's no nol on the current year they may just bounce the amended returns back to you keep in mind that since you have n't filed your return by the due date including extensions you 're now unable to forego the carry back i do n't know if you discussed this with your cpa but you 're allowed if you chose so to not apply the nol to prior years and instead to apply it forward for the next 20 years or until it runs out depending on your income pattern that might have been something you could have considered but you can only chose this if you file a statement before the due date with extensions which is now passed

a company typically goes public in order to bring in additional capital in an ipo the company through its officials will typically do so by issuing additional shares and offering to sell those to investors if they did not do that then there would be no net capital gain for the company if person a sells share in company c to person b then company c does not benefit directly from the exchange by issuing and selling additional shares the total value of all stock in the company can increase being publicly traded also greatly increases the confidence in the valuation of the company as a consequence of the perfect market theory there is nothing in this that says that initial investors cofounders employees etc need to sell their shares in the process they might choose to do so or they might not or they might be prevented from doing so by terms of any agreements that they have signed or by insider trading laws compare what happens to internal stock when a company goes public depending on specifics it might be reasonable for the company to perform a share split prior to the initial public offering that however does n't affect the total value of the shares only the price per share

i am going to speak in general as this has also been the case in europe   first of all qe is an increase of money supply but using non conventional might be exceptions some examples of this measures are changing interest rates or   as to why this has nt transitioned into more inflation which in the end has but years after has been a question that people have asked a lot one of the reasons for this is the transmission mechanism not working properly which implies that despite the fact banks have received money they have nt been able to move it to the real economy hence not increasing prices

the money that you have under your control e.g. in bank accounts savings accounts taxable investments etc is your money and there is no tax of any kind either in india or in us that needs to be paid when the money is transferred to india as dheer 's answer says you need to transfer all these monies within 7 years as per indian tax law for your 401(k account assuming that all the money is tax deferred i.e. you contributed to a regular 401(k and not a roth 401(k you will have separated from service as far as us tax law is concerned so check if it is at all possible to roll over the money into a similar scheme in india specifically the employees provident fund wikipedia says the schemes covers both indian and international workers for countries with which bilateral agreements have been signed 14 such social security agreements are active and so a rollover might be possible if not you could withdraw small amounts each year and avoid us income tax but not the 10 excise tax but how long you can continue holding 401(k assets after return to india and whether that is long enough to drain the 401(k are things that you need to find out

there s some major logic missing from this report it did nt mention how technology is disrupting how everything is being distributed as businesses become more efficient with technological advances and less dependent on human capital then so must humans become more efficient and less dependent upon an expected level of income what s the demand to keep a human alive and well versus the demand for needing a well paid human laborer if you are easily then your value to the company is simply cheap labor best example is walmart the wealthiest family the largest employer whose many employees require gov assistance to live due to low wages the only way this business could even exist is with from the goverment to support its workers so where do these tax subsidies come from the article responded with a great point there will never be piles and piles of valuable goods laying around with no one to enjoy them whoever said that has never been to walmart with no money i suppose there will always be someone around to enjoy them but will there also be less and less people who can afford to enjoy such things walmart has already shown what happens this article points out the old ways of doing things economically but ignores the fact technology creates abundance not scarcity were not currently using that abundance to directly improve humanity on a large scale level but rather the opposite to control supply or scarcity aka profits when the demand to maintain amp control financial power the desire to care amp provide for your neighbor then the rise of inequality and options appear this buying power is the component of influence to being able to survive very well or simply even remain alive if my daily wage does nt provide for my daily needs then how can i use technology to stay alive how efficient can we all become before we start to share in the abundance of life together

this was a huge question for me when i graduated high school should i buy a new or a used car i opted for buying used i purchased three cars in the span of 5 years the first two were used first one was $ 1500 honda reliable for one year than problem after problem made it not worth it to keep second car was $ 2800 subaru had no problems for 18 months then problems started around 130k miles $ 1800 fix fixed it and it still burnt oil i stopped buying old after that finally i bought a nissan for $ 5500 30,000 miles private owner over 5 years i found that the difference between your typical car for $ 1500 and the typical car you can buy for $ 5500 is actually a pretty big difference   things to look for low mileage one owner recent repairs search google known issues for the make and model based on the mileage of the car your reviewing receipts clean interior buying from a private owner getting a deal where they throw in winter tires for free so you already have a set are all things to look for with that said buying new is expensive for more than just the ticket price of the car if you take a loan out you will also need to take out full insurance in order for the bank to loan you the car this adds a lot to the price of the car monthly depending on your views of insurance and how much you 're willing to risk buying your car outright should be a cheaper alternative over all than buying new save save save its very probably that the hassles of repair and surprise break downs will you enough to buy new or newer at some point but like the previous response said you worked hard to stay out of debt i 'd say save another grand buy a decent car for $ 3000 and continue your wise spending habits try to sell your cars for more than you bought them for look for good deals buy and sell work your way up to a newer more reliable car good luck

whether to employ a payroll service to handle the taxes and possibly the payroll itself is a matter that depends on how savvy you are with respect to your own taxes and with using computers in general if you are comfortable using programs such as excel or quicken or turbotax or taxact etc then taking care of payroll taxes on a nanny 's wages all by yourself is not too hard   if you take a full of receipts and to your accountant each april to prepare your personal income tax returns and sign whatever the accountant puts in front of you as your tax return then you do need to hire a payroll service it will also cost you a bundle since there are no economies of scale to help you there is only one employee to be paid

related and one of the best titled psychology papers if money does n't make you happy then you probably are n't spending it money doesnt make you happy     the relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak which may stem in part from the way people spend it drawing on empirical research we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money specifically we suggest that consumers should 1 buy more experiences and fewer material goods 2 use their money to benefit others rather than themselves 3 buy many small pleasures rather than fewer large ones 4 eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance 5 delay consumption 6 consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day to day lives 7 beware of comparison shopping and 8) pay close attention to the happiness of others   even money does n't bring happiness material things do n't bring happiness things that bring happiness however are much easier to achieve with money novel bring happiness and it 's hard to afford vacations when you 're poor being useful to society at large make people happy bill gates is more useful because he is rich than a peace corps worker it 's the little things in life that make us happy and the rich can afford more of them happiness like death is by a thousand cuts

when a business asks me to make out a cheque to a person rather than the business name i take that as a red flag frankly it usually means that the person does n't want the money going through their business account for some reason probably tax evasion i 'm not saying you are doing that but it is a frequent issue if the company makes the cheque out to a person they may run the risk of being party to fraud worse still they only have your word for it that you actually own the company and are n't ripping off your employer by pocketing their payment even worse when the company is audited and finds that cheque the person who wrote it will have to justify and document why they made it out to you or risk being charged with embezzlement it 's very much in their interests to make the cheque out to the company they did business with given that you should really have an account in the name of your business it 's going to make your life much simpler in the long run

in addition to the higher risk as pointed out by you also need to consider that there are regulations against naked shorting so you generally need to either own the security or have someone that is willing to loan the security to you in order to sell short   if you own a stock you are shorting the irs could view the transaction as a sell followed by a buy taking place in a less than 30 day period and you could be subject to wash sale rules   this added complexity most often the finding of someone to loan you the security you are shorting is another reason such trades are considered more advanced you should also be aware that there are currently a number of proposals to re the uptick rule or some circuit breaker variant designed to prevent short sellers from driving down the price of a stock and conducting bear raids etc the first requires that a stock trade at the same or higher price as prior trades before you can submit a short   in the latter shorting would be prohibited after a stock price had fallen a given percentage in a given amount of time   in either case should such a rule be then you could face limitations attempting to execute a short which you would not need to worry about doing simple buys or sells    as to vehicles that would do this kind of thing if you are convinced we are in a bear market and willing to take the risk there are a number of etf 's classified as inverse exchange traded funds etf 's for a variety of markets that via various means seek to deliver a return similar to that of shorting the market in question   one such example for a common broad market is ticker sh the short s&p500 etf which seeks to deliver a return that is the inverse of the s&p500 and as would be predicted based on the roughly + 15 performance of the s&p500 over the last 12 months sh is down roughly -15 over the same period   the wikipedia article on inverse etf 's lists a number of other such funds covering various markets    i think it should be noted that using such a vehicle is a pretty aggressive bet to take in reaction to the belief that a bear market is imminent   a more conservative approach would be to simply take money out of the market and place it in something like cd 's or treasury instruments   in that case you preserve your capital regardless of what happens in the market using an inverse etf otoh means that if the market went bull instead of bear you would lose money instead of merely holding your position

i would say the most challenging fact for this assertion is that hft firms operate with extremely limited capital bases for a stock with say 10 m shares adv even a very large and successful hft strategy might use a position limit of no more than 5000 shares   that is to say if you sum up and net the buys and sells for a stock across the day the hft firm will never exceed 10,000 shares 2x position limits assuming it completely flipped on a stock that trades 10,000,000 shares on a given day the high volumes are attained through high turnover the strategy might trade up to 500,000 shares or 5 of the volume attaining a 50x turnover   but that brings me back to the original point in the market literature market impact generally has been found to scale linearly or even sub linearly for net volume executed    if i alternate between thousands of 1 lot buy and sell orders it would be very difficult for me to move the market because the market impact of every one of my buy orders roughly cancels the market impact of my almost exactly equal number of sell orders    there might be a higher order mechanism at work but i 'm genuinely curious what you think it might be how could strategies that attain such small net positions have such out sized impact on market direction

yeah    they actually have said that their new strategy is not to make money from breakage people who pay but do n't use it i believe they also guaranteed the $ 10 deal for a year but i 'm not at all certain so do n't quote me on that    instead they want to make money from the data and eventually convince movie theaters to cut them in on sales and/or give them discounts on tickets both of which depend on people actually using moviepass    i think those are really silly plans the movie data is highly unlikely to cover the costs of the tickets that moviepass has to buy    movie theaters like studios are stubborn bastards who have a history of sticking to their guns and refusing to budge even an inch when it comes to certain terms they also have recently demonstrated a preference for building out their own direct to consumer offerings rather than with third party offerings    i do n't see them getting a ton more traffic from mp customers and more concession sales and then deciding to give up any of their highly prized concession sales considering that most heavy theater likely have a primary theater that they go to it would probably make more sense for theaters to simply market their own offering to them in theater and wait for mp to run out of money    finally amc is the biggest chain and actively wants this $ 10/month subscription to fail amc has announced that it absolutely will not give mp any deals on ticket prices something that mp is counting on to make this sustainable maybe mp is counting on amc to eventually change its mind but i do n't think that 's a smart bet    otoh what the hell do i know i 've been wrong plenty of times before

the issues are larger than taxes   if one of you receives the check then breaks off 25 of it for themselves and sends three checks out to each of you that will be indicated on that person 's taxes   you three will then all recognize your portion of the income on your taxes and it 's all settled   it 's no big deal it 's a bit rag tag but it 'll get the job done   i 've done little ad hoc partnership work with people this way and it 's not a problem this is why you should really be more formal   what if this entity contracting you guys sues you   who has the liability if only one of you was paid   what if the money is sent to one of you and that person dies before paying you   what if you all get another client   what if this contracting entity has another project    the partnership needs to have the liability   the partnership needs to receive the money   the partnership needs to be named on whatever contract you all sign   the partnership can be a straight partnership or maybe the four of you take a 25 stake in an llc or inc arrangement   minimally you should sit down with your partners so everyone knows everyone else 's responsibilities and you should write it all down   it probably sounds like overkill and i 'm sure your partners are you buddies and we 're tight and nothing bad could come between us   i 've done some partnership work with more than one friend we 've always been fine   some ventures are successful some are n't i 'm still very good friends with all of them   writing things down manages expectations and when money starts moving around everyone is happier when everyone has a solid expectation of who gets what

that 's a simple overhead calculation   for secretary how much time is this person going to potentially save verses how much time i spend on those tasks   if secretary pay rate is near equal or less than what i spend in my own hourly rate it makes sense to hire   if it is not do not hire you do n't want to loose money on overhead or have people sitting around doing nothing   brand manager is more complicated because it involves speculation and projection   i would want some kind of trial solution before a more permanent solution was decided on   for example if brand manager is renewing my brand image what do i anticipate that new image will bring in additional revenue or alternatively what new markets will my product now be able to tap into that it was not able to tap into before   then i would do the simple sales calculation of how much revenue would i need to expect to cover the cost of the overhead and project to justify viability   then simply ask the question of if it is reasonable to expect those kinds of returns from this person or project   in business there is risk   there 's really two ways to look at risk big risk = big reward and screw the consequences if we fail or make sure that risk is diminished as much as possible before making a decision   i would say most start ups begin with big risk = big reward and then evolve into diminishing risk as much as possible   both have many good and many bad examples   most involve businesses dead before they figure out how to diminish risk or in extreme examples wall street people diminishing risk by cheating the system but we are n't discussing ethics

most of the answers here reflect a misunderstanding of what gold actually is from a financial perspective   i 'll answer your question by asking two questions and i do challenge you to stop and think about what we mean when we say cash or unit of exchange because without understanding those you will completely miss this answer in 1971 the dxy was 110   for people who do n't know the dxy is the us dollar index it weighs the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies   hey look it 's a pretty graph of the dxy 's history in 1971 gold was $ 35 an ounce the dxy is 97 today gold is $ an ounce today now the questions if shares of company a in 1971 were $ 10 a share but now are $ 100 a share and some of this is because the company has grown but some of it is because of inflation and the dxy losing value what would the value of the company be if it was held in grams of gold and not dollars benjamin graham who influenced warren buffett is a supposed critic of gold yet what percent of his life were we not on a gold standard   in his day the dollar was backed by gold why would you buy gold if every dollar represented gold finally consider how many us dollars exist and how few metric tonnes of gold exist   even paul volcker admitted that a new gold standard would be impossible because the value of gold if we did it today would put gold in the $ range which is absurd to get on a gold standard technically now an old fashioned gold    standard and you had to replace all the dollars out there in foreign    hands with gold god the price you buy gold because the price of    gold would have to be enormous so you 're all left hoping the federal reserve figures how to get us all out of this mess without causing trouble otherwise let me just kindly say you will realize the value of gold then as the old saying goes a fool and his money are soon   i could be wrong but i 'd say that those who 've been buying gold since 1971 for their cash holdings not index funds are n't the suckers

when you own a share you also own a vote in most cases that vote is your means of controlling the assets and management of the company if you had enough votes and wanted to trade a share for an iphone or liquidate the company entirely you could do it the only thing that prevents you from doing that is that companies are not set up to handle the transaction that way stock holders are usually trying to buy investments not iphones there are companies that have more cash in the bank than the market cap total value of their stock they usually do n't remain as public companies for long in that case an investor or group of investors buy them up and split the cash if you had enough shares of apple you could do that to or just trade one for an iphone

i get paid a 50 cents more at my second job than my day job and at the end of the week my take home pay from the latter is $ 20 higher that s a bullshit argument $ 5 per hour is a lot of money especially considering that a lot of people have been living paycheck to paycheck throughout obamas never ending recovery   what makes a 's hours $ 5 more valuable than a fedex employee by every measure fedex is a more productive and efficient entity than the us postal service so why is the worth more i 'll tell you exactly why   the fedex employee 's compensation is needs based fedex does a certain amount of business which requires a certain amount of labor which commands a certain price in the labor market fedex does not pay more for labor than it has to because fedex must be an efficient organization to meet its customers price expectations     the 's compensation is arbitrary set by government officials with no direct accountability to customers because they know jack shit about logistics congress has mandated that the postal service offer services to the public at uniform price and quality as such it has continuously failed to manage its budget properly to the tune of $ 5 to $ 10 billion dollar every year with a total mail volume that has declined 29 between 1998 and 2008   why does the postal service exist because it makes your congressman feel good and he 's more than willing to burn your money on the of his and false over the massive arbitrarily created vested interest postal employees have in losing their above average pay hack jobs than for any dedication you he has to the welfare of his constituents   if you want me to run down why i believe our government is not acting in our own personal best interests the postal service is the perfect place to start

yes maybe sometimes the mother company that makes the car covers a bit of the loss that comes from the super offer loan so the dealer loses a bit less but generally you are right you should be able to talk them into some rebate that gets you around the given number depending on how good you are a negotiator and how urgently they need to sell a car

mrchrister 's answer is just plain wrong your history of carrying debt or paying interest has nothing to do with your credit score the biggest factors are payment history debt to available credit ratio and length of credit history if you have active credit accounts for 5 years have 10 15k in limits on credit cards and put gas and groceries on a credit card that is paid in full each month you 'll have a top notch credit rating there is no way to tell from a credit report whether you carry a balance for pay in full anyone who gets into debt to improve a credit score is ignorant of the process if you have bad credit here 's how you improve it

  it 's all about risk   with a cash buyer the decision is left up to one person   with a financed buyer it adds another approval process the lender   it 's another opportunity for the deal to fall through   if the bank is the lender then there 's even more risk   they 've already taken back the property once and incurred cost and they 're setting themselves up to do it all over again   the discount price can depend on a lot of factors   maybe it 's a bad area and they need to get rid of it   maybe the appraisals for the area are low because of foreclosures and they know it will be hard for a buyer to get a loan   lots of reasons as to what price they 'd take   every deal has contingencies unless it 's a foreclosure bought at auction   even if you are getting a steal from the bank in terms of price you 're always going to have an inspection period   if a buyer does n't need an inspection then he will just go to an auction and buy a property for an even cheaper price

i agree this is an great discussion   i think i understand your position now black scholes is an equilibrium model because its a model that in effect says here 's the price of an option if the underlying follows this stochastic process i guess my question is then what would a strictly no arbitrage equity option model look like then e.g. one analogous to hull white does such a concept even make sense

this would never apply for tax brackets it 's not as though making an extra dollar will put you into an entire separate bracket the irs is n't that bad they bump up the brackets every $ 50 so you will never turn down a raise because it would cause you to lose income however if your raise would preclude you from contributing to your ira because it pushes you over $ 110,000 then yes you could turn it down or explain to your boss that it would need to be just a little bit higher to cover your ira contribution loss
