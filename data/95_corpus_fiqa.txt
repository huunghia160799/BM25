yes it applies to control groups   if i remember correctly common ownership rules are used to determine applicable large employer status but if the time comes to owe a penalty only the actual entity missing the mark will owe a penalty not the entire control group this is an excerpt from section the section that lays out employer requirements and penalties 16 employer the term employer means the person that is the employer of an employee under the common law standard see for purposes of determining whether an employer is an applicable large employer all persons treated as a single employer under section c m or o are treated as a single employer thus all employees of a controlled group of entities under section or c an affiliated service group under section or an entity in an arrangement described under section are taken into account in determining whether the members of the controlled group or affiliated service group together are an applicable large employer for purposes of determining applicable large employer status the term employer also includes a predecessor employer see paragraph of this section and a successor employer link to the federal register

my knee jerk reaction was no they are not worth it but i took a little time to look up what some of the trusted names in consumer electronics reviews had to say about extended warranties service contracts a writer said that your decision should consider the price of the service contract relative to the price of the item you 're buying as well as the amount of hassle you 're willing to endure should something go wrong consumer reports believes that the warranties that come with your products are almost always enough and they say that electronics and appliances are so well built nowadays the likelihood of you needing extra service before you upgrade are slim to none and the folks over at offer the same maybe yes maybe no advice as the guys depends on your appetite for risk and the options available to you so i would suggest that the answer be no most of the time but consider it anyway

patience is the key here i hate to say there are five factors to fico credit scores   payment history is adversely affected by late payments so always pay on time otherwise your report will be for seven years credit utilization has to do with how much of your available credit is currently in use lower is better but 0 is n't good either because they want to see that you 're using credit 10 or less is a good goal and try to keep any single card balance to 30 or less when its statement close date rolls around credit history is based on the average age of all of your accounts cards or otherwise the older the better do n't close either of your other cards because that would cause your average account age to fall and make sure to use the store card at least occasionally because lenders sometimes decide to close unused lines of credit credit mix has to do with the different types of credit you hold and is why your bank 's website suggested taking out a loan it also has to do with the number of accounts overall i 've never found a satisfactory answer for what the sweet spot is but i suspect it 's in the 6 12 range you would n't want to get several new ones at the same time because new credit is affected by the credit inquiries hard pulls that occur when you apply for new cards or loans inquiries stay on your report for two years before falling off this is almost certainly where your score dropped you also mentioned not knowing if some hospital bills are still affecting your score you 'll want to review your credit reports and find out plus checking your credit reports regularly is a really great habit to get into because errors and fraud can and do happen there are three credit reporting agencies experian equifax and transunion and you 'll want to review all three you can get one free report from each of them every year it can take a couple of months for a new credit account to show up on your credit report so your score should recover and go even higher once that happens sit tight as annoying as that is

see my recent answer to a similar question on prepaying a mortgage versus investing in ira the issue here is similar you want to compare the relative rates of funding your retirement account versus paying down your debt if you can invest at a better rate than you are paying on your debt with similar risk then you should invest otherwise pay down your debt the big difference with your situation is that you have a variable rate loan so there 's a significant risk that the rate on it will go up if i was in your shoes i would do the following but that 's me if you 're more debt averse you may decide to prepay that fixed rate loan too

can is fine and other answered that i 'd suggest that you consider the should does your employer offer a matched retirement account typically a 401(k are you depositing up to the match   do you have any higher interest short term debt credit cards car loan student loan etc   do you have 6 months worth of living expenses in liquid funds   one point i like to beat a dead horse over is this for most normal mortgages the extra you pay goes to principal but regardless of how much extra you pay the next payment is still due next month so it 's possible that you are feeling pretty good that for 5 years you pay so much that you have just 10 left on the 30 year loan but if you lose your job you still risk losing the house to foreclosure it 's not like you can ask the bank for that money back   if you are as disciplined as you sound put the extra money aside and only when you have well over the recommended 6 months then make those prepayments if you choose   to pull my comment to into my answer i avoided this aspect of the discussion but here i 'll suggest that a 4 mortgage costs 3 after tax in 25 bracket and i 'd bet cap gain rates will stay 15 for so with the break even return of 3.5 to return 3 after tax and dvy yielding 3.33 the questions becomes do you think the dvy top will be flat over the next 15 years any return over is profit that said the truly risk averse should heed the advise in original answer then pre pay update when asked in april 2012 the dvy i suggested as an example of an investment that beats the mortgage cost traded at $ 56 it 's now $ 83 and still yields to put numbers to this a lump sum $ 100 k would be worth $ k this does n't include dividends and giving off $ in dividends for an after tax $ we happened to have a good 4 years overall the time horizon 15 years makes the strategy low risk if one sticks to it

as i recall from the documentation presented to me any gain over the strike price from an iso stock option counts as a long term capital gain for tax purposes if it 's held from 2 years from the date of grant and 1 year from the date of exercise if you 're planning to take advantage of that tax treatment exercising your options now will start that 1-year clock now as well and grant you a little more flexibility with regards to when you can sell in the future of course no one 's renewed the bush tax cuts yet so the long term capital gains rate is going up and eventually it seems they 'll want to charge you medicare on those gains as well because they can soo the benefit of this tax treatment is being reduced lovely time to be investing

an option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy or sell the underlying so you do n't have to exercise you can just let the option expire so long it does n't have an automatic expiry after expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays an option has two values associated with it time value and exercise value far out of the money when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side options only have time value whereas deep in the money options as yours seems to be has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy sell at a low high price and then sell buy the underlying   the time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move further in your favour and make you more money at expiry as expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no up to now what i have said applies to both otc and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower on the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds if these are european style options which sounds likely and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money they have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying if i am not correct in my excise style assumption european i may need more details on the trade as it seems like you should just exercise now and take the profit if it is that far into the money

smallest risk of default would depend on where alice and bob live i suppose but lets assume they are in a lower yielding nation where default is not a big concern   remember for instance that greece was a lower yielding nation at one point and that the us has defaulted before let 's start with bob because he is easier to analyze   yield curves inversions generally pre date recessions which is generally not so good for bob as rates tend to drop during recessions and he will be at the short end of the curve so his bonds will be less sensitive   however he will generally get higher yields in good times to make up for this but these higher yields come with a price in that he is generally much more sensitive to yield changes and can get much larger swings in portfolio value first off as jb mentioned alice would likely own inflation linked il bonds   which behave fairly differently from bob 's bonds however to keep this simple lets say they live in a place without il bonds or il bonds are not a consideration   then generally alice has lower yielding bonds in good times but may do very well when the fed steps in during a crisis so who wins in the long run   likely who owns a mix of a broad index of stocks and bonds in a risk mix where she would n't have to sell in downturns   especially as would n't have to pay the trading costs of moving her whole portfolio between long and short bonds   between bob and alice however bob would likely win in the long run as the markets generally reward risk taking in the long run   still inflation even without the il bonds and general rate trends long term rates are historically low right now could have bob losing for long periods

there 's no requirement of us citizenship to open a bank account in the us any person citizen or not can do that i do n't know where this assumption of yours come from but it is false so the easiest solution is to open a bank account for your nephew next time he visits the us and get him an atm card from that account you can then deposit money to that account as much as you want beware of the gift tax consequences if he does n't want to travel to the us and can not open a us bank account remotely from russia which is probably the case then follow the 's suggestion have him open a bank account in russia and just wire money there having a foreigner tapping freely into your own personal bank account may cause legal issues both with regards to gift tax and money laundering provisions that require you to certify that the money on the account is yours only also check if there 's an issue for a russian resident to have control over foreign accounts there 's definitely such an issue for a us resident russians are generally not far behind when it comes to government oppression

you ca n't short a stock unless there is someone willing and able to lend shares to you and there are several reasons why that might not be the case first is a new stock which means that no one has held it very long it 's much easier to short ibm or exxon mobil where there are some long term holders who would like to earn a little extra money lending you their shares but if everyone involved is busy buying or selling the stock there wo n't be many people to lend it that 's not manipulation that 's just the market another reason may be a large short interest that is many others have shorted it before you that 's dangerous for you because if some lenders want to pull their shares off the market they can cause a short squeeze that will drive the price much higher   and stock shortages can be orchestrated by the company or large investors to artificially drive the price higher unless you have a lot of experience do n't try shorting small cap stocks try to gain some experience with large caps like ibm or exxon mobil first those are stocks that people at least ca n't play games with you will win or lose based on the market itself

first things first its always good to set the records straight when you are trying to clear your debt do them one by one and ask the collection agent that you would pay in full only if the records would be deleted from your credit history and most of the collection agencies are happy to take it off your credit report as they are getting the money this would work generally only when you pay the full amount i can guarantee you this because i have tried it myself after hearing about it from my friends   if you have already paid whole amount already then records of your payments generally will not be available after 2 years with any banks even the big ones like bank of america or wells fargo that means if they do n't have the records no body else would because its a burden as your payment is written off you can file a dispute to credit bureaus for your payment history and if they could n't provide you the history they have to take your record off your history even they know that you have delinquent history because they do n't have enough proof to confirm that and when you file a dispute its always good to file it by paper as they have to write back and you can ask hard copies of the proofs which are very difficult to get one more thing if you want to dispute it might take couple of months atleast and you need to have patience because you already might have known how important credit history is

it sounds like you 're putting all your extra money into insurances because you feel that one can never have too much insurance that 's a very bad idea financially basically it means you 'll end up giving your money away to insurance companies in order to satisfy that feeling do realize that the expected value of every is negative on average you 'll pay more money than you 'll receive otherwise insurance companies would go bankrupt so they are very good at ensuring that they get more in premiums than they pay out insurance should only be bought to cover essential risks things that would ruin you major health problems death to cover disability liability for everything else you should self insure by saving up money up to a few months wages and putting it into safe and liquid investment vehicles as an emergency fund that way you are much more flexible do n't pay for the insurance company 's employees fancy offices and profits and may even earn some interest

as others have alluded to but have n't said due to the lack of reputation points to spare you can take advantage of oil prices by leveraging up and using as much credit and margin as the banks and brokerages respectively will lend you people assume that the correct answer on this forum has to as conservative financial advice and this is not advice nor conservative futures contracts are readily available but they are expensive to obtain like a minimum entry of $ but if this expense is no such object to you then you can then obtain this contract which is actually worth 20x that and experience the price appreciation and depreciation of the whole contract the concept is similar to a downpayment on a mortgage you assume rock bottom oil prices but fortunately for you futures contracts will allow you to quickly change your bets from future price appreciation and allow you to speculate on future price depreciation so although the union workers will be protesting full time after the drilling company lays them off you will still be getting wealthier long options these are the best the difference with options amongst other speculation products is that options require the least amount of capital risk for the greatest reward with futures or with trading shares of an etf especially on margin you have to put up a lot of capital and if the market does not go your desired direction then will lose a lot and on margin products you can lose more than you put in being long options does not come with these a long march 2015 call option on uso etf can currently be bought for less than $ 200 of actual cash ie the trading quote will be less than $ 2.00 but this will cost you less than $ 200 and will be worth $ 1000 on a very modest rebound in prices the most you can lose is the $ 200 for the contract compared to $ on the futures or $ 100,000 that you do n't have in the futures market if oil really moves against you or compared to whatever large amount of cash needed to actually buy shares of an etf needed to make any decent return these are the most lucrative and fun and and ways to take advantage of rock bottom oil prices as an individual

i have an example that may be interesting for your question my grandfather had a tennis club around 35 years ago and some other businesses some investments went bad and he was heading for bankruptcy due to the tennis club 's expensive payments so he asked to renegotiate a variable rate rather than a fixed rate even though the interest rates were going up not down the idea was that if the current situation is going to bankrupt you taking a chance might be better as an analogy if you ca n't swim and you 'll drown in 6 feet of water it does n't matter that you 're taking the risk to go deeper you might have to take that chance to survive he did keep the tennis club in the end but that 's irrelevant here for student loans if i 'm not mistaken declaring bankruptcy does n't free you of all their debt so it may not be applicable   and this situation is when renegotiating not when negotiating the first time because obviously if you 're in trouble financially taking a loan you know you ca n't repay is suicide

there are no rules about how the price should act after an ipo so there are no guarantee that a pop would appear at the opening day but when an ipo is done it 's typically underpriced on average the shares are 10 up at the end of the first day after the ipo i do n't have the source that i just remember that from some finance course also after the ipo the underwriter can be asked to support the trading of the share for a certain period of time that is the so called stabilizing agent they have few obligations like this price support in often done by a repurchase of some of the shares of poorly performing ipo edit about the pool when the ipo is done a certain number of client buy the shares issued by the company the underwriter with the clients can decide to create an pool where the clients would get a little more shares hence but this time the shares are not issued by the company but by the underwriter to put it another way the underwriter and becomes short by a certain number of shares limited to 15 of the ipo in exchange for the risk taken by this the underwriter gets a option from the clients that will allows the underwriter to buy back the oversold shares at the price of the ipo from the clients the idea behind this option is to avoid a market exposure for the underwriter so after the ipo if the price goes down the underwriter buys back on the market the shares and makes a profits if the price goes up the company exercise the option buy the shares at the ipo prices the pool that is the additional shares that the clients wanted to avoid suffering a loss

you are right if by a lot of time you mean a lot of occasions lasting a few milliseconds each this is one of the oldest in the book and there 's plenty of people constantly on the lookout for such situations hence they are rare and do n't last very long most of the time the relationship is satisfied to within the accuracy set by the bid ask spread what you write as an equality should actually be a set of inequalities   continuing with your example suppose 1 gbp ~ 2 usd where the market price to buy gbp the offer is $ and to sell gbp the bid is $   suppose further that 1 usd ~ 2 eur and the market price to buy usd is and to sell usd is   then converting your gbp to eur in this way requires selling for usd receive $ then sell the usd for eur receive   going the other way converting eur to gbp it will cost you to buy 1 gbp   hence so long as the posted prices for direct conversion are within these bounds there is no arbitrage

here is the investing for retirement theoretical background you should have you should base your investment decisions not simply on the historical return of the fund but on its potential for future returns and its risk past performance does not indicate future results the past performance is frequently at its best the moment before the bubble pops while no one knows the specifics of future returns there are a few types of assets that it 's relatively safe to make blanket statements about the future returns of your portfolio will primarily be determined by your asset allocation the general rules look like there are a variety of guides out there to help decide your asset allocation and tell you specifically what to do the other thing that you should consider is the cost of your funds while it 's easy to get lucky enough to make a mutual fund outperform the market in the short term it 's very hard to keep that up for decades on end moreover chasing performance is risky and expensive so look at your fund information and locate the expense ratio if the fund 's expense ratio is 1 that 's super expensive the stock market 's annualized real rate of return is about 4 so that could be a quarter of your returns all else being equal choose the cheap index fund with an expense ratio closer to 0.1 many 401(k providers only have expensive mutual funds this is because you 're trapped and ca n't switch to a cheaper fund so they 're free to take lots of your money if this is the case deal with it in the short term for the tax benefits then open a specific type of account called a rollover ira when you change jobs and move your assets there or if your savings are small enough just open an ira a traditional ira or roth ira and use those instead or yell at your hr department in the event that you think that 'll actually accomplish anything

looking at the spy option chain you posted all of the call options with a strike price of or higher have a bid of n a.   that 's because the ask price for all of those options is 0.01 and the bid price has to be less than the ask price but buyers are not allowed to bid 0.00   it 's not accurate to say that no one wants to buy those calls anyone who wanted to buy one of those calls would just buy it at the ask price of 0.01 so why are people selling those calls for just 0.01   the further out of the money you go as you get closer to expiration the less likely the underlying stock or etf spy in this case will go over the strike price and the less you can sell it for   spy closed yesterday at about and it would have to go up almost 2.5 today for the calls to be in the money and a 2.5 move in one day is extremely unlikely

whether you do decide to go with a tax advisor or not be sure to do some research on your own when we moved to the us about 5 years ago i did find the taxes here pretty complicated and confusing   i went ahead and read up all different tax documents and did some calculations of my own before hiring a cpa at that point i just wanted a second opinion to make sure i got the calculations right however when the office of the cpa was finished with my taxes i found they had made a mistake when i went back to their office to point it out the lady just shrugged corrected her numbers on the form and said you seem to know a lot about this stuff already why are you here i swore to never use them again not this particular cpa at least now i am not saying all cpas are the same some of them are pretty darn good at their job and know what they are doing all i am saying is it helps to be prepared and know some basic stuff just do n't go in all blind   after all they are also humans prone to mistakes and your taxes are your liability in the end   my suggestion is to start with a good tool that supports tax filing for non residents most of them provide a step by step qa based tool as you go through the steps google each question you do n't understand it may take more time than hiring a tax advisor directly but in the end it will all be worth it

in us public stock markets there is no difference between the actions individual retail traders are permitted to take and the actions institutional corporate traders are permitted to take   the only difference is the cost of those actions   for example if you become a registered market maker on say the bats stock exchange you 'll get some amazing rebates and reduced transaction prices however in order to qualify for registered market maker status you have to maintain constant orders in the book for hundreds of equities at significant volumes   an individual retail trader is certainly permitted to do that but it 's probably too expensive algorithmic trading is not the same as automated trading algorithmic trading can be non automated and automated trading can be non algorithmic and both can be anywhere from low- to high frequency   a low frequency automated strategy is essentially indistinguishable from a person clicking their mouse several times per day so no from a legal or regulatory perspective there is no special procedure an individual retail trader has to follow before s he can automate a trading strategy   your broker on the other hand may have all sorts of hoops for you to jump through in order to use their automation platform last but certainly not least you will almost certainly lose money hand over fist attempting bid ask scalping as an individual retail trader whether your approach is algorithmic or not automated or not   why   because the only way to succeed at bid ask scalping is to a always be at near the front of the queue when a price change occurs in your favor and b always cancel your resting orders before they are executed when a price change occurs against you   unless your algorithms are smarter than every other algorithm in the industry an individual retail trader operating through a broker 's trading platform can not react quickly enough to succeed at either of those   you would have to eschew the broker and buy direct market access to even have a chance and that 's the point at which you 're no longer a retail trader good luck

the main difference between a mutual fund and an etf are how they are bought and sold from the investors perspective an etf is transacted on the open market this means you normally ca n't buy partial shares with your initial investment having to transact on the open market also means you pay a market price the market price is always a little bit different from the net asset value nav of the fund during market hours the etf will trade at a premium discount to the nav calculated on the previous day morningstar 's fund analysis will show a graph of the premium discount to nav for an etf with a mutual fund on the other hand your investment goes to a fund company which then grants you shares while under the hood buying the underlying investments you pay the nav price and are allowed to buy partial shares usually an etf has a lower expense ratio but if that 's equal and any initial fees commissions are equal i would prefer the mutual fund in order to buy partial shares so your initial investment will be fully invested and so you do n't have to worry about paying premium to nav

top down approach needed when bottom up approach of markets leads to    periods of high unemployment imagine a chart that starts with one point at the top and breaks it down into the details by the time you get to the bottom people can read this chart either from the top and go down or from the bottom and go up wikipedia does have articles on top down and bottom up design if you want more detail than i give here top down refers to the idea of starting at a high level and then working down to get into the details for example in planning a vacation one could start with what continent to go then which country then which cities in that country and so forth thus the idea here would be to start with macroeconomic trends and then create a strategy to fix this as the other way is what created the problem the idea of taking a subject or system and breaking it down into individual pieces would be another way to state this bottom up refers to the idea of starting with the details and then build up to get a general idea to use the vacation example again this is starting with the cities and then building up to build the overall within political circles you may here of efforts where citizens will form groups to gain influence this would be an example of bottom up since it is starting with the people the idea of taking individual components and putting them together to build up something would be another way to state this the statement is saying that a completely different style of approach will be necessary than the one that created the problem here

i would contribute this money to the deposit but would n’t pay anything else more and want to know if they do the house up and it increases in value how does my share gets worked out if i want it out in about years this can be simple you have contributed 9 k out of 260 k. you own approx 3.4 of equity in the house whenever this gets sold you will get back 3.4 now the real trick comes in if the house is not being sold ie your sister would continue using it and you want out then one would need to decide the fair market value you could agree to consult some lists or agree of the fair value based on sale price of similar properties in the area this is where it normally gets difficult and can cause disputes we do not have much money for solicitors lawyers and we do n't really really need them it is advisable to get a lawyer as one does n't know what happens 10 years in future things may go wrong between you and your sister or your sister is no more and her fiancé   may not honor the agreement you have there are other considerations    it would be advisable you have your name on the property it would help from tax point of view in future if you are not having your name on the property then the money you are giving would be loan or gift and needs to have the right paper work if its a gift you ca n't have it back your sister would have to make a gift back to you later whenever you want out so it can really be complicated and it would be worth the money you spend on lawyer

simply put you can not beat the market if by being informed and following all relevant news you can arrive at the conclusion that company a will likely outperform company b in the future then having a stocks should be better than having b stocks or any e.g. index based mix of them but as the whole market has access to the very same information and will arrive at the same conclusion provided it is logically sound everybody will want a stocks which thus become expensive to the point where the expected return is average again   your only options of winning this race are to be the very first to have the important information insider trade or to arrive at different logical conclusions than the rest of the world which boils down do making decisions that are not logically sound good luck with that or assuming that almost everybody else is not logically sound go figure

leverage means you can make more investments with the same amount of money   in the case of rental properties it means you can own more properties and generate more rents   you exchange a higher cost of doing business higher interest fees and a higher risk of total failure for a larger number of rents and thus higher potential earnings as with any investment advice whenever someone tells you do x and you are guaranteed to make more money unless you are a printer of money that is not entirely true in this case taking more leverage exposes you to more risk while giving you more potential gain   that risk is not only on the selling front in fact for most small property owners the risk is primarily that you will have periods of time of higher expense or lower income   these can come in several ways if you weather these and similar problems then you will stand to make more money using higher leverage assuming you make more money from each property than your additional interest costs   as long as you 're making any money on your properties this is likely as interest rates are very low right now but making any money at all above and beyond the sale value may be challenging early on    these sorts of risks are magnified for your first few years until you 've built up a significant reserve to keep your business afloat in downturns   and of course any money in a reserve is money you 're not leveraging for new property acquisition the very same trade off   and while you may be able to sell one or more properties if you did end up in a temporarily bad situation you also may run into 2008 again and be unable to do so

as chris pointed out if your expenses are covered by the income exactly as you have said to assume then you are basically starting with a $ 40 k asset your starting equity and ending with a $ 200 k asset a paid for home at the same value since you have said to ignore any appreciation so to determine what you have earned on the $ 40 k you leveraged 5x would n't it be a matter of computing a cagr that gets you from $ 40 k to $ 200 k in 30 years the result would be a nominal return not a real return so if i set up the problem correctly it should be $ 40,000 1 + = $ 200,000 then solve for return it works out to be about or so

yes you could sell what you have and bet against others that the stock price will continue to fall within a period of time shorting   if you 're right your value goes up even though the stock price goes down this is a pretty darn risky bet to make   if you 're wrong there 's no limit to how much money you can owe   at least with stocks they can only fall to zero   when you short and the price goes up and up and up before the deadline you owe it and just as with stocks someone else has to agree to take the bet   if a stock is pretty obviously tanking its unlikely that someone would oppose your bet it 's probably pretty clear that i barely know what i 'm talking about but i was surprised not to see this listed among the answers

this started as a comment but then really go too long so i am posting an answer i am also using gnucash just like you as a non accountant but i think it really pays off to get to know more about accounting via gnucash it is so useful and you learn a lot about this hundreds of years old double entry system that all accountants know so start learning about 5 main accounts and debits and credits imho it is far easier than one can think now the answer even without balancing amounts exactly program is very useful as you still can track your monthly outgoings very well just make adjust some reports and save their so you can re run quickly when new data comes in after you have classified your transactions properly if i still did not know what some transactions were happens a lot at first import i just put them under expenses unaccounted expenses thus you will be able to see how much money went who knows where if later you learn what those transactions were you still can move them to the right account and you will be pleased that your reports show less unaccounted money how many transactions to import at first for me half a year or a year is quite enough once you start tracking regularly you accumulate more date and this becomes a non issue reflecting that personal finance is more about behaviour than maths and that it is more for the future where your overview of money is useful gnucash wil learn from import to import what transactions go where so you could import say 1 or 3 month intervals to start with instead of a while year no matter what i still glance at every transaction on import and still sometimes petrol expense lands in grocery because of the same seller but to spot things like that you use reports and if one month is abnormal you can drill down to transactions and learn correct things note that reports are easy to modify and you can save the report with names you can remember they are saved on the machine you do the accounting not within the gnucash file so if you open the file or mysql database on another computer you will miss your custom reports you can transfer them but it is a bit hence it makes sense to use gnucash on your laptop as that you probably will have around most often once you start entering transactions into gnucash on the day or the week you incur the expense you are getting more control and it is perhaps then you would need the balance to match the bank 's balance then you can adjust the equity opening balances to manipulate the starting sums so that current balances match those of your bank this is easy   when you have entered transactions proactively on the day or the week and then later do an import from bank statement the transactions are matched automatically and then they are said to be reconciled i.e. your manual entry gets matched by the entry from your statement so for beginning it is something like that if any questions feel free to ask imho this is a process rather a one off thing i began once got bored but started again and now i find it immensely useful

how to use your shares if you own common shares in a company as opposed to a fund then you have the right but not the obligation to one vote per share on questions put before the shareholders usually this occurs once a year usually these questions regard approval of auditors sometimes they involve officers such as directors on the board you will be mailed a form to fill out and mail back in   preferred shares usually are not voting shares but common shares always are   by the way i do not recommend owning shares in companies i recommend funds instead either etfs or mutual funds owning shares in companies puts you at risk of a failure of that company owning funds spreads that risk around thus reducing your exposure   there are really two purposes for owning shares 1 owning shares gives you the right to declared dividends 2 owning shares allows you to sell those shares at some time in the future hopefully at a profit   one obscure thing you can do with owned shares is to write sell covered put options but options are not something that you need to concern yourself with at this point   you may find it useful to sign up for a free daily email from

that happens all the time the best situation for this to happen is when you have several products each a bit better and a bit more expensive than the other and you add a new product which is the cheapest that gets people into the store to look at the cheapest product and then you show the the next more expensive which is so much better for only a little more money and the next more expensive which is again so much better you might not sell any of the cheapest product but it helps you sell the others   also happens the other way round you add a really expensive item unaffordable for most customers that is really really nice then customers look at it and you show them that for half the price they can have something that is almost as nice the expensive product increases the amount that customers think is the right price for that kind of product a customer might think that $ 2,000 for a diamond ring is an awful lot of money but if you show them another ring for $ 5,000 then suddenly the $ 2,000 does n't look that expensive anymore and if it is almost as nice as the $ 5,000 ring you sell a lot of rings for $ 2,000 because you had the more expensive ring in the store

sorry but i am absolutely correct   fractional reserve lending banking is simply that when someone deposits money into a bank the bank is allowed to loan that money out so long as they keep a reserve   if the reserve rate is 10 it 's much lower in reality and someone deposits $ 100 into the bank the bank can then loan out $ 90   that is fractional reserve lending at its most basics   now fractional reserve lending does have a multiplier effect   and this effect is exactly how i described it   let 's go back to the example   person a deposits the $ 100 the bank then loans $ 90 to person b person b spends it with person c person c takes the money and deposits back to the bank   now the bank has the $ 100 cash back $ 90 in loans and the $ 190 in deposits so they need to hold onto $ 19 as a reserve and can loan out $ 81   assuming the money cycles with 100 efficiency the bank can continue loaning out the same money until they are left with $ 1000 in deposits $ 900 in loans and the original $ 100 is the reserve   this is the multiplier effect

credit cards are a golden goose for banks as they get to issue high interest loans and simultaneously generate alot of fee income debit cards are n't quite as good but they still generate substantial fee income ~2 of every credit non pin debit transaction goes to the bank and credit card network credit histories exist because they are the most effective tool available to predict whether you will pay back your loans or not you do n't need a credit history to buy most things you need a credit history to get a large loan think of it from perspective of a lender credit scoring is the bank 's way screening out people who are expensive to do business with it 's objective does n't discriminate on the basis of race sex or other factors and you have recourse if the rating agencies have incorrect information

interest rates are market driven they tend to be based on the prime rate set by the federal reserve bank because of the tremendous lending capacity of that institution and that other loan originators will often fund their own lending at least in part with fed loans however there is no mandatory link between the federal reserve rate and the market rate no law stipulates that rates can not rise or fall they will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital though a lender asking 10 interest might make no loans when others are willing to lend for 9 the only protection you have is that we are mostly economically free as a borrower you are protected by the fact that there are many lenders likewise as a lender because there are many borrowers stability is simply by virtue of the fact that one market participant with inordinate pricing will find fewer counterparties to transact

the usual rule of thumb is that you should start considering refinance when you can lower the effective interest rate by 1 or more if you 're now paying 4.7 this would mean you should be looking for loans at 3.7 or better to find something that 's really worth considering one exception is if the bank is willing to do an in place refinance with no closing costs and no points sometimes banks will offer this as a way of retaining customers who would otherwise be tempted to refinance elsewhere you should still shop around before accepting this kind of offer to make sure it really is your best option most banks offer calculators on their websites that will let you compare your current mortgage to a hypothetical new one feed the numbers in and it can tell you what the difference in payment size will be how long you need to keep the house before the savings have paid for the closing costs and what the actual savings will be if you sell the house in any given year or total savings if you do n't sell until after the mortgage is paid off remember that in addition to closing costs there are amortization effects in the early stages of a standard mortgage your money is mostly paying interest the amount paying down the principal increases over the life of the loan that 's another of the reasons you need to run the calculator refinancing resets that clock

what is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high even extreme nobody paid them reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before you could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss my dad on the advice of an irs tax auditor built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers but it was intended to never make any money it 's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability   these tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters so what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations these corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it which could then be claimed as a loss but if these spread between bank interest cds paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar this was the trigger to the boom bust when the feds raised lowered the interest rates and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time they would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings people could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted even to zero it just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations   when reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight they went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money i know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day of course he has never really financially recovered either      the point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to reagan 34 tax was way more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to reagan

you could but the bank wo n't let you if you 're a sole proprietor then you could probably open a personal account and just use it and never tell them that is actually a business however depending on your volume of operations they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions for corporations you can not use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds also you 're generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection which is why you have the corporation to begin with generally business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts and it costs more for the banks to run them in the us some banks offer free or very low cost business accounts for small businesses that do n't need too many transactions i 'm sure if you shop around you 'll find those in canada as well

gt;if a road is not profitable it wo n't be built right so all of those roads in the country that go up mountains that i love to travel on wo n't exist   if enough people want it and are willing to pay to use it it will be built if not why should i subsidize your hobby with my tax dollars   gt;these corporations have the right to decide who gets to use the roads right you 're all about the free market but what if the guy who owns the road to my house up the price or does a crappy job maintaining it i just have to move   yes although i would argue that basic infrastructure such as roads should have some level of price control not a completely free market but still better than what we have now   gt;it will also be for profit which means it will cost more you 're willing to pay more to use a road because it 's your choice as opposed to less for that road because someone made you pay for it as in it will have to continue to turn a profit even after it 's been paid for   not necessarily true if private corporations can be more efficient than government it does n't have to cost more

anybody can contribute to a traditional ira up to the maximum limit   does it make sense to contribute to a non deductible ira   there are a couple of cases where it does   if you 're 59 1/2 or older you 're old enough to make ira withdrawals without penalty if you choose investments that maximize the value of tax deferral you can use the nondeductible ira to manage your tax burden if you 're aware of an upcoming change in tax law that will benefit high earning individuals it might be beneficial to use a nondeductible ira for example you know that income limits for converting a traditional to a roth are going to change in the coming year you set up a nondeductible ira with the intention of converting it the next year so you can get around roth contribution rules   beyond these cases the main argument for contributing to a non deductible ira is compounded returns if your ira has a strong steady growth rate compounded returns can work wonders for your contributions let 's take a hypothetical you are 35 you contribute the max amount of $ 5,500 every year until you retire at 70 with a modest growth rate of 9.5 your total contribution of k would become the compounded returns are 7.6 times your contributions

no the above calculation does not hold good when financial statements are prepared they are prepared on a going concern basis i.e. a business will run normally in the foreseeable future valuation of assets and liabilities is done according to this principle when a bankruptcy takes places or a business closes down immediately the valuation method will change for assets the value will be more relevant for example if you hold 100 computers in an normal situation they will depreciated at the normal rate every year some portion of the cost is written off as depreciation when you actually go to sell these computers you are likely to realize much less than what is shown in the statement similarly for a building the actual value may be more for liabilities they tend to increase in such situation hence just a plain computation can give you a very broad idea but the actual figure may be different

this is exactly how monopolies are made   allowing a business to use one extremely profitable business to undercut competitors in other areas at below cost mind you   this should be illegal practice   google should be hit hard   while i understand your stance i do n't believe it is creating an equal playing field in the economy and it is hurting it badly    for example no startup out there is going to create an online maps startup even if they have an awesome idea that would make maps better because they do n't have the ability to monetize and survive   google gives their 's away free using their near monopoly on online advertising to subsidize it   you talk about the only exit for a startup being acquired by a larger company   that is exactly the problem   you 're creating unbeatable   google msft apple fb will only grow startups will only have 10 20 companies to exit to   they should be able to survive and grow and compete on their own    groupon was a company that tried to do that and you can see how they 're doing   the tech world is turning into that very oligopoly that you try to caveat    people just do n't realize it     we should break the stranglehold   if people paid for services then their would be more entrants into the market as they could monetize quicker and the best ideas would win vs. the best connections to vcs and having an entrepreneurial track history which is how the bay area works   startups would n't be so dependent on financiers they could monetize their actual client base

so i did some queries on google scholar and the term of art academics seem to use is target date fund i notice divided opinions among academics on the matter w. gave a nice set of citations of papers with which he disagrees so i 'll start with them in 1969 paul published the paper lifetime portfolio selection by dynamic programming which found that there 's no mathematical foundation for an age based risk tolerance there seems to be a fundamental quibble relating to present value of future wages if they are stable and uncorrelated with the market one analysis suggests the optimal lifecycle investment should start at roughly 300 percent of your portfolio in stocks via crazy borrowing other people point out that if your wages are correlated with stock returns allocations to stock as low as 20 percent might be optimal so theory is n't helping much perhaps with the advent of computers we can find some kind of empirical data robert shiller authored a study on lifecycle funds when they were proposed for personal social security accounts lifecycle strategies fare poorly in his historical simulation moreover with these life cycle portfolios relatively little is contributed when the allocation to stocks is high since earnings are relatively low in the younger years workers contribute only a little to stocks and do not enjoy a strong effect of    compounding since the proceeds of the early investments are taken out of the stock    market as time goes on and drew follow up on that assertion with a set of lifecycle strategies and their contrarian counterparts whereas a the lifecycle plan starts high stock exposure and trails off near retirement the contrarian ones will invest in bonds and cash early in life and move to stocks after a few years they show that contrarian strategies have higher average returns even at the low 25th percentile of returns it 's only at the bottom 5 or 10 percent where this is reversed one problem with these empirical studies is isolating the effect of the glide path from rebalancing it could be that a simple fixed allocation works plenty fine and that selling winners and doubling down on losers is the fundamental driver of returns and compare lifecycle strategy with a number of fixed asset allocation schemes in monte carlo simulations and conclude that a 70 equity 30 long term corp bonds does as well as all of the lifecycle funds finally the earlier w paper offers a monte carlo simulation similar to and and runs final portfolio values through a utility function designed to calculate diminishing returns to more money this seems like a good point as the risk of your portfolio is n't all or nothing but your first dollar is more valuable than your finds that for some risk aversion coefficients offer greater utility than portfolios with fixed allocations and does note that applying their strategies to the historical record makes a strong recommendation for 100 percent stocks in all but 5 years from 1940 2011 so maybe the best retirement allocation is good old low cost s&p index funds

i do n't think it has to be either or you can profitably invest inside the simple though i would n't put in any more than the 1 it takes to get the match let 's look at some scenarios these assume salary of $ 50k year so the numbers are easy you can fill in your own numbers to see the outcome but the percentages will be the same let it sit in cash in the simple you put in 1 your employer matches with 1 your account balance is $ 1,000 at the end of the year plus a small amount of interest cost to you is $ 500 from your gross pay 100 return on your contributions yay likely 0 1 real returns going forward you 'll be lucky to keep up with inflation over the long term short term not so bad buy shares of index etfs in the simple let 's assume the fee works out to 10 you put in 1 employer matches 1 your contributions are $ 500 fees are $ 100 your balance is $ 900 in etfs 80 instant return and possible 6 7 real long term returns going forward buy funds in the simple assume the load is 5 management fee is 1 and you can find something that behaves like an index fund so it is theoretically comparable to above 1 from you 1 from employer your contributions are $ 500 load fees are $ 50 your balance is $ 950 90 instant return and possible 5 6 real long term returns going forward assuming the 6 7 real returns of equities are reduced by the 1 management fee you did n't list out the fees and they 're probably different for the different fund choices so fill in your own details and do the math invest outside the simple in the same etfs or equivalent no load index funds let 's assume you can do this with no fees you put in the same 1 of your gross ignoring any difference that might come from paying fica into a self directed traditional ira at the end of the year the balance is $ 500 so deciding whether or not to take the match is a no brainer take it deciding whether you should hold cash etfs or one of two types of funds in your simple is a little trickier

congratulations on starting your own business invest in a tax software package right away i ca n't recommend a specific one but there is enough information out there to point you in the right direction share with us which one you ended up using and why maybe a separate question you do need to make your fica taxes but you can write off the se part of it keep all your filings as a pdf a printout and a in the native format of the tax software package it really helps the next tax season when you begin your business most of the expenses are going to be straightforward it was for me and while i had the option of doing it by hand i used software to do it myself at the beginning it might actually seem harder to use the tax software package but it will pay off in the end build relationships with a few tax advisors and attorneys you will need to buy liability insurance soon if you are in any kind of serious non hobby business and accounting for these are no trivial tasks if you have not filed yet i recommend you do this file an extension overpay your estimated taxes you can always collect a refund later and file your return once you have had a cpa look over it do not on a cpa it 's just the cost of running your business and you do n't want to waste your time reading the irs manuals when you could be growing your own business best of luck and come back to tell us what you did

i work at a bank if a private company that we 've never heard of wants a loan we will be more hesitant than if it were a public household name covered by equity research analysts requires more due diligence on our part if they get s&amp;p or moody 's ratings that makes us more comfortable the company wants the loan more than we want to lend to them so in my mind they should be the one paying for it   i agree that this creates a conflict of interest and recognize that conflict when using the research

as a legal contract a mortgage is a form of secured debt in the case of a mortgage the debt is secured using the property asset as collateral so no there is no such thing as a mortgage contract without a property to act as collateral is it a good idea   in the current low interest rate environment people with good income and credit can obtain a from their bank at a rate comparable to current mortgage rates   however if you wish to setup a credit line for an amount comparable to a mortgage then you will need to secure it with some form of collateral

interesting thing is not all of this analysis is typically done by the person you are speaking with re your mortgage   likely there is an economic team at some institution or another as many many loans are sold distributed in some fashion finance team and all of them are looking at various rates etc   typically what is offered is matching an offsetting liability somewhere else   so there may be cases where the spread someone is looking to pick up might be tighter or looser within institutions or types of institutions vs others even though the overall market is at one place   e.g. banks vs. insurance companies     so you may have negotiating room at a certain term but not another or the reverse at another firm   one firm might have lots of 10 year money while another might be limited so will be picky in what they choose   either more conservative loan terms ltv or a higher spread for example   so many things go into the ultimate rate someone can get but in theory the blog did a decent job

first off some companies do something like this   microsoft for example was well known for consistently hitting earnings estimates every quarter nearly never missed them and most of the time did n't exceed by much either   in order to do this and not be prosecuted for accounting fraud you typically have to be a service or good company like microsoft used to be where you can manipulate the amount of product on hand and move costs fairly easily from one quarter to the next   a company like say home depot or caterpillar both of which have tangible goods they 're either or producing has less flexibility there although they will still try to move profits around to match earnings estimates more closely however you have to be consistently doing well to be able to do this   you ca n't manufacture additional total revenue so if you have one down quarter you have to either have moved some revenue into it from the previous quarter or you have to be able to move some into it from the next quarter   that obviously does n't work consistently unless you 're a fast growing company or have an extremely stable base   it 's also hard to do this in a legal seeming fashion technically this sort of manipulation is illegal so decisions have to be justifiable   companies like microsoft that are expanding can also do things to encourage slightly lower expectations   a company in need of a stock price bump issues press releases touting its inventions and products as amazing things that will drive profits through the roof and an aggressive profit forecast just as easy to issue a press release with a conservative forecast meaning the bar will be lower to hit    it 's also not really necessary to manipulate earnings to have a consistently well performing stock   this article for example shows that companies who miss earnings estimates do n't really suffer much when controlling for their actual earnings changes of course in the long run   your price might drop a bit but if your company is otherwise sound it will recover finally companies do sometimes come out with information ahead of earnings that cause expectations to be lowered   for example just lowered its earnings expectations due to various reasons   some companies choose to do this in order to dilute the effect on the market   i 'm not sure if this is ever required but it seems to me that some companies are much quicker to restate earnings expectations than others

there are many reasons for buying new versus used vehicles price is not the only factor   this is an individual decision although interesting to examine from a macro perspective each vehicle purchase is made by an individual weighing many factors that vary in importance by that individual based upon their specific needs and values i have purchased both new and used cars and i have weighted each of these factors as part of each decision and the relative weightings have varied based upon my individual situation read freakonomics to gain a better understanding of the reasons why you can not find a good used car the summary is the imbalance of knowledge between the buyer and seller and the lack of trust although much of economics assumes perfect market information margin profit comes from uncertainty or an imbalance of knowledge   buying a used car requires a certain amount of faith in people and you can not always trust the trading partner to be honest price the price or more precisely the value proposition of the vehicle is a large concern for many of us larger than we might prefer that it be selection a buyer has the largest selection of vehicles when they shop for a new vehicle finding the color features and upgrades that you want on your vehicle can be much harder even impossible for the used buyer and once you have found the exact vehicle you want now you have to determine whether the vehicle has problems and can be purchased at your price preference a buyer may simply prefer to have a vehicle that looks new smells new is clean and does not have all the that even a gently used vehicle would exhibit this may include issues of pride image and status where the buyer may have strong emotional or psychological needs to through ownership of a particular vehicle with particular features reviews new vehicles have mountains of information available to buyers who can read about safety and reliability ratings learn about problems from the trade press and even price shop and compare between brands and models contrasted with the minimal information available to used vehicle shoppers unbalanced knowledge the seller of a used car has much greater knowledge of the vehicle and thus much greater power in the negotiation process buying a used car is going to cost you more money than the value of the car unless the seller has poor knowledge of the market and since many used cars are sold by dealers who have often taken advantage of the less knowledgeable sellers in their transaction you are unlikely to purchase the vehicle at a good price fear risk many people want transportation and buying a used car comes with risk and that risk includes both the direct cost of repairs and the inconvenience of both the repair and the loss of work that problems knowing that the car has not been abused that there are no hidden or problems waiting to leave you stranded is valuable placing a price on the risk of a used car is hard especially for those who only want a reliable vehicle to drive placing an estimate on the risk cost of a used car is one area where the seller has a distinct advantage warranties new vehicles come with substantial warranties and this is another aspect of the fear risk point above a new vehicle does not have unknown risk associated with the purchase and also comes with peace of mind through a manufacturer warranty you can purchase a used car warranty but they are expensive and often come with different problems finance terms a buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle and you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs own versus rent you are assuming that people actually want to own their cars and i would suggest that people want to own their car until it begins to present problems repair and maintenance issues and then they want a new vehicle to replace it but renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive and less flexible means to obtain transportation expense allocation a vehicle is an expense as the owner of a vehicle you are willing to pay for that expense to fill your need for transportation paying for the product as you use the product makes sense and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle capital allocation a buyer may need a vehicle either to commute to work school doctor or for work or business but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts credit cards loans the buyer may not have savings but be able to obtain financing to solve that need remember people need transportation and they are willing to pay to fill their need but they also have varying needs for all of the above factors and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals

there are two types of insurance which causes some confusion social security disability insurance which you indicate you have is insurance you can receive benefit from if you earn enough work credits payroll taxes prior to your disability onset it is not a needs based program supplemental security income is a need based program which does not consider your work history to qualify for this your total assets need to be lower than some threshold and your family income also below some threshold if you inherit a home or money i doubt this would jeopardize your ssdi qualification since your qualification was based on a disabling condition and work history if you inherit an income property which you manage i.e. you become a landlord this may jeopardize your claim that you are unable to work even if you are not making an income as the landlord but the work your are performing is deemed to have some value this too could jeopardize your claim all of this can be very complicated and there are some excellent references on the web including ssa website and some other related websites finally if you become able to work while on ssdi your benefit may will end depending on the level of work you are able to perform but just because you are able to work again does not mean you need to repay past benefits received assuming your condition has not been falsified your local social security office or the social security main office both offer telephone support and can also answer questions regarding your concern here are a couple relevant links

in the united states short term capital gains are taxed at rates similar to regular income which is 25 if you make less than $ and 28 if you make more than that but less than $ 190,000 if you make more than $ 190,000 then the rate is 33 if you hold the stock for a year or more than the tax rate is 15 unless your income is less than $ in which case there is no tax on long term gains as a general rule the way to make money is to stay out of debt so i can not advise you to assume a mortgage financially you are better off investing your money much like you i bought a house with a mortgage using about $ 30,000 in a down payment about 20 years ago and i paid it off a few years ago if i had to do it over again i would have bought a shack a steel building for $ 30,000 and lived in that and invested my income if i had done that i would be about $ 500,000 richer today than i am now

is it not that bad depends how bad is bad the problems causes by a government having large debt are similar to those caused by an individual having large debt the big issue is more and more of your income goes to paying interest on the debt and is thus not available for spending on goods and services if it gets bad enough you find you can not make payments you start defaulting on loans and then you have to make serious sacrifices like selling your property to pay the debt nations have an advantage over individuals in that they can sometimes debt i.e. simply declare that they are not going to pay lenders can then refuse to give them more money but that does n't get their original loans paid back in theory other nations could send in troops to seize property to pay the loan but this is a very extreme solution totally aside from any moral considerations modern warfare is very expensive it 's likely the war would cost you more than you 'd recover on the debt how much debt is too much it 's hard to give a number any more than one could give a maximum acceptable debt for an individual american banks have a rule of thumb that they wo n't normally loan you money if your total debt payments would be more than 1/3 of your income i 've never come close to that that seems awfully high to me but say a young person just starting out so he 's not making a lot of money and he lives someplace with high housing prices might find this painful but acceptable etc

for those who do n't know credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you   when you fill them out and spend them you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account   you should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions that having been said when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds   they want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored   if your teller does n't know the answer to that question you 'll need to find someone at the bank who does   if you do n't like the answer they give you you 'll need to find another bank i would think that if the credit card is from chase and you are trying to deposit a credit card check into a chase checking account they should be able to do that instantly   however bank policy does n't always make sense

i do n't have a reference but i think it depends on when you entered the workforce if you finished school at age 24 your primary goals are to pay down expensive debt and to save up enough for a down payment   so essentially not much   maybe $ 5k to $ 10k at the most on the other hand if you entered the workforce at age 20 with no debts and no significant expenses it should have been easy to sock away 20 of your income for 6 years so $ 40k to $ 50k would be reasonable the difference is that the first person 's income earning potential should be higher so eventually they 'd be able to make up the difference and pass them

in addition to the excellent answers here i might suggest a reason for investing in leveraged funds and the original purpose for their existence   lets say you run a mutual fund that is supposed to track the performance of the s&p 500    if you have cash inflows and outflows from your fund due to people investing and selling shares of your fund you may have periods where not all funds are invested appropriately because some of the funds are in cash   lets say 98 of your funds are invested in the securities that reflect the stocks in the s&p 500   you will will miss matching the s&p 500 because you have 2 not invested in some money market account    if you take 1/3 of the cash balance and invest in a triple leveraged fund or take 1/2 of the funds and invest in a double leveraged fund you will more accurately track the index to which your fund is supposed to track   i am not sure what percentage mutual fund owners keep in cash but this is one use that i know these etfs are used for the difference over time that compounding effects have on leveraged funds is called beta slippage there are many fine articles explaining it at you can find one located at this link

i had a debt collector call on a bill that was sent to collections because of a clerical error   instead of negotiating with the debt collector i called the company that originally owned the debt they allowed me to pay my bill without any late fees 6 months later and they gave me a receipt to furnish to the debt collectors i 'm sure the debt collectors got a refund for the purchase of my debt if your desire is to pay the debt then you could still call the owner of the debt and see it they wish to work with you to get the debt paid   any contact with the original creditor will affect your legal rights with respect to collection and statutes of limitation so you should be sure you want to pay the debt back in full before you take such a step

if you are using software like quickbooks or even just using spreadsheets or tracking this without software use two equity accounts something like capital contributions and capital distributions when you write a personal check to the company the money goes into the company 's checking account and also increases the capital contribution account in accordance with double entry accounting practices when the company has enough retained earnings to pay you back you use the capital distributions equity account and just write yourself a check you can also make general journal entries every year to zero out or balance your two capital accounts with retained earnings which i think is an automatically generated equity account in quickbooks if this sounds too complex you could also just use a single capital contributions and distributions equity account for your contributions and distributions

as you probably know a credit spread involves buying a call or put at one strike and selling another call or put at another with the same maturity so you 're dealing with two orders your broker will likely have to fill this order themselves meaning that they 'll have to look at the existing bid asks for the different strikes and wait until the difference matches or exceeds your limit order   obviously they ca n't place limit orders on the legs individually since they ca n't guarantee that they will both be executed   they also do n't care what the individual prices are they just care what the difference is   it 's possible that they have computer systems that examine existing bids and asks that would fill your order but it 's still done by the broker not the exchange   the exchange never sees your actual limit order they will just see the market orders placed by your broker

from the etoro website in the financial trading industry rollover is the interest paid or earned for holding currency overnight each currency has an interest rate associated with it and because currencies are traded in pairs every trade involves two different interest rates if the interest rate on the currency you bought is lower than the interest rate on the currency you sold then you will pay rollover fees if the interest rate on the currency you bought is higher than the interest rate of the currency commodity you sold then you will earn rollover fees

a 25 variance in price in most markets is n't so crazy as to require it be some sort of terrible scam but that does n't mean much else it could be the inclusion of floor plans that are carefully designed to add square footage at minimum cost and thus reduce the average cost per square foot without actually being cheaper otherwise less insulation thinner walls cheap piping minimized wiring or they are just efficient and competitive as you pointed out they do n't have gas so that 's certainly one way you know they cut costs no gas lines to install as the article from cost of constructing a home points out though what this figure includes can vary does it include the finished lot if so then a smaller lot would mean lower square footage building price because the land is smaller and cheaper not the house   is any kind of financing quoted in the price compare also change plan costs any penalties for delays in construction grade of materials floor plans customization costs fees or premiums to pick colors floors counters cabinets fixtures and so on what about central cooling and heating are they quoting an electric furnace how does electrical heating in your area compare to the cost of gas heat relative pricing of electric and gas vary widely by region and climate in short often square footage price is n't the whole story of what it would cost to construct a home ensure you are comparing everything that 's important to you and you are getting a full quote not comparing small isolate sales pitch figures with no clear details if it turns out the price is 25 lower than other builders in your area and they give you what you are wanting and you have the good sense to have a qualified home inspector and/or structural engineer inspect the home thoroughly before you take possession then you might just have found a good builder i 'd encourage you to personally visit some of their past construction work such as houses they build 2 10 years ago and ensure they are in the sort of condition you 'd expect

this is a bit of an open ended answer as certain assumptions must be covered hope it helps though my concern is that you have 1 year of university left is there a chance that this money will be needed to fund this year of uni and might it be needed for the period between uni and starting your first job if the answer is yes to either of these keep any money you have as liquid as possible ie cash in an instant access cash isa if the answer is no let 's move on are you likely to touch this money in the next 5 years i 'm thinking house flat deposits whether you rent or buy cars etc etc if yes again keep it liquid in a cash isa but this time perhaps look to get a slightly better interest rate by fixing for a 1 year or 2 year at a time something like will show you best buy cash isas if this money is not going to be touched for more than 5 years then things like bonds and equities come into play ultimately your appetite for risk determines your options if you are uncomfortable with swings in value then fixed income products with fixed term ie buy a bond hold the bond when the bond finishes you get your money back plus the yield interest may suit you better than equity based investments equity based means alot of things stocks in just one company an index tracker of a well known stock market eg tracker actively managed growth funds passive etfs of high dividend stocks and each of these has different volatility price swings and long term performance as well as different charges and risks the only way to understand this is to learn so that 's my ultimate advice learn about bonds learn about equities learn about gilts corporate bonds bond funds index trackers etfs dividends active v passive management in the meantime keep the money in a cash isa where £ 1 stays £ 1 plus interest once you want to lock the money away into a long term investment then you can look at stocks isas to protect the investment against taxation you may also put just enough into a pension get the company match for contributions it 's not uncommon to split your long term saving between the two routes then come back and ask where to go next but chances are you 'll know yourself by then because you self educated if you want an alternative to the us based generic advice check out my simple steps concept here and my free posts on this framework at i also host a free weekly podcast at also on itunes and others they were designed to offer exactly that kind of guidance to the uk for free

buyouts are usually for more than the original value of a stock that 's because the price premium represents an incentive for holders to tender their shares to the would be buyer sometimes in these situations the stock price rises above the proposed buyout price in anticipation of a higher takeover bid from a second party that may or may not materialize to answer the other part of the question does a bidder have a chance of taking over a dying company for less than the market price that is a strategy sometimes referred to as a take under and it has not been a notably successful strategy that 's because it goes against human nature of the seller where there is life there is hope they would seldom accept a lower price for sure survival when the market is telling them that they are worth a higher price very few people realize that the market may disappear tomorrow think of all the homeowners who wo n't cut their price but insist on bids that meet recent comps and if the company is really dying the prospective buyer may be best served by waiting until it does and then pick up the individual pieces at auction

i really like value investing by bruce it 's not a textbook so you can probably pick it up for about $ 20 while it is dense i think with some patience you might be able to understand it at the undergrad level the process outlined in the vi book is very different from the conventional corp finance way of valuing a company   a typical corp finance model would probably have you model cash flows 5 or 10 years out and then assume some sort of terminal growth the vi book argues that it 's nearly impossible to predict things that far out accurately so build your valuation on what we know start with the balance sheet then look at this year 's earnings is that sustainable   this is a simplification of course but i describe it only so you can get the idea i think it 's definitely a worthwhile read

i started with lending club about a year ago   i love it   it has been insightful   off topic but i am in a loan to a guy who make 120 k a year and is regularly late and has a pretty high interest rate   crazy you gain some economies of scale by going with a bigger note   i have $ 100 notes that i get hit for 2 or 3 cents for a fee where $ 25 notes are always a penny   however i do n't think that should be your deciding factor i scale my note purchases based on how much i like the status of the borrower   for example i did $ 100 which is currently my max for a guy with a reasonable loan amount 16 k a stable work history 15 + years a great credit history and a great interest rate   if one of those things were a bit out of whack   i might go $ 50 two $ 25    i prefer 36 month notes really 5 years to get out of debt   it is unlikely to happen imho keep in mind that if you invest $ 100 in a loan then you get one $ 100 note   you ca n't break them up into 4 $ 25 notes   for that reason if you are likely to want to sell the note prematurely keep it at $ 25   the market is greater    i 've had a lot of success using the trading account buying further discounted notes for people who want out of lending club or get spooked by a couple of late payments and a change in billing date    another advantage of using the trading account is you start earning interest day 1   i 've had new notes take a couple of weeks to go through    to summarize there are some other things but that is the main stuff i look at

like joetaxpayer said i do n't know of any difference between the backdoor and a regular roth ira contribution besides the issue with existing pre tax ira money so if it is your practice to contribute at the beginning of the year good for you most people wait until the last minute then doing a backdoor seems like the safe choice some people have speculated that hypothetically the irs could use the step transaction doctrine to treat it as a single direct contribution to a roth ira which then would be disallowed and cause you a penalty until you take it out but i have never heard of this happening to anyone as for the paperwork you just need to fill out one extra form at tax time form 8606 you need to complete two parts of it one for the non deductible contribution and one for the conversion it is pretty straightforward although i 've found that it is a pain to do it in tax software another option would be for you to contribute to a roth ira now but when you discover that you 're over the limit at the end of the year re characterize it as a traditional contribution and then convert it back to roth but this way is not good because then there is a long time between the traditional contribution and the roth conversion and earnings during this time will be taxed at conversion

unanticipated unemployment is usually the triggering factor for drawing on an emergency fund ask yourself what happens if i lose my job tomorrow or my spouse becomes unemployed what happens if i become disabled and ca n't work for x amount of time sure you can discount your chances of needing such a fund if you have free health care but having health insurance does n't change the fact that an emergency fund is a good idea there are many ways to go broke

gold has value because for the most of the history of mankind 's use of money gold and silver have repeatedly been chosen by free markets as the best form of money gold is durable portable homogeneous fungible divisible rare and recognizable    until 1971 most of the world 's currencies were backed by gold   in 1971 the us government defaulted on its obligation to redeem us dollars by which most other currencies were backed in gold as agreed to by the bretton woods agreement of 1944   we did n't choose to go off the gold standard we had no choice foreign central banks were demanding in gold and the us did n't have enough we inflated too much    i think that the current swell of interest in gold is due to the recent massive increase in the federal reserve 's balance sheet plus the fast growing national debt plus a looming social security medicare crisis   people are looking for protection of their savings and they wish to opt out of the government bail outs government deficits government run health care and government money printing   they are looking for a currency that does n't have a counter party gold is money and nothing else jp morgan in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value if there were the government would have to make its holding illegal as was done in the case of gold if everyone decided for example to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods the financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves this is the shabby secret of the welfare statists against gold deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth gold stands in the way of this insidious process it stands as a protector of property rights if one this one has no difficulty in understanding the statists toward the gold standard alan greenspan

the art of short selling by stanley providers for many case studies about what kind of opportunities to look for from a fundamental analysis perspective typically things you can look for are financing terms that are not very favorable expensive interest payments as well as other on cash flow arbitrary decisions by management poor management and dilution that does n't make sense usually another product of poor management from a quantitative analysis perspective you can gain insight by looking at the credit default swap rate history if the company is listed in that market the things that affect a cds spread are different than what immediately affects share prices some market participants trade over credit default swaps when they are betting on a company 's insolvency but looking at large trades in the options market is n't indicative of anything on its own but you can use that information to help confirm your opinion you can certainly jump on a trend using bad headlines but typically by the time it is headline news the majority of the downward move in the share price has already happened or the stock opened lower because the news came outside of market hours you have to factor in the short interest of the company if the short interest is high then it will be very easy to squeeze the shorts resulting in a rally of share prices the opposite of what you want a short squeeze does n't change the fundamental or quantitative reasons you wanted to short the technical analysis should only be used to help you decide your entry and exit price ranges amongst an otherwise random walk the technical rules you created sound like something a very basic program or stock screener might be able to follow but it does n't tell you anything you will have to do research in the company 's public filings yourself

for starters if you 're not making any money doing something it 's a hobby it sounds like you want to work for the current owners making them money as a hobby if that floats your boat go crazy    show enough motivation and they may offer to sell you the business for $ 1 or some other surprisingly low dollar figure this will seem like a gift worth dropping out of school for but be extremely careful before getting excited    odds are when you take over the business you end up assuming their debts too mortgages rent payments back payroll equipment loans leases and possibly any back late payments from before your takeover     use your first few weeks as an academic study for a school project get a copy of their books find out where the consistent money is and see how to grow that they may be selling games at a loss because their crowd consistently buys enough beer to cover expenses or maybe the money from that stupid crane game covers the electric bill for the whole place because bill has a problem    learn study and ask more for information as payment than cash the only way it make real money is to actually take over ownership of the place so take the long view and build toward that instead of a salaried manager gig or something

based on my experience with which is a development platform for automated trading strategies and therefore can be easily be used for backtesting your personal strategy i can give a little insight into what you might look for in such a platform   is a coding environment which reads data feeds from a variety of sources more on that in the second point and runs the code for your strategy on that data and gives you the results the data could be imported from a live data feed or from historical data either through numerous api 's csv excel etc you can write your own strategies using the custom c libraries included with the software which spares you from implementing your own code for technical indicators basic statistical functions etc getting the data is another issue you could use joe 's strategy and calculate option prices yourself although you need to exercise caution when doing this to test a strategy however there is no substitute for backtesting a strategy on real data markets change over time and depending on how far back you 're interested in testing your strategy you may run into problems the reason there is no substitute for using real data is that attempting to replicate the data may fail in some circumstances and you need a method of verifying that the data you 're generating is correct and realistic calculating a few values comparing them to the real values and accordingly is a good idea but you have to decide for yourself how many checks you want to do more is better but it may not be enough to realistically test your strategy disclaimer lest you interpret my post as a shameless plug for the platform i 'll state that i found the interface awful it looked vaguely like office 2000 but ten years too late and the documentation woefully incomplete i last used the software in 2010 so it may have improved in the intervening years but your mileage may vary i only use it as an example to give some insight into what you might look for in a backtesting platform when you actually begin trading a different platform is likely in order   that being said it responded fairly quickly and the learning curve was n't too steep the platform was n't too expensive at the time about $ 700 for a license with no data feeds i think but i was happy that the cost was n't coming out of my pocket it 's only gotten more expensive and i 'm not sure it 's worth it

this is referred to as an hsa mistaken distribution an hsa mistaken distribution occurs when you take a distribution and later find out that it is not for a qualified medical expense   for example this could occur if you accidentally pay for a restaurant dinner with your hsa debit card   it can also occur if you take a distribution to pay for a medical expense but then are later reimbursed by insurance this is discussed in the instructions for irs forms 1099-sa and   note these forms are submitted by the hsa bank not the consumer so the instructions are addressed to them hsa mistaken distributions    if amounts were distributed during the year from an hsa because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable cause the account beneficiary may repay the mistaken distribution no later than april 15 following the first year the account beneficiary knew or should have known the distribution was a mistake for example the account beneficiary reasonably but mistakenly believed that an expense was a qualified medical expense and was reimbursed for that expense from the hsa the account beneficiary then repays the mistaken distribution to the hsa   you have until april 15 in the year following the refund to repay the hsa and avoid the extra tax and penalty that should be paid if you were to keep the distribution that was not ultimately used for medical expenses   when you send the money to the hsa bank you need to explicitly tell them that it is a mistaken distribution repayment so that they can report it to the irs correctly and it will not affect your contribution limits

the reason that stock buybacks are not considered insider trading is because the offers are open to all on equal terms to everyone outside the company even if the company knows inside information it 's not supposed to tell it and company executives are not allowed to tender shares unless they had previously set up a blind selling program on if that 's actually the case no one investor is better informed than another and hence there is no insider trading the issue of inside trading is that insiders are better informed

with any institution or organization you 're always going to have top middle and bottom performers i do n't think we should select prospective employees based on schools or brands but the world is a vast place and having those things like brands as markers or indicators serves as a practical heuristic for recruiters however many of my past colleagues from non top brand institutions are just as smart and capable the idea is that the more selective the educational institution the more likely it is to filter for top candidates who can then be fed into companies down the road but the reality is that the filter is very narrow due to class size and school size so a lot of equally qualified candidates also get filtered out of the school because of marginal differences or sometimes just random luck therefore these incredible students end up attending their next top choice that 's the reason we should n't only hire from top schools more talented people overflow to other schools    as a side note malcolm gladwell is like the myth tv show but for books entertaining but ultimately flawed in several ways that he analyzes statistics and data    source hbs mba class of 2015 currently interning at amazon for summer will provide proof if required

note that to keep an investor from lowering their tax bill is not an explanation well yes it is in fact   it is the only explanation the rule plainly exists to prevent someone from realizing a loss when their economic situation remains unchanged before after a sale now you might say but i have suffered a loss even if it is unrealized but would you want to pay tax on unrealized gains the tax system still caters to reducing the tax impact of investments particularly capital investments part and parcel with the system of taxing gains only when realized is that you can recognize losses only when realized are there other ways to artificially reduce taxable income yes but the goal of a good tax system should be to reduce those opportunities whether you agree that it is fair for the government to prevent this tax saving opportunity when others exist is another question but that is why the rule exists

having recently been given basically the same question it hinges on a few major factors what does your apartment provide e.g. heating internet etc my personal example with my numbers which includes taxes insurance estimates minor repairs to home as needed also ignoring all costs that are shared e.g. food internet car insurance etc i am only making a difference around $ 450 per month in 5 years i would save $ 450 12 5 $ 27,000 however i also have to pay costs for buying the house transfer deed fees home inspections etc which in my case cost around $ 3000 not to mention selling a home has some costs i think around $ 1500 + in my area as well as the taking a cut which i also think is around 2.5 = $ so we can probably estimate you would lose around $ 15000 at most buying and selling the home when all final costs come in which means in my case i would at most be saving around $ 12,000 probably less assuming i did not miss anything so basically 5 = $ 200 per month saved tldr i do n't think its worthwhile because there is a lot of risks involved and houses tend to require a lot of extra work money with apartments you have little no risk and can freely leave at the end

i would not suggest closing out your roth ira couple of reasons for that 1 since you 've been contributing to it for 15 years your investments have probably grown seen dividends etc   if you close it out you will owe taxes and be slapped with a 10 penalty on the growth money you did n't contribute   that 's quite a waste of hard earned money    2 while your income may exceed the contribution limit of a roth you could do what 's called a backdoor roth which is really just converting your after tax contributions into an ira into a roth ira 3 given the length of your contributions your roth ira is seasoned 5 years this allows you to use up to 10k for your house if you chose   usually not an option people use other than that consider paying off the student loans with the highest interest first

the biggest issue i can see is that in order to have your parents protected properly they 'll have to register an interest in the property ie the 25 i ca n't see the mortgage lender being too happy to have a second lienholder on the house for a total of 100 of the purchase price usually their conditions state that they 'll need to be informed of other debts secured on the house and might actually have a say in that another way of accomplishing this is putting your parents on the house 's deeds but that might also complicate matters with the lender and cause additional problems when it comes to selling the property not to mention that if anything bad happens to your parents their stake in your property would be counted as one of their assets and you might find yourself in the situation where you have to come up with 25 of the property value right now or you might find that you have to sell the property to the first bidder simply because you do need the money as quickly as possible personally i would n't do it especially without legal advice the legal structure can be a nightmare and you 'll just end up painted into a corner

the biggest concern is how you get $ 250,000 in unsecured credit it 's unlikely that you will be loaned that amount at a percentage lower than what you expect to earn unsecured credit lines are rarely lower than 10 and usually approach 20 on top of that for a bank to approve you for that credit line you have to have a high credit score and an income to support the payments on that credit line but lets suspend disbelief and assume that you can get the money you want on loan you would then be expected to pay back that 10 but investments do n't go up uniformly some years they go up 15 20 and other years they go down 10 what do you do if you have to sell some of your investments in a down year that money is no longer invested and you ca n't recover it with the following up year because you had to take too much out to cover the loan payments you 'll be out of money long before the loan is repaid because you can expect there will be bad years in the stock market that will eat away at your investment there were a lot of people who took their money out of the market after the crash of 2008 if they had left their money in through 2009 they would have made all that money back but if you have a loan to pay you have to pull money out in the bad years as well as the good years unless you have a lucky streak of all good years you 're doomed

it depends on the size of the payroll not on the number of employees   probably you need to file form 941 quarterly under this scenario   you may or may not need to deposit taxes more frequently   if you must deposit then you need to do it electronically i this from the instructions for form 941 if your total taxes line 10 are less than $ 2,500 for    the current quarter or the preceding quarter and you    did not incur a $ 100,000 next day deposit obligation    during the current quarter you do not have to make a deposit to avoid a penalty you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely if you are not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $ 2,500 and your liability for the preceding quarter was not less than $ 2,500 make deposits using the or monthly rules so you wo n't be subject to failure to deposit penalties if your total taxes line 10 are $ 2,500 or more for the    current quarter and the preceding quarter   you must    make deposits according to your deposit schedule see    section 11 of pub 15 circular e for information and rules    about federal tax deposits i would say that probably for two employees you need to deposit by the 15th of each month for the prior month but you really need to check the limits above and the deposit schedule in pub 15 as referenced above based on your actual payroll size note that if you have a requirement to deposit that must be done either through or by wire transfer   the former is free but requires registration in advance of your first payment they mail you a pin that you need to log in and it requires that you get your payment in by the night before   the latter does not incur a charge from the irs but your bank will likely charge you a fee   you can do the wire transfer on the due date however so it 's handy if do n't get into in time this is all for federal   you may also need to deposit for your state and then you 'll need to check the state 's rules

signing bonuses are probably the most variable of all as there is a general understanding that more personal factors are taken into account as a result hr is n't under a huge obligation to explain away the differences in comparison for salary there 's the wide expectation that same job = same pay since there 's so variable but also fairly rare budget is n't a main concern for many hr departments and they certainly wo n't have a finely grained budget breakdown this year we 'll pay $ for $ 50000 for relocation payments $ 100,000 for pension transfers $ for stock option losses it 's generally tossed on one big heap cost of hiring so what can you ask for that 's really a market question what 's your value to the company how much of that is already reflected in salary and other benefits the main downside to signing bonuses is that a company wo n't know how long you 'd stay your value to the company is probably your monthly work therefore they can not amortize that bonus over a fixed amount of months what if you leave after 3 months for that reason a conditional signing bonus is a reasonable offer from your side e.g. ask for one month salary conditional on you staying for 24 months and otherwise you 'll repay them from your last salary

i would strongly advise that you do not use western union or any other wire transfer service for any money transfer unless you personally know and trust the recipient of your funds and the method by which you can communicate the details of the transaction as was mentioned wire transfers are irreversible and very difficult to trace to ensure the actual recipient got the funds in some countries and situations literally anyone can show up at any western union location correctly the details of the transaction which is proof enough they are the intended recipient and receive the cash if the vendor accepts paypal then simply set up a paypal account linked to your credit card and pay the vendor that way this can be done 100 online assuming you have a valid card

ask for documentation proving the amount they say you were overpaid and ask for time to review their claim if it is a large amount that they can prove you owe and if you were staying then you could ask for the repayment to be spread over multiple pay checks this would avoid the situation where you could get a very small check or even a check for zero because you are leaving you could ask for time to reimburse them but do n't count on them agreeing to that deal   the lesson is to save all time cards especially ones in which your hours are not consistent also save all pay stubs for the year what you should do now is download all the time card and pay info on the website before you lose access to it these should be saved on your home machine or printed and kept at home check to see if they made any time card adjustments many systems keep track of all changes made by the employee and by management both before and after the employee signs the time card if there are change you should be able to ask them to explain the changes

if the share is listed on a stock exchange that creates liquidity and orderly sales with specialist market makers such as the nyse there will always be a counterparty to trade with though they will let the price rise or fall to meet other open interest   on other exchanges or in closely held or private equity scenarios this is not necessarily the case nasdaq has market maker firms that maintain the bid ask spread and can do the same thing with their own inventory as the specialists but are not required to by the brokerage rules as the nyse brokers are   the nyse has listing requirements of at least 1.1 million shares so there will not be a case with only 100 shares on this exchange

when one says that corporations are people in a legal sense they are saying that they have the ability to enter into binding legal agreements in a manner similar to people this allows corporations to do things like own a building or a car or enter into a contract this is so that an individual does not have to do so this keeps individuals from being liable for the activities of the corporation it also keeps the individual from running off the the corporation 's car or selling the corporation 's building   if they are using it in any sense other than the legal sense it 's either hyperbole ignorance or pandering   now if you set yourself up as inc then you would very well be able to get all the same tax deductions and benefits as a corporation but you would also be liable for everything that a corporation is liable for namely a higher standard of reporting and different accounting methods

the sears ceo eddie lampert is an ayn rand fanatic   this is what happens when you take ayn rand newshour amp making sense column this is what happens when you take ayn rand seriously   in 2008 sears ceo eddie lampert decided to restructure the company according to rand 's principles   lampert broke the company into more than 30 individual units each with its own management and each measured separately for profit and loss the idea was to promote competition among the units which lampert assumed would lead to higher profits instead this is what happened as described by a reporter for bloomberg business   an advocate of free market economics and fan of the ayn rand he created the model because he expected the invisible hand of the market to drive better results if the company 's leaders were told to act selfishly he argued they would run their divisions in a rational manner boosting overall performance   instead the divisions turned against each other and sears and kmart the overarching brands suffered interviews with more than 40 former executives many of whom sat at the highest levels of the company paint a picture of a business that 's by infighting as its divisions battle over fewer resources   a close up of the debacle was described by stuart in a salon article from 2013   it got crazy executives started undermining other units because they knew their bonuses were tied to individual unit performance they began to focus solely on the economic performance of their unit at the expense of the overall sears brand one unit kenmore started selling the products of other companies and placed them more prominently than sears own products units competed for ad space in sears units were no longer incentivized to make sacrifices like offering discounts to get shoppers into the store   sears became a miserable place to work rife with infighting and screaming matches employees focused solely on making money in their own unit ceased to have any loyalty to the company or stake in its survival   we all know the end of the story sears share prices fell and the company appears to be headed toward bankruptcy the moral of the story in 's words   what lampert failed to see is that humans actually have a natural inclination to work for the mutual benefit of an organization they like to cooperate and collaborate and they often work more productively when they have shared goals take all of that away and you create a company that will destroy itself

the penny pink sheet stocks you tend to see promoted are the ones a with small public floats or b they are thinly traded   this means that any change in buy sell volume will have an outsized effect on the stock 's share price even when the underlying fundamentals are not so great   promoters are frequently paid based on how much they can move a stock 's price but such moves are not long lasting   they peter out when the trading volumes return to more normal ranges for the stock because all of the hype has died out there are some small cap nasdaq stocks which can be susceptible to promotion for the same reason they have small floats and/or are thinly traded   once someone figures out the best targets they 'll accumulate a position and then start posting all kinds of news on the web in an effort to drum up interest so they can sell off their position into the buying that follows    the biggest problem with penny pink sheet stocks is that they frequently fail to publish reliable financial statements and their ownership is of a dubious nature   in the past these types of stocks have been targeted by organized crime which ran their own pump and dump operations as a way to make relatively easy money   this may still be true to some extent today    be wary of investing in any publicly traded firm that has to use promoters to drum up investor interest because it can be a serious red flag   even if it means missing out on a short term opportunity research the company before investing   read its financials understand how it has behaved through its trading history learn about the products services it is selling   do your homework   otherwise you are doing the investing equivalent of taking your money and lighting it on fire remember there 's a good reason these companies are trading as penny pink sheet stocks and it generally has nothing to do with the notion the promoters will tell you that somehow the market has missed out on this amazing opportunity   pump and dump schemes which lie at the heart of almost all stock promotion rely on convincing you the investor that you 're smart enough to see what others have n't   i hope this helps good luck

your house does n't need to multiply in order to earn a return your house can provide shelter that is not money but is an economic good and can also save you money if you would otherwise pay rent this is the primary form of return on the investment for many houses it is similar for other large capital investments like industrial robots washing machines or automobiles the value of money depends on as long as the size and velocity of the money supply changes about as much as the overall economic activity changes everything is pretty much good a little more and you will see the money lose value inflation a little less and the money will gain value deflation   as long as the value of inflation or deflation remains very low the specifics matter relatively little prices including wages the price of work do a good job of adjusting when there is inflation or deflation the main problem is that people tend to use money as a unit of account e.g. you owe $ 100,000 on your mortgage i have $ 500 in the bank changing the value of those numbers makes it really hard to plan for the future imagine if prices and wages fell in half it would be twice as hard to pay off your mortgage or if the bank expected massive inflation in the future they would want to charge you a lot more interest presently inflation is the norm because the government entities who help adjust how much money there will be through monetary policy interest rates and the like ask about it if you 're interested will generally gradually increase the supply of money a little bit more quickly than the economy in general they may also be worried that outright deflation over the long term will lead to people purchases to get more for their money later harming overall economic activity so they tend to err on the slightly positive side the value of money however has not really ordinarily decreased until the modern era the 1930s or so during much of history a relatively low fixed amount of valuable commodities gold served as money when the economy grew and the same amount of money represented more economic activity the money became more valuable and deflation this could have the unfortunate effect of investment because rich jerks with lots of money could see their riches increase just by holding on to those riches instead of doing anything productive with them and changes in the supply of gold havoc with the money supply whenever there was some event like a gold rush because precious metals were at the base of the monetary    system rushes increased the money supply which resulted in inflation    soaring gold output from the california and australia gold rushes is    linked with a thirty percent increase in wholesale prices between 1850    and likewise right at the end of the century a surge    in gold production reversed a decades long deflationary trend and is    often credited with indebted farmers and helping to end the    populist party ’s strength and its call for a gold and    silver money standard the california gold rush today there is way too little gold production to represent all the growth in world economic activity but we do n't have a gold standard anymore so gold is valuable on its own merits because people want to buy it using money and its price is free to fluctuate when it gets more valuable and people pay more for it mines will go through more effort to locate extract and refine it because it will be more profitable that 's how most commodities work for more information on these of history some in depth articles on

to speak to this a little more broadly apart from groups like hedge funds and other investors investing for purely speculative purposes one of the major purposes of forwards and for that matter futures for companies in the real economy is to lock in a particular price in advance or to reduce the risk of some kind of investment or transaction investopedia defines a currency forward as follows with a few key points emphasized a currency forward is a binding contract in the foreign exchange market that locks in the exchange rate for the purchase or sale of a currency on a future date a currency forward is essentially a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment the other major benefit of a currency forward is that it can be tailored to a particular amount and delivery period unlike standardized currency futures this can be a major advantage for planning and risk management purposes for example if i know i 'm going to have to pay $ 1 million usd in the future and most of my revenue is in euros the actual amount i 'll have to pay will vary based on the exchange rate between euros and dollars thus it 's very worthwhile for me to be able to lock in a particular exchange rate so that i know exactly how much i 'm going to pay relative to my projected revenue the goal is n't necessarily to make money off the transaction maybe they do maybe they do n't as much as to reduce risk and improve planning ability the fact that it does n't involve an up front payment is also a major advantage it 's usually a bad practice to sit on cash for a year if you can avoid it another key point savings accounts pay less interest than inflation if inflation is 3 and your savings account pays 1 that looks remarkably like a guaranteed 2 loss to me

going by the information from goods and services tax gst on the australian government website there seem to be a number of possibilities note first i am neither a tax expert nor a lawyer this is simply my interpretation of the rules on the page linked above second this interpretation is based on the assumption that a service means you at least technically buy the service from another company and sell it on to the users of your app depending on the nature of the service and possibly factors such as whether you are deemed to take possession during the transaction it might be that different rules apply your turnover is under 75,000 providing you 're not reselling taxi services you wo n't need to register for gst should not charge it and your invoices should show that gst was not included in the price however if the turnover of the company whose services you are reselling is registered for gst they will be charging you gst that you will not be able to claim back so you would need to factor this into the price you charge your users before any promotional discount for example your turnover is over 75,000 if your turnover is above the limit you would need to charge gst on the final sale amount and pay this amount one of the price your customer paid to the australian government you also have to send out properly formatted tax invoices however it 's probably safe to say the company you are buying the original service from will also be over the gst threshold so you should be able to reclaim the gst that was charged to you by them   for example here your overall profit loss is helped by the fact that you can reclaim the gst you were charged and can under some circumstances result in an overall rebate these figures assume you add 10 to your selling price to cover the gst you have to pay the government however this may make your offering uncompetitive so you may have to absorb some all of the gst yourself

when i was in that boat a few years ago i went for the car first   my thoughts if i get the car first i 'm guaranteed to have a car that runs well   that makes it more convenient to commute to any job or for social functions   i ended up dropping about $ 20k into a car paid cash i do n't like being in debt   i chose to buy a really nice car knowing it will last for many years to come i 'm expecting to not replace it for about 10 years from the purchase   i would urge you to consider paying in full for the car dumping $ is a lot and there are plenty of nice cars out there in the $ 10 20k range that will work just fine for years to come   one benefit of paying in full is that you do n't have a portion of your income tied into the car loan the main reason i chose not to go for the house first had more to do with the difference in commitment   a home mortgage is a 30-year commitment on a large chunk of your income   with the job market and housing markets both currently working against you it 's better to wait until you have a large safety net to fall into for example it 's always recommended to have several months worth of living expenses in savings   compared to renting having 6 or more months of mortgage payments + utilities + insurance + property taxes + other mandatory expenses see food gas comes out to a significant amount more that you should have saved for me i 'm looking at a minimum of about $ 20k in savings just to feel comfortable ymmv   also owning a house always has more maintenance costs than you will predict   even if it 's just replacing a few light bulbs at first eventually you 'll need something major an appliance will die your roof will spring a leak anything i had both of those happen in the first year though it could be bad luck   you should make sure that you can afford the increased monthly payments while still well under your income once you 're locked in to the house you can still set aside a smaller chunk of your income for a new car 5 10 years down the road   but if you 're current car is getting down to it 's last legs you should get that fixed up before you lock yourself in to an uncomfortable situation do n't be in too much of a hurry to buy a house   the housing market still has a ways to go before it recovers and there 's not a whole lot to help it along   interest rates may go up but that will only hurt the housing market so i do n't expect it to change too much for the next several months   with a little bit of sanity we wo n't have another outrageous housing bubble for many years so houses should remain somewhat affordable interest rates may vary   also keep in mind that if you pay less that 20 down on the house you may end up with some form of mortgage interest which is just extra interest you 'll owe each month

yes there are a lot of places you can research stocks online google finance yahoo finance reuters etc it 's important to understand that the price of the stock does n't actually mean anything   share price is just a function of the market capitalization divided by the number of shares outstanding   as an example take two companies that are both worth $ 1 million but company a has issued 10,000 shares and company b has issued 100,000 shares   company a has a share price of $ 100 while company b has a share price of just $ 10   comparing share price does nothing to indicate the relative value or health of company a versus company b.    i know there are supposed to be no product recommendations but the dictionary area of investopedia.com is a good source of beginner investing information   and as joe points out below the questions here with the stock tag would also be a good place to start   and while i 'm on a roll the book a random walk down wall street is a good starting point in investing in the stock market

first i want to point out that your question contains an assumption does anyone make significant money trading low volume stocks   i 'm not sure this is the case i 've never heard of a hedge fund trading in the pink sheets for example second if your assumption is valid here are a few ideas how it might work accumulate slowly exit slowly   this wo n't work for short term swings but if you feel like a low volume stock will be a longer term winner you can accumulate a sizable portion in small enough chunks not to swing the price and then slowly unwind your position when the price has increased sufficiently create additional buyers sellers   your frustration may be one of the reasons low volume stock is so full of scammers pumping and dumping read any investing message board to see examples of this   if you can scare holders of the stock into selling you can buy significant portions without driving the stock price up   similarly if you can convince people to buy the stock you can unload without destroying the price   this is of course morally and legally dubious so i would not recommend this practice

there is actually a restriction on how high a wage they can pay you there did n't use to be but now it has to be reasonable for the work you are doing so they ca n't pay you $ 100/hr while other people doing the same work get minimum wage you might ask why on earth a parent would want to pay a child way more than they 're worth the salary is tax deductible to the company then the child pays their expenses hockey fees and equipment field trips birthday presents for their friends and so on out of the money the company paid them   they also save for their post secondary education the rest of the family budget now has a little more room and the parents can lower their own salaries if they have expensive children this means more net money in the company and less total income tax paid by the family for the same total income my concern is that if your parents do n't know whether or not you must be paid minimum wage you must there 's no family exemption then they also do n't know whether you should have ei deducted probably not and various other special cases like eligibility for summer student subsidies the firm 's accountant should be able to help with these things and the company should know all this it 's not the role of a 14 year old to ask the internet how to run a business the business owners should know it

if you itemize your deductions then the interest that you pay on your primary residence is tax deductible also tax is also deductible both go on schedule a. the car payment is not tax deductible   you will want to be careful about claiming business deduction for home   or car the irs has very strict rules and if you have any personal use you can disqualify the deduction for the car you often need to use the mileage reimbursement rates if you use the car exclusively for work then a lease may make more sense as you can expense the lease payment whereas with the car you need to follow the depreciation schedule   if you are looking to claim business expense of car or home it would be a very good idea to get professional tax advice to ensure that you do not run afoul of the irs

work on your own site is certainly not relevant here that 's just a part of your trade not a service you provided to yourself the business received the benefit of that work not you suppose your business sold if you took a tv from stock for your own lounge that would be included in this box because you have effectively paid yourself with a tv rather than cash if you take a tv from stock to use as a demo model that 's part of your trade and not goods you have taken out of the business for your own use for services provided to your dad it 's less clear as said it depends whether it 's your business providing the service or you personally if you gave your dad a free tv then it would be clear that you have effectively paid yourself with another tv and then given it to your dad as a gift with services it 's less clear whether you 're receiving services from the business for free you might consider how it would be treated by your employer if you were n't self employed if you were just applying your skills to help your dad in your free time your employer would n't care if you used your employer 's equipment or facilities or hosted his site on a server that your employer pays for your employer would be more likely to discipline you for effectively stealing services from them as they would if you took a tv from their warehouse for him

one opinion related to savings is to save 30 of your take home salary every month split the amount into two parts depending on your age 29 one part would be 30 of 30 and another 70 of 30 take the 70 and buy blue chip stock and take the 30 and buy govt bonds each 10 years adjust the percentages at 40 40 on bonds and 60 on stock only cash out on the day you retire otherwise ignore all market economic movements with this and the statutory savings employment retirement you should be ok

the rules of thumb are there for a reason in this case they reflect good banking and common sense by the buyer when we bought our house 15 years ago it cost 2.5 times our salary and we put 20 down putting the mortgage at exactly 2x our income my wife thought we were stretching ourselves getting too big a house compared to our income you are proposing buying a house valued at your income granted rates have dropped in these 15 years so pushing 3x may be okay the 26 rule still needs to be followed you are proposing to put nearly 75 of your income to the mortgage right the regular payment plus the 25k yr saved to pay that interest free loan wow   you are over reaching by double unless the rental market is so tight that you can actually rent two rooms out to cover over half the mortgage   consider talking to a friendly local banker he or she will likely give you the same advice we are these ratios do n't change too much by country interest rate and mortgages are n't that different i wish you well welcome to se

this turned out be a lot longer than i expected   so here 's the overview despite the presence of asset allocation calculators and what not this is a subjective matter   only you know how much risk you are willing to take   you seem to be aware of one rule of thumb namely that with a longer investing horizon you can stand to take on more risk   however how much risk you should take is subject to your own risk aversion   honestly the best way to answer your questions is to educate yourself about the individual topics   there are just too many variables to provide neat concise answers to such a broad question   there are no easy ways around this   you should not blindly rely on the opinions of others but rather use your own judgment to asses their advice some of the links i provide in the main text s&p 500 total and inflation adjusted historical returns 10-year index fund returns the motley fool risk aversion disclaimer these are the opinions of an enthusiastic amateur   why should i invest 20 in domestic large cap and 10 in developing markets instead of 10 in domestic large cap and 20 in developing markets should i invest in reits why or why not   simply put developing markets are very risky   even if you have a long investment horizon you should pace yourself and not take on too much risk   how much is too much is ultimately subjective   specific to why 10 in developing vs 20 in large cap it is probably because 10 seems like a reasonable amount of your total portfolio to gamble   another way to look at this is to consider that 10 as gone because it is invested in very risky markets   so if you 're willing to take a 20 haircut then by all means do that   however realize that you may be throwing of your money out the window meanwhile reits can be quite risky as investing in the real estate market itself can be quite risky   one reason is that the assets are very much fixed in place and thus can not be liquidated in the same way as other assets   thus you are subject to the of a relatively small market   another issue is the large capital outlays required for most commercial building projects thus typically requiring quite a bit of credit and risk   another way to put it donald trump made his name in real estate but it was and still is a very ride   yet another way to put it you have to build it before they will come and there is no guarantee that they will like what you built what mutual funds or index funds should i investigate to implement these strategies   i would generally avoid actively managed mutual funds due to the expenses   they can seriously eat into the returns   there is a reason that the most mutual funds compare themselves to the average instead of something like the s&p 500   all of those costs involved in managing a mutual fund teams of people and trading costs tend to weigh down on them quite heavily   as the motley fool on years ago if you can not do better than the s&p 500 you should save yourself the headaches and simply invest in an s&p 500 index fund that said depending on your skill and luck picking stocks or even funds you may very well have been able to beat the s&p 500 over the past 10 years   of course you may have also done a whole lot worse   this article discusses the performance of the s&p 500 over the past 60 years   as you can see the past 10 years have been a very ride yielding in a negative return   again keep in mind that you could have done much worse with other investments that site simple stock investing may be a good place to start educating yourself   i am not familiar with the site so do not take this as an endorsement   a quick once over of the material on the site leads me to believe that it may provide a good bit of information in readily digestible forms   the motley fool was a favorite site of mine in the past for the individual investor   however they seem to have turned to the dark side charging for much of their advice   that said it may still be a good place to get started   you may also decide that it is worth paying for their advice this blog post though dated compares some vanguard index funds and is a light introduction into the contrarian view of investing   simply put this view holds that one should not be a following the crowd rather one should do the opposite of what everyone else is doing   one strong argument in favor of this view is the fact that as more people pile onto an investing strategy or into a particular market the yields thin out and the risk of a correction i.e. a downturn increases    in the worst case this leads to a bubble which corrects itself suddenly or pops thus the term bubble leading to quite a bit of pain for the participants   an participant is one who is not hedged properly   basically this means they were not invested in other markets strategies that would increase in yield as a result of the event that caused the bubble to pop    note that the recent housing bubble and resulting credit crunch beat quite heavily on the both the stock and bond markets   so the easy hedge for stocks being bonds did not necessarily work out so well   this makes sense as the housing bubble burst due to concerns over easy credit unfortunately i do n't have any good resources on hand that may provide starting points or discuss the various investing strategies   i must admit that i am turning my interests back to investing after a    as i stated i used to really like the motley fool but now i am somewhat suspicious of them   the main reason is the fact that as they were exploring alternatives to advertising driven revenue for their site they promised to always have free resources available for those unwilling to pay for their advice   a cursory review of their site does show a decent amount of general investing information so take these words with a grain of salt   another reason i am suspicious of them is the fact that they spammed me with lots of to pay for their advice which seemed just like the type of advice they spoke against anyway time to put the soapbox away   as i do that though i should explain the reason for this   simply put investing is a risky endeavor any way you slice it   you can never eliminate risk you can only hope to reduce it to an acceptable level   what is acceptable is subject to your situation and to the magnitude of your risk aversion   ultimately it is rather subjective and you should not blindly follow someone else 's opinion professional or otherwise   point being use your judgment to evaluate anything you read about investing    if it sounds too good to be true it probably is   if someone purports to have some strategy for guaranteed steady returns be very suspicious of it   read up on the madoff scandal   if someone is putting on a heavy sales pitch be weary   be especially suspicious of anyone asking you to pay for their advice before giving you any solid understanding of their strategy   sure many people want to get paid for their advice in some way in fact i am getting paid with reputation on this site   however if they take the sketchy approach of a slimy salesmen they are likely making more money from selling their strategy than they are from the advice itself   most likely if they were getting outsized returns from their strategy they would keep quiet about it and continue using it themselves   as stated before the more people pile onto a strategy the smaller the returns   the typical model for selling is to make money from the sale   when the item being sold is an intangible good your risk as a buyer increases you may wonder why i have written at length without much discussion of asset allocation   one reason is that i am still a relative and have a mostly high level understanding of the various strategies   while i feel confident enough in my understanding for my own purposes i do not necessarily feel confident creating an asset allocation strategy for someone else   the more important reason is that this is a subjective matter with a lot of variables to consider   if you want a quick and simple answer i am afraid you will be disappointed   the best approach is to educate yourself and make these decisions for yourself   hence my attempt to educate you as best as i can at this point in time personally i suggest you do what i did   start reading the wall street journal every day an acceptable substitute may be the business section of the new york times   at first you will be overwhelmed with information but in the long run it will pay off   another good piece of advice is to be patient and not rush into investing    if you are in a hurry to determine how you should invest in a 401(k or other such investment vehicle due to a desire to take advantage of an employer 's matching funds then i would place my money in an s&p 500 index fund   i would also explore placing some of that money into broad index funds from other regions of the globe   the reason for broad index funds is to provide some protection from the normal fluctuations and to reduce the risk of a sudden downturn causing you a lot pain while you determine the best approach for yourself   in this scenario think more about capital preservation and hedging against inflation then about beating the market

in some jurisdictions you can donate the development rights you and the family still own it but nothing can ever be built on it in some cases you will still be able to build a cabin or similar structure on a few acres but the bulk has to be left natural   the advantage is that by giving away the logging or other development rights the land loses much of its value thus reducing the tax value of the land there are some hoops that you need to jump through but this is not an unusual transaction another choice it to see if the land touches any similar conservation areas it can be possible to donate the land to the government or other conservation group but it would revert to the family if they ever tried to sell or develop the land because you do n't own it you would not have to pay taxes but and could still use it by donating the land to the same organization a your neighbors it can streamline the paperwork for people who want to through hike

small purchases will have a disproportionate expense for commissions even a $ 5 trade fee is 5 on a $ 100 purchase so on one hand it 's common to advise individuals just starting out to use mutual funds specifically index funds with low fees on the flip side holding stocks has no annual fee and if you are buying for the long term you may still be better off with an eye toward cost and learn over time   in theory an individual stands a better chance to beat the experts for a number of reasons no shareholders to answer to and the ability to purchase without any disclosure among them in reality most investor lag the average by such a wide margin they 'd be best off indexing and staying in for the long term

first accept the fact that you are not going to be able to predict the ups and downs of the market well enough for that to be a viable strategy in the long run these schemes tend to be losers because it forces you to guess correctly twice when to get out when to get back in and missing either date can cost you a better strategy to benefit from market volatility

it sounds good but perhaps they 've overlooked several things that would need to be addressed before anything like this could work well   1 if there is a leak in the overall flow such as a hft hedge fund sucking money out of the markets at an enormous rate into a tax haven such a system would just perpetuate the existing rise of the entities they still get richer without spending much in return   2 as described they have only talked about one government one nation one monetary recycling system as if nations are closed boxes they are not money flows across borders with ease nations compete to maximise the amount of assets they hold within their borders at any given time these can be fixed capital assets too so nothing prevents the global equity investment they mention from starting to resemble all the powerful corporations concentrated in a single nation over time that would represent a lot of political power concentrated in ways that are not necessarily favourable to individual sovereign national legal systems elsewhere   it is possible that this could mean that nations would compete to lower taxes to zero to attract corporations thereby risking bankrupting governments unless the income from the global equity index compensated enough at 6 it wo n't match current tax rates   the second point also means that nations can not unilaterally decide to implement this unless they have a guaranteed additional income from activities that could compensate for excessive outflow

when you are starting out using a balanced fund can be quite advantageous a balanced fund is represents a diversified portfolio in single fund the primary advantage of using a balanced fund is that with it being a single fund it is easier to meet the initial investment minimum   later once you have enough to transition to a portfolio of diversified funds you would sell the fund and buy the portfolio with a custom portfolio you will be better able to target your risk level and you might also be able to use lower cost funds   the other item to check is do any of the funds that you might be interested in for the diversified portfolio have lower initial investment option if you can commit to adding money on a specified basis assuming that you are able to also there might be an etf version of a mutual fund and for those the initial investment amount is just the share price the one thing to be aware of is make sure that you can buy enough shares that you can rebalance holding a single share makes it hard to sell some gain when rebalancing i would stay away from individual stocks until you have a much larger portfolio assuming that you want to invest with a diversified portfolio the reason being that it takes a lot more money to create a diversified portfolio out of individual stocks since you have to buy whole shares with a mutual fund or etf your underlying ownership of can be fractional with no issue as each fund share is going to map into a fraction of the various companies held and with mutual funds you can buy fractional shares of the fund itself

to be clear a 401 k is a vehicle you make investments within it if you choose poorly such as say putting all your money into company stock when working for the next enron you can still get hurt badly   so it is important to have diversity and an appropriate risk level based on your age tolerance for risk etc that said as vehicles go it is outstanding and the always max your 401 k is very very common advice for a large number of investing professionals cfa 's pundits etc   that said there are a few priorities to consider here first priority if there is some level of company matching grab that it 's hard to beat that kind of return in almost any other case second since you never want to tap into a 401 k if you can at all avoid it before you are ready to retire you should first be sure you have a good emergency fund set aside in the event you lose your job or some other major happens   many recommend setting aside at least 6 months of basic living expenses    third if you have any high interest debt like credit card debt pay that stuff down as fast as you can   you 'll save a ton of interest it 's pretty much the same as investing the money you use to pay it down and getting a return equal to the interest rate you are paying with zero risk ca n't be beat   you 'll also end up with a lot better cash flow and the ability to start saving first and spending out of savings so you earn interest instead of paying it once you have those things out of the way then it is time to think about fully funding the   401k.   and keep in mind since you do n't pay taxes on it the felt effect to you pocket is about 80 or even less of what goes into the account so it 's not as painful as you might think and the hit to your take home may be less than you 'd expect   contributing as much as you can as early as you can also lets you benefit from the effect of compounding and has a far larger affect on the balance than money put into the account closer to retirement   so if you can afford to max it out i surely would advise you to do so

i think i have a better answer for this since i have been an investor in the stock markets since a decade and most of my money is either made through investing or trading the financial markets yes you can start investing with as low as 50 gbp or even less if you are talking about stocks there is no restriction on the amount of shares you can purchase the price of which can be as low as a penny i investing in stocks when i was 18 with the money saved from my pocket money which was not much but i made investments on a regular period no matter how less i could but i would make regular investments on a long term remember one thing never trade stock markets always invest in it on a long term the stock markets will give you the best return on a long term as shown on the graph below and will also save you money on commission the broker charge on every transaction the brokers to make money for themselves will ask you to trade stocks on short term but stock market were always made to invest on a long term as warren buffet rightly says and if you want to trade try commodities or forex forex brokers will offer you accounts with as low as 25 usd with no commissions the commission here are all inclusive in spreads   is this true can the average joe become involved yes anyone who wants has an interest in the financial markets can get involved knowledge is the key not money is it worth investing £ 50 here and there or is that a laughable idea 50 gbp is a lot i started with a few indian rupees if people laugh let them laugh only morons who do n't understand the true concept of financial markets laugh there are fees rules involved is it worth the effort if you just want to see the problem with today 's generation of people is that they fear a lot unless you crawl you do nt walk unless you try something you do nt learn the only difference between a successful person and a not successful person is his ability to try fail fall get back on feet again try he succeeds i know its not instant money but i 'd like to get a few shares here and there to follow the news and see how companies do i hear that bric russia india and china is a good share to invest in brazil india the good thing is share prices are relatively low even the commissions mostly roi return on investment on a long term would almost be the same can anyone share their experiences maybe best for community wiki always up for sharing please ask questions no matter how stupid they are i love people who ask for when i started i asked and people were generous enough to answer and so would i be

the fallacy in your question is in this statement the formulas must exist because prices can be followed real time what you see are of the current status of the stock what was the last price a stock was traded at what is the volume is the price going up or down   people who buy and hold their stock look at the status every few days or even every few months day traders look at the status every second of the trading day   the math formula comes in when people try to predict where the stock is going based on the in the line these move based on how other people react to the   the big movements occur when big pieces of news make large movements in the price company x announces the release of the key product will be delayed by a year the founder is stepping down the government just doubled the order for a new weapon system the insiders are selling all the shares they can there are no formulas to determine the correct price only formulas that try to predict where the price may go

the standard answer i have heard is that if you were to purchase term life insurance and invest the difference between the cost of the policies your investments would grow larger than the cash value of the insurance also when you take cash out of the insurance value drops by a like amount so you ca n't have your cake and leave it to your heirs too either you get the cash value or they get the insurance value hopefully there could be some of both although i believe the philosophy of that answer i have two issues with it first you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month i can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance second for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value my life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period hmm maybe there is n't a one size fits all solution if you need a large amount of insurance term life will certainly be more affordable however considering this as an investment i would not expect that to be a deciding factor good luck with your decision it is great that at such a young age you are concerned about investments

you go public to raise money to invest in the business and/or pay off the existing shareholders it 's really as simple as that the advantage of being public is that your shares can easily be bought and sold and so you can issue and sell new ones and your existing shareholders can sell out if they want to the disadvantage is that you are much more tightly regulated with more disclosure requirements and also that you are exposed to much more pressure from your shareholders to maintain and increase your share price

i do n't have a direct answer for you but here are some other things you might consider to help you decide on a course of action in addition to joe 's note about consulting a cpa   get a couple contractors out to look the place over and give you some quotes on the work needed most will do so for free or a nominal fee   everything about the extent and cost of repairs is complete guess work until you have some firm numbers you might also consider getting an up to date appraisal particularly if you can find someone willing to give you an after improvements estimate as well   the housing market has fluctuated a bunch in the last couple years your current value may have shifted significantly from where you think it is if you have n't done one recently   you will definitely have to pay for this service i would estimate around $ 500 based on one i got in st louis a few months ago    you might also consider reaching out to a local property management company to find out where they think you would fall in the scope of the current rental market and what improvements they would recommend   you will probably want to be onsite to talk to any of the above people about the work they are proposing and your intended goals so figure some travel costs and time into your evaluation as one of your noted concerns was the state of the roof i can tell you that in st louis county and the spec sheet for most shingle manufacturers you are limited to two layers of shingles then the roof is supposed to be stripped and from the bare wood   personally i wo n't even do the second layer i always go to bare wood and start over if for no other reason than it gives me an opportunity to inspect the deck and deal with any minor problem areas before they become big problems i do n't know county to know what the local code may be like but odds are high that the shingle manufacture would not honor any warranty with this installation another potential gotcha that may be out there is your ex may still have a lingering claim to the home if you go to sell it   i do n't know the rules in missouri off hand but where i grew up with family in the real estate and title insurance businesses there was a law regarding homestead rights   if a spouse spent even one night in a property they had an interest in it and an explicit waiver had to be signed to release said interest   review your divorce settlement and/or contact your attorney to confirm your status in this regard also consider the potential of refinancing your mortgage to either reduce the payment or get funds for the improvements repairs    final note i understand wanting to help out a friend i have done similar things more times than i can count but seriously look at the situation and see if you ca n't get the rent or other compensation up to the level of the mortgage at least    you mentioned that you have belongings still on the property what would a storage unit for said items cost in terms of juggling the numbers you could potentially use that value as justification to adjust the friends rent as a fee without any issue   verify with your cpa talk to the friend and see if there are other parts of the job they would be willing and able to take on as consideration for the reduced rent make sure you have at least a simple contract on any such agreement    or if none of the above are sufficient to balance the numbers see if they would be willing to take on an actual room mate to help make up the difference

i do n't think airbnb should be regulated in that way and look there are far fewer problems with airbnb than with hotels and and without the need of government intrusion why because airbnb 's reputation model works far better than the government will make everyone okay model i 've stayed at a lot of hotels and i would take any airbnb i 've stayed at over a hotel any day    airbnb is a perfect example of the free market working just fine the government is only wanting to get involved because of the hotel lobby hotels are a multi billion dollar industry and if anyone thinks that they are just going to bend over and take it from airbnb they they 're a fool they are fighting back with the use of native ads like this along with support from politicians who will sell out to any industry associations willing to line their campaign coffers    this is an industry fight it 's about old dying industries fighting the new economy and entrepreneurs    its nasty underhanded and full of lies cracked just totally lost me with this fake news

the limits on an hsa are low enough that there 's no real danger of it   the limits max out at as of 2011 for an individual at just over $ 3000 per year    sometime in the next few years you will have more than $ 3000 in health care expenses   it might be something like a car accident acid a weird that the doctor wants to check out a broken toe a few nasty that need to be filled an expensive antibiotic or something else entirely   or it might be something less dramatic getting eaten away by copays and contact lenses when that happens you want the peace of mind that you can pay for your deductible plus any other expenses   keep in mind that even a $ 5000 deductible can cost you more than $ 5000 out of pocket either because of non insured expenses or simply an illness that straddles multiple calendar years besides it 's not like your hsa money is going anywhere even if you never touch it it 's just a savings account that you ca n't touch until you turn 65   and if you do truly have an emergency you can get at it if you have to even if your hsa is filled with several years worth of deductibles it 's still a way to shield thousands of dollars a year from taxes with luck moving them into lower tax years 40 years from now   and it 's a way that does n't involve income limits or mandatory withdrawals

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

the dividend reinvestment wo n't change whether the dividends themselves are qualified or not for us income tax purposes   it 's still the holding period on the stock that matters   if you bought stock in different lots then you could have a situation where some of the dividends paid are qualified and some are not but for completeness it 's worth noting that some dividends can not be qualified no matter how long you hold them but if you 've got an investment in a common corporate stock vs. something more exotic then what 's above should apply

if you have decided to do the degree and are simply deciding whether to accept employer funding for it or not take the funding i see no difference between my employer does n't pay my tuition and my employer paid my tuition but i had to pay it back because i moved on therefore there is no downside to letting them pay the tuition if you want to move on before the two years or whatever is up you pay back that interest free loan you are still ahead over self funding the degree if you have not decided to do the degree and are letting the employer funded tuition figure into your decision process stop that right now doing a degree is hard work you will either work much longer hours than you do now or live on a lower salary or more likely both you might enjoy it you might be worth more afterwards and it might open the door to a of careers available only to those with the degree the actual cost of the tuition is unlikely to be significant in this decision process removing it by assuming the employer pays it should still not be done if it 's worth doing when you self fund then do it and relax knowing you wo n't feel trapped at your employer even if you let them pay it or lend you the money for it if you end up leaving

as i 'm sure you are reading in hull 's classic the basic valuation of bonds depends on the chance of entity defaulting on those bonds   let 's start with just looking at the us   the united states has a big advantage over corporations in issuing debt as it also prints the same currency that the debt is denominated in   this makes it much easier not to default on your debt as you can always print more money to pay it   printing too much currency would cause inflation lowering the value of debt but this would also lower the value of us corporate debt as well   so you can think of even the highest rated corporate bonds as having the same rate as government debt plus a little extra due to the additional default risk of the corporation the situation with other aa rated governments is more complicated   most of those governments have debt denominated in their local currency as well so it may seem like they should all have similar rates   however some governments have higher and some actually have lower rates than the united states   now as above some of the difference is due to the possible need of printing too much currency to cover the debt in crisis and now that we have more than one country to invest in the extra risk of international money flowing out of the country 's bonds however the bigger difference between aa governments rates depends more on money flow central banks and regulation   bonds are still mostly freely traded instruments that respond to supply and demand but this supply and demand is heavily influenced by governments   central banks buy up large portions of the debt raising demand and lowering rates   regulators force banks to hold a certain amount of treasuries perhaps inflating demand finally to answer your question the united states has some interesting advantages partially just due to its long history of stability controlled inflation and large economy making treasuries valuable as one of the lowest risk investments   so its rates are generally on the low end but government manipulation can still mean that it is not necessarily the lowest

you want to know if you should pay cash or use a credit card like cash there are so many benefits to the card like purchase protection cash back and postponed payments that there needs to be a really good reason to pay cash   if you are concerned about the 10 threshold ask your credit card company to raise your limit   if you are indifferent let the merchant decide for you by asking for a discount if you pay cash   the biggest reason is that credit cards when handled make your money work for you by keeping it in less liquid higher interest investments like inflation adjusted t bills you will still be able to access it by using the credit card to float large expenses without liquidating at a loss investment accounts like schwab one are great for this since you can borrow cash at a low interest rate against your securities until your security sale clears

i am not trying to attribute the current economic climate and the decisions that stem from that with raising tax rates   i simply think that a higher tax rate for the wealthy will further slow the recovery i also think that the issue of tax rates is being used to divert the attention of the people from that which is actually killing us the national debt that is thanks to trillion dollar deficits the tax hikes are used to a fight between red and blue without getting to the crux of the matter    the reality is that at most the government might be able to raise taxes that would generate 200 or 300 billion dollars more in yearly revenue over the short term over the long term these taxes will drive capital off shore and into investments that shelter it from taxes at the same time that the debt continues to increase at over 1 trillion per year anyway   the debate should be this do we want to cut federal spending by 40 now or do we want to cause an economic and monetary collapse by continuing along with deficits that are 10 of gdp

there are a lot of good answers above all of them will probably work for you in some way or another one point to note from the procrastination theme is that you could invest your free money that you have currently in some investment instrument which would require you to do some paperwork etc to get out this way the immediate cash flow is decreased and also invested now from each budget save a small amount for the things that you would like to buy give this small savings some months to accumulate so that you can afford only one of the items that you want to buy or target an item that you want to buy after the money is accumulated if you still want to buy the item then you probably should one point of note is that budgeting is also important on a monthly basis pete has provided excellent suggestion in this regard

you will need to check the language of your sales contract most of the time it will be written that the pro rated property taxes will be part of closing costs in general if you 've already paid taxes then the buyer will pay you the pro rated portion of that from the closing date through the end of the year if you have n't then you would usually be charged the pro rated amount to be held in the buyer 's mortgage company escrow account with the remainder being collected from the buyer at a later date for your income tax purposes you can deduct that tiny amount of the paid property taxes from your income assuming itemized deductions doing some research on property tax for the state of georgia brings up this interesting note if you owned property on january 1 you are responsible for the ad tax for the entire year even if you sell the property on january 2   georgia law does not allow a refund for partial year residents this leads me to believe that your sales contract would have it written in that the buyer paid you almost the entire year 's property taxes in anticipation that you would be responsible for the property taxes as you owned the property on january 1st again you should consult with the settlement attorney and review your contract

forex trading contracts are generally fairly short dated as you mention   months to weeks   professional forex traders often extend the length of their bet by rolling monthly or quarterly contracts   closing a contract out a few days before it would expire and a new contract for the next quarter month   this process can be rather expensive and time consuming for a retail investor however a more practical but also not great method would be to look into currency etfs   the etfs generally do the above process for you and are significantly more convenient   however depending on the broker these may not be available and when available can be illiquid and/or expensive even in major currency pairs   it 's worth a bunch of research before you buy note in both cases you are in a practical sense doubling your nok exposure as your home currency is nok as well   this may be riskier than many people would care to be with their retirement money   an adverse move would at the same time you would lose money make it much to buy foreign goods which frankly is most goods in a small open country like norway the most simple solution would be to overweight local nok stocks or if you believe stocks are overvalued as you mention nok denominated bonds   with this you keep your nok exposure a currency you believe will appreciate without doubling it as well as add expected returns above inflation from the stock growth dividends or bond real interest rates

just to add to @duffbeer703 comment additionally the cash value is not part of the death benefit the policy is intended to grow the cash value to the point where it matches the death benefit and then it matures and you get the cash my point being is that since they do n't give you both you are really transferring the from them to you over time your savings that you lose becomes part of the death benefit and they it with less and less over the years so that it would equal the death benefit @duffbeer703 nailed it right on the head buy term and invest the difference and once you 've got your savings built really the need for insurance is n't there any longer if you 've got 1/2 million saved do you really need insurance

first let me say that you have to take everything your agent says with a grain of salt freakonomics had a great article that discussed the math behind the motivation of the real estate agent   it described the home seller trying to get say $ 400k. on a 6 commission the $ 24 k is destined to be split between seller realtor office and buyer 's realtor 's office the selling agent gets $ 6,000 or so in the end as a seller if i settle for $ 380 k my realtor is only out $ 300 netting $ but $ 20 k lower sale price and i just lost nearly $ 19 k after commission is paid   the agent would have the natural goal of volume not extracting the last dollar from the buyer gaining back the last $ 20 k to the seller will cost the realtor far more than $ 300 in her time keeping the house on the market and waiting for the better offer   sellers might use down payment as one way to estimate the probability of the financing falling through but it 's a rough estimate at best because in the case of bank financing the bank needs the same time to run through the paperwork for a 3 down or a 20 down it 's just as easy for the buyer to qualify or not qualify for one loan or the other there are young couples with great incomes and no debt who blow away the required ratios for proposed debt to income but have n't saved up the otherwise huge 20 downpayment then there are those who have saved for years even having 30 to put down but their income is still not going to qualify them the offer will be contingent on the financing regardless it will show that you are putting $ xx dollars as a downpayment and the final transaction is contingent on your bank approving you

why not just hold that cash until you graduate from college why because it 's a safety net make sure you do n't have any sudden expenses medical school bills car bills etc then after school you 're going to need some cash for job moving relocation clothes downpayment on apartment utilities etc if all that cash is tied up into a 401 or ira then you ca n't touch it and if something happens you 'll be tempted to take a loan out   you 'll have plenty of time since you 're just starting to save for retirement keep this cash as a beginning emergency fund and hang on cause as soon as you get out of school things really move fast

yeah the biggest problem with this is that it far more heavily taxes the poor than the rich   poor people spend all of their income   month to month living paycheck to paycheck poor people have no choice but to spend their entire incomes on basic necessities utilities etc   rich people on the other hand spend very little of their incomes   most of it gets stashed in and overseas holdings and does n't really change hands in a way that allows it to be taxed under this style of tax structure   so your tax continuously hits 100 of the wealth of the bottom of households while largely bypassing the rich folks who have more money than they can   in short this kind of tax structure is really bad for anyone who does n't make $ a year and store most of their wealth in stocks and so forth   if you want to help the general public households making less than $ 300k year you need to generate more tax revenue from investments and capital   a 2 tax say on stock trades valued over $ 10,000 obviously would n't hurt poor people at all and also would n't really hurt the rich   cuz if you 've got 10 grand or a hundred or thousand or whatever to stash in shares of amazon or whatever you 're really not gon na miss the $ 200 that comes off the top of your trade   but this would generate huge tax revenue as there are thousands of such transfers a day

having worked for a financial company for years my advice is to stay away from all the freedom funds offered   they 're a new way for fidelity to justify charging a higher management fee on those particular funds   that extra 1 or so a year is great for making the company money it will kill your rate of return over the next 25 + years you 're putting money into your retirement account   all these funds do is change the percentage of your funds in stocks vs. more fixed investments bonds etc so you have a higher percentage in stocks while you 're young and slowly move the percentage more towards fixed as you get older   if you take a few hours every 5 years to re balance your portfolio and just slowly shift more money towards fixed investments you 'll achieve the same thing without the extra annual fee so how much difference are we talking here   let 's do a quick example   based on your salary of $ 70k and a 4 match by your company you 'll have $ a year to put in your 401(k your 4 plus matched 4   i 'll also assume an 8 annual return for both funds   here is what that 1 extra service charge will cost you fund with a 1 service charge annual fee paid year 1 $ 60.00 annual fee paid year 25 assuming 8 growth in assets $ total fees year 1 through 25   $ fund with a 2 service charge annual fee paid year 1 $ annual fee paid year 25 assuming 8 growth in assets $ total fees year 1 through 25   $ that 's a total of $ in extra fees over 25 years on just the investment you make this year   next year if you invest the same amount in your 401k that will be another $ paid over 25 years to the management company   this pattern repeats each year you pay the higher management fee   trust me if you invest that money in stock instead of paying it as fees you 'll have a whole lot more money saved when it 's time to retire my advice pick a percentage you 're comfortable with in stocks at your age maybe 85 90 and pick the stock funds with the lowest management fees the remaining 10 15 should go into a fixed fund   make sure you pick at least some of your stock money i do 20 25 and select a diverse lots of different countries international fund for any retirement money you plan to save above the 4 getting matched by your company set up a roth ira   that will give you the freedom to invest in any stocks or funds you want   find some low cost index funds such as vti for stocks and for bonds and put your money in those   invest the same amount every month automatically and your cost average will work itself out through up markets and down good luck

daniel anderson shared interesting insights in my research i learned a few things some interesting data on fraud trends   payments fraud and control survey 2016 as a consumer at the very least i 'd improve awareness of i 'd also learn about basic types of fraud and for the techies out there i 'd recommend learning about layered security there 's no way the customer service is going to talk about this

not necessarily   the irs deals with income taxes   i 'd have to run the numbers but i 'm not sure if this would short the irs versus deducting wages paid at time and a half     usually a state 's department of labor or similar would go after him for something like this   also this sounds like plain old fraud so a criminal charge could be brought   what 's also interesting is how the franchise 's cpa and/or subway 's corporate accounting handled this   phantom employees are a big no no but are more commonly used to hide embezzlement   there are a number of tests auditors are supposed to perform to weed out phantom employees   i wonder if they did and covered it up or if they never bothered to test   either is bad   and accountant

appreciate the good back and forth i only did equity for a brief while before i moved to emerging market debt i can go across capital structure but we do n't spend much time on retail outside of china i think ebitda or an adjusted ni makes a lot more sense than fcf for amazon and nowadays fcf is all that i use for valuation in em debt world

johnny   i recently bought my first home as well and i have worked in the credit business not mortgage so i think i can answer some of your questions   disclaimer first that i 'm in ny and home buying does vary from state to state in my experience pre qual is not too different from pre approval   neither represents any real on the part of the bank i.e. they can still deny approval at any point and both are based on pulling your credit bureau and calculating ratios based on your stated probably not documented financial information   it 's theoretically possible that a seller would choose a pre approved buyer over a pre qualified buyer all other things being equal but all other things are seldom equal remember also that you do n't need to ultimately get a mortgage from the same bank that you use for the pre qual   the pre qual just shows that you are probably credit worthy and serves to give you some credibility with sellers   once you have an accepted offer and need to find a real mortgage you can shop around for the best rate and best loan structure   banks do n't need to have pulled your credit to quote rates but they will need to have a general idea of your fico range   once you find the bank you like with the best rate and actually apply for the loan they will pull a hard bureau and if your scores are different from what you said before the rate may change but within the same range you 'll generally be ok   also banks do not necessarily pull all 3 bureaus they may only pull 1 as it costs them for each pull 2 potential downsides to this approach also make sure you have a mortgage funding clause in your contract as banks are unpredictable and make sure you have a great real estate lawyer not a legal factory the extra few hundred $ are worth it do n't this credit stuff too much   find a good house for a good price and get a no nonsense mortgage that you fully understand no exotic stuff   good luck

so is n't this a success it was implemented by taxation teams to ensure that non taxable transactions could no longer occur and now they are n't on the corruption side everything is electronic and traceable now sounds like it is working as intended

it definitely does   part of the misinformation the gmo pr puts out is that there 's a difference without specifying they are both non gmo   organic is non gmo   the difference is that organic goes a step further and removes synthetic pesticides fertilizers and growth hormones which is a problem for meats and dairy in addition to gmos

i especially hate this whole distribute tips and pay the hard workers pretty much nada explains so many things about our most recent visits to olive garden no wonder the waiter could n't hold on to our request for a refill which we 'd never even had to request before long enough to bring it back to our table until the second request he was probably worrying how he 's going to eat that day poor thing also explains the table nearby sitting waiting to be while people line up outside waiting to eat i would n't hurry either for $ 2 an hour and a crap share in the tips i guess we 'll just have to buckle down and try harder not to eat out for a while except at the two family run local places that do n't hire any outside workers at least i can hope the family is n't screwing any of their members

the bigger stores also benefit from this i worked as a for a major chain grocery store and when a tj opened up next door our sales actually increased by 3 may not sounds like much but when you 're selling a huge volume of dollars every percent adds up quick
