a contracts are for future delivery of said underlying so if you are trading cl crude oil futures and do n't sell before delivery date you will be contacted about where you want the oil to be delivered a warehouse presumably 1 contract is the equivalent of 1000 barrels b 600 contracts depends entirely on what you are trading and how you are trading if you are trading es s&p 500 e mini you can do the 600 contracts in less than a second c no fees does not make particular sense it 's entirely possible that you are not trading anything it 's just a fake platform so they can judge your performance d the catch typically is that when it 's time to pay you they will avoid you or worst case disappear e trading is a full time job especially for the first 4 5 years when you 're only learning the basics remember in futures trading you are trading against all the other professionals who do only this 24/7 for decades if you are only risking your time with the reward being learning and possibly money it seems like a good deal there 's typically a catch with these things like you would have to pay for your data which is very expensive or withdrawing funds is possible only months later

i am a bit at a loss as to how you can read the same book that inspired warren buffet and take away that trading 600 contracts per month is a way to prosperity   as a fellow engineer i can say with assurance this speculation scheme is doomed to failure   crossing out the word gamble was a mistake    instead you should focus on two things   the first is your core business which is signal processing   work and strive to be the best you can   seek out opportunities to increase your income while keeping your costs low   as an engineer you have an opportunity to earn an above average salary with very low costs second would be to warehouse some of those earning and let others who are good at other things work for you   you may want to read the jack bogle books and seek an asset allocation model   i tend to be more aggressive then he would suggest but that is a matter of preference     you do n't really have the time when you focus on your core business to manage 6 trades a month let alone 600   put your contributions on auto pilot and a surprisingly short time you will have a pile of cash

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

i buy or sell a few shares whenever i have a small amount of money to transfer into out of my mutual funds since i 'm not paying transaction fees there is no reason not to when that is what makes sense if you are paying a fee for each transaction of course it makes sense to try to wait until you have a larger amount to move so the overhead per share is lower

margin trades let you post a margin of a certain proportion of the value of the trade as collateral against the price of a trade and pay off the difference between the current price and the price that you bought at any losses incurred are taken from the margin so the margin has to be maintained as prices change in practice this means that when the price moves significantly from the buying price a margin call is triggered and the buyer has to increase their posted margin the vast majority of the foreign exchange trades done every day are margin trades as effectively are all spread bets margins get reset overnight whether or not a call has occurred

as you can see from the graphs above as absolute distance from atm at the money increases the ratio represented by delta begins to approach or 1:1 meaning as delta approaches 1 the option price moves up 1 dollar for every 1 dollar the stock price moves up as delta approaches 0 the option price does not move as the stock price moves as the absolute distance from atm increases gamma approaches zero 0 meaning as the price of the option increases or decrease the change in delta is at its highest as the option price is nearest the money as the price of the option moves away from the money in either direction it changes less drastically interestingly delta is the first derivative of the value of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price and gamma is the first derivative of delta definition of delta definition of gamma

it seems like this was a stock for stock transaction that is your company was acquired not for cash but for the stock of company x in a deal that your company 's board of directors signed off on   your company no longer exists and that 's why your stock was cancelled the acquirer will be sending you an equivalent amount of stock in their company x. you do n't need to worry about taxes only accounting because this is a non cash transaction what this means that your cost basis in the stock of company x will be what you paid for the original company 's stock not its value on the day of the merger which may be higher or lower than what you paid

yes the price of a stock is what investors think the value of a stock is which is not tied to profits or dividends by any rigid formula but to say that therefore the price could be high even though the company is doing very poorly is hypothetically true but unlikely in practice consider any other product there is no fixed formula for the value of a used car either if everyone agreed that a 20-year old car that does n't run is worth $ 100,000 then that 's what it would sell for but that 's a pretty big if at the beginning of that sentence   if the car had been used in some hit tv show 20 years ago or if it was owned by a celebrity or some such special case maybe a old car really would sell for $ 100,000 likewise a stock might have a price higher than what one would predict from its dividends if some rich person wanted to buy that company because the brand name brings back memories from his youth and so he drives the price up etc but the normal case is that in the long term the price of a stock tends to settle on a value proportional to the dividends that it pays or rather and this is a big caveat the dividends that investors expect it to pay in the future and then adjusted for all sorts of other factors and special situations like the value of the company if it was to be liquidated etc

you must consider the different levels of risk associated with each loan when the bank loans you money it does so based on a high degree of information about your financial situation through your credit report + additional information gathered at the time of granting your request it feels quite confident that you will repay them and therefore considers you to be low risk in order to make a profit off of all its low risk clients the bank only needs to charge a small rate of interest competitive with the market but enough to cover the losses from clients who will default when you loan money through a peer to peer program you are at two distinct disadvantages from the bank 1 your loan portfolio will not be diversified that is you may have only a single person or a small handful of people owing you money any catastrophic event in their lives may wipe out their loan to you whereas the bank can play the averages with a broader client base 2 you have less information and ultimately less effective power to reclaim your losses would you feel confident walking behind the desk at a bank today and deciding whether to approve someone 's loan based on the information that the bank 's back end has already determined is necessary to make that decision now how about when you are doing it on your own because of this you take on more risk from a peer to peer loan than a bank takes on from you that 's why the person is willing or required due to market availability to pay a higher rate they know they are higher risk that does n't mean this is a bad idea just that there is a specific reason that the difference in rates exists and it implies that you should consider carefully whether the risks outweigh the benefits note that the concept of taking a buy sell position on two theoretically identical assets while earning a net profit at no risk is known as arbitrage arbitrage situations rarely exist and never for long whenever you see a position that appears to be arbitrage consider what might make it not so ie you could buy inventory in location a and sell it at 10 higher margin in location b but have you considered transportation carrying costs and interest for the period that you physically held the inventory the appearance of arbitrage may in my opinion be a sign that you have incomplete information

in the us the key to understanding the benefits of retirement accounts is to understand capital gains taxes and how they work retirement accounts are designed for making investments throughout your career then after several decades of contributions withdrawing that money to pay for your needs when your full time employment has concluded normally when you invest money in a brokerage account if the value of your investment increases and you sell in less than a year those investments are considered short term gains and taxed as ordinary income if you hold that same investment for over a year the same investment is taxed at a lower capital gains rate depending on which tax bracket you are in during that year the amount due could be up to 20 but much lower than your regular income tax rate when you place your money in a retirement account you are choosing to either pay the tax due on the income when you put it in the account or put the money in tax free and pay the tax when you withdraw these are called tax deferred accounts when you have money invested several decades the raw dollar amount increases greatly but inflation is also reducing the value of those dollars imagine you bought some bonds that payed 4 over 40 years but inflation was 2 during those same years when you sell those bonds 40 years later you will owe capital gains on the entire gain even though half of the gain came from inflation retirement accounts allow you to buy and sell according to your investment needs and goals without any consideration about whether the gains are short term or long term and they also allow you to pay taxes just once either when you put it in or when you take it out with no worries about whether you 're paying taxes on inflated gains

it requires fairly large levels of capital but what about seed funding angel investments in startups this would be before venture capital gets involved so the amounts are relatively low tens of thousands vs. millions of usd but as valuations this early in the game are also low you can get a significant portion of equity in a startup that you feel is being run by good people and is in a promising market paul graham of y has a number of articles about this from both sides of the table that you can take a look at and see if this is for you it 's definitely very high risk but if you can pick successful startups before their valuation shoots up get some equity help them succeed and they eventually go public or get acquired you can stand to bring in some big returns note that this is n't a hands off investment you 'll need to build connections in the startup community and it is n't uncommon for angel investors to become involved in the day to day operations of the businesses in which they invest

from the instructions if you do not need to make any adjustments to the basis or type of    gain or loss short term or long term reported to you on form 1099-b    or substitute statement or to your gain or loss for any transactions    for which basis has been reported to the irs normally reported on    form 8949 with box a checked you do not have to include those    transactions on form 8949 instead you can report summary information    for those transactions directly on schedule d. for more information    see exception 1 later however in case of espp and rsu it is likely that you actually do need to make adjustments since 2014 brokers are no longer required to track basis for these so you better check that the calculations are correct if the numbers are right and you just summarized instead of reporting each on a separate line its probably not an issue as long as the gains reported are correct no one will waste their time on you if you missed several thousand dollars because of incorrect calculations some might think you were intentionally trying to hide something by aggregating and may come after you

the appropriate structure for an organization depends largely on the size of the firm smaller firms can employ some non traditional more easily i.e. flat design whereas the same structures are more difficult to use in mid size and large companies the most important pieces of any corporate structure are 1 clarity of roles 2 accountability and 3 ease of communication   firstly everyone in the organization must have clarity of their own role and how it fits into the bigger picture that means a structure that is easy to understand and a comprehension of how all the roles tie in to each other    secondly a good structure will enable and empower leadership to hold the team accountable and be held accountable in turn what is often misunderstood about accountability is that people often assume that it simply means punishing poor behavior when something breaks down in reality that 's holding people responsible not accountable accountability is something that is self driven and is a product of sound relationships and transparency as an example one of the most common breakdowns in accountability is found in passive non this is when you may reach out to a business partner for help or an update but they simply do not reply as in email text or    thirdly the structure should be such that it is easy for individuals to communicate across and up down the chain this does n't mean that if you send an email communication is easy rather who do i reach out to for this problem what are the best practices or agreed upon methodologies for a certain practice and how does the team know this some of this should be codified in the form of standard operating procedures which can be referenced at any time many companies use a playbook which is a high level reference guide on how to operate the business an example is found here a playbook can be anything from a pdf to an interactive website like the aforementioned link it should always have the most up to date information   most companies will change their structure over time as their environment both internal and external change and they need to adapt for example a small firm may not need an hr department but as it employs more and more people a need to have someone or an entire team focused on human capital management rises quickly an owner operator can handle only so much before it is time to scale up   the most important thing to consider is who you hire people are the largest expense to an organization and having the right people in the right roles is the best way to avoid unnecessary incremental costs resulting from inefficiency fraud or risky behavior always look for the personality traits that make a good employee relative to the role i.e. customer service finance integrity operations teamwork   one of the most obvious parts of a business as it scales up is specialization you want to find a balance though for example hr handles all human relations issues while legal handles all internal claims suits and patents there is an overlap that occurs here as internal claims often start as human relations issues which means you must have healthy communication and clear accountability for an appropriate hand off so legal takes a claim at the right point in time while this example may be a little obvious many times the edges are blurred and clarity of role can be difficult   i hope that helps reach out with any follow up questions

as already noted options contain inherent leverage a multiplier on the profit or loss the amount of leverage is dictated primarily by both the options strike relative to the current share price and the time remaining to expiration options are a far more difficult investment than stocks because they require that you are right on both the direction and the timing of the future price movement with a stock you could choose to buy and hold forever buffett style and even if you are wrong for 5 years your unrealized losses can suddenly become realized profits if the shares finally start to rise 6 years later but with options the profits and losses become very final very quickly as a professional options trader the single best piece of advice i can give to investors in options for the first time is to only purchase significantly itm in the money options for both calls and puts do a web search on in the money options to see what calls or puts qualify   with itm options the leverage is still noticeably better than buying selling the shares outright but you have a much less chance of losing all your premium also by being fairly deep in the money you reduce the constant bleed in value as you wait for the expected move to happen the market moves sideways more than people usually expect to deeply itm options are the ones that options market makers like least to trade in because they offer neither large nor easy premiums and options market makers make their living by selling options to retail investors and other people that want them like you so connect the dots by trading only itm options until you become quite experienced you are minimizing your chances of being the average sucker all else equal some amateur options investors believe that similar benefits could be obtained by purchasing long expiration options like leaps for 1 + years that are not itm like atm or otm options the problem here is that your significant time value is bleeding away slowly every day you wait   with an itm option your intrinsic value is not bleeding out at all only the relatively smaller time value of the option is at risk thus my recommendation to initially deal only in to deeply itm options with expirations of 1 4 months out depending on how you wish to be with your move timing

spring hill in 2009 spring hill united church of christ followed the lead of the denomination ’s 24th general of 2003 and adopted a statement of the church body would welcome and affirm all people including people of every sexual identity one way the church has decided to live up to that statement is by offering an educational and support group for those with hiv aids as well as people affected by it beginning this month the group will meet from 7 to p.m. on the last tuesday of each month at the church for the past two years our church has declared itself open to all people regardless of age race gender ethnicity sexual identity health or disabilities economic status or family structure said the as part of that of all people in our we are excited to be able to reach out to those who may lack the support and that comes from being hiv positive or having aids the ministry called red project will be led by church member and student ray gomez i chose the name red project because red is a stand out shout out kind of color gomez said red is also the color of the aids used to represent the illness he said red denotes danger and is an angry color representing the worst in human behavior and ignorance along with hatred shown to the people with the illness in the early years gomez said and the stigma surrounding hiv even today gomez is hiv positive and has more than 25 years of experience teaching and advocating on hiv aids he holds degrees in education and education and is working on a second master ’s degree in counseling he is an minister through the church international and is a student in ministry with the united church of christ gomez who is gay said he the church in spring hill because it is open and a lot of churches do not want to service or go out of their way to reach the hiv population he said it ’s unfortunate because a lot of people with hiv live in this community there ’s so much stigma still attached to hiv so for that reason many people do n’t want anything to do with church gomez said that several years ago he personally felt rejection by many churches subsequently he turned to alcohol crack cocaine and living i discovered quite quickly that the world ’s solutions make great promises but can never deliver he said it was all just an illusion of the intimacy i was seeking and i was left more broken more hopeless and experienced deeper despair over the past 11 years gomez said he returned to the faith of his youth and began to those who were hurting and broken now as an advocate and peer in the field he is a certified prevention specialist hiv test counselor and peer i have recovered from crack addiction and alcohol abuse he said i have discovered the metropolitan community church and the united church of christ two denominations that allow me to be fully myself and fully christian and which give me the opportunity to minister to a hurting and broken community reconciliation for hurting people is his goal my purpose and pastor ’s purpose is to reconcile gay men and people that have been hurt by other christians and that do n’t attend church anymore and welcome them back into a family of faith topics at the monthly classes will include i just tested positive now what talking with my health care provider the stuff you need to discuss medication adherence what ’s important and why and crystal meth and hiv a non judgmental educational experience according to a press release the purpose of red project is to offer emotional physical and spiritual support and guidance to those newly diagnosed with hiv and to those who have been positive for some time i believe a good support group needs four things gomez said physical support emotional support education and spiritual support there is no cost to attend but donations will be sought to help with and educational materials said those attending need not participate in the church there are no strings attached he said all we want to do is to help those who have a need and to affirm those who may feel alienated and by society at large my biggest hope is that people find inner healing and form bonds of friendship from participating in red project according to public information officer for the county health department the county does not offer a support group for those with hiv aids the health department reaches out with hiv aids education presentations literature testing and prevention said the health department clinics offer testing education comprehensive care and referrals hiv and aids is a concern across florida she said and we are fortunate to have resources available in county that support people who are living with hiv and aids

comparing retirement savings to ordinary investment is not an apples to apples comparison retirement savings are savings for retirement if you want to invest in things now and live off of or reinvest those earnings then retirement accounts are not the right vehicle    that said here are some benefits of the main types of retirement accounts benefits of a 401(k benefits of a ira benefits of a roth 401(k benefits of a roth ira the benefits above are not exhaustive there are other benefits such as using a roth ira for higher ed expenses etc but those are the highlights if you have a plan for how you hope to use the money now rather than later does it make sense to hold onto it if your plan is meant to provide income at retirement and earns returns higher than the returns plus matches and tax benefits you get from retirement accounts then yes it may make more sense but those benefits are generally very hard to beat   plus having the money locked away in an account that is painful to tap can be a good thing you 're less tempted to use that money for foolish decisions which everyone makes at some point

peace of mind is the key to your question just before the us housing bust of 2007 i had someone try to convince me to take all the equity from my house which was overvalued in an overheated market the idea was to put that money in the stock market for a bigger return than the interest on the house many people did that and found themselves out of jobs as the economy crashed unfortunately they could n't sell their homes because they owed more than they were worth i never lost a night of sleep over the money i did n't make in the stock market i did manage to trade up to a house twice the size by buying another when the housing market bottomed out but waiting for a market recovery to sell the smaller house the outcome of my good fortune is a very nice house with no mortgage worth about 1/3 of my total net worth that 's probably a larger percentage than most money managers would recommend but it is steadily decreasing because now all the money that would go to a mortgage payment instead gets deposited in retirement accounts and it still has 30 years to grow before i start drawing it down i almost do n't remember the burden of a mortgage hanging over my head each month almost

gt they want to lower the standards we have for goods and services   their goal is regulatory but its not being done in a good publications its an attempt to sneak through a huge long long of bad ideas that would not fly in any kind of light of day and then make them permanent with special eternal domestic legal process background for multinational corporations so permanent that future elections can not change them nor can states individually protect people their laws would be to the extent that unaccountable trade can order huge fines against countries and states for merely doing their sites default files case documents because they upon   new suddenly materialized rights as perceived by the trade agreements almost nobody knows they are doing this often countries do nt realize that they have lost their rights to determine their policies and then countries usually lose   there are so many problems i do n't know where to begin    gt in part by opening up public services to private business   privatization often goes badly they are hiding that and privatization as the only possible future    well at the beginning the ftas nafta and gats mandated the privatization of most public services in countries that signed them with services everything you ca n't drop on your foot especially some of the add on documents to gats that was in 1995 it contains a they all do   which said that countries could not change anything if it was a move back towards public ownership and control in the case of services they frame that as bad as a theft from businesses   so typically says things like they can not create any new public services and if there was any money involved in the market sector at all that it would have to be files in tiny steps no going back to public services allowed    but of course people do nt know that and often do n't believe it when told for example do you believe me when i tell you that s the reason us health care is so     can you see how and why they might lie about what they politicians can do can do about things because they want to win elections by promising things like affordable health but also hide the ugly act that they gave away the programs starting in 1995    the ftas that we can read the early ones tried to do it by being to non they are so complicated and ambiguous only a few people really know what they demanded at least up until recently now they are top secret really secret only the 600 lobbyists have access    now a growing number of people especially in europe seem to realize this is really scary and a red flag but its not because the news was any help its because of the net the media especially in the us has been completely unhelpful they do nt cover this at all ttip is a huge controversy but i have a feeling the worst one is tisa which has remained largely out of the news except for wikileaks and the financial services chapter just one chapter is known and its an old version   now they want in tisa to greatly expand the scope of these ftas to millions of service watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 in a huge number of countries countries want things like the us wants to be able to charge more money for drugs and they want to force other countries to allow us companies into their markets for example insurance or financial instruments it seems that they are trying to deregulate banking when it should be re regulated to avoid a repeat of the 2008 gfc another thing the us wants is to limit generic drugs and make it easier for companies to open factories send contractors etc elsewhere   its not always a good thing to open markets up to   in many cases it could lead to substantial job losses as it has in central america after america crisis belies empty

for person a to be protected meaning able to recover some or all of the money should the other party try to welsh on the deal the two of them must have entered into a valid binding contract where both parties acknowledge and agree to the debt and the terms such a contract is subject to the statute of frauds a collection of laws governing contracts which is mostly borrowed from english common law the basics are that in all cases a contract is only formed when both parties agree technically when one party accepts an offer made by the other party both the offer and acceptance must be made sincerely for a contract once entered to be enforceable proof of the contract 's existence and terms must itself exist certain types of transactions real estate large amounts of money require contracts to be in written form and witnessed by a trusted third party in most cases this party is required to be a notary public and contracts must have a certain amount of quid pro quo contracts that provide a unilateral benefit can be thrown out on a case by case basis a contract that simply states that person b owes person a money without stating what benefit person a had provided person b in return for the money in this case a gives b the money to begin with is unenforceable the benefits must of course be legal on both sides a contract to deliver 5 tons of cocaine will not be upheld by any court in any free country and neither will any contract attempting to enforce money kickbacks bribery etc though some toe the line one could argue that a signing bonus is tantamount to bribery in some cases even seemingly benign clauses like escape clauses allowing one party a free out can make the contract unenforceable as they could be abused to the severe detriment of one party there are also jurisdiction specific rules such as limits on finance charges for debts not owed to a bank a bar for instance can not charge 10 on an outstanding tab in the united states this is huge for your example because if person a had specified an interest rate in excess of the allowed rate for non bank lenders not only will the contract get thrown out even though person b agreed to the terms but person a could find themselves on the hook for punitive damages payable to person b far in excess of the contracted amount given that the agreement meets all tests of validity for a contract if either party fails to perform in accordance with the contract causing a loss or tort for the other party the injured party can sue generally the two options are strict performance the party is ordered by the court to comply exactly with the terms of the contract or payment of net actual damages and dissolution of the contract in your example if person a had lent person b money strict performance would mean payment of the debt in the installments agreed at the rate agreed actual damages would be payment of the outstanding balance plus current interest charges without any further penalty notice that it 's net damages if person a was to issue the loan in installments and missed one causing person b to suffer damages from the loss of expected cash flow directly resulting in their failure to pay according to the terms then person b 's proven damages are subtracted from a 's very often the plaintiff in a suit to recover money can end up owing the defendant for a prior failure to perform there are further laws governing bankruptcy basically if the other person can not satisfy the contract and can not pay damages they will pay what they can and the contract is terminated with prejudice no blood from a

ask for documentation proving the amount they say you were overpaid and ask for time to review their claim if it is a large amount that they can prove you owe and if you were staying then you could ask for the repayment to be spread over multiple pay checks this would avoid the situation where you could get a very small check or even a check for zero because you are leaving you could ask for time to reimburse them but do n't count on them agreeing to that deal   the lesson is to save all time cards especially ones in which your hours are not consistent also save all pay stubs for the year what you should do now is download all the time card and pay info on the website before you lose access to it these should be saved on your home machine or printed and kept at home check to see if they made any time card adjustments many systems keep track of all changes made by the employee and by management both before and after the employee signs the time card if there are change you should be able to ask them to explain the changes

i do n't think 's explanation is correct   a trailing lit sell order adjusts downwards i.e. if you place the order with an price in it 's trigger price of and a trailing amount of 6.00 then assuming the ask is 100.00 will add the trailing amount to the ask price and if it 's less than the trigger price it will adjust so in my example if the market ask goes straight up to nothing will be adjusted the trigger is touched and the limit order will be placed see below if on the the other hand the market goes down to then amt + ask is if it goes further down to then the trigger price will be adjusted to because it 's less than the current trigger and so on for the lit part you have either an absolute limit price you can enter or you have an offset limit which will be subtracted from the trigger price in which case it is adjusted as well so back to my example the trigger is now and the limit offset is say 1.00 so my limit order would be placed at if the ask ever touches and that in turn is only visible if the bid touches because it 's limit if touched for a buy just use the same explanation with some swapped roles the trigger price adjust upwards when the trailing amount plus bid is larger than the current trigger and the limit offset will be added to the trigger price edit also quite succinct and worth having a look at guesswork highly subjective as for why this might be good well you have to believe in momentum strategies i.e. a market that goes down will continue to go down if you believe that and you believe in mean reversion as well then a trailing limit order can assist you in not buying selling but closer to the mean   i 've never used it that way though what i have done even just now to get the explanation right is to place trailing buy and sell orders simultaneously   you will find that you can just go in with estimates and because the adjustments will go towards each other you will end up with a narrowing band of trigger prices as opposed to trailing stop orders which will give you a widening band of trigger prices   if you believe in and then this can be one easy way to profit from it   i 've just sold eurusd for and bought it back at with a trailing amount of and a limit offset of within the time of writing this

you have heard the old adage buy low sell high right that sounds so obvious that you 'd have to wonder why they would ever bother such an expression it should rank up there with do n't walk in front of a moving car on the duh scale of advice well your question demonstrates exactly why it is n't quite so obvious in the real world and that people need to be reminded of it   so in your example the stock prices are currently low relative to what they have been so per that adage do you sell or buy when prices are low hint it is n't sell yes your gut is going to tell you the exact opposite thanks to the fact that our brains are unfortunately wired to make us susceptible to the loss aversion fallacy when the market has undergone a big drop is the worst time to stop contributing buying stocks   this example might help get your brain and gut to agree a little more easily if you were talking about any other non investment commodity cars for instance   your question equates to i really need a car but the prices have been dropping like crazy lately     maybe i should wait until the car dealers start raising their prices again before i buy one dollar cost averaging as littleadv suggested if you have an automatic payroll deduction for your retirement account you are getting the benefit of dollar cost averaging because you are investing the same amount on a scheduled interval you are buying more shares when they are cheap and fewer when they are expensive it is like an automatic buy low strategy is built into the account the alternative which you are implying is a market timing strategy under this strategy instead of investing regularly you try to get in and out of investments right before they go up drop there are two major flaws with this approach    1 your brain will work against you see above and encourage you to do the exact opposite of what you should be doing    2 unless you are this strategy is n't much better than gambling if you are lucky it can work but because of 1 the odds are stacked against you

someone posted a very insightful article on reddit a while back that basically explained the whole cable pricing model and why a la carte would n't work or would be so prohibitively expensive that nobody would go for it    iirc the breakdown was that basically a few super popular channels and live sports in the standard $ 100/mo package helped subsidize the rest of the less popular channels       most of the niche channels probably could n't exist in an a la carte environment unless they were ridiculously cheap and if they were ridiculously cheap they would n't be able to generate enough revenue to stay afloat    also how would the pricing work   could i subscribe to amc for 1 hour a week to watch mad men   or would i be locked into subscribing for a minimum of a day week month       imho what makes more sense is to allow people to subscribe to individual shows like rss feeds

these have been around for decades in the 80 's and 90 's they had you setup small ads in local newspapers and you would sell a brochure tells people how to make money or solve some other problem the idea was that money would roll in the more ads you placed the more money you made in the late 90 's they had you setup a small website instead of a small newspaper advertisement but the rest was the same they were also done with ebay as the medium now they are live streams   most of the money made is by the people selling you the course materials to show you exactly how to make money some of the people pitching these ideas though books websites and were able to update their to change with the medium but the end result was always the same most people did n't make serious cash   the initial description of how it works is done for free and is n't enough information to know how to do it the real secrets are after you pay for the advanced course of course to really make them work you need the expensive coaching sessions

give me your money i will invest it as i see fit a year later i will return the capital to you plus half of any profits or losses this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses think about incentives if you wanted an investment where your losses were only half as bad but your gains were only half as good then you could just invest half your assets in a risk free investment so if you want this hypothetical instrument because you want a different risk profile you do n't actually need anything new to get it and what does the fund manager get out of this arrangement she does n't get anything you do n't she just gets half your gains most of which she needs to set aside to be able to pay half your losses the discrepancy between the gains and losses she gets to keep which is exactly equal to your gain or loss she could just invest her own money to get the same thing but wait the fund manager did n't need to provide any capital she got to play with your money for free and keep half the profits not a bad deal for her perhaps here 's the problem no one cares about your thousands of dollars the costs of dealing with you accounting for your share talking to you on the phone legal expenses when you get angry the paperwork when you need to make a withdrawal for some dental work mailing statements and so on will exceed the returns that could be earned with your thousands of dollars and then the sec would probably get involved with all kinds of regulations so you with your humble means and limited experience is n't constantly getting screwed over by the big fund complying with the sec is going to cost the fund manager something the fund manager would have to charge a small administrative fee to make it worthwhile   and that 's called a mutual fund but if you have millions of free capital willing to give out people take notice is there an instrument where a bunch of people give a manager capital for free and then the investors and the manager share in the gains and losses yes hedge funds and this is why only the rich and powerful can participate in them only they have enough capital to make this arrangement beneficial for the fund manager

i believe the worst part about surface is running windows 8   it 's terrible   horrible   and yes most of the terrible experience for users is that everything is all different now for little reason just like shifting to the continual interface revamp of every version of office since 2007   change for change 's sake   users are saying no thanks   i know not all of it is change for change 's sake and i know about the requirement for a new os to handle a touch based interface i get that   but users have too much interface change fatigue and are getting tired of paying more and getting less all the while having to whole systems of interface design that does n't truly add to their productivity especially because the next interface change will occur in only 12 24 months   the interface is a wonderful waste of space just when every device now made has a much smaller vertical resolution than horizontal formats   so take up much more vertical space so now the user can not see what they 're working on   simply brilliant   or they could have put the off to the side where they would be out of the way maybe that 's the next scheduled interface change   put a touch based windows 7 os on surface and i believe you 'd see an instant jump in sales   part of my business is fixing building computers for people   many of them have simply purchased the latest laptop computer whatever they could find in stores and when they attempt to use their nifty new speed machine they face continual frustration with the bizarre confusing and seemingly disconnected double interface with windows 8   the bugs have them utterly baffled and using skype is a disaster since they can no longer figure out how to quickly tell skype to use the in system microphone and for the 13th time this month when receiving a call like they used to be able to do never mind that skype continually forgets these settings as usual   they also have to create some pointless microsoft account to use the software hardware they just purchased   why   people are n't interested in being a card carrying member of the mickey mouse club anymore so why require it of them   they generally need to get something productive done and all this bullshit stands in their way   three separated versions of email that are n't connected at all behind the scenes is a recipe for confusion   another part of my business is industrial design and with that the creation of productive comfortable interfaces   here 's my secret good interface design really is n't that difficult you just need to listen to what the users want   bam   now even microsoft can turn things around

yes it 's normal if you buy your own disability insurance with after tax money any payout you get is non taxable if your employer buys your disability insurance with their own money any payout you get is taxable since the payout is not 100 of your pre disability income most folks strongly prefer that the payout be non taxable to achieve this i pay the premiums on behalf of my employees including myself and then add that premium to their salary as a taxable benefit in effect i paid it to them then took it from them and used it to buy the insurance it has no impact on my corporate taxes since i can either deduct premiums or salaries same either way this ensures they wo n't pay tax if they should collect and i have had people collect and it was non taxable to them

in the netherlands specifically there are several reasons to pay extra off on your mortgage first house prices have dropped significantly in the last several years   they are rising slowly now but it 's region specific and you can still borrow more than 100 of the price of the house   under these conditions if you choose to sell your house and the outstanding mortgage amount is greater than the value of your house you are left with a gap to finance   i think the rules have changed recently around this allowing you to finance this gap with a new mortgage but this is not a good idea   the tax implications of this are likely to be complicated in the long run and your new house may not cover this gap for some time second the less you owe on your house the lower mortgage rates you can get   mortgages in the netherlands usually fall into categories based on percentage of the auction price at a foreclosure sale   if you pay more of your mortgage off you may qualify for a lower interest rate possibly making refinancing interesting   this is especially important if interest rates continue to drop but the value of your house does not increase or even decreases third if you choose to keep your house and rent it out the banks in the netherlands have very strict rules on this if you want to do it above board   i 've read that some banks require the mortgage amount nb not the value you may have built up in a linked savings or insurance account to be less than 50 of the foreclosure auction price   also related to point 2 if you have something other than a linear or annuity mortgage you will need to refinance to do this as the tax advantages around savings mortgages do not apply if it is not used as your own residence finally if you choose to sell and you are in the happy position of having the value of your house be greater than the value of your mortgage you have an there may still be some obstacles   any value you have accumulated in a linked savings or life insurance account is not available until after you sell your house   extra value derived purely from the difference between mortgage value and sale price may be easier to deal with edit as a final note i 've made extra payments on both a linked life insurance and a linked savings account   in one the principal paid each month reduced and the mortgage lifetime stayed the same   in the other the principal paid each month stayed the same and the lifetime reduced   in both cases interest payments were less each month   i would contact your mortgage provider to understand what the expected impact of extra payments will be

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

wrong people create money by lending it to the banks   banks are just exchanges between depositors and lenders i.e. an iou exchange   when you deposit $ 1000 you loan the bank $ 1000 and the normal way you deposit $ 1000 is by an iou of $ 1000 by someone else like your employer not by showing up in the bank with cash   nb checks are ious   the issuing central bank do create money if the normal banks have more customers wanting to borrow than lend however that source of money may be raised by the central bank issuing bonds rather than new money

that 's an interesting assessment   i had a good read   i suppose it would be weird if we had more government   we only have 4.5 million people   i suspect effective government is a fairly low bar as we have plenty of improvement to make in a range of metrics   we are damaging the environment because of a lack of regulation on farmers activities   many rivers in the south island are not safe to swim in now   we have very high and growing income inequality   we are behind the times on drug reform and our incarceration rates and rates are an embarrassment   but importantly our system of governance is more representative we restrict campaign spending to small amounts of public money you see a few billboards and ads on tv which is proportional to the support that party has    we allow no outside funding although there has been some instances where private businesses have attempted to influence elections and the various parties are semi frequently caught and fined for trying to skirt these restrictions   i think that 's the main reason we manage to get things pretty right in a trend towards good policy over time

now i have been trying to figure out how to split the money that we both earn from what i can see there are several concepts but none of them really seems ideal to me there is nothing fair or unfair in such arrangements it is what you both agree you can try and make this as scientific as possible but then there is no golden rule   for example your girlfriend makes 2200 now and due to child she is making 1100 the child is both of your responsibility so you need to compensate half of her salary loss 550 and she takes the other half if you hire a nanny to look after you kinds it would say cost you 500 but your girlfriend is doing that job so she should get additional 500 from common pot plus due to loss of few years in looking after the children she has a lost opportunity in career growth i.e. she may indefinitely make less money than she can so one gets into all kinds of theories and analysis and any arrangements will have some or the other gaps   so my suggestion do n't get too scientific about it just talk it out as to what you both feel how this should be and arrive it it is something every individual has to agree it also make sense to have the large assets or assets that matter like house car etc in clear title and who gets what in case you decide to separate other should be incidental

my wife and i use a digital form of the envelope system we call it a budget we record how much we want to allocate each month to spend for each category of expense in a spread sheet why use prepaid cards why not open a bunch of bank accounts and use debit cards from each if you want to separate the money you could also keep a ledger for each account that you spend from on a smart phone or even in a physical ledger   the reason for the envelope method is that it psychologically hurts some people to physically part with cash once you it in some factor you lose what is the primary touted benefit and it 's no longer the envelope system the secondary benefit that once the budget for one category is gone it 's gone is only as good as the discipline you have to not rob cash from another envelope why is this any easier than the discipline of not debiting beyond the bottom of the ledger so a budget is a digital version of the envelope system once the physical cash is removed from the equation it 's definitely not the envelope system sorry for the contrarian take on this question but i 've never been a fan of the envelope system for many of the reasons you have described i guess i 'm too young for the cash psychology to work for me

for new shares to be successfully sold the price has to be below market price if you currently own shares of that company you should always get an option to buy those newly sold shares at that discounted price the number of options depends on the relative number of shares you hold lets say you own 100 out of 1000 shares currently priced at $ 10 100 new shares are to be sold at $ 9 since you are holding 10 of all shares you have the option i.e. the right to buy 10 new cheaper shares 10 of 100 before anybody else can buy them theoretically the money you save by getting the shares at a discounted price is equal to the money you lose by the share 's value being diluted so if you 're a shareholder and the company is increasing it 's capital you 're given the right to go with it

are financial institutions less likely to lend me money because of my age yes   but they are especially unlikely to loan you money because you have little income    or because they know i avoid interest by paying things off aggressively this wo n't affect them   but you might ask yourself how much credit history you have   credit history can include all of loans credit cards rent utilities etc   you mention three loans   but you do n't mention rent or utilities   you may simply not have much credit history even if what you do have is good    but again the biggest thing that they will look at is your income history   if you have a small income then it does n't matter what your payment history is   they do n't want to loan money to people who need money   they want to loan money to people who do n't need to borrow but are instead bringing a future purchase into the present    the ideal recipient is someone who has a high income and spends it all every month   such a person is likely to borrow heavily but be able to keep up the payments    obsessing about your ability to borrow is probably the wrong approach   instead focus on how you can meet your goals without borrowing   eventually your ability to pay will catch up   then they 'll offer you money   of course you might not need it then    note that when i say little income i 'm talking about their perspective   you may be fully on track and making decent money or even very good money for your age   but they 're looking for people who are mature in their careers and regularly bringing home large sums but who spend it faster than they can get it

gt;i hear lots of interesting stories about teaching the most recent involves an experimental program where the teacher performance is n't graded on student outcomes but how well they 're following the narrative defined by the program every few years teachers are handed new programs that the district curriculum people bought and told you 're going to teach $ subject using this program now sometimes those programs work better for different groups of students the ones that it was evaluated with do great the ones in different neighborhoods are failed by the program the programs are implemented district wide and the teachers are told not to deviate from the programs   nothing really new there at all and it is n't local control it is the opposite standard central planning typically driven by federal and state department of education bureaucrats in combination with teacher 's union officials but i am being redundant because they are one and the same there being a revolving door and then it is pressed down on the school by an administrator who is attempting to please the higher ups and/or to guarantee the flow of funds linked to said program on one of their several ridiculously inane metrics   gt;a recent example from the town i grew up in   that letter is hilariously sad and not for the reasons that you think   this teacher with a masters degree in reading from which i assume they believe they understand reading better than anyone   be interesting to know the last time this master of reading actually read a book that was n't strictly required the answer is probably a decade or more ago   this teacher is really just one central planning disciple who is to a different central planning program than the one they themselves were indoctrinated into   the whole thing is very revealing regarding the sheer lunacy of the scientific and scientific education paradigm   this teacher like the administrators the teacher is concerned about the wrong things there is really no concern about whether kids are learning how to read and to enjoy utilize reading which is a rudimentary skill kids can pick up on their own provided they have n't had it turned into torture by some brainless amp teacher   but rather it is all about what to use for reading language arts   the phrasing of that question and the misguided emphasis of it reveals the fact that the teacher really does n't have a clue how to truly get kids reading and understanding the english language   basically he she just wants to work a program by a semi mindless rote and is really only pissed because the programs keep being changed on them    fortunately a least a small part of the kids will learn to read mostly due to authors industry putting out things they are interested in all hail jk amp collins not because of but despite the formal schooling systems attempts to teach them

do n't forget inflation    with a roth 401k or ira you do n't pay any taxes on inflationary or real gains   you pay taxes at the beginning and then no more taxes unless you invest money after you distributed from it    with a regular taxable investment account not a 401k or ira you pay taxes on the initial amount   and then you pay taxes on the gains both inflationary and real   so you effectively pay taxes on the inflated principal twice   once at initial earning and once when it shows up as inflationary gains   i 'll give an example later    with a traditional 401k or ira you pay no taxes on the initial amount   you pay taxes on the distributed amount   that includes taxes on gains but it only taxes them once not twice   all the taxes are paid at distribution time    here 's a example   this is not a real example with real numbers but the numbers should n't be ridiculously off   they could happen   i 'm going to ignore variation and pretend that all the numbers will be the same each year so as to simplify the math    so you pay a 25 marginal tax rate and want to invest $ 12,000 plus any tax savings    roth   $ 12,000 principal traditional ira trad   $ 16,000 principal with $ 4000 in tax savings taxable investment account tia   $ 12,000 principal let 's assume that you make an 8 rate of return and inflation is 3   both numbers are possible although higher and lower numbers have occurred in the past   that gives you returns of $ for the roth and tia cases and a return of $ for the trad case   pay no annual taxes on the roth or trad cases   pay 25 marginal tax on the tia case that 's $ 240    balances after one year    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ inflation decreases the value of the roth and tia cases by $ 360 in the roth and tia cases   and by $ 480 in the trad case    ten years of inflationary gains cumulative    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ net buildup including inflationary gains roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ real value minus inflation to maintain spending power    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ now take out $ 3000 per year after taxes   that 's $ 3000 in the the roth and tia cases as you already paid the taxes   in the trad case that 's $ 4000 because you have to pay 25 tax which will cost $ 1000    do that for five years and the new balances are   roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ the tia will run out in the 8th year   the roth and trad will both run out in the 9th year    so to summarize   the traditional ira initially grows the most   the tia grows the least   the tia is tax advantaged over the traditional ira at that point but it still runs out first   the roth ira grows about the same as the traditional after taxes are included    note that i left out the matching contribution from a 401k   that would help both those options   i assumed that the marginal tax rate would be 25 on the traditional ira distributions   it might be only 15 which would increase the advantage of the traditional ira   i assumed that the 15 rate on capital returns would still be true for the entire period   if that is increased the tia option gets a lot worse    inflation could be higher or lower   as stated earlier the tia account is hit the worst by inflation

i 'm a software engineer not an academic   from the way you have viewed things that everything can be measured by quantity you are in fact coming from an academic perspective the same as the idiot manager mba 's   gt;my assumption is that you can measure things like average on a checkout line or number of widgets assembled on an assembly line and possibly the defect rate of those widgets or pounds of fries dumped in the trash because they got cold before being served relative to fries served is this not the case   no it is not the case certainly not as you seem to imagine it   a single fast food worker does not simply stand in front of the french fry making fries all day long and the metric of the fries dumped in the trash because they got cold before being served relative to fries served is used in the management of the overall operation how many fries to make and when but they are emphatically not used as a performance measure for the general workers how could   they be the worker does not decide how many fries to make the system and the shift manager makes those decisions   likewise with the number of widgets assembly on the assembly line again the defect rate is known and typically only varies when something major has gone wrong with one of the machines processes seldom is the actual worker responsible for anything major as far as defects people with qa responsibilities might be for failing to catch a bad batch a signal that they are likely simply not doing their job at all rather than the quality of work but the actual quantities produced are a matter of scheduling amp planning via systems aka or ii and erp   so as i said your ignorance which has then turned into arrogance is showing   gt;in my field we measure things like the change in average time to launch or the revenue impact of features or the change in performance metrics etc    lol   the attempts to measure software engineering are among the most failed category of performance measurement   everyone in management basically keeps repeating the same stupid mistakes that were already proven worthless in prior iterations   gt;they're all proxy measurements though poor performers are generally much easier to spot than high performers mediocre performers can generally get through things but may not earn promotions etc   do n't kid yourself poor performers in terms of actual quality amp quantity of code will often still be promoted for several political reasons they are probably better at managing up than the better coders are iow they suck up to the idiot manager mba boss better regurgitate the latest party line of buzzwords phrases on a regular basis are not seen as troublesome adamant on quality or consistency and are seen as team players etc   about the only poor performers that will be easily spotted are those who are totally incompetent unqualified and really they are an indication of poor management in that they should never have been hired in the first place   and the true high performers in software are in fact fairly easy to spot provided you know what to look for and do n't get caught up in ridiculously inane and worthless proxy performance metrics which are all too often how well often did you kiss the boss 's arse comply with some meaningless process steps

why are there so many stock exchanges in the world   the simple answer is that there is a lot of money to be made by charging fees to facilitate the trading of securities but there are other factors at play here relating to new technologies trading volumes have increased rapidly in recent years   according to this data in 1997 6.5 billion shares were traded on us exchanges   by 2015 this number had increased to billion shares   there are a number of reasons for this rapid increase in volumes   most significant would be the introduction of new technologies that allow for high volume high frequency trading this increase in activity has be accompanied by an increase in the number of stock exchanges   as cqm points out in his answer there has been considerable consolidation in the ownership of legacy exchanges   for example the nyse merged with in 2007 and the combined group is now owned by the exchange which also owns numerous smaller stock exchanges as well as a number of derivative commodities exchanges however this consolidation in ownership has been more than matched by the creation of many virtual exchanges    in north america these virtual exchanges are called alternative trading systems   in europe they are called trading facilities    these new virtual exchanges sometimes referred to as dark pools have begun to significantly eat away at the volumes of the legacy exchanges   if you look at the data linked above you will see that the total volume of shares traded on legacy exchanges actually peaked in 2008 and has since then has decreased   this coincides roughly with the appearance of the virtual exchanges and the new high frequency trading methods   according to this paper from the sec site dated 2013 alternative trading systems accounted for of total volumes in 2012   this will have increased rapidly in the years since 2012   it is this loss of business that has prompted the consolidation in the ownership of the legacy exchanges these new exchange are conceptually the same as the legacy exchanges and must play by the same regulatory rules

well taking a short position directly in real estate is impossible because it 's not a fungible asset so the only way to do it is to trade in its derivatives investment fund stock indexes and commodities correlated to the real estate market for example materials related to construction     it 's hard to find those because real estate funds usually do n't issue securities and rely on investment made directly with them another factor should be that those who actually do have issued securities are n't usually popular enough for dealers and market makers to invest in it who make it possible to take a short position in exchange for some spread so what you can do is you can go through all the existing real estate funds and find out if any of them has a broker that let 's you short it in other words which one of them has securities in the financial market you can buy or sell one other option is looking for real estate property derivatives like this particular example personally i would try to find other securities that may in some way correlate with the real estate market even if they look a bit far fetched to be related like commodities and stock from companies in construction and real estate management etc and trade those because these have in most of the cases more liquidity hope this answers your question

market makers traders and value investors would be who i 'd suspect for buying the stock that is declining some companies stocks can come down considerably which could make some speculators buy the stock at the lower price thinking it may bounce back soon short sellers are out to sell borrowed stocks that if the stock is in free fall unless the person that shorted wants to close the position they would let it ride worthless stocks are a bit of a special case and quite different than the crash of 1929 where various blue chip stocks like those of the dow jones had severe declines thus the companies going down would be like apple coca cola and other large companies that people would be shocked to see come down so much yet there are some examples in recent history if one remembers enron or worldcom stocks getting delisted tend to cause some selling and there are some speculators may buy the stock believing that the shares may be worth something only to lose the money possibly as one could look at the bankrupt cases of airlines and car companies to study some recent cases here circuit breakers are worth noting as these are cases when trading may be halted because of a big swing in prices that it is believed stopping the market may cause things to settle down

i struggled with this one at first    it 's easiest if you temporarily ignore the mathematical machinery of and go back to the derivation that black and scholes provide in their 1973 paper they basically show that when you construct a portfolio consisting of a long position in the option the one being priced and a short position on the replicating portfolio consisting of shares of stock and cash in the risk free bank account then that portfolio will be entirely risk less and hence will earn the risk free rate of interest this makes intuitive sense if you think about it every change in the value of the option is going to be countered by an opposite change in the replicating portfolio by no arbitrage that composite portfolio the option + the replicating portfolio must therefore earn the risk free rate    the fact that the composite portfolio earns the risk free rate provides the connection to martingale pricing    recall that a martingale is basically a stochastic process that has no drift only volatility here it 's useful to think of the drift as being the risk   premium or return of a particular asset like the stock    what martingale pricing theory says is that to find the price of the option we 1 discount the value of the replicating portfolio by the cash bond the asset and 2 turn the stochastic process of the risky asset in the replicating portfolio into a martingale this move intuitively makes sense because the black scholes derivation shows that the replicating portfolio + the option must earn the risk free rate but if you divide the value of the black scholes replicating portfolio by the asset you 're going to cancel out that risk free rate e.g. have a martingale   i 'm not a so please correct me if i 've something up in my explanation    i say basically because there are some technical conditions that need to be fulfilled but that 's generally true

the basis of homeowner 's insurance pricing is the or amount of insurance   this pertains to the cost to rebuild the dwelling in the event of a total loss   the standard coverages e.g. contents loss of use medical payments liability are calculated relative to this amount   consequently the is selected by the value of the dwelling   this is why it is important that if parts of the dwelling are upgraded that the cost of those upgrades are taken into account the question is not one of denying claims should a loss occur unless the nature of the upgrade is such that policy should not have been underwritten in the first place   this can happen if for example the homeowner builds an extension onto the house that damages the structural integrity of the dwelling in the end the is still just an estimate but the takeaway is that like scheduled personal property jewelry rare collectibles or other endorsements every home and homeowner has slightly different insurance needs and it is in your interest to tailor your coverage to be as accurate as possible in reflecting your needs   insurance is not a one size fits all product consequently the selection of sufficient coverage for your mix of risks is only prudent   now if after you get a quote back and you find that the premium is too high you can typically select a deductible that can reduce it but you have to consider what amount of exposure you are willing to retain   you should shop around too   different insurers use different methods and criteria to price their products so even if the coverage is substantially similar the premiums may vary   for example some insurers ask whether you own a dog exposure to liability claims but others do not   some insurers put more weight on your dwelling 's geographic location exposure to fire theft wind hail than others

a home is an investment but the value it returns is n't primarily financial $ $ they are consumption a place to live this gives it different characteristics than other investments e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home does n't do much to assist your financial well being and future income and is n't necessarily the responsible thing to do you may get some capital gains typically in line with inflation sometimes less sometimes more but those are n't the most reliable and it 's difficult to realize them it involves selling your house and moving its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent but if you 're still working full time and can expect cost of living increases that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to say someone living on a fixed income but as for treating it as a low risk investment that 's very problematic real low risk investments are things like government bonds where you ca n't lose principal unless you 're going to live into your house until the day you die the real estate crash should have you of any notion that housing values never go down rather your house is a single illiquid investment imagine if you will going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties also you ca n't sell any of it until you move away and the transaction fee will take something like 3 still sound safe moreover it 's exactly the wrong kind of risk your house 's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy this means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time it totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations safety is not the way you should be thinking of it though

i think the biggest reason is price it 's a lot cheaper now than it was to offer these   that 's because for the most part when you get a credit score for free you 're not getting a true fico score   you 're getting instead a vantagescore vantagescore was created by the three credit bureaus and as such they can offer it without paying fair isaac a licensing fee   that makes it a lot cheaper to offer and while it 's not absolutely identical to fico or more accurately to any of the fico provided scores it 's close enough for most peoples purpose and of course undoubtedly fair isaac has some price pressure on their side now that vantage is big enough that many people see them as fungible   as such they 've had to make it easier or they 'd lose business no longer being a monopolist the other relevant piece here is that probably in many of these cases they 're really just offering you what experian would give you directly so it 's just a cross marketing thing where experian or perhaps another bureau gets access to you as a customer so they can up sell you id theft insurance and whatnot while the bank gets to offer the free score

gt;but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans   which means the insurance bought by employees must get a whole lot cheaper i guess as there would be direct competition and lots of shopping around   gt and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up   so the employers suddenly do n't need to compete on the employee marketplace i mean in times with high unemployment not but this is to this in times with high unemployment they do n't need to compete with benefits either i guess   although in reality i agree with you let me offer a different but supporting perspective it is much easier to haggle a salary than to haggle anything else i 've always lived in european countries with different amounts of government mandated paid holidays and i have never ever heard of a person who a week of extra holiday in his package or a vip level additional private health insurance above the basic social security paid one the one that gets people more comfortable hospital rooms and better hospital food etc if people buy it here they always buy it privately not by the employer   or really anything but money the only extra i ever heard about is the private usage of a company car and even that is rare and that has more to do with easier accounting than anything else sometimes people get lunch tickets but that is usually because they are tax free   i do n't know why but it seems to be the general law either the government mandates some non monetary benefit or the employer decides to provide it because of competition but people privately can pretty much never haggle for it not even when they are badly needed strange   a possible explanation business are used to buying stuff with a simple monetary price as a buyer you have no other responsibilities than to pay for example a programming company will not demand that the client gives them a detailed specification they will gladly write one for a price so if anyone comes and tries to sell something and wants anything else but money it gets weird and i figure it is the same for employees

i think what you really want to look into is put options you can essentially replicate the same thing without worrying about margin calls check out this site a quick glance seems to show it to be pretty good   the way you would limit downside risk is to buy a put option allowing you to sell anytime within the next n months for the current price assuming american this will allow you to limit downside risk however potential profits do go down due to fees as another answer suggests this could be cost prohibitive this type of strategy is also known as a protective put if you wanted to be more refined you could use 's bands although you have to be looking for that specific outcome also due to complexity this can become a taxing in terms of time invested and risky if you are wrong investment either way i think you need to study payoff curves a little more

basically a company who provides health insurance for their employees provides it as part of the employee 's salary package this is an expense by the company in its pursuit of making income in general tax deductions are available on any expense incurred in deriving income the exception is when social policy allows deductions for other types of expenses if you pay for your own health insurance individually then this expense is not an expense for you to derive your income and as such is not tax deductible

slightly abbreviated version of the guidance from california state law limits credit check or application screening fees landlords   can charge prospective tenants and specifies what landlords must do when accepting these types of fees cal code   here are key provisions i am not a lawyer but it would seem you have two options if you catch a landlord violating these rules an idea to avoid the whole problem in the first place get a copy of your credit report yourself and take a copy with you to meet the landlord if they want an application fee ask why they need it making it clear you know the above law if they say for a credit report offer to give them a copy in lieu of the fee

an equity tax does seem to make some sense it would probably help to stave off deflation as well because it would encourage growth and investment where people would otherwise choose to sit on their money or worse   an equity tax on currency or liquid investments of even .5 apr would have a huge effect on the behavior of corporations sadly the largest of them would have the resources to avoid the tax by keeping all of their money out of the country

assuming no debt as you 've specified in the comments to your question the assets should generally be distributed proportional to ownership share   but without any sort of agreement there might be contention on what each investor 's share is and that might get fought out in court   with a corporation issuing shares the corporate charter probably defines the relationship between different classes of shares or specifies only one class   for a partnership though you could conceivable have people making claims of ownership stake based on labor in addition to any cash that they put up   messy if there 's no up front agreement

first check with your lender to see if the terms of the loan allow early payoff   if you are able to payoff early without penalty with the numbers you are posting i would hesitate to refinance this is simply because if you actually do pay 5k month on this loan you will have it paid off so quickly that refinancing will probably not save you much money back of the napkin math at 5k month has you paying 60k pounds a year which will payoff in about 5 years   even if you can afford 5k month i would recommend not paying extra on this debt ahead of other high interest debt or saving in a tax advantaged retirement account if these other things are being taken care of and you have liquid assets cash for emergencies i would recommend paying off the mortgage without refinancing

is right if a halt is in place then no trading will occur simple as that but in the practice of risk management it is a little different want to remind you that you are assuming that trading is halted immediately upon the drop in price that does n't always happen so if there is any time between the actual price drop and halt of trading then it is possible that your order will be filled depending on how liquid your security is also not every security has circuit breakers in place and the exact requirements to trigger a breaker is not public information   in some cases trades are ordered to be rolled back reversed by the exchange but this is usually reserved for institutional traders who make some sort of mistake   this article below mentions day traders who bought at or near the bottom of the may 6 2010 flash crash this was before circuit breakers but i think it 's a good story for someone looking to understand the finer workings of the electronic market

the various levels of government have laws determining what a protected class is    federally wiki are the protected classes under federal law it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their membership of any   of those demographics on the state and local level many states have additional protections for example my home state of il explicitly forbids discrimination based on someone 's sexual orientation or gender identity classes which are not explicitly forbidden on the federal level   hate speech is protected under the first amendment so long as you 're not violence that caveat is very murky and i am not qualified enough to speak on what is and is n't violence from a legal perspective i just know that the caveat exists   the key distinction that i think a lot of people misunderstand and are confused about is that while hate speech is protected under the first amendment like all other forms of speech it is not a protected class meaning i can say whatever hateful rhetoric i want but non government entities are free to discriminate against me     i can absolutely be fired if my employer finds out i am posting on facebook advocating for the death of black lives matter activists or saying stuff like terrorist immigrant go home because political speech is not a protected class i can not be fired for posting a photo of my gay wedding in il because in il sexual orientation is a protected class    does that make sense

this is a very interesting question   unfortunately in the way you wrote the question the answer is no   essentially you would be asking someone to give you a ~20 return for your cash on something that is almost guaranteed when holding your cash only gets them a < 1 return   would anyone take the other side of that deal interestingly though you can to some extent hedge surprises in health care costs   for instance investing in the healthcare industry as david rice suggests is a partial hedge   the prices of those industry stocks already has future expected cost increases included however if costs were to jump even higher than expected you would gain some of the added cost you would pay in healthcare back not that i recommend this strategy as you lose diversification but this is a valid and reasonable reason to slightly overweight american healthcare companies for someone in your situation    note that the wiki article you mention talks about hedging surprises as well   if at planting time the farmer sells a number of wheat futures contracts equivalent to his anticipated crop size he effectively locks in the price of wheat at that time   thinking that way you may actually be able to buy health insurance now for two or three years in the future essentially locking in expected price increases today   probably not the answer you were looking for but the best analogy for what financial hedging truly does

to me it looks pretty good 10 per year is a pretty good return lagging behind the indexes is normal it is hard to beat the indexes over a long period of time the longer the period the lesser the chances to succeed however half a year is a relatively short period of time and you should check your investments a little bit deeper i 'm assuming you 're not invested in one thing so you should check per investment how it is performing if you have funds check each fund against the relevant index for that fund if you have stocks check against the relevant industry indexes etc also check the fees you pay to each fund and the plan they come out of your pocket lowering the return

for whatever it 's worth   judging from the comments in the other answers i think everyone is addressing your question how can you possibly lose money   there are a lot of ways to possibly lose money in the stock market   here are my thoughts   this is a chart of the s&p 500 from about 1996 to about 2012   at the top from the first arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 45   from the top of the second arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 52   it is really easy to look at our sustained bull market and feel   and while i 'll concede that not every company in the index fell over these two periods bear in mind that the s&p500 index is a collection of the 500 largest companies in the united states and the entire index lost half it 's value twice   as the companies contained in the index shrink in value they were replaced by companies that are the new biggest 500 in the country then those fell too and so on and so forth until the entire index lost half value is a funny thing because it is n't necessarily tied to the performance of the business look at the current rosy valuations of all these non earnings tech companies   it could be that a company is still performing very well but there are just no buyers for the stock    so how can you lose money in the stock market   very easily   in a practical sense it 's when you need the money and can no longer weather the storm   people who went out for retirement around 2000 could n't sit around and wait until 2007 for their account values to be replenished   this is why you roll off your stock exposure as you age   as you get older you do n't have time and if you stop having income you can find yourself selling your assets at the least opportune time

i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that well this is n't a meaningful distinction the mutual fund may or may not be in an ira similarly the mutual fund may or may not be in a 401(k however so i 'm going to treat your question as if it 's why would a person get a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that in an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into the same mutual fund in a 401(k same mutual fund same amount of money narrowing your question to the difference between the two types of accounts as stated in your question 's title others have answered that to the extent that you really have no choice other than pick which type of account to use for a given bundle of money other than nobody having mentioned the employer match even if there were no other difference at all in tax treatment it 's pretty typical that 401(k contributions will be matched by free money from the employer no ira can compete with that but that 's not the only choice either many of us contribute to both the 401(k and the ira why because we can i 'm not suggesting that just anybody can but if you max out the employer matching in the 401(k or if you max out the tax advantaged contribution limit in the 401(k and you still have more money that you want to save in a tax advantaged retirement account this year you can do so the ira is available it 's not instead of the 401(k

my advice is that if you 've got the money now to pay off your student loans do so   you 've saved up all of that money in one year 's time   if you pay it off now you 'll eliminate all of those monthly payments you 'll be done paying interest and you should be able to save even more toward your business over the next year over the next year you can get started on your business part time while still working full time to pile up cash toward your business   neither you nor your business will be paying interest on anything and you 'll start out in a very strong position    the interest on your student loans might be tax deductible depending on your situation however this does n't really matter a whole lot in my opinion you 've got about $ 22k in debt and the interest will cost you roughly $ 1k over the next year why pay $ 1k to the bank to gain maybe $ 250 in tax savings starting a business is stressful there will be good times and bad how long will it take you to pay off your debt at $ 250 a month 5 or 6 years probably by eliminating the debt now you 'll be able to save up capital for your business even faster and when you experience some slow times in your business your monthly expenses will be less

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

first of all an ira is a type of account that says nothing about how your money is invested it seems like you are trying to compare an ira with a market etf   like vanguard total market admiral vtsax but the reality is that you can have both depending on your ira some of the investment options may be limited but you will probably be able to find some version of a passive fund following an index you are interested in the ira account is tax advantaged but you may invest the money in your ira in an etf   as for how often a non ira account is taxed and how much that depends on how often you sell if you park your money in an etf and do not sell the irs will not claim any taxes from it the taxable event happens when you sell but if you gain $ 1000 in a year and a day and you decide to sell you will owe $ 150 assuming 15 capital gains tax bringing your earnings down to $ 850 if your investments go poorly and you lose money there will be no capital gains tax to pay

the fact that you are choosing index fund means you are surely not one of those investors who can correctly judge dips but buying on dips is still important you can use a method called dollar value averaging it is better than dollar cost averaging just make sure you apply a lower limit and an upper limit to be more predictable suppose you have 10000 to invest use limits like minimum 200 investment when index is high maximum 600 investment when index is down and when index gives normal returns invest 400 do this for about 2 years more than 2 years is not recommended i myself use this method and benefit a lot

tax cost basis is the amounts you 've spent on developing the product which you has n't deducted yet from previous income from what you 've described it sounds like your cost basis is $ 0 time you spent is not your cost since time is not money the fact that you might have earned something if working at that time but you did n't is irrelevant because potential income that you did n't get is not a loss that you took someone mentioned intangibles in the comments that would be the line of thought of the buyer however since you did n't buy the product but rather developed it you can only deduct the actual expenses you 've incurred that you have n't deducted so far

i 'd like to add that many companies offer divident re investment plans or drips which is basically a regular automatic stock purchase program more info here while your stock broker may offer dividend reinvestment this is not the same as a drip drips are offered directly by the company rather than the stock broker they have the added benefits that the stock purchases are almost always commission free and in some cases the company even offers a discount on the stock price it can take a little more effort to get enrolled in a drip but if you are interested in holding the stock long term this is a good option to consider

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

i ca n't address the psychology of trust involved in your question but here are some common sense guidelines for dealing with your issue make sure you know who you are talking to   call the company you need to speak to via a publicly available phone number an email or something you got in a letter might be from a different source   if you use a website you should be sure you are on the correct website keep careful records   make good notes of each phone call and keep all emails and letters forever note the time name and/or id of the person you spoke to and numbers called in addition to keeping notes on what actions should be done   keep your transmission receipts and shipping tracking numbers too if you are nervous ask them why they want the info   the fraud department should be able to explain it to you   for example they probably want your social because that is how your credit report is identified   if they are going to fix a credit report they will need a social   it is doubtful they would have a good explanation why they need your mother 's name ask for secure transmission or confirm they have it   postal mail is n't so secure but i 'll go out on a limb and say most fax machines today are not really fax machines but software that deals in pdfs   at some point you will have to realize you will have to transmit something   no method is perfect but you can limit your exposure help them do their jobs   if you are understandably nervous consider their motivations corporate profit   but that could very well mean not running afoul of the law and with any luck treating customers the best way they know to earn business   if you the fraud department how can they help you if the id theft was serious enough document your issue for future law enforcement so you getting pulled over for speeding does n't result in you going to jail for whatever crime the other person did   perhaps the fraud department you are dealing with can assist there finally while you work with fraud departments to clear up your name and account work on the other end to limit future damage   freeze your credit   see if you bank or credit card have monitoring   use creditkarma.com or a similar if you can not find a free service   please do n't ever pay for credit monitoring

their is no arbitrage opportunity with buying dividends you 're buying a taxable event this is a largely misunderstood topic the stock always drops by the amount if the dividend on the ex date the stock opens that day trading ex excluding the dividend it then pays out later based in the shareholders on record   there is a lot of talk about price movement and value here that can happen but it 's from trading not from the dividend per se yes sometimes you do see a stock pop the day prior to ex date because people are buying the stock for the dividend but the trading aspect of a stock is determined by supply and demand from people trading the stock   the dividends are paid out from the owners equity section of the balance sheet this is a return of equity to shareholders the idea is to give owners of the company some of their investment back from when they bought the stock without having the owners sell the shares of the company after all if it 's a good company you want to keep holding it so it will appreciate   another similar way to think of it is like a bonds interest payment   people sometimes forget when trading that these are actual companies meant to be invested in your buying an ownership in the company with your cash   it really makes no difference to buy the dividend or not all other things constant though market activity can add or lose value from trading as normal

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

the idea of education has never been to make stupid people smarter but to make uneducated people educated and ready to serve a greater good as an educated worker and member of the political spectrum   comparative economics tells us that as the manufacturing jobs that used to be in the us move overseas and equalize the wealth of the world with the people working to receive it as this happens jobs in manufacturing will leave the us and their educated and formerly employed workers with it my suggestion is that microsoft takes the already educated and gives them training to function in a new career in return for guaranteed service in the job they have been trained for there is no need to revamp any education system here but only to start a training program which microsoft would benefit greatly from

crisis and volatility benefit financiers and the wealthy even more now than they did then back then anybody left standing could buy at the bottom of a depression while it was those who needed wages to eat who really suffered nowadays arbitrage and derivatives not to mention federal policy make volatility itself a profitable proposition for people with lots of money to invest   that said i do n't think it 's a necessary conclusion from 's statement that he thought those at the top intentionally caused inflation and depression merely that their actions brought it about maybe he was complaining that the economy would be healthier and more stable if it were truly a free market or maybe he was arguing that greed at the top led to imprudent policy

if you 're fiscally responsible go ahead and use a   honestly in all of the horror story experiences i 've seen where someone went into honest details they were trying to skate by with risky decisions at the extreme bottom end of the financial spectrum nearly all of the complaints boil down to overdraft fees for people who run their account down to less than $ 10 and then get upset when something unexpected happens   for example when banks re order purchases from largest to smallest so that users would have to pay a larger quantity of overdraft fees that can literally only happen if you 've tried to spend more than you have in the account it 's mathematically not possible for that to happen any other way so yes i think everyone can agree re ordering is shitty but those overdrafts are also 100 preventable by not trying to spend more than you   most people just want to jump on the gripe train and they are n't going to share the real details of their situation if they even understand them

i was wondering what relations are between brokerage companies and exchanges are brokers representing investors to trade on exchanges yes but a broker may also buy and sell stocks for his own account this is called broker firm for individual investors what are some cons and pros of trading on the exchanges directly versus indirectly via brokers does n't the former save the investors any costs expenses paid to the brokers yes but to trade directly on an exchange you need to register with them that costs money and only a limited number of people can register i believe note that some or all exchanges have their websites where i think trading can be done electronically such as nasdaq and bats can almost all stocks be found and traded on almost every exchange in other words is it possible that a popular stock can only be found and traded on one exchange but not found on the other exchange if needed to be more specific i am particularly interested in the u.s. case and for example apple 's stock yes it is very much possible with smaller companies big companies are usually on multiple exchanges what are your advices for choosing exchange and choosing brokerage companies what exchanges and brokerage companies do you recommend for brokerage companies a beginner can go with discount broker for sophisticated investors can opt for full service brokers usually your bank will have a brokerage firm for exchanges it depends if you are in us you should send to the us exchanges if you wish to send to other exchanges in other countries you should check with the broker about that

that $ 200 extra that your employer withheld may already have been sent on to the irs depending on the size of the employer withholdings from payroll taxes plus employer 's share of social security and medicare taxes might be deposited in the us treasury within days of being withheld so asking the employer to reimburse you out of petty cash so to speak might not work at all   as joetaxpayer says you could ask that $ 200 less be withheld as income tax from your pay for the next pay period is your federal income tax withholding at least $ 200 per pay period and one way of forcing the employer to withhold less is to file a   new w-4 form with human resources payroll increasing the number of   exemptions to more than you are entitled to and then filing a new w-4 changing your exemptions back to what they are right now once when you have had $ 200 less withheld but be careful claims for more exemptions than you are entitled to can be problematic and the irs might come looking if you suddenly discover several extra children for whom you are entitled to claim exemptions

hope this helps   i understand that a reverse mortgage can be paid out in two ways a lump sum and monthly payments i figure that if you take the lump sum eventually the bank wants you to start paying it back answer    actually there are 3 payout options or 4 if you consider a combination payout as another one there 's a lump sum a line of credit or the monthly payout or a combination   i figure that if you take the monthly payments eventually the bank stops paying out and wants you to pay it back in both situations interest accrues and this is how the bank makes money off of the deal   answer the only time the monthly payments would stop would be if the borrower defaults on the lenders terms or they no longer live at home you are right though and interest does accrue on whichever payment is decided on i 'm not sure how the lender makes money probably by the interest but i know borrowers are protected against high rates and owing more than your house here 's an article i found that goes over the protections more in detail   but what determines when you have to begin paying back the reverse mortgage some sources online seem to say that it 's based only on if you die or would like to sell move that ca n't be right in all situations because you could end up with a massive debt on a property more than its value   answer there are a lot of protections or regulations in place to protect anyone who takes out a reverse mortgage one being you ca n't owe more than your house is valued at during the time of repayment a reverse mortgage is a non recourse loan in the instance that your house is less than you owe you either sell the home and the proceeds are used to pay the loan and you keep the rest or if you owe more than the house proceeds of the home go to the lender either way you 're not left paying for a mortgage without the house in the case the parent grandparent passes then the heirs would have a choice of either paying back the reverse mortgage in payments or they can sell the house heirs are protected during this as well to make sure they 're not left with major debt in case of anything   is there a formula to figure out when the bank stops the monthly payments and then wants it back   amount becomes due if loan terms are not met but the lender will discuss the options if it comes to that   is there a different formula for when the lump sum would have to be paid back   answer each payout option has the same terms and the same pay back terms as long as terms are met the lender ca n't ask for early repayment

you can relate everything on a credit report and how things are calculated to life scenarios that s a 100 fact and that s what people need to go by when designing their credit diet utilization any kind of resource in life water food energy and etc who would you want to live with more the guy that just eats way too much uses way too much energy than they need and wastes way more water than they need assuming there was no water cycle payment history speaks for itself derogatory remarks s happens that s what makes life life but when given chances to fix your mistakes and own up to them like i and every other responsible adult have done and you do nt that s living up to the exact definition of derogatory and not caring who wants to lend to someone who does nt care so if you re not gon na care we will just put this special little remark in the derogatory section and show that you do nt care about when you make mistakes f it right lol well that s what that section is for showing you wo nt try to fix things when they go sour if i had a guy who was fixing my roof and did a bad job but did everything he could to fix it i would nt give him a bad rep at all if a guy messed up my roof and just said cya thanks for your money he s getting a derogatory remark credit age just like life showing the ability to maintain every other aspect of a report for x amount of time its like getting old as a person after x amount of years a lot of people will be able to say more about you as a person whether you re a real male reproductive organ or an amazing guy total accounts is like taking on jobs as a self employed person or any business if you have a lot of jobs people must want you to do their work it shows how people like you hard inquiries this is the one category of them all i do nt fully agree on can go either way and i hate it i really ca nt think of a life scenario to relate it to so i kind of think its a prevention mechanism keep a person in check kind of thing like to save them from and save the lenders for example if a guy has great utilization and just goes insane applying for credit cards hell get everyone of them because he s showing almost no utilization then said guy goes and looses his job but since he racked up 50 cards at 1k each now he can destroy 50k in credit that s just my take but that s exactly how i look at it from tu ex point of view

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

for any accounts where you have a wish to keep track of dividends gains and losses etc you will have to set up a an account to hold the separately listed securities   it looks like you already know how to do this   here the trading accounts will help you especially if you have finance quote set up to pull security prices from the internet for the actively managed accounts you can just create each managed account and not fill it with the separate securities   you can record the changes in that account in summary each month year as you prefer so you might set up your chart of accounts to include these assets and this income the actively managed accounts will each get set up as type stock   you will create one fake security for each account which will get your unrealized gains losses on active accounts showing up in your trading accounts   the fake securities will not be pulling prices from the internet   go to      tools > securities editor > add and type in a name such as merrill lynch brokerage a symbol such as and in the type field input something like actively managed in your self managed accounts you will record dividends and sales as they occur and your securities will be set to get quotes online   you can follow the general gnucash guides for this    in your too many transactions actively traded accounts maybe once a month you will gather up your statements and enter the activity in summary to tie the changes in cost basis   i would suggest making each fake share equal $ 1 so if you have a $ 505 dividend you buy 505 shares with it   so you might have these transactions for your brokerage account with merrill lynch for example when you have finished making your period end summary entries for all the actively managed accounts double check that the share balances of your actively managed accounts match the cost basis amounts on your statements   remember that each fake share is worth $ 1 when you enter it   once the cost basis is tied you can go into the price editor tools > price editor and enter a new price as of the period end date for each actively managed account   the price will be value of active acct at period end cost of active acct at period end   so if your account was worth $ but had a cost basis of $ 505 on jan. 31 you would type in the price field and jan. 31 2017 in the date field when you run your reports you will want to choose the price source as nearest in time so that gnucash grabs the correct quotes this should make your actively managed accounts have the correct activity in summary in your gnucash income accounts and let them work well with the trading accounts feature

the short answer is that there is no us tax due if all you are doing is moving assets held abroad to the us whether you are a returning us citizen or will continue your residence in the philippines is not relevant to this the long answer is that you may be liable for a lot of other fines and taxes if you have not been doing any of several things correctly as a us citizen you are required to declare your worldwide income on your us income tax returns have you been filing us income tax returns during your time abroad and have you been declaring the income that you have received from non us sources each year this includes wages interest dividends capital gains rental income from real estate gambling income lottery winnings   nobel prizes everything if you have been paying income tax to other countries on this income then it is generally possible to get a deduction for this tax payment from the income that will be taxed by the us or a credit for the tax payment against your us federal income tax liability depending on the existence of tax treaties or when the us senate refuses to approve a tax treaty a double taxation avoidance agreement between the us and other countries in some cases foreign earned income up to a certain limit is not taxed by the us at all even if you have been filing us income tax returns correctly and can thus account for the $ 45,000 in your savings account or you received that money as a gift or inheritance and can account for it on that basis have you been filing reports with the us treasury since the year when the total value of all your foreign bank accounts and other financial assets stocks and bonds etc but not real estate first exceeded $ 10,000   in prior years this was a matter of filling out and submitting form td f 90 22.1 but more recently since 2010 you need to fill out and submit fincen form 114 have you been submitting the required documentation all along note that there are severe penalties for failure to fine fincen form 114 and these penalties do not get waived by tax treaties in summary you might or you might not have several other tax or legal issues to worry about than just taxes on the transfer of your money from the philippines to the us

what interests me in the article is the way california seems to be quite happy to be losing people who pay taxes because the state can so easily attract new warm bodies what happens to a state when there is no incentive to retain its people    it struck a cord with me because i 've been reading about the history of mining if an industry can always bring in newer poorer people conditions for those working in that industry will never rise in mining conditions can be so bad that you can almost think of it as if the workers are expendable working conditions can be so bad that many die each year and nobody seems to care because if one group of workers gets a little management simply starts importing them from another country    you can disagree but i see a parallel with california sure one is an industry and one is a country but this is a state that seems more than the rest of the country to depend on cheap mexican labor as mexico stopped breeding people for export california begin to simply import new slave labor from or any other place that still exports people as though they were only cattle of course this makes it difficult for those who came in an earlier wave to improve quality of life in fact life gets harder and just look at what happened to the world class famous free public education in california yeah distant memory now    i also wonder if allowing california to ignore national immigration law is good for the rest of the nation what about this quote   also more than 30 of the nation ’s welfare recipients are californians even though california has just 12 of the nation ’s population   it is not surprising therefore that california is ranked number one in poverty   california has so many electoral votes that i do n't expect to see them prosecuted by the federal government like az no matter what they do the state is too big to piss off but it is becoming a cancer to the rest of the nation

my guess is that both the blue and lines are hand drawn by someone the blue line indicates higher lows while the line represents higher highs together they form a trading channel in which you can expect future prices to be unless there is some unanticipated event that occurs   edit since the price broke out above the trading channel at the start of the year and is verified by the increase in volume at that time something must have occurred to increase the value of the stock   edit2 this news likely explains the breakout in price this chart shows that the stock price is now seeking equilibrium the price will likely be volatile over the next few days or weeks

in short your scenario could work in theory but is not realistic generally speaking you can borrow up to some percentage of the value of the property usually 80 90 though it can vary based on many factors   so if your property currently has a value of $ 100k you could theoretically borrow a total of $ 80 90k against it   so how much you can get at any given time depends on the current value as compared to how much you owe   a simple way to ballpark it would be to use this formula =      if your available equity allowed you to borrow what you wanted and you then applied it to additions renovations your base property value would hopefully increase   however as other people mentioned you very rarely get a value increase that is near what you put into the improvements and it is not uncommon for improvements to have no significant impact on the overall value   just because you like something about your improvements does n't mean the market will agree just for the sake of argument though lets say you find the magic combination of improvements that increases the property value in line with their cost   if such a feat were accomplished your $ 40k improvement on a $ 100k property would mean it is now worth $ 140k   let us further stipulate that your $ 40k loan to fund the improvements put you at a 90 loan to value ratio   so prior to starting the improvements you owed $ 90k on a $ 100k property   after completing the work you would owe $ 90k on what is now a $ 140k property putting you at a loan to value ratio of   meaning you theoretically have 26 equity available to borrow against to get back to the 90 level or roughly $ 36k   note that this is 10 less than the increase in the property value   meaning that you are in the realm of diminishing returns and each iteration through this process would net you less working capital the real picture is actually a fair amount worse than outlined in the above ideal scenario as we have yet to account for any of the costs involved in obtaining the financing or the decreases in your credit score which would likely accompany such a pattern   each time you go back to the bank asking for more money they are going to charge you for new appraisals and all of the other fees that come out at closing   also each time you ask them for more money they are going to your credit and see the additional inquires and associated debt stacking up which in turn drops your score which prompts the banks to offer higher interest rates and/or charge higher fees also when a bank loans against a property that is already securing another debt they are generally putting themselves at the back of the line in terms of their claim on the property in case of default   in my experience it is very rare to find a lender that is willing to put themselves third in line much less any farther back   generally if you were to ask for such a loan the bank would insist that the prior commitments be paid off before they would lend to you   meaning the bank that you ask for the $ 36k noted above would likely respond by saying they will loan you $ 70k provided that $ 40k of it goes directly to paying off the previous equity line

from an amateur prices are n't entirely rational they float and the day to day prices of stock are an excellent example of this   so how would you assign an appropriate value to it   there is a logical minimum the scrap value of the assets and the cash on hand   however that does n't take into account the expectations for growth people have for that company   if everyone thought a $ 100 mil company was going to be worth $ 200 mil by the end of next year they 'd still be willing to pay at a $ 150 mil price point now that said the market is big enough that it 's easy enough to find someone who has those growth expectations   they still expect it to be worth more in the future and they 'll buy it now   and if no one buys at that price point that 's when prices start to fall

technical analysis is based more on psychology than anything else as an example if an analyst estimates or believes that a stock is undervalued or simply wants to re balance their portfolio then they will buy some amount moving the price up others in the market see the upwards move as the start of an upwards trend an indication that the stock is undervalued or perhaps even that an insider is trading ahead of better than expected data from the firm they then buy the stock creating a self fulfilling prophecy and pulling more traders in as they see an upward trend being confirmed this is even more pronounced in a bear market as fear is an even stronger driver when a trader sees a stock is falling they are more likely to jump to the conclusion that it is due to expected poor performance of the firm and that the firm and the economy are both in trouble and going down than to think that it is simply a or a large investor re balancing etc to quote credit suisse 1   a chart is a mirror    of the mood of the crowd and not of the fundamental factors thus technical analysis is the    analysis of human mass psychology therefore it is also called behavioral finance the underlying truth that makes technical analysis work is that people are predictably irrational at least in the short run and tend to follow the same patterns of thought references 1 2 3 cfa level 1 syllabus

there is empirical evidence of a correlation between independence of central banks and lower unemployment lower inflation and more stable prices   the argument as to why this is comes from when control central banking more then politicians get involved and they vote for more easier money which looks good in the short run thereby getting them votes but causes inflation unemployment price volatility in the long run when governments control banking you sometimes end up with zimbabwe inflation well not as bad as zimbabwe often but without the govt able to add money at will it is much harder   a significant feature of most successful modern central banks is to remove the control from the hands of i.e. politicians and put control into the hands of skilled economists ever notice the fed chairman and many of the board are actually very well trained economists   full transparency is also bad since some areas of monetary policy need knowledge to be kept from the markets in order to be effective otherwise the fed loses some of the tools they need to try and target inflation   finally there are quite a lot of regulations that the fed does follow including regular outside audits that keep them in check

canadian here the us is our biggest customer so we were impacted economically i expected that within a year or two of the us housing collapse we would also be hit but something else happened when the us dropped interest rates like a stone we were also forced to drop interest rates this meant that suddenly money was being handed out for very very cheap so cheap it was almost free if you had a decent job and good credit the housing market here for a brief moment and then continued climbing it never stopped until some new rules were implemented aimed mostly at foreign buyers and investors and put in place this year it appears however that this current drop in prices may be a temporary dip the average cost of a home in toronto is still around $ 1 m cad and our real estate is still among the most expensive in the world if you look at how much we pay compared to our incomes   in some places houses have basically tripled over the past decade   my point here is that canadian home owners were not impacted negatively by the 2008 crisis in fact once the free money started flowing and prices went up accordingly canadian home owners were enriched as a direct result of the 2008 us housing crisis the situation is clearly unsustainable and the market is irrational it 's easy to say that we are in a bubble but it is   impossible to tell when it will crash in canada it 's harder to walk away from mortgage debt if you 're underwater on your home and the bank forecloses on you and sells the house for less than you owe you still owe the bank the remainder of the money in most provinces

inflation like trade deficits or surpluses have winners and losers in an economy clear losers are people who are on a fixed income as they often have a fixed income and a prices keep on going up meaning they can afford less   numerous articles on the internet discuss the inflation of the 1970s here are google 's results   i 'm not so sure that governments want some inflation as much as they desperately want to avoid deflation deflation means that the price for today 's product like a car will decrease in price tomorrow or a month from now which creates a powerful incentive for people to put off a purchase until later which brings consumer demand down in a country 's economy

if one wants to have a bound on the loss percentages that are acceptable this is would be a way to enforce that for example suppose someone wants to have a 5 stop loss but does n't want this to be worse than 10 as if the stock goes down more than 10 then the sell should n't happen thus if the stock opened in a gap down 15 one day this triggers the stop loss and would exit at too low of a price as the gap was quite high as i wonder how familiar are you with how much a stock 's price could change that makes the prices not be as continuous as one would think at least this would be my thinking on a volatile stock where one may want to try to limit losses if the stock does fall within a specific range

stocks are regarded as an inflation hedge because when your money is worth less everything else is worth more i.e. stocks are more expensive go up simply because your money is worth less but not because of better earnings across individual companies so that general idea can effect sentiment whereby if everyone believes it then more people buy stocks if they think there will be a lot of inflation but it does n't explain actual behavior whether more people buy hold or sell it 's worth noting that individual companies and stocks also may be adversely affected by inflation since their own assets or accounting may already be outside of the currency and/or they may already be engaging in their own hedging

your question is very broad whole books can and have been written on this topic the right place to start is for you and your wife to sit down together and figure out your goals where do you want to be in 5 years 25 years 50 years to quote if you do n't know where you are going you 'll end up someplace else let 's go backwards 50 years i 'm guessing the answer is retired living comfortably and not having to worry about money you say you work an unskilled government job does that job have a pension program how about other retirement savings options will the pension be enough or do you need to start putting money into the other retirement savings options career wise do you want to be working as in unskilled government jobs until you retire or do you want to retire from something else if so how do you get there your goals here will affect both your 25 year plan and your 5 year plan finally as you plan for death which will happen eventually what do you want to leave for your children likely the pension will not be transferred to your children so if you want to leave them something you need to start planning ahead 25 years at this stage in your life you are likely talking college for the children and possibly your wife back at work could happen much earlier than this e.g. when the kids are all in school what do you want for your children in college do you want them to have the opportunity to go without having to take on debt what savings options are there for your children 's college also likely with all your children out of the house at college what do you and your wife want to do travel give to charity own your own home 5 years you mention having children and your wife staying at home with them can your family live on just your income can you do that and still achieve your 50 and 25 year goals if not further education or training on your part may be needed are you in debt would you like to be out of debt in the next 5 10 years i know i 've raised more questions than answers this is due mostly to the nature of the question you 've asked it is very personal and i do n't know you what i find most useful is to look at where i want to be in the near mid and long term and then start to build a plan for how i get there if you have older friends or family who are where you want to be when you reach their age talk to them ask them how they got there also there are tons of resources out there to help you i wo n't suggest any specific books but look around at the local library or look online read reviews of personal finance books read many and see how they can give you the advice you need to reach your specific goals good luck

the easier way is to sell the house and pay back the 95 k to the mortgage company your taxable gain if any is calculated as the difference between the sales price minus the purchased price of there is a further deduction for any selling expenses before you have to pay income tax if you liquidate your other investments to raise the 95 k and prepay the mortgage you might realize and be taxed on gains on those investments that 's something you might not want on the other hand if you have some investments that can be liquidated at a loss you might want to sell those to generate a tax loss then prepay all or part of the bear in mind that there are limitations of 3 k a year for certain types of losses so see a tax adviser before using this course of action

even though the person you 're responding to actually said paternity leave i 'll respond to the benefit that maternity leave provides to employers   businesses with a paid maternity leave policy benefit in 2 ways 1 companies that pay for a maternity leave period as opposed to allowing the time off but requiring it be unpaid have hire retention which means that the woman is more likely to come back than become a stay at home mom 2 companies with good maternity leave policies get the pick of the litter in hiring women so while they 're perhaps having to hire men they feel are in the top 20th percentile with women they 're able to hire top ten percentile

i think you might be asking the wrong question you have plenty of capital on the side that can be invested instead of asking whether you should get an adviser you might want to examine what your end goal is are you looking to build long term growth of you capital are you asking about and adviser because you do n't want to handle your money or is it simply because that 's what people do i would imagine that the answer to 1 is yes and that the answer to 2 is that you want to handle your money and you always considered this something best left to the advisers i shall proceed on these hypothetical assumptions in my humble opinion i would do the following skip the adviser and the fees that go with it for a young professional like yourself especially with an engineering background you can certainly handle the education required to learn the mechanics of investing invest some time to learn the fundamentals of the market such as asset classes basic terminology ect you will benefit in several ways for one you will learn an invaluable skill and save tens of thousands in fees during your lifetime moreover you will have complete control of your risk profile allocation and every penny that belongs to you i really am not bashing advisers but no one will care as much about your money as you will and do n't be fooled the market is efficient an adviser does not have any more edge in a market than anyone else and from first hand experience they rarely outperform benchmarks net of fees i assume you have made it to this step because you want to manage your own money and financial future sounds scary how should one proceed let 's assume that $ 100,000 is in play and since you are learning the ropes let 's leave $ 50,000 in cash for now this leaves $ 50,000 to start a portfolio i 'd start by building a core position of all the major asset classes in etf form this means buying things like spy or tlt if you 're comfortable you can start selling monthly calls against these positions to reduce basis and earn some income the point is your only limitation at this point is taking time to learn the ropes the technology is there the free education is there and liquidity and product mix is there next thing you know you 're learning how gamma scalping works or maybe you 're more of a buffett type   this is how i view finance in general and truly hope you break through the initial barrier to your own finances

hi i 'm the writer thanks for the read and the comment with the statement you quoted i 'm trying to dispute the claim that people these days ca n't afford a house because they would have to pay their entire salary just to afford the mortgage which i think is quite common in some circles the data makes no statement as to whether home ownership is more affordable or not but simply shows that those buying property are using around the same percentage of their income to pay for it which the data clearly shows to be true      as it turns out home ownership levels have remained within ~5 of their 1980 levels based on percentage of the total population i think there is an major classification flaw when comparing only sales because a great deal of people inherit property with no sale ever being made
# 303724
in my view it 's better to sell when there 's a reason to sell rather than to cap your gains at 8 i 'm assuming you have no such criteria on the other side i.e. hold your losses down to 8 that 's because what matters is how much you make overall in your portfolio not how much you make per trade example if you own three stocks equal amounts and two go up 20 but one falls 20 if you sell your gains at 8 and hold the loser you have net lost money so when do you actually sell you might say a fall of 10 from the last high is good enough to sell this is called a trailing stop which means if a stock goes from 100 to 120 i 'll still hold and sell if it to 108 needless to say if it had gone from 100 to 90 i would still be out the idea is to ride the trend for as long as you can because trends are strong and keep your trailing stops wide enough for it to absorb natural because you may get stopped out of a stock that falls 4 but eventually goes up 200 or sell under other conditions if the earnings show a distinct drop or the sector falls out of favor   whenever you decide to sell also consider what it would take for you to buy the stock back increased earnings strong prices a product release whatever because getting out might seem like a good thing but it 's just as important to not think of it as saying a stock is crappy it might just be that you had enough of one ride that does n't mean you ca n't come back for another one

i agree that if you have employees you 're going to think long and hard about hiring employee number 5000 and probably hold off as long as you can but eventually if you need more employees you 're going to do it   i also do n't think a company with say 10,000 employees is going to suddenly fire half of them to get to under 5000   aka   they still have an incentive to grow you can still make more money by growing a slight increase in taxes does n't change that

if you are intent on becoming a quant i concur with most of the opinions in this thread you will need a graduate degree because it is a relatively small field and it is densely populated with people who have graduate degrees specializing more closely in the field than engineering will ever touch upon   however do n't give up searching for killer work opportunities like the kind you are currently getting if you maintain an excellent gpa in combination with these work placements you can easily secure a spot in a top degree program you are placed in an comparable program meaning you will possess a top notch understanding of math and have demonstrated experience in business    if you plan to search for work in canada after graduation i would highly recommend getting your graduate degree from university of toronto while it is often a poorly regarded undergraduate finance school when employers are looking for soft skills and queens slaughter undergrads for job placements absolutely no one disputes that university of toronto students have a top notch grasp of theory and it is commonly regarded from what i have heard at least as one of the toughest schools   at u of t there are two degrees that might fit for your field the and index mfe it would probably be prudent to call around or tap people in the industry in nyc or toronto to let you know which is preferable or a best fit i sense the but my opinion is next to worthless here    if you are interested in working in nyc and have the money for a graduate degree in the states without putting yourself under a mountain of debt get educated there your program directors will know the street better than those in toronto most likely gave excellent advice though i would add one thing know that doing this work in canada and the us are very different propositions especially for the sell side you probably know this but look no further than places like wso or colleagues at internships for horror stories related to hours conditions perks pay etc at american banks these days i have friends that have worked 55 hours straight in their offices if you consider that a point of pride go crazy otherwise be wary

we are exactly where we should be for pricing we are not over valued   the largest bull market in history is following the longest stagnation in history we 're merely playing catch up of course it was spurred after trump won because the business sector assumed he would regulation one thing we 're pretty sure he 'll accomplish because his business interests are   recommended reading outlining why we are appropriately valued stocks for the long run by jeremy prof of finance at wharton    i 'm all for looking out for people 's benefit as an investment advisor i have to abide by the rule myself i 'm sure there 's another side to the argument for them removing the rule as robert shiller nobel laureate in economics put it we need the right regulation not more or less perhaps it 's not correct in it 's current state but i 'm not a legislative expert maybe someone can elaborate   we need to be wary about how quick we are to judge on these rulings many comments are not experts and our confirmation bias will drive people to misinformation we judge ourselves on our intentions and others on their actions

it 's done by opening auction the opening auction between and    a random time between and    there will be called an auction period during which time    limit and market orders are entered    and deleted on the order book no    order execution takes place during    this period so it is possible that the    order book will become crossed this    means that some buy and sell orders    may be at the same price and some buy    orders may be at higher prices than    some sell orders at the end of the random start period    the order book is frozen temporarily    and an order matching algorithm is    run this calculates the price at    which the maximum volume of shares in    each security can be traded all    orders that can be executed at this    price will be filled automatically    subject to price and priorities no    additional orders can be added or    deleted until the auction matching    process has been completed the opening price for each stock will    be either a ut price or in the    event that there are no transactions    resulting form the auction then the    first at trade will be used

i would focus entirely on the emergency fund first and get it built up as fast as you can   once that is in place you 've got a cushion that will keep you from going into debt in an emergency   depending on your monthly expenses $ 2000 seems low for that   i 'd aim for 3 6 months worth of expenses note that this is $ 800 less than your monthly income because of your savings once you have your emergency fund in place then follow a formula like 's to invest for retirement and save for future major purchases car house vacation etc

first you need to distinguish between short term and long term capital gains in an ira you can use investment strategies that incur short term capital gains without being taxed as ordinary income as mentioned in a comment above with a roth ira you can invest now at your low income tax rates and withdraw all gains without incurring any taxes at retirement time you can also pull out your contributions penalty free before retirement age 59 1/2 if you 've had the account for more than 5 years you only pay taxes and penalties on the earnings you can also make withdrawals for education expenses and you have one lifetime exclusion of $ 10,000 for a down payment on a house

for a cheaper hedge you can try a call spread e.g if you shorted a stock at 40 but are worried that it can get bought out for 60 then buy a 50 60 bull call spread with appropriate number of contracts or even 50 55 this is better than just buying a 50 call as it will be expensive also the other option is not to short but buy a debit bear put spread 40 30 near the money and then buy an out of money call spread 55 60

broadly speaking a traditional account is better if you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement see for instance here   when you put the money in now you pay no taxes on it at your current high rate when you take it out you will pay taxes at your future low rate   you push the taxes onto your future lower rate self this is assuming you can deduct the contribution on the traditional ira   if you ca n't e.g. because you have an employer sponsored plan and make too much money the traditional ira does n't really gain you anything see here that is the basic story but there are some other differences to consider as well   for instance if your income is too high you can not contribute to a roth at all   also with a traditional ira you 're required to start taking money out at a certain age whereas with a roth you never have to this can make a difference if you have other retirement income and want to leave the money in the roth e.g. to pass on to your heirs without having to pay an intermediate tax at withdrawal on a more speculative level there is the possibility that tax rates may change between now and your retirement some people try to hedge against this possibility by strategically allocating their retirement assets based on whether they think tax rates will rise or fall

lol yes it can hurt european corporations but it 'll affect the russian people at least as much was this really the best area of business they could think of it 's kind of a big deal   edit i think this r business is good frustration can help putin point out scapegoats because frustrated or angry people is as history tells with   too much clarity very easy to manipulate like easy

this is the best tl;dr i could make intellectual capital en tech reduced by 90 i 'm a bot gt at the same time that computer based transactions are rising in importance us companies are less and less of their investment spending to computers   gt instead an increasingly large share of investment spending is being dedicated to non technology investment   gt if companies rely on employees to provide some of the technology they need to do their jobs then distinguishing investment from consumer spending becomes less helpful    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords company**^#3

i have a car loan paid in full and even paid off early and 2 personal loans paid in full from my credit union that do n't seem to reflect in a positive way and all 3 were in good standing but you also   my credit card utilization is 95 i have a total of 4 store credit cards a car loan 2 personal loans so assuming no overlap you 've paid off three of your ten loans 30   and you still have 95 utilization    what would you do if you were laid off for six months   regardless of payment history you would most likely stop making payments on your loans   this is why your credit score is bad   you are in fact a credit risk   not due to payment history   if your payment history was bad you 'd likely rank worse   but simple fiscal reality is that you are an adverse event away from serious fiscal problems    for that matter the very point that you are considering bankruptcy says that they are right to give you a poor score   bankruptcy has adverse effects on you but for your creditors it means that many of them will never get paid or get paid less than what they loaned    the hard advice that we can give is to reduce your expenses   stop going to restaurants   prepare breakfast and from scratch and bag your lunch   do n't put new expenses on your credit cards unless you can pay them this month   cut up your store cards and do n't shop for anything but necessities   whatever furniture appliances clothes shoes etc you have now should be enough for the next year or so    cut your expenses   have premium channels on your cable or the extra fast internet   drop back to the minimum instead   turn the heat down and the a c temperature up so it cools less   turn off the lights if you are n't using them   if you move move to a cheaper apartment   nothing to do   get a second job   that will not only keep you from being bored it will help with your financial issues    bankruptcy will not itself fix the problems you describe   you are living beyond your means   bankruptcy might make you stop living beyond your means   but it wo n't fix the problem that you make less money than you want to spend   only you can do that   better to stop the spending now rather than waiting until bankruptcy makes your credit even worse and forces you to cut spending    if you have extra money at the end of the month pick the worst loan and pay as much of it as you can   by worst i mean the one with the worst terms going forward   highest interest rate etc   if two loans have the same rate pay the smaller one first   once you pay off that loan it will increase the amount of money you have left to pay off your other loans   this is called the debt snowball snowball effect    after you finish paying off your debt save up six months worth of expenses or income   these will be your emergency savings    once you have your emergency fund write out a budget and stick to it   you can buy anything you want so long as it fits in your budget   avoid borrowing unless absolutely necessary   instead save your money for bigger purchases   with savings you not only avoid paying interest you may actually get paid interest   even if it 's a low rate paid to you is better than paying someone else    one of the largest effects of bankruptcy is that it forces you to act like this   they offer you even less credit at worse terms   you wo n't be able to shop on credit anymore   no new car loan   no mortgage   no nice clothes on credit   so why declare bankruptcy   take charge of your spending now rather than waiting until you ca n't do anything else
