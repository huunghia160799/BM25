if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

from your question and how you have framed it i get you find agressive sales tactics the buying process for you i understand because i also find the whole process of research negotiating buying owning using is all on one continuum so anything that ruins the process will likely lose the sale or enjoyment of the item at the end of the day   very long answer sorry the answer to this is to know what you want before you have to deal with the sales people a good sales person likes a customer who knows what they want i would suggest that you follow my buying process much you have already done before you buy identify the item you want and the max min realistic price you   would buy at stick to this price else buyers remorse may bite   later write the questions you have down on paper before you visit the     dealer write the answers you want on the same list if known decide which questions are most important and therefore must get the   answer you want these should be the questions you ask first mark   these on the list re visit points 1 3 are they complete and to your satisfaction would you buy if all the answers the price are right if no then re visit point 1 3 else you are not ready to buy now if yes then organise your visit to the dealer book appointment etc if needed at dealer meet your sales person and clearly state what you want the item and importantly when you intend to buy if all your questions are answered to your satisfaction   there is no need to discuss price at this point as the haggling is only possible if the questions are answered to your satisfaction do not give information such as your maximum budget or similar requests as they give the sales person the upper hand to maximise his her pricing   if asked state that your budget is conditional on the answers you get as the questions are answered assess the answer and assign + to the question on your list if any of your most critical important questions are answered in the negative they are the reasons you have to call it a day and walk out you can assess whether they are worth ignoring but you will need to factor this into your price and if you have identified your questions correctly there should be little room for debate assuming you have got all your questions answered you should know what you are buying and have assessed what is a reasonable price for it if you still want it as this point   if you have lost interest say so and let the sales person go do n't waste their time they may make some sort of offer to you but do n't forget that if you have doubts now they will not go away easily no matter what the great price is if you want it then continue buying your item none of the following is really if you have told the sales person your budget as they will be aiming for the highest end of your budget you will often find that the best price is very close to your maximum budget do not forget your realistic price range this should limit your buying price no matter what tactics are used by the sales person only you know what you are prepared to pay and if an extra 1 or 50 is considered worth it to you if you have to have the item regardless you have to have some idea of your limit and be prepared to stick to it you must be able to walk away if the price is silly and not worth it assuming you have not been by your item and funds are not unlimited ask for the price and assess it against your price range at this point i can only offer pointers as there are no magic rules to get what you want at the lowest price the only advice i would offer is that you will be lucky to get something at your 1st offer price unless the seller really needs to sell because of this your 1st offer should be less than your price range lowest band you will need to assess how much less but be prepared to get a no response if you get a yes and your research is good buy it if you get too enthusiastic a response question your research if not sure bail out no sale at this point you are likely to be haggling so you need to be ready for all the must buy now tactics if you have clearly stated your wants and there is no reason to be pulled in by these tactics and they can be ignored until the price has reached the level you are happy with if the price is not moving where you want than clearly state you can not buy at that price if you get a total stop and no movement than you need to assess your need and if priced too high then you should walk out remember if you stated that you had a timescale to buy of weeks you should act like you have weeks to keep looking any on your part will tell the sales person that you have lied you can always come back and try again reminding the sales person that the item is still there and perhaps it is priced too high to sell and make the same offer a bit of cheek sometimes works if the price is close and you still want it and the sales person is not moving you need to try walking out while stating that you would love the item if it was priced better if no improved offer as you go try an increased offer but again you need to assess how much and remember you can only go up or walk out and come back another day if the price is at a level you are happy with then you should have no reason not to buy if you have followed this process but this does not mean that you should be forced into buying now if you do not want to regardless of any must buy now tactics if the price is right and you can not buy now tell the sales person when you can buy and see if you can get an agreement with this it is unfair to expect a price to be held for an time so you do need to state when you could buy if not now when a price has been agreed this is a point where the deal may break down if the sales person thinks they have a sale and to force the sale now once again you have to assess your need and whether buying now is better than walking out if the deal breaks down there is nothing stopping you from coming back and offering the same price when you can buy a final option is to agree if a deposit can be left to reserve the item until you can buy this gives the sales person some assurance that you will come back and is sometimes non refundable unless you agree otherwise before you pay so check this detail first this tends to be smaller dealers but generally in the uk the large companies offer refundable deposits as part of their customer service the advantage of using larger stores dealers etc apologies for the epic reply hope it helps

my advice is to quit worrying about the salesman 's tactics   they are a distraction   what do you want   how much are you willing to pay for it   if you want the instrument decide how much you want to pay for it   round down to the next even hundred   take that much in $ 100 bills   put the money in his hand and say this is what i have take it or leave it   you must be prepared to walk out of the store without the instrument
# 439467
i often spend weeks or months and sometimes even years deciding whether to buy something certainly the dealer should recognize you by now if you take a third opportunity to look at the same instrument you could politely remind him that you 've twice declined his excellent prices from there you can assert that you will purchase only when you are ready

this is way too long for a comment so i am posting this as an answer my bet is that you 're buying a new piano it is the only instrument that makes sense the rest of this answer are going to assume this but this should apply well if you 're going after a or for example for those readers that do not know a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument my piano is literally more expensive than my car there are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car you may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price therefore the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you this explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy you are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region or the exact model around your region which you have already did those indicate the standard price in your negotiation you described the dealer had the exact model you desire only in different appearance i assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood pattern one in their showroom note every piano is different even with the exact same model there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch since some processes are hand finished if you 're buying a treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal if they do not have your desired model in the showroom ask for a visit to their inventory facility again play the exact instrument not a showroom model some dishonest dealers will have their showroom regulated and tuned differently than the standard from shipping if you get an extremely good offer proceed with caution there may be defects in that particular instrument look for rust or layers on the strings look for in the hammers listen to clicking when playing the keys these are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they can not sell it you can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online before you close the deal ask for after sale services how many free will they provide will they polish your piano after delivery these are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price
# 13139
in my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now 100 of the time it is not true of course i ca n't guarantee that is universally the case but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later or tomorrow or next week it 's extremely likely that they 'll still take your money for the original price in fact sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the excellent offer most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a this price is only good right now pitch it ends up being because they do n't want you to go search the competition and read reviews in this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price sales is an art and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it this particular salesperson obviously you and/or you do n't have an easily vulnerability i would n't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase if you are worried about the scenario of someone else up the item consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you reflect and/or arrange for the funds
# 235925
i have a very simple rule for anything other than trivial purchases a small fraction of my monthly income the only final decision i will make in the presence of a salesperson is no after i have the terms nailed down and still feel that i am likely to buy the item i leave the store car dealership etc and think about it by myself often i go to a mall coffee shop to do the thinking if it is really big i sleep on it and make my decision the next day once i have made my decision i inform the salesperson if the decision is no i do not discuss my reasons that gives them an overcome the objection lever i just tell them i have decided not to buy the item which is all they need to know
# 120279
he sounds like a very bad salesman and i should know because i was a sales manager at a bike shop which sold bikes from $ 200 to $ 10k now i had a clear goal which is to sell as many bikes at the highest price possible but i did n't do that by making customers uncomfortable each customer received different treatment depending on what they were looking for   for example the $ 200 beach cruiser buyer was going to be told you look great on that bike can i ring you up whereas the interested in saving grams will receive a detailed discussion about his bike options   the $ 200 bike customer wo n't have very sophisticated questions although i could give a lecture on so giving out too much info complicates a likely quick impulse buy   on the other hand we are building a relationship with the which will include detailed fitting sessions and time consuming mechanical service   while i also want to close a high priced sale it will take several visits to prove both i have the right bike and this is the best shop but no matter what you were buying i was always pleasant and and my customers left happy    specifically with this situation of high pressure tactics the problem is the competition with internet sales   often customers will have only 2 criteria the model and the price and if a shop does not meet both the customer walks right out    possibly this sales guy is a bit cynical with his tactics but the reality is that if you have no relationship with that shop you fall into the category of internet buyer   one thing the sales guy could have done was not tell you we was n't going to honor this price if you came back   occasionally there would be an internet buyer and i showed no even though internet sellers could crush our brick and mortar shop   i would mention a competitive price and if he bought it great and if not that 's just business    as for the buyer i would treat these tactics with a certain   i would personally chuckle at his treatment and ask if i could kick the tires an user car saying    i suppose the bottom line is if you are ready to buy this specific model and if the price is right and the shop is ethical so you wo n't get ripped off with garbage then you have to be ready to buy on the spot i will point out one horrible experience i had at a car dealership   i came in 15 minutes before closing and a sales person gave me a price almost a third cheaper than list   i was n't ready to buy on my first visit ever to a dealership and of course buying a car has all kinds of hidden fees   i asked will this be the price tomorrow and he said absolutely not   i told him so if i come in tomorrow morning your dealer clock has only gone 15 minutes but that logic did not register with him    maybe he thought i was going to spend 15k on the spot and pressure tactics would work on me   i never came back but i did go another dealership and bought a car after a reasonable negotiation
# 365240
as described by the other answers there are pretty harmless explanations for that behaviour you could be slightly worried because he gave you exceptionally good deals for both instruments but that 's neither here nor there maybe he simply prices all items way up to be able to give a great discount on either sale you ca n't ever know the actual price you pay in the end is what counts what i would do if i expect in advance or if i notice during the negotiation that i am put under pressure in this way i usually try to do exactly the same in reverse that is i take   a minute to explain up front that i will not under any circumstance buy right now but that this is a purely informational event i will make sure not to have my money card with me any high end salesman worth his sale should have no problem with that at all money aside you are shopping for something that will mean a lot to you the salesman is not some of arbitrary wares everybody understands that not only do you not want to pay too high a price but also that you want to really get the item you want and want to be happy with it for a long time this is a tough decision often and if the salesman can not or does not want to respect that then it would be a clear signal for me that dubious things are going on in fact you would probably be if you got the wrong item for a great price than if you got a great item for a slightly too high price that is something you should probably not tell the salesman but can keep in mind so getting the greatest deal of all times is probably not so high on your priority list
# 230908
there are few main reasons i can think of that the salesperson would do this a lot of people assume it 's the 3rd option always   but if the person is reputable it 's most likely 1 or 2 you ca n't run a business doing option 3 for long without getting a reputation

in theory the trust admin the trustee custodian should have filed the each year the trust should have either a paid tax on any gains or b distributed the gains to her along with a nice schedule k-1 showing that she had income from the trust and was responsible for the tax on that income in effect the trust took that distribution to her as a deduction against its own income thus negating the need to pay tax at the trust rate yes if under $ 600 it could retain the income and still pay no tax   now when she gets this money and it seems it 's all being distributed by your choice of the money not some money it 's not taxable or at least should n't be the corpus of a trust is already post tax money unless of course it 's somehow pretax ira or 401(k money which is not so common

powers makes a good point trading costs may eat up a significant portion of your roi a fee as little as 2 can consume more than 50 of your long term roi a rule of thumb is keep your fees to less than 1 one way to do that is to buy stock in companies that have a drip with a share purchase plan often the allows investors to purchase shares for low fees or free once you have the ability to purchase shares for virtually free you can   use roughly you send more money to the companies whose share prices are near their 52-week low and less money to those who are near their 52-week high getting back to your original question

red flag you should not be invested in 1 share you should buy a diversified etf which can have fees of 0.06 per year this has significantly less volatility for the same statistical expectation left tail risk is much lower probability of gigantic losses since losses will tend to cancel out gains in diversified portfolios moreover your view that you believe these will continue is fallacious stocks of developed countries are efficient to the extent that retail investors can not predict price evolution in the future countless academic studies show that individual investors forecast in the incorrect direction on average i would be quite right to objectively classify you as a incorrect if you continued to hold the philosophy that owning 1 stock instead of the entire market is a superior all the evidence favours holding the market   in addition do not invest in active managers academic evidence demonstrates that they perform worse than holding a passive market tracking portfolio after fees and on average and do n't try to select managers that you think can outperform you ca n't do this even the best in the field ca n't do this   direct answer it depends on your investment horizon if you do not need the money until you are 60 then you should invest in very aggressive assets with high expected return and high volatility these assets should mainly be stocks through etfs or mutual funds but could also include us reit or global reit etfs private equity and a handful of other asset classes no gold please or perhaps wealth management products which pool many retail investors funds together and create a diversified portfolio but i 'm that their fees are worth the added diversification if you need the money in 2 3 years time then you should invest in safe assets fixed income and term deposits   why is investment horizon so important if you are holding to 60 years old then it does n't matter if we have a massive financial crisis in 5 years time since the stock market will rebound unless it 's a nuclear bomb in new york or something and by the time you are 60 you will be laughing all the way to the bank gains on risky assets overtake losses in the long run such that over a 20 30 year horizon they will do much better than a deposit account as you approach 45 50 you should slowly reduce your allocation to risky assets and put it in safe haven assets such as fixed income and cash this is because your investment horizon is now shorter so you need a less risky portfolio so you do n't have to keep working until if the market tanks just before retirement very important if you may need the savings to avoid defaulting on your home loan if you lose your job or something then the above does not apply decisions in these context are more vague and ambiguous

my level of analysis is not quite that advanced can you share what that would show and why that particular measure is the one to use   i 've run regression on prices between the two vix prices have no correlation to the s&amp;p500 prices should n't true volatility result in the prices more people putting options on the vix during the bad times and driving that price up correlate to the selloff that occurs within the s&amp;p500 during recessions and other events that would cause significant or minor volatility my r2 showed no significance within a measurement of regression within excel   but gasp i could be wrong but would love to learn more about better ways of measurement

the best answer to your question would to be what the interest rates are like in australia itself   the reserve bank sets the target cash which is the market    interest rate on overnight funds it uses this as the instrument for    monetary policy and influences the cash rate through its financial    market operations decisions regarding the cash rate target are made    by the reserve bank board and explained in a media release announcing    the decision at 2.30 pm after each board meeting prior to december    2007 media releases were issued only when the cash rate target was    changed from investopedia how rates are calculated   each central bank 's board of directors controls the monetary policy of its     country and the short term prime    interest rate that banks use to borrow from each other when the    economy is doing well interest rates are in order to curb    inflation and when times are tough cut rates to encourage lending and    inject money into the economy have a look at this from graph from i would then go to a website that allows you to compare graphically whichever interest rate you you could get the raw data and run some analysis to each his own   fyi this topic fx is incredibly complex and i hope my answer satisfies your needs otherwise talk to a quant you will need a ton of data inputs to model the entire economy of australia to try and predict what the central bank will do which is what people try and do everyday best of luck

the company gets the proceeds from the sales of shares on the open market if a company is selling 1,000,000 shares at $ then they will receive $ from the underwriter minus some fees that the underwriter will collect the part that ties into valuation is to consider what percentage is the company selling of itself that is coming from its own holdings if the company is putting out 10 of its shares in the ipo from treasury holdings on a $ 10b valuation then it will get $ 1b minus the fees i 'd suspect where i worked in late 1990s early 2000s had an ipo where the underwriter did a bridge loan and the ipo so that the company did n't get all the money raised but did get enough to run operations for a while before ending operations public offering notes that after an ipo other offerings would be called seasoned equity offering that may or may not be as they could come from new or existing shares

below is just a little information on this topic from my small unique book the small stock trader   the most significant non company specific factor affecting stock price is the market sentiment while the most significant company specific factor is the earning power of the company perhaps it would be safe to say that technical analysis is more related to psychology emotions while fundamental analysis is more related to reason that is why it is said that fundamental analysis tells you what to trade and technical analysis tells you when to trade thus many stock traders use technical analysis as a timing tool for their entry and exit points technical analysis is more suitable for short term trading and works best with large caps for stock prices of large caps are more correlated with the general market while small caps are more affected by company specific news and speculation perhaps small stock traders should not waste a lot of time on fundamental analysis avoid the financial position market position and management of the focus companies it is difficult to make wise trading decisions based only on fundamental analysis company specific news accounts for only about 25 percent of stock price fluctuations there are only a few important figures and ratios to look at such as perhaps also furthermore single ratios and figures do not tell much so it is wise to use a few ratios and figures in combination you should look at their trends and also compare them with the company ’s main competitors and the industry average preferably you want to see trend improvements in these above mentioned figures and ratios or at least some stability when the times are tough despite all the exotic names found in technical analysis simply put it is the study of supply and demand for the stock in order to predict and follow the trend many stock traders claim stock price just represents the current supply and demand for that stock and moves to the greater side of the forces of supply and demand   if you focus on a few simple small caps perhaps you should just use the basic principles of technical analysis such as   i have no doubt that there are different ways to make money in the stock market some may succeed purely on the basis of technical analysis some purely due to fundamental analysis and others from a combination of these two like most of the great stock traders have done jesse livermore baruch nicolas william and steven cohen it is just a matter of finding out what best fits your personality   i hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful author of the small stock trader

now is there any clever way to combine forex transactions so that you receive the us interest on $ 100 k instead of the $ 2 k you deposited as margin   yes absolutely but think about it why would the interest rates be different imagine you 're making two loans one for 10,000 usd and one for 10,000 chf and you 're going to charge a different interest rate on the two loans why would you do that there is really only one reason you would charge more interest for the currency that you think is less likely to hold its value such that the expected value of the money you are repaid is the same in other words currencies pay a higher interest when their value is expected to go down and currencies pay a lower interest when their value is expected to go up so yes you could do this but the profits you make in interest would have to equal the expected loss you would take in the devaluation of the currency people will only offer you these interest rates if they think the loss will exceed the profit unless you know better than them you will take a loss

got it i can definitely see how it can come across that way especially with all of these big tech companies lining up against the proposal my understanding is that a lot of that is more driven by their size than anything else the media focuses on the impacts to amazon and facebook because they 're huge companies and it 's easier to get information on them   but when it comes to who would get hurt the most by removing nn it 's actually small businesses and startups that would suffer the most in a world without net neutrality isps would be able to provide access to web services at different speeds for example if you are a comcast customer if comcast has a deal with amazon prime they can make it so that your access to competing services like netflix and hulu are moving so slow that it will be hard to use anything other than amazon prime video   now if that happens it will be annoying for companies like facebook netflix google etc to have to pay extra for internet users to be able to use them but they could do it they have the money the people who would struggle are people who own smaller businesses and smaller websites when they 're just starting out they wo n't have the money to pay the isps to let people access them and as a result they could be essentially locked out of many marketplaces this is the argument made by people who say that removing net neutrality will stifle small business removing the regulation would create this built in structural advantage for large established businesses and leave smaller businesses locked out

that is called substitution of collateral and yes it can be done but only with consent of the lender the best case for this kind of maneuver is if the second house is larger and more valuable than the first another possibility is that you have two mortgages on the first house and none on the second and you want to move the second mortgage on the first house to the second one effectively making it a first mortgage in these instances the lender has a clear incentive to allow a substitution of collateral because the second one is actually better than the first one the potential problem in your case is if the second house were more expensive than the first house you could not use the sale proceeds of the first house as to buy the second house without borrowing additional money in that case a possible solution would be to go back to the lender on your first house for a larger mortgage with the proceeds of that mortgage being used to retire the earlier mortgage depending on your credit payment record etc they might be willing to do this

another simple case of reading comprehension both from your graph and from my post if you 're that high interest rates means lower inflation that means you have no idea how 99 of the currency is created or about the quantity theory of money the cpi index is more of a measurement of how much money the average consumer is spending than it is the value lost of the dollar if the average consumer spends 2 more than their basket of goods will get 2 more expensive if wages go up 2 they will spend 2 more cpi is a fucking joke and anyone who believes it is either a or a shill

i remember in the 19th and early 20th century was the problem of trusts set up by the wealthy to avoid taxes hence the term anti trust that 's not what antitrust means   the trusts in that case were monopolies that used their outsized influence to dominate customers and suppliers   they were n't for tax evasion purposes   trusts were actually older than a permanent income tax   antitrust law was passed around the same time as a permanent income tax becoming legal   prior to that income taxes were temporary taxes imposed to pay for wars    the primary ways to evade taxes was to move expenses out of the personal and into businesses or charities   the business could pay for travel hotels meals and expenses   or a charity could pay for a trip as a promotion activity the infamous safari to africa scheme   charities can pay salaries to employees so someone could fund a charity tax deductible and then use that money to pay people rather than giving gifts   if you declare your house as a historical landmark a charity could maintain it    subscribe to magazines at the office and set them in the waiting room after you read them   use loyalty program rewards from business expenses for personal things   sign up for a benefit for all employees at a steep discount and pay everyone a little less as a result   barter   you do something for someone else e.g. give them a free car and they return the favor   call it marketing or promotion trump is carried away from his tower in a new mercedes benz limousine    another option is to move income and expenses to another tax jurisdiction that has even fewer laws about it   where the united states increasingly cracked down on personal expenses as business expenses many jurisdictions would be happy just to see the money flow through and sit in their banks briefly    tax policy is different now than it was then   many things that would have worked then would n't work now   the irs is more aggressive about insisting that some payments be considered income even if the organization writes the check directly to someone else   it 's unclear what would happen if united states tax rates went back to the level they had in the fifties or even the   would tax evasion become again   or would it stay closer to current levels    the rich actually pay a higher percentage of the overall income taxes now than they did in the and fifties   and the rich in the united states pay a higher percentage of the taxes paid than the rich in other countries with higher marginal rates   some of this may be more rich people in the us than other countries but tax policy is part of that too   high income taxes make it hard to become rich

properties do in fact every year for several reasons one of the reasons is that an old property is not the state of the art and can not therefore compete with the newest properties e.g. energy efficiency may be outdated second reason is that the property becomes older and thus it is more likely that it requires expensive repairs i have read somewhere that the real value depreciation of properties if left practically i.e. only the repairs that have to absolutely be performed are made is about 2 per year but do not remember the source right now however properties or more accurately the tenants do pay you rent and it is possible in some cases that rent more than pays for the possible depreciation in value for example you could ask whether car leasing is a poor business because cars depreciate in value obviously it is not as the leasing payments more than make for the value depreciation however i would not recommend properties as an investment if you have only small sums of money the reasons are so as a summary for large investors property investments may be a good idea because large investors have the ability to diversify however large investors often use debt leverage so it is a very good question why they do n't simply invest in stocks with no debt leverage for small investors property investments do not often make sense if you nevertheless do property investments remember the diversification also in time so purchase different kinds of properties and purchase them in different times putting a million usd to properties at one point of time is very risky because property prices can rise or fall as time goes on

for a lot of small beef farmers hobby farms like ours the price of fertilizer is already high enough that it 's proving effective in maintaining or possibly reducing costs   the most successful examples i 've seen have equal or higher carrying capacity cattle per acre for less monetary cost by moving to older methods of grazing   the tradeoff is that rotation takes more time to do than open field amp hay grazing   there 's also lower capital equipment costs tractor mower and are the major equipment for a small producer so being able to do without or use smaller ones is good   and less maintenance on that equipment   we 're not experts by any means and our farm is n't anywhere near its maximum carry capacity but every large full time farmer i know that has done it has had good results

the trend in etfs is total return where the etf automatically reinvests dividends   this philosophy is undoubtedly influenced by that trend the rich and retired receive nearly all income from interest dividends and capital gains therefore one who receives income exclusively from dividends and capital gains must fund by withdrawing dividends and/or liquidating holdings for a total return etf the situation is even more limiting income can only be funded by liquidation the expected profit is lost for the dividend as well as liquidating since the dividend can merely be converted back into securities new or pre existing   in this regard dividends and investments are equal one who withdraws dividends and liquidates holdings should be careful not to liquidate faster than the rate of growth

it 's a fair complaint to have people have grown accustomed to road trips needing only 5 10 minutes to refuel and continue on that 's currently a problem in the ev market and one that lots of manufacturers are working hard to try and fix    porsche just unveiled their 800 volt charger that 's 2 3 times faster charging on paper than the tesla superchargers which operate at 480 volts max for example a 75kwh battery on a tesla can from 0 to 75kwh full charge in 37 minutes although the battery should never be fully depleted with porsche 's supercharger a 75kwh battery could charge minutes tesla is expecting to upgrade their supercharger technology to match or exceed porsche soon   however the component to range anxiety in ev 's is recharging and as more companies are focusing on the ev market addressing that problem will become first priority further the batteries being used will increase in density and capability therefore increased range so charging a battery will become even more important the goal is that in the future you can have a 500 + mile battery and still charge it in minutes if a 500 + miles battery or a battery pack had access to chargers the charge time would be ~25 minutes

we do n't have a good answer for how to start investing in poland   we do have good answers for the more general case which should also work in poland   e.g. best way to start investing for a young person just starting their career this answer provides a checklist of things to do   let 's see how you 're doing    match on work pension plan you do n't mention this   may not apply in poland but ask around in case it does   given your income you should be doing this if it 's available    emergency savings you have plenty   either six months of spending or six months of income   make sure that you maintain this   do n't let us talk you into putting all your money in better long term investments    high interest debt you do n't have any   keep up the good work    avoid pmi on mortgage as i understand it you do n't have a mortgage   if you did you should probably pay it off   not sure if pmi is an issue in poland    roth ira not sure if this is an issue in poland   a personal retirement account in the us    additional 401k a reminder to max out whatever your work pension plan allows   the name here is specific to the united states   you should be doing this in whatever form is available    after that i disagree with the options   i also disagree with the order a bit but the basic idea is sound   one time opportunities emergency savings eliminate debt maximize retirement savings   check with a tax accountant so as not to make easily avoidable tax mistakes    you can use some of the additional money for things like real estate or a business   try to keep under 20 for each   but if you do n't want to worry about that kind of stuff it 's not that important   there 's a certain amount of effort to maintain either of those options   if you do n't want to put in the effort to do that it makes sense not to do this    if you have additional money split the bulk of it between stock and bond index funds   you want to maintain a mix between about 70/30 and stocks to bonds   the index funds should be based on broad indexes   they probably should be european wide for the most part although for stocks you might put 10 or so in a polish fund and another 15 in a true international fund    think over your retirement plans   where do you want to live   in your current apartment   in a different apartment in the same city   in one of the places where you inherited property   somewhere else entirely   also do you like to vacation in that same place    consider buying a place in the appropriate location now or keeping the one you have if it 's one of the inherited properties   you can always rent it out until then   many realtors are willing to handle the details for you    if the place that you want to retire also works for vacations consider short term rentals of a place that you buy   then you can reserve your vacation times while having rentals pay for maintenance the rest of the year    as to the stuff that you have now    look that over and see if you want any of it   you also might check if there are any other family members that might be interested   e.g. cousins etc   if not you can probably sell it to a professional company that handles estate sales   make sure that they clear out any junk along with the valuable stuff    consider keeping furniture for now   sometimes it can help sell a property    you might check if you want to drive either of them   if not the same applies check family first   otherwise someone will buy them perhaps on consignment they sell for a commission rather than buying and reselling    there 's no hurry to sell these   think over whether you might want them    consider if they hold any sentimental value to you or someone else   if not sell them   if there 's any difficulty finding a buyer consider renting them out   you can also rent them out if you want time to make a decision   do n't leave them empty too long   there 's maintenance that may need done e.g. heat to keep water from freezing in the pipes    that 's easy just invest that    i would n't get in too much of a hurry to donate to charity   you can always do that later   and try to donate anonymously if you can   donating often leads to spam where they try to get you to donate more

the us will lose money until the point where production in the us is cheap enough to bring it back    not if they raise taxes   i recently saw a mention of a research job in psychology that came to a conclusion more or less like this given the choice of getting $ 100,000 while their neighbor got $ 250,000 and the alternative of each getting $ 50,000 most americans chose the second option   they 'd rather get less for themselves rather than let their neighbor get more than they did    that 's why so many americans favor higher taxes on the corporations it does n't matter if the corporations become unable to invest in more jobs the important thing is not to let the corporations make money easily

do n't get me started about the law   i 'm a lawyer and the business model is a mess   you 'll hear about massive unemployment with lawyers   this is because lawyers are exempt from overtime   firms slave associates for 70 100 weeks for years   no weekends no holidays   most associates make less per hour than their secretaries   then they fire associates instead of making them partners and hire new associates desperate for a job   i know lawyers are hated but please have some sympathy for associates who work 10 12 hour days and get paid less per hour than the staff   happened to me   there are two necessary reforms   one is to allow ownership of law firms by non lawyers   this has happened in the uk   if costco or other companies could have law firms it would kill the greedy partner aspect and make legal work accessible to many more people   i 'm 100 in favor   i 'll happily take a lower wage and serve more people   everyone should be able to afford a lawyer   the other necessary reform is making anyone who is n't an owner entitled to 40 hour work weeks and overtime   if you own your own business and want to put in 90 hours fine   but you should not be able to force an exempt employee to work 90 hours unless that employee is an owner     those are entirely fair and reasonable and would transform the profession into what it should be   i 've since started teaching   it does n't pay as well but at least i do n't have to ram down a christmas dinner and then go into the office   or spend a fourth of july on top of the parking structure to see a few before going back in to work more

i have a colleague who always leases cars first   he 's very well off has piles of money in savings owns a home and the cherry on top he could just write a check for the car    he sees the lease as an insurance policy on the first couple of years of the car 's life   if it gets in an accident or he finds something about it he does n't like he can give it back to the dealer at the end of the term with no hassle and move on to the next car   some people value the fact that a lease is a rental    if you 're leasing a luxury car or something you could n't otherwise afford no amount of mental gymnastics will turn this in to a good idea    separately you should never make a down payment on a lease   if the car is totaled early on you will not the money you put down   the issue here is that while the numbers all work out the same between a lease and a purchase your situation is different   if the leased car is totaled the bank gets its money back from an insurer   if that payment does n't cover the value of the car the gap insurance will cover it   in either situation if there 's an excess remaining it will be returned to you   the issue is the excess may not fully replace your down payment   if you then went to lease another car you would need to come up with that down payment again because you could n't just simply choose to lease a used car like you could in the case of a purchase   additionally gap is generally included in a lease whether you want it or not   as far as i 'm concerned it does n't make financial sense to mitigate the value of the gap coverage once you 've decided to live in a lease situation

sure yahoo finance makes mistakes from time to time   that 's the nature of free data however i think the issue here is that yahoo is aggregating several line items into one   like maybe reporting cash equivalents plus total investment securities minus loans as cash equivalents   this aggregation is done by a computer program somewhere and may or may not be appropriate for a particular purpose and firm for this reason if you are trying to do top quality research it 's always better to go to the original sec filings if you can   then you will know for sure which items you are looking at   the only mistakes will be the ones made by the accountants at the firm in question if there 's a reason you prefer to use yahoo like if it 's easier for your code to scrape then spend a little time comparing to the sec filing to ensure you know where the numbers really come from before using it

as an investment opportunity no as a friendly assist with money you do n't mind ever getting back legal depending on amount a few years back i was in the housing market myself and researching interest rates and mortgages   for one property i was very interested in i would need about $ 4 k extra in liquid cash to complete the down payment   a pair of options i saw were a combo loan 15yr 4 interest for the house 1yr 8 interest for the $ 4k.   alternately the bank of mom and dad could offer the 4 k loan for a much lower rate the limit where reporting is not required was $ 12,000 at the time i did the review   irs requires personal loans to be counted as having interest at the commercial rate   thus an interest free loan of $ 10 k with commercial interest rate of 1 for easy math would be counted as a gift of $ for that calendar year disclaimer ultimately i did not use this approach and did not have it subjected to a legal review

discussions around expected values and risk premiums are very useful but there 's another thing to consider cash flow some individuals have high value assets that are vital to them such as   transportation or housing   the cost of replacing these assets is prohibitive to them their cashflow means that their rate of saving is too low to accrue a fund large enough to cover the asset 's loss however their cashflow is such that they can afford insurance while it may be true that over time they would be better off saving that money in an asset replacement fund until that fund reaches a certain level they are unprotected thus it 's not just about being risk averse there are some very pragmatic reasons why individuals with low disposable income might elect to pay for insurance when they would be financially better off without it

you will need to check the language of your sales contract most of the time it will be written that the pro rated property taxes will be part of closing costs in general if you 've already paid taxes then the buyer will pay you the pro rated portion of that from the closing date through the end of the year if you have n't then you would usually be charged the pro rated amount to be held in the buyer 's mortgage company escrow account with the remainder being collected from the buyer at a later date for your income tax purposes you can deduct that tiny amount of the paid property taxes from your income assuming itemized deductions doing some research on property tax for the state of georgia brings up this interesting note if you owned property on january 1 you are responsible for the ad tax for the entire year even if you sell the property on january 2   georgia law does not allow a refund for partial year residents this leads me to believe that your sales contract would have it written in that the buyer paid you almost the entire year 's property taxes in anticipation that you would be responsible for the property taxes as you owned the property on january 1st again you should consult with the settlement attorney and review your contract

the first thing that strikes me is is this a time limited offer because if you can expect the offer to still be valid in a few weeks why not just wait that month which will earn you the money and buy the car then the second thing you need to consider is obviously the risk that in the interim there will be an actual emergency which would require the money that you no longer have the third thing to consider is whether you need the car now do you require a car to get around and your current one is breaking down perhaps even to the point that repairing it would cost you more than buying a new car and it is currently not safe to drive if so compare the cost of repairing to the cost of buying if the difference is small and the new car would be more likely to be reliable than the old car after spending the money then it can make sense to buy a new car and perhaps sell the old one in its current condition to someone who likes to tinker even if you only recover a few hundreds of dollars that 's still money that perhaps you would n't otherwise have the fourth thing i would consider especially given the time frame involved is can you get a loan to buy the new car even if the interest rate is high one month 's worth of interest expense wo n't set you back very far and it will keep the money in your emergency fund for if there is an actual emergency in the weeks ahead doing so might be a better choice than to take the money out of the emergency fund if you have the opportunity save the emergency fund for when that opportunity does not exist and of course without knowing how much you earn take care to not end up with a car that is no more reliable than what you have now without knowing how much you earn and what the car you have in mind would cost it 's hard to say anything for certain but if the car you have in mind costs less than a month 's worth of net pay for you consider whether it 's likely to be reliable maybe you are making an absolutely stellar pay and the car will be perfectly fine but there 's that risk running the car by a mechanic to have it briefly checked out before buying it may be a wise move just to make sure that you do n't end up with a large car repair expense in a few months when the transmission gives up for example

from my recollection of warren buffett 's book warren buffett and the art of arbitrage the following factors determine the difference between the market price of a stock and the future expected price of an acquisition or merger time assuming the deal will close the market price should approach the offer price as the closing date approaches the fact that there is a 14 spread partially reflects the time value of money probability things could happen between now and closing date which could derail the deal the higher the spread the more likely the market thinks the deal will not occur for example lo shareholders could reject the offer saying it is too low or anti trust regulators could say the deal is anti competitive part of this 14 spread indicates the probability of the deal completing

this is a comment not an answer but it needs saying and does n't fit in the comment boxes owning is not always cheaper than renting   houses do n't always appreciate and in the early years of a loan you 're mostly paying interest so that too is lost money the time to buy a house is when you are reasonably sure you are n't going to move in the next five years or so you need something a rental ca n't give you you have at least 20 to put down so you avoid the pmi rip off you 've run a full budget including upkeep and insurance costs and are sure you can carry the house worst case including if you 're out of work for an extended time   i 've seen people lose a job and discover that they ca n't keep the house   and ca n't unload it quickly   good route toward bankruptcy houses are not a liquid asset and being house rich cash poor is potentially dangerous if you really hate apartments   remember that sometimes you can rent houses too often at lower cost per square foot basically do n't be into buying i rented for two decades before i bought and by while doing so i was able to put aside enough investments that i could have bought a half million dollar house for cash and was able to change cities several times without the stress of having to sell and re buy i missed out on the insane housing bubble   but i also avoided being hit when that crashed

you do not need to have high net value and yes you can invest in it typically fund companies require a minimum investment that could be 100 it could be a 1000 5000 should be enough for 99.9 of all funds for an initial investment what you need is an investment company that manages the account for you i can not name those for your country but they should be easy to find companies like and fidelity might serve your country you then open an account with the company of your choice transfer the money and tell them which fund it shall go in all this is possible online you can also go to see an agent in person and he will fill the forms for you and handle all the action but he might take a fee for it

there is the price they want and the price you pay everything is negotiable when its a service always possible but usually harder with actual goods you should always haggle and price match your vendors you can also try going to different vendors and not telling them its for a wedding and see if there really is a price difference for example call up a florist and say you need x y and z for a corporate or for a special event for which you can not give the details if you then tell them its actually a wedding and they blindly raise it without a good justification move on that said they jack up the price because they know most people will says it 's my wedding it 's once in a lifetime it 's my special day etc the same is true about diamonds their price does not reflect the actual supply and demand ratio just the perception that has been created however as mentioned in some of the comments above the service provided at a wedding may be different or more involved than just a normal dinner the more important issue is ensuring there are no back fees no hidden fees and you have well written well reviewed contracts for example we know a couple whose added a mandatory 20 gratuity regardless of the service which was provided most venues or restaurants will not be making the bar a lose leader but they will charge for other things   you can also save money by buying used or looking on ebay for prices closer to wholesale for the product i think a good analogy to this is the recent time magazine article on the price of healthcare it costs a lot because its a small market and its harder to navigate and most are not experienced shoppers in the area or do n't have control over the individual item costs

first of all you nit wit are a group of languages which includes arabic and the arabs by far outnumber you so i ca n't be anti semitic   how the jews have seemed to take the phrase semitic and coin anti semitic to mean a hatred of jews seems to me classic jewish misdirection you may rest assured i hate no language   now if you wish to speak about why i think the jews have been a plague on mankind through the centuries and always the root cause of strife and conflict i have many valid arguments to their display of despicable behavior starting with palestine and the apartheid regime the world looks away from in shame   right here in america we have the jewish control of the federal reserve and the treasury and banking system which continuously put us through the boom and bust cycle we have jews the white house and driving policies that are anti america and pro israel and the we can argue the subject for as long as you like   my point here was that the american people have become so blind and that america can be taken to war in iraq because israeli intelligence decided that they had wmd and it was a threat to israel syria is also a threat to israel and iran is also a threat to israel and so is afghanistan and of course pakistan and saudi arabia   from the looks of it israel and the jews seem to think a majority of the semitic world is out to destroy them so it would seem actually the pitiful few jews left over after the holocaust are actually the anti   and most surprising is the fact that the pitiful few jews actually grew in population during the course of wwii which would actually quite possibly with that rate of breeding make them rabbits thus i would have to plead guilty of being anti rabbits and thank the lord that rabbits have lots of natural predators or jews would grow as big as but fortunately the british had the foresight to not make israel in australia because while they took a pair of rabbits there in the 1700 hundreds look at their population now   we would have a serious jew population explosion on our hands and since they would then be a majority of the semitic languages would be forced to the rabbit population in australia using biological agents and the few potent ones left we could eat in what could later be called the big roast on the in the biggest act of antisemitism that never happened   i am afraid at this point i would like to take the phrase antisemitism back from you and suggest you use a phrase closer to what you are trying to say jew hater   as for me i absolutely hate fucking rabbits

most of stock trading occurs on what is called a secondary market for example microsoft is traded on nasdaq which is a stock exchange an analogy that can be made is that of selling a used car when you sell a used car to a third person the maker of your car is unaffected by this transaction and the same goes for stock trading still within the same analogy when the car is first sold money goes directly to the maker actually more complicated than that but good enough for our purposes in the case of stock trading this is called an initial public offering ipo seasoned public offering for most purposes what this means is that a drop of value on a secondary market does not directly affect earning potential let me add some nuance to this say this drop from 20 $ to 10 $ is permanent and this company needs to finance itself through equity stock in the future it is likely that it would not be able to obtain as much financing in this matter and would either 1 have to rely more on debt and raise its cost of capital or 2 obtain less financing overall this could potentially affect earnings through less cash available from financing one last note in any case financing does not affect earnings except through cost of capital i.e. interest paid because it is neither revenue nor expense financing obtained from debt increases assets cash and liabilities debt and financing obtained from stock issuance increases assets cash and shareholder equity

you should n't the dow has gained 7 annually on average since october adjusted it has also lost 73 of its inflation adjusted value from 1966 to 1982 meaning that it would have lost you 4.5 annually for 16 years furthermore past performance is not indicative of future results if stock markets keep performing like they have for the past 100 years you can expect there will be a point within the next so years your stocks will be higher in value than they were when you bought them with funds you are paying the people managing them which means you are guaranteed to have losses that your gains will have to offset in your case you are betting with no fundamental knowledge that s&p will be higher than now whenever you need the money which is not even supported by the above assumption dollar averaging just means you will be placing many bets which will reduce your expected your expected gains when compared to just buying $ 100 k worth of s&p right now whatever you invest in and whatever your time frame do n't gamble if you ca n't say this will be $ x more valuable than now in x months with probability > y then you should n't be investing in it nobody ever made money by losing money there are also safer investments than the stock market like treasury bonds even if the returns are lousy

i have heard that investing more money into an investment which has    gone down is generally a bad throwing good money after bad so    to speak is investing more money into a stock you already have a stake in    which has gone up in price a good idea other things being equal deciding whether to buy more stocks or shares in a company you 're already invested in should be made in the same way you would evaluate any investment decision and broadly speaking should not be influenced by whether an existing holding has gone up or down in value for instance given the current price of the stock prevailing market conditions and knowledge about the company if you think there is a reasonable chance that the price will rise in the time period you are interested in then you may want to buy more stock if you think there is a reasonable chance the price will fall then you probably wo n't want to buy more stock note it may be that the past performance of a company is factored into your decision to buy e.g was a recent downturn merely a blip and long term prospects remain good or have recent steady rises exhausted the potential for growth for the time being and while this past performance will have played a part in whether any existing holding went up or down in value it should only be the past performance not whether or not you 've gained or lost money that affects the new decision for instance let us suppose for reasons that seemed valid at the time you bought your original holding at £ 10/share the price has dropped to £ 2/share but you now believe both prices were are wrong and that the true price should be around £ 5/share if you feel there is a good chance of this being achieved then buying shares at £ 2 anticipating they 'll rally to £ 5 may be sound but you should be doing this because you think the price will rise to £ 5 and not because it will offset the loses in your original holding you may also want to take stock and evaluate why you thought it a good idea to buy at £ 10 if you were overly optimistic then you should probably be asking yourself whether your current decisions in this or any share are sound there is one area where an existing holding does come into play as both and victor rightly point out keeping a balanced portfolio without putting all your eggs in one basket is generally sound advice so when considering the purchase of additional stock in a company you are already invested in remember to look at the combined total old and new when evaluating how the potential purchase will affect your overall portfolio

no spdr etfs are not a good fit for a novice investor with a low level of financial literacy   in fact there is no investment that is safe for an absolute beginner not even a savings account   an absolute beginner could easily overdraw his savings account leading to fees and collections i would say that an investment becomes a good fit for an investor as soon as said investor understands how the investment works   a savings account at a bank or credit union is fairly easy to understand and is therefore a suitable place to hold money after a few hours to a day of research   even after 0 hours of research however a savings account is still better than a sock drawer money market accounts through a bank certificates of deposit through a bank and money market mutual funds through a mutual fund provider are probably the next easiest thing to understand   this could take a few hours to a few weeks of research depending on the learner equities corporate bonds and government bonds are another step up in complexity and could take weeks or months of schooling to understand well enough to try   equity or bond mutual funds or the etf versions of those which is what you asked about are another level after that also important to understand along the way are the financial institutions and market infrastructure that exist to provide these products   banks credit unions public corporations brokerages stock exchanges bond exchanges mutual fund providers etf providers etc

try using technical analysis look at the charts and look for stocks that are uptrending the of an uptrend being higher highs and higher lows use a stochastic indicator and buy on the dips down when the stochastic is in the oversold position below 20 and and crossing over about to turn back upwards or you can also use the stochastic to trade shares that have been ranging between two prices say between $ 10 and $ 12 for a while as the price approaches the $ 10 support and the stochastic is in oversold you would buy as the price rebounds off the $ 10 support and the stochastic crosses and starts back up as the price starts reaching the resistance at $ 12 with in overbought at above 80 you would look to sell and take profits if you were able to do short selling in the competition you could short sell at this point in time and make profits on the way up as well as on the way down there are many more techniques you could use to set up trade opportunities using technical analysis so it may be a subject you could research further before the begins good luck

living in one unit of a multi family while renting out the others although not without its risks can be a viable if gradual way to build wealth it 's been recently as house hacking but the underlying mechanics have been around for many years many cities in the northeast in particular remain full of neighborhoods of homes built and used for exactly that purpose for decades though now frequently sub divided into condos   it 's true you 'd need to borrow money but there are a number of reasons why it 's certainly at least worth exploring which is what you seem to be asking should you bother doing the homework tl;dr yes and yes you would be relying on tenants to meet your monthly expenses including a mortgage bill that will arrive whether the other units are vacant or not but in most markets rental prices are far less volatile than home prices from the san francisco federal reserve the main result from this is that the behavior of the    price rent ratio for housing mirrors that of the price dividend ratio    for stocks the majority of the movement of the price rent ratio comes    from future returns not rental growth rates emphasis added it 's also important to remember that rental income must do more than just cover your mortgage there 's lots of other expenses associated with a rental property including insurance taxes maintenance vacancy an allowance for the periods when the property will be empty in between tenants reserves for capital improvements and more as with any investment it 's all about whether the numbers work you mentioned not being interested in the upkeep work so that 's another 8 10 off the top to pay for a property manager if you can find a property at an attractive price secure financing on attractive terms and can be reasonably confident that it will rent in the ballpark of 1.5 2 of the purchase price then it might be a fine choice for you assuming you are willing and able to handle the work of being a landlord something worth at least as much of your research time as the investment itself   it sounds like you 're still a ways away from having enough for even an fha down payment which gives you a great opportunity to find and talk with some local folks who already manage rental properties in your area for example you might look for a local chapter of the national real estate investment association to get a sense of what 's really involved

you can get direct market access dma but you have to pay for data as this is part of the exchanges data plan and there are plenty of other fees that are passed straight down to you your clearing firm also has fees that are passed on to you in general you are looking at $ 150 a month on the low side in data and software fees if you wanted pure access nasdaq alone charges $ 6,000 a month last i checked the different routes data routes to the exchange all have different rules and they give you rebates for some kinds of orders in some conditions   brokers nowadays usually assume this responsibility including collecting the rebates lol at the very least and charge an average price for routing your orders a price that fits into their business plan and their target audience hope that helps

equity does not represent production divisions in a company i.e. chocolate strawberry and vanilla does not make sense   in sole proprietorship equity represents 1 owner   in partnership equity has at least two sub accounts namely partner 1 and partner 2   in corporations equity may have common stockholders and preferred stockholders or even different class of shares for insiders and angel investors   as you can see equity represents who owns the company it is not what the company does or manufactures   first and foremost define the boundary of the firm are your books titled the books of the family of doe the books of mr mrs doe or the books of mr mrs doe sons   ask yourself who owns this family if you believe that a marriage is perpetual until further notice then it does not make any sense to constantly calculate which parent owns the family more in partnership firm profits are attributed to partner 's accounts using previously agreed ratio for example because partner 1 is more hard working and valuable to the firm   does your child own this family does he she have any rights to use the assets to earn income from the assets to transfer the assets to others or to enforce private property rights if they do n't have a part of these rights they are certainly not part of equity   so what happens to the expenses of children if you follow the partnership model there are two ways the first way is to attribute the loss to the parents family since you do not expect the children to repay it is an unrecoverable loss written off the second way is to create a account to aggregate all child expense then create a separate book called the books children 1 and classify the expense in that separate book   i advise using the family of doe as the firm 's boundary and having 1 equity account to simplify everything it is ultimately up to you to decide the boundaries

from lots of sensible advisers will tell you to buy index funds but    importantly the advice is not simply buy index funds    there are at least two other critical details 1 asset allocation    across multiple well chosen indexes maintained through regular    rebalancing and 2 dollar cost averaging or    much more complex but probably slightly better value averaging the    advice is not to take your single lump sum and buy and hold a    cap weighted index forever the advice is an investment    discipline which involves action over time and an initial    choice among indexes an index fund based    strategy is not completely passive it involves some active risk    control through rebalancing and averaging if you 'd held a balanced portfolio over the last ten years and rebalanced and even better if you 'd dollar cost averaged you 'd have done fine your reaction to the last 10 years incidentally is why i do n't believe an almost all stocks allocation makes sense for most people even if they 're pretty young more detail in this answer how would bonds fare if interest rates rose i think some index fund advocacy and books do people a disservice by focusing too much on the extra cost of active management and why index funds are a good deal   that point is true but for most investors asset allocation rebalancing and of their setup are more important to outcome than the expense ratio

there are many ways to value a business here is a simple method to get a ball park number on most businesses this business is made of two parts for the real estate for the business   i would consider this type of small business riskier than the stock market and so you should expect a higher return maybe 15 or 20 if the rental business makes $ 50k profit not revenue and that is 20 return of your investment the business is worth $ 250k if the business makes no money or if they only make money because they do n't take a salary then this is a hobby and not a business there 's no business to buy here and you are just bidding on the real estate to do with what you please the assets worth $ 600k and the business worth $ 250k would be added together for a fair sale price of $ adjust for your actual numbers and you should be able to get a ball park of what you think the business is worth if you do the math and it works out that you 'll make 1 3 on your business compare that to investing in other places if it works out that you 'll make 40 on your money that 's pretty awesome too

rebalancing a portfolio helps you reduce risk sell high and buy low i 'll use international stocks and large cap us stocks   they both have ups and downs and they do n't always track with each other international might be up while large cap us stocks are down and vice versa if you started with 50 international and 50 large cap stocks and 1 year later you have 75 international and 25 large cap stocks that means that international stocks are doing relatively well to large cap stocks     comparing only those two categories large cap stocks are on sale relative to international stocks    now move so you have 50 in each category and you 've realized some of the gains from your international investment sell high and added to your large cap stocks buy low the reason to rebalance is to lower risk    you are spreading your investments across multiple categories to manage risk    if you do n't rebalance you could end up with 95 in one category and 5 in another which means 95 of your portfolio is tied to the performance of a single asset category i try to rebalance every 12 months and usually get it done by every 18 months   i like being a hands off long term investor and this has proven often enough to beat the s&p500

interest rates are market driven they tend to be based on the prime rate set by the federal reserve bank because of the tremendous lending capacity of that institution and that other loan originators will often fund their own lending at least in part with fed loans however there is no mandatory link between the federal reserve rate and the market rate no law stipulates that rates can not rise or fall they will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital though a lender asking 10 interest might make no loans when others are willing to lend for 9 the only protection you have is that we are mostly economically free as a borrower you are protected by the fact that there are many lenders likewise as a lender because there are many borrowers stability is simply by virtue of the fact that one market participant with inordinate pricing will find fewer counterparties to transact

i have a buddy that used to run one of those companies that buys gold like the ones you see on tv here 's the deal 1 if the jewelry is n't total junk get it appraised making raw materials into jewelry obviously increases the value since you ca n't buy jewelry for the price of raw gold in many cases it will be worth more as jewelry but not always depends on the piece 2 those companies generally rely on the fact that people selling jewelry to a gold dealer are in a hurry to get cash and are very negotiable on what they will take for it depending on how predatory they are you will probably get between 50 and 75 of the market rate they make a living on the spread and people 's need for quick cash they usually resell it immediately to a 3rd party that actually it down and it   so the short answer to your question is no you wo n't get close to market value with these companies you would do better if you did n't have to go through the middle man but then those final buyers are n't generally the ones who have set up shop to deal with the general public

lots of good answers   i 'll try and improve by being more brief   for each option you will pay different taxes index fund    traditional ira roth ira you can see that the roth ira is obviously better than investing in a taxable account   it may not be as obvious that the traditional ira is better as well   the reason is that in the traditional account you can earn returns on the money that otherwise would have gone to the government today   the government taxes that money at the end but they do n't take all of it in fact for a given investment amount x and returns r the decision of roth vs traditional depends only on your tax rate now vs at retirement because = the left hand side is what you will have at retirement if you do a roth and the right hand side is what you will have at retirement if you do traditional   only the tax rate differences between now and retirment matter here   an index fund investment is like the left hand side but has some additional tax terms on your capital gains   it 's clearly worse than either

there is a misunderstanding    the business and the owner are not the same entity   you said    i give the business $ 25,000 and take 50 of the business no you can give the owner of the business 25 k and now he has 25 k and 50 of a 50 k business    that 25 k sits in mr. smith 's bank account not acme widget 's account    a more simple example is when you buy a car   the money goes to the car dealership it does not get put into the car 's glove box you may be thinking of an investor in a business   he could pump $ $ into the business as operating capital for a share of the business   in that case it would be a bit unfair to get 50 of the business for a 25k.   however the owner may be interested in doing such a deal because value of the investor can add more than just $ $ to the business   having a celebrity investor might do more good for the business than the actual dollars another situation is that the owner might be desperate   without a influx of cash the whole business might end there are guidelines to business evaluation but valuing them is not an easy thing

it depends on your bank and the details in the agreement but typically interest is calculated daily so if you borrow 1000 eur for 1 day you pay 15 1000 eur = 42 cent cent to be exact you can simply multiply these 42 cent up with the number of days you plan and the number of 1000s eur note that weekend days count too even if you can not pay them back on the weekend the exact value will be very slightly different as the interest is added monthly to the principal and there is compound interest on the interest banks also often consider all months 30 days long for interest calculations

as to where the interest comes from the same place it comes from in other kinds of savings accounts the bank takes the money you deposit and invests it elsewhere traditionally by lending it out to others hence the concept of a savings and loan bank they make a profit as long as the interest they give for borrowing from you plus the cost of administering the savings accounts and loans is less than the interest they charge for lending to others no they do n't have to pay you interest but if they did n't you 'd be likely to deposit your funds at another bank which did their ideal goal is to pay as little as possible without losing depositors while charging as much as possible without losing borrowers yeah i know typo corrected why do they get higher interest rate than they pay you mostly because your deposits and interest are essentially guaranteed whereas the folks they 're lending to may be late paying or default on those loans as with any kind of investment higher return requires more work and/or higher risk plus larger reserves so you can afford to ride out any losses that do occur

not everyone pays their balance in full every month they may not make interest off of you or me but they do make interest off of a lot of cardholders in many cases the interest is variable and the larger your running balance the higher your rate if you 're close to your limit and making minimum payments you can literally take decades to pay off $ 2,000 or so   some people do n't pay at all every month and end up paying late fees some people use their cards overseas and pay foreign transaction fees ever take a cash advance me neither but they charge you interest right away for that instead of waiting until your statement the list of fees and charges is as long as my arm and in tiny print that 's how they make money the points bonus cash back and other rewards programs are to get you in the door it 's like when you see a luxury car advertised for a too good to be true price and you get to the lot and find out that the one they are selling for that price is a manual transmission without ac or a radio they only had one and they sold it an hour before you got there it got you on the lot though the rewards programs function in much the same way minus the disappearing part they get you interested in their offering among a sea of virtually identical products but rest assured if the card issuers were losing money because of them they would n't exist for very long

the diversification offered by the advisor can easily be at vanguard with something like the ivy portfolio simplify it or complicate it to your liking with vanguard index reits index stock funds international bond etc set up automatic contributions and do n't watch your money like a hawk set it and forget it or maybe rebalance your holdings once a year the main thing advisors are good for at your level of assets is investors to stay in the market during a crash most investors will sell after a crash and completely miss out on the rebound it 's human nature to be a terrible market timer but if you can really promise yourself never to sell in a panic then you do n't need an advisor at your asset level fees like 1.25 sound like a okay deal but should be viewed in context with an average annual return of say 7 a 1.25 fee represents nearly 18 of your gain for the year and 1.25 may be the least of your fees what about fees when you get out of the funds neat trick huh calling a fee 1.25 instead of is active management worth 18 of your yearly gain your advisor 's fee and the active funds fees compound year after year because they take the fees out of your account every year or month

when you give a gift to another person or receive a gift from another person there is no impact on your taxes you do not have to report certain amounts in your income including the following    gifts and inheritances if you give a gift to a charity or similar organization you can reduce your taxes it is my recollection that when a family member gives a large amount of money to a child tax on the income that money earns typically interest should be paid by the giver not the child but i ca n't find any publications to that effect on the cra site there is a bit of language about gifts from an employer that are really employment income gifts and other voluntary payments 1.3 the term gift is not defined in the act in common law jurisdictions the courts have said that a bona fide gift exists when    is a voluntary transfer of property    donor freely of his or her property to a donee and    donee no right privilege material benefit or advantage on the donor or on a person designated by the donor 1.4 whether a transfer of property has been made voluntarily is a question of fact in order for a transfer to be considered voluntary there must be no obligation to make such a transfer amounts received as gifts that is voluntary transfers without consideration and which can not be attributed to an income earning source are not subject to tax in the hands of the recipient 1.5 however sometimes individuals receive a voluntary payment or other valuable transfer or benefit by virtue of an office or employment from an employer or from some other person in such cases the amount of the payment or the value of the transfer or benefit is generally included in employment income pursuant to subsection or paragraph see also guide guide taxable benefits and allowances similarly voluntary payments or other transfers or benefits received by virtue of a profession or in the course of carrying on a business are taxable receipts if the people in question are adults who are not related to each other and do n't have a business or employment relationship then you should find that regardless of the amount of the gift neither giver nor recipient will have a tax consequence

i somewhat agree to alex b 's post   i was a finance manager for 7 years both prime and sub other words bad    the parts he 's 100 right on   hit up you local credit union then your bank   get your financing done first if you can   now 690 credit score is one of 3 bureaus not all banks and lending institutions use all three or the same one   also the score is n't everything   that could be good or bad   the 2 3 range is normally for the 720 + crowd unless its a manufacture   gm ford so on   with rates capping out at around 30 depending on state laws   however 690 should not be 19 on a new or late model car   at 690 at 19 you would have be going for a 70,000 + mile 6 year or older car if i had to guess assuming you have no bk 's and    some times dealerships have to pay banks to get people financed   its hidden in the cost and they by law are not allowed to tell you about it because it can not be passed on to you   however the banks do n't just fund any crazy amount of money either say like 115 of book and   that it   that is where and why they want that big down payment because that is used to off set the finance amount and what you pay   making the dealership money   and i can go on and on and on    but you should always try to get the funding prior   your credit union wo n't charge the hidden fees and they only care about your down payment to see that you are making a commitment   if you are buying used   save out 1500 for future repairs and tires and such   do n't buy paint and such   if you finance thru the dealership and put less than 20 down do buy gap insurance but that s it   i can go on and on but i wo n't   feel free to ask though    and to answer your original only question with not context is there any reason not to put a 35 down payment on a car yes if the money is better served paying off credit cards or long term mortgage assuming you do n't need the write off

sounds like you are drowning in debt why not just stop paying it will ruin your credit but eventually you might be able to settle for much less than you owe and a reasonable interest rate you will then have a long road to recover you credit but imho this road is much longer and stressful hey you are paying a high interest rate because you are expected to default if you were expected to pay back your rates would be lower

i 've been told by staff in my local car hire agency that they get such big discounts that they actually make money selling the cars so they replace all their cars every six months in the uk the number plate indicates when the car was registered in six month periods this suits the manufacturers because it means they can offer a lower cost product to price sensitive customers while charging more to people who want something brand new for example you could buy a brand new fiesta for £ 14,000 or a 6 month old version of the same car with a few thousand miles on the clock for £ 12,000 this means if you only have £ 12,000 then you can afford to buy a nearly new fiesta but if you can afford a bit more then ford will happily take that off you for a brand new fiesta ford sell an extra car and if the car hire company only paid £ 11,000 then they make some profit too

i 'll just add this in the best hedge funds and proprietary trading funds stock selection is approached very scientifically in order to minimize losses maximize gains researchers think of a trading idea and carefully test it to see which methods of stock selection work and how well and finally they combine them every day researchers update their models based on the past performance of each indicator   all this is just too much work to be done manually firms use machine learning methods to understand markets they try to figure out what is normal what did not happen correctly at a specific time what will happen in future for instance they use deep learning networks to look at data and figure out what is normal and what is not these networks can analyze an of noise and separate out the signal this is very relevant to finance and markets because finding the patterns and anomalies in market data has been the bread and butter of traders for decades deep learning networks give us applications like feature learning by features i 'm referring to certain attributes in data that indicate an event by anticipating them we can help predict future price movements new technology is allowing us to break new ground in managing risk to be a typical and manage risk in ever improving ways it 's the responsibility of every trader whether working for themselves or others to take advantage of this technology to improve the collective investing experience i care very deeply about this i have many close friends in the finance world and without who have lost large amounts of money to poor trade tools and lack of transparency

as the other answer already states whether you should or should n't currency hedge your equity investments depends on a lot of factors if you decide to do so depending on your investment vehicles there might be a more cost efficient way than arranging a separate futures contract with a bank if you are open to or are already investing in etfs there are currency hedged versions of some popular etfs these are hedged against the currency risk for a specific currency for example if you are buying in and expecting to sell for usd you would buy an etf hedged to usd of course they have a higher expense ratio than non hedged etfs since the costs of the necessary contracts are included in the expenses

gt;the system is designed to defend teacher compensation and provide job security as the first priority not to provide the best education for our kids   bingo   it is designed to reward union loyalty and union involvement because by definition those things tend to be inherently far higher in teachers with seniority younger teachers are not so vested in their interests and still have the possibility of shifting careers things which lessen as people age   in short it is an entirely political thing within the unions and politically the older union members outweigh and the younger ones plus of course the older members tend to be in charge of the negotiations

couple of points about being a consultant in the us it sounds like the rules for what you can deduct may be more lax in italy   for example you can deduct a certain percentage of your home for work but the rules are relatively strict on your use of that space and how much is deductible   also things like clothes restaurants phones car use etc must follow irs guidelines to be deductible   this often means they are used exclusively for work and are required for work   a meal you eat by yourself is not generally deductible for example   any expense you would have had anyway if you were not working is generally not deductible a contractor in the us can organize in various ways including sole proprietorship an s corp and a c corp   each has different tax and regulatory implications   in the simple case of a sole proprietorship one must pay not only regular income tax but also self employment tax which is the part of social security and medicare tax normally paid for by one 's employer   estimated taxes must be paid to the government quarterly and then the actual amount due up at the end of the year with the government sending you the difference or vice versa generally speaking contractors may set aside more money pre tax for retirement and have better investment options   this is because solo 401(k retirement accounts are cost effective and flexible and the contractor can set aside the full $ 18 k pre tax as well as having the company contribute generously pre tax to the retirement account   contractors can also easily employ spouses and set aside even more the details of how frequently you are paid as a contractor and how much notice if any the company must give you before terminating your relationship are negotiated between you and the company and are generally pretty flexible   you could get paid your whole year salary in a lump sum if you wanted   the company that is paying you will not normally give you any benefits whatsoever in this way it is the same situation as it is in italy by the way the three points you mention in your edit are definitely not true in the us

you 're not talking about capitalism you 're talking about hate for the bourgeois which you refer to as parasites thus making you the you do n't own a business you work for one if you wanted to create a company you could because you have the freedom to so do the opportunity to as this guy did through discipline and determination but you you prefer to debate religion and give people advice and make assertions on the internet   capitalism is an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit taken right from wikipedia   this guy built a company from the garage of a small house driving a 12 year old car while his friends drove new cars and enjoyed healthy salaries today his company has 7,000 employees and lots of revenue who did he exploit it sounds like he produced a service for profit    so what is the fact that his revenue and profit are larger than most his net profit is much lower than gross profit because of already high liabilities not only including various taxes but as much or more in mandatory insurances i 'd wager the net profit is less than half of the gross profit if his liability increases there is less incentive to continue operations    the fact is he created his business and he can do with it what he pleases

i used for forex trading a couple years ago i am in the us but i think it 's available in the uk as well at the time they had no commissions and their spreads were comparable or better than other brokers the spreads would just quite considerably when a big event like a fed meeting or the unemployment figures come out but i suspect that that is the same everywhere or they have constant spreads and reject trades   they did not push the high like other brokers were at the time i considered this to be very reputable because though the profits to be gotten through leverage are great advertising the reality is that one unexpected spike and a newbie would lose a bunch of money in a margin call

keep in mind that you need to have a cash reserve   blindly applying all stray cash to debt reduction is a bad idea   your lenders do not care about your balance   all they care about is your next payment   it is therefore imperative that you have a cash reserve that can carry these payments for several months   having zero cash reserves puts you at high risk for such simple things as the payroll clerk at work missing the monthly deposit rare but it happens i 've also been in situations where a major client had a cash flow issue and delayed payment and our company had to borrow to meet payroll that month   fortunately we were in good standing with the bank and had low debt but it could have been catastrophic for any employees living paycheque to paycheque

the concept of a social contract is absolute a constitution defines the how of a state the social contract addresses the question why a state even exists and what justifies its existence and i say it again the only justification for the existence of a state is the protection of your rights and freedoms from others   capitalism is based on the exchange of goods and services based on mutual agreement and respect for each other 's property its driving force is competition   it is an invisible force that has been there since the very beginning every other system can be defined as a restriction to capitalism   we agree on that you can work because the state ensures your safety and the protection of your rights that 's the social contract again   police courts and military might be on the list of those necessary services however mandatory public healthcare is not   preventing a monopoly is not about wealth redistribution the driving force behind all the benefits of capitalism is competition once you have a monopoly the whole thing turns sideways in that area you need to introduce a few market regulations and a handful of guidelines for competition but redistribution of wealth wo n't stop its formation

banks are in it to make money but they 're expected to provide a social good which powers our economy secure money storage bank accounts and cashless transactions credit debit cards   and the government does not subsidize this   in fact banks are being squeezed prudent customers dislike paying the proper cost of their account 's maintenance say a $ fee for a credit card or $ for a checking account they want it free   meanwhile government is pretty aggressive about preventing fine print trickery that would let them recover costs other ways   however there is n't much sympathy for consumers who make trivial mistakes whether they be technical overdraft late fee or money management mistakes like doing balance transfers or getting fooled by promotional interest rates   so that 's where banks are able to make their money when people are imprudent   the upshot is that it 's hard for a bank to make money on a prudent careful customer those end up getting subsidized by the less careful customers who pay fees and buy high margin products like balance transfers   and this has created a perverse incentive banks make more money when they actively encourage customers to be imprudent   here the 0 interest is to make you about running up a balance or doing balance transfers at a barely mentioned fee of 3 5 they know most americans do n't have $ 500 in the bank and you wo n't be able to promptly pay it off right before the 0 rate ends   or you 'll forget   and this works that 's why they do it    by law you already get 0 interest on purchases when you pay the card in full every month   so if that 's your goal you already have it   in theory the banks collect about 1.5 from every transaction you do and certainly in your mind 's eye you 'd think that would be enough to get by without charging interest   that does n't work though   the problem is such a no interest card would attract people who carry large balances   that would have two negative impacts first the bank would have to spend money and second the bank would have huge exposure to credit card defaults    the thing to remember is the banks are not nice guys and are not here to serve   you   they 're here to use you to make money and they 're not beneath encouraging you to do things that are actually bad for you caveat emptor

as per the sipc website most customers can expect to receive their property in one to three    months when the records of the brokerage firm are accurate    deliveries of some securities and cash to customers may begin shortly    after the trustee receives the completed claim forms from customers    or even earlier if the trustee can transfer customer accounts to    another broker dealer delays of several months usually arise when the    failed brokerage firm ’s records are not accurate it also is not    uncommon for delays to take place when the troubled brokerage firm or    its principals were involved in fraud source link

according to the answers to this question you generally are n't taxed on gains until you sell the asset in question none of those answered specifically for the u.k. so perhaps someone else will be able to weigh in on that to apply those ideas to your question yes your gains and losses are taxable if you originally traded something worth $ 100 for the bitcoins then when you converted back to dollars you received $ 200 you would have a $ 100 gain simply on the foreign exchange trade that is this $ 100 of income is in addition to any income you made from your business selling goods

wow wow   they grew the fed balance sheet from 800 billion to 4.5 trillion by buying up every bad debt and funny money contract that the banking sector had fraudulently entered into spite of the fact that every economist in the world told them that socializing the debt was bullshit .they gave their banker trillions of dollars of tax payer money money never entered the real economy and remain tied up between the fed and the banks .the real economy never grew inflation never picked up and the wage and income gap grew and the banks got richer and everybody got poorer and now they are going to unwind us 4.5 trillion the fuck that means nobody is buying those toxic assets because they have no value then and not now   if the banks buy it back they are right back where they started with 4.5 trillion of bad debt    so all it could mean is they are going to write it off as a loss and that would mean they have been lying to the american public about what great profits and have mean while transferred us 4.5 trillion free money at tax payer expense to the banks

the effect on your credit score would be a positive one   if you have plenty of money now then pay off the balance each month if you are very disciplined and can pay off the balance each month you could stop using your debit card to make daily purchases and use your credit card instead that way you can keep your money in an interest bearing account all month and pay the bill in full when it comes due

the barrier to entry is extremely high in the isp world you either have to piggyback on an existing isp and their lines or you lay your own obviously google is going with the latter which is a huge undertaking that not only involves the work to actually lay the fiber but also get regulatory approval and the funds to do so they have the resources to do this but only when the cities cooperate and work with them then there 's the work involved with setting up all of the networking infrastructure to actually route customer traffic set up agreements etc basically there are two kinds of entities that can do all this existing isps who obviously want to maintain the status quo and companies with lots of influence and money and technical resources you wo n't find a startup doing what google is doing at least not without some big players backing them

during the settlement period the buyer transfers payment to the seller and the seller transfers ownership to the buyer this is really a from the days when so much of stock trading was done by individual human traders and computers were still not a huge part of the operation   back then paper tickets for trades exchanged hands and the time period was actually 5 days so 3 days is an improvement    a settlement period was necessary for everyone to figure out their trades and do what was necessary to make the settlements happen so it was not always a quick process mainly because of smaller trading firms that did n't have technology to help them along nowadays technology makes settlements easy and they usually occur at the end of the trading day   the trading firms sum up their trades figure out who they owe and send lump sum settlements to the counterparties to their trades   if anything the period may just be used now to let parties verify trades before settling i hope this helps good luck

to round out something that w. rea pointed out the business that a reit is in will be either a equity reit property management b mortgage reit lending or c hybrid reit both   a very key point about why reits broadly have been struggling lately and this would show up in the reit indices etfs you 've linked to is linked to the reit business models   for an equity reit they borrow money at the going rate let 's say for commercial scale loans and use that to take out mortgages on physical properties if a property rents for $ 15 k per month and they can take out a $ 1.8 million loan at $ 9,000 per month then their business is around managing maintenance operating expenses and taxes on that $ 6,000 per month margin for a mortgage reit they borrow funds as a highly qualified borrower again let 's say and lend those funds back out at a higher rate the basic concept is that if you borrow $ 10 million at 4.5 for 30 years you need to pay it back at $ per month if you can lend it out reliably at 5 you collect $ per month a handy $ 3,000 per month the cheaper you can get money at below 4.5 and the higher you can lend it at above 5 the better your margin is   the worry is that both reit business models are very highly dependent on the cost of borrowing money with the us fed changing its bond buying qe stimulus activity the prevailing interest rates are likely to go up while this has its benefits inflation it also will make it more expensive for these types of companies to do business

your mortgage terms are locked in the servicer new owner can not   change the terms without your consent but the servicer can be more aggressive in taking action   as specified in your mortgage contract against you for example if the mortgage agreement calls for penalties for missing a payment or making it late your friendly neighborhood banker might waive the penalty if the payment is received a day late once but perhaps not the second or the third time but the servicer does n't know you personally and does not care you are hit with the penalty right   away if the payment was received a day late because of delays in the post office too bad if you used a bank bill payment service that guarantees on time arrival talk to the bank all   perfectly legal and what you agreed to when you signed the contract if you can set up electronic payments of your mortgage payments you can avoid many of these hassles if you are sending in more money than what is due each month you should make sure that the extra money reduces the principal amount owed easy enough if you are sending a physical check with a coupon that has an entry line for extra payment applied to principal on it but the best mortgage contracts from the bank 's point of view are those that say that extra money sent in applies to future monthly installments that is if you send in more than the monthly payment one month you can send in a reduced payment next month the bank will gladly hold the extra amount sent in this month and apply it towards next month 's payment so read your mortgage document i know i know the fine print is incomprehensible to see how extra money is applied finally re financing your mortgage because you do n't like the servicer is a losing proposition unless you can somehow   ensure that your new bank will not sell your new mortgage to the same servicer or someone even worse

many services charge prices that do not scale linearly with usage   this is because the service provider has fixed costs that they must recoup by charging a rate with a fixed component   a taxi ride is unlikely to cost half what a taxi ride costs   even a half sandwich at a sandwich place usually costs more than half of what a full sandwich costs   in this respect insurance is no different from many other items you may purchase

johnny   i recently bought my first home as well and i have worked in the credit business not mortgage so i think i can answer some of your questions   disclaimer first that i 'm in ny and home buying does vary from state to state in my experience pre qual is not too different from pre approval   neither represents any real on the part of the bank i.e. they can still deny approval at any point and both are based on pulling your credit bureau and calculating ratios based on your stated probably not documented financial information   it 's theoretically possible that a seller would choose a pre approved buyer over a pre qualified buyer all other things being equal but all other things are seldom equal remember also that you do n't need to ultimately get a mortgage from the same bank that you use for the pre qual   the pre qual just shows that you are probably credit worthy and serves to give you some credibility with sellers   once you have an accepted offer and need to find a real mortgage you can shop around for the best rate and best loan structure   banks do n't need to have pulled your credit to quote rates but they will need to have a general idea of your fico range   once you find the bank you like with the best rate and actually apply for the loan they will pull a hard bureau and if your scores are different from what you said before the rate may change but within the same range you 'll generally be ok   also banks do not necessarily pull all 3 bureaus they may only pull 1 as it costs them for each pull 2 potential downsides to this approach also make sure you have a mortgage funding clause in your contract as banks are unpredictable and make sure you have a great real estate lawyer not a legal factory the extra few hundred $ are worth it do n't this credit stuff too much   find a good house for a good price and get a no nonsense mortgage that you fully understand no exotic stuff   good luck

lower fees are always better everything else equal a lower fee makes your transaction overall a better deal all else equal   other transactions costs like the sec fee on sales are mostly the same across brokers and there is unlikely to be any difference in execution quality either   when comparing brokers be sure to consider the other issues to me most of these are minor issues   for that reason i 'd say let transaction cost be your guide i hear a lot of talk about the quality of the interface   if you just want to buy or sell a stock they are all pretty easy   some brokers have better tools for monitoring the market or looking at technical indicators if you are into that

using your uber vs. medallion taxi driver as an example   the problem in the sharing economy is an individual working as an independent contractor takes on all the risk and diminishing rewards while the profit of the company to which the individual is contracted increases significantly    case in point with uber let 's say you decide you want to drive for you lease a prius and thus are on the hook financially for $ 350/month + $ 100/month insurance + $ 300/month gas and other car expenses and you 'll have that for three years that 's a $ 750 nut    your nut remains the same but you have very little protection to ensure that your earnings are going to continue to come in especially if you look at it long term i am most familiar with the ridesharing market here in seattle and just in the last two years the number of ridesharing drivers lyft sidecar has exceeded an estimated 3,000 sure the customer base grows but there is also a continuing influx of additional drivers competing for those fares with the medallion system there is some level of protection to ensure that the industry remains viable for those who carry a medallion i am not advocating completely for this system and realize that the the government protection gave to the taxi industry led to customer service quality issues    so back to uber as uber fights for market share both capturing from the taxi industry but also competing against lyft and people driving their own cars they lower prices in some cases these lower prices have been in the form of discounts in some cases lower fares in seattle currently the minimum fare for an ride is $ 4 it was $ 6 a year ago uber takes a 20 percent cut from drivers and also charges drivers $ 10 a week to use their service if a driver makes $ 1000 a week in fares they pull down $ 800 of that after taxes let 's call it $ 600 so over the course of a month you 're looking at $ 2400 minus your nut including phone rental let 's call it $ 1600 take home pay    these people are n't getting rich to begin with and are at a huge risk for when uber or lyft or task rabbit or whoever decides to cut their prices again these services are beyond great for the consumer but are a temporary for anyone relying on them for work the big problem here is that companies like uber are advertising heavily that you can make $ on their service enticing people to make investments in things like cars to drive with them but at the end of the day you 're an independent contractor and uber owes you nothing    i believe uber i single them out because i think lyft is a little better at this on the ignorance of potential drivers to lure them into the system

bull means the investor is betting on a rising market puts are a type of stock option where the seller of a put option promises to buy 100 shares of stock from the buyer of the put option at a pre agreed price called the strike price on any day before expiration day   the buyer of the put option does not have to sell it is optional that s why it is called buying an option   however the seller of the put is required to make good on their promise to the buyer the broker can require the seller of the put option to have a deposit called margin to help make sure that they can make good on the promise    profit the buyer can profit from the put option if the stock price moves down substantially    the buyer of the put option does not need to own the stock he can sell the option to someone else   if the buyer of the put option also owns the stock the put option can be thought of like an insurance policy on the value of the stock   the seller of the put option profits if the stock price stays the same or rises   basically the seller comes out best if they can sell put options that no one ends up using by expiration day a spread is an investment consisting of buying one option and selling another let 's put bull and put and spread together with an example from apple so if you believed apple inc. aapl currently was going up or staying the same through jan you could sell the 600 jan put and buy the 550 put   if the price rises beyond 600 your profit would be the difference in price of the puts   let 's explore this a little deeper prices from google finance 31 oct 2012 worst case   aapl drops below 550   the bull put spread investor owes 600 shares = $ 5000 in jan but received $ for taking this risk edit 2016 the worst case was the outcome in this example the aapl stock price on options expiry jan 18 2013 was about $ net profit = $ $ 5,000 = = loss of $ best case   aapl stays above 600 on expiration day in jan net profit = $ 0 = $ break even   if aapl drops to the value of the 600 jan aapl put sold will equal the $ collected and the bull put spread investor will break even commissions have been ignored in this example

i do not and did not support the usa in afghanistan syria and iraq    when it comes to iraq i only refer to the 2001 events i do support the usa actions in the gulf war versus iraq in the 1990 totally justified and a good necessary work in the 1990s   i will add the usa and only the usa is 100 responsible for the mess we have now in syria and iraq instead of supporting the in those countries countries that do not understand democracy and are not ready for democracy the usa actively worked to topple their reasonable leaders in a failed attempt to do arab spring and nation building   same thing with iran instead of supporting the of iran a great and person carter created the mess we have with iran today   we are so lucky that egypt managed to kick out the democratically elected crazy religious guy and replace it with a good a    as for palestine i have no doubt that you are totally clueless about the this just like your misguided support for n.korea   let 's start with n.korea i think that usa should stay out of it and only explain that if ever japan or korea get attacked by n.korea then n.korea will be wiped out from the face of the earth the usa should let the neighboring countries of china russia and india check the map handle n.korea and those countries know how to handle any from n.korea very very well we should stay out of this business   bill clinton is 100 responsible for why n.korea have nuclear weapons with that stupid nuclear agreement he did with them and even giving them nuclear reactors obama will be 100 responsible for iran having nuclear weapons soon   back to palestine a short real true and verifiable historical summary there was never ever a country or nation of palestine the only reason we hear about palestine and palestinians today is because in 1967 israel liberated the local arabs from a 1948 occupation by egypt and jordan of land given to them by the un for which israel agreed to if the 1967 events never happened you would not hear today about palestine and palestinians true or false   so israel never wanted to be a greater israel to rule over millions of additional arabs as part of its democracy or occupation more arabs than jews israel is not that dumb true or false   the blockade is actually by egypt and israel check the map egypt has a border with gaza true or false   the local arabs can have a palestine for themselves already in 1948 if they agreed to the un partition plan or 1967 after they were liberated by israel israel has only one condition in 1948 and in 1967 for a palestine that palestine needs to be a nice neighbor to israel they do n't want to be nice so no palestine until they grow up true or false

risk is the capital you have in pursuit of profit the danger is that you lose what you have risked   for some bets risks you can get insurance to cover for losses   now the game of landlord and tenant requires you to play fully by the rules set forth by your legislators in your case that is the legislators of the state of texas without knowing those rules you could be liable open to civil prosecution for violating those rules tenants could be savvy to those rules or savvy enough to hire someone a lawyer who knows those rules as well in the game of landlord and tenant you must ascertain the creditworthiness of your would be tenant if the tenant fails to pay rent that tenant can the residence you will incur additional outlays to gain possession of your property ownership in your rental now the game of landlord vs landlord is different you ca n't pick up houses easily enough and even if you could likely the expense of doing so could wipe out any would profits from having the house as a rental so in landlord vs landlord you get constrained by where your rental sits thus you must forecast what will the neighborhood look like in five ten fifteen years

it depends on what your investment goals are   are you investing for the short term or the long term   what was your reason for investing in these stocks in the first place   timing short term fluctuations in the market is very difficult so if that 's your goal i would n't count on being able to sell and buy back in at exactly the right time   rather i think you should think about what your investment rationale was in the first place and whether or not that rationale still holds   if it does then hold on to the stocks   if it does n't then sell

not being able to keep up with demand for at least a foreseeable 5 years as you just said is a pretty huge failure in itself and i do n't see them being able to last they underestimated the market and i expect some of the big established automakers like toyota ford and nissan to swoop down and meet the demand with their own offerings as well as with new models tesla as you just noted still has yet to be profitable whereas amazon has been around for some 20 years now and has actually turned a profit and they 've had the huge ups and downs of just about any 20-year old business so your comparison of amazon 's last quarter losses to tesla 's last quarter losses is pretty absurd

the contract should address this issue it will specify the types of remedies and damages that would result if either side tries to back out of the deal there can be monetary penalties and the courts can force the seller to complete the deal where i have experienced this it generally takes only a gentle reminder from the agent regarding the consequences there is also limited indirect protection via the contract between the seller and their real estate agent many times that contract will require the seller to pay the agent their commission if there is n't a valid reason to cancel the deal the contract was to find a fully qualified buyer the threat of having to pay 6 of list price to the agent and not selling the house can be enough to get them to complete the deal all this assumes there was fraud which could bring in criminal penalties

students 1 to pay off all student loans is n't inflationary it would be deflationary   no if you have to print money out of thin air and letting it circulate in the economy then you are expanding the money supply inflation it would have to contract the money supply to be deflation even if the money is being spent on student loan payments it is still circulating in the economy provided the recipients of the loans banks or government depending use it later   debt was created out of thin air sure but debt is not money so it has nothing to do with inflation or deflation it can be paid back over long periods of time in the case of student loans 35 years the government could pay students back over the course of 50 years to reduce the debt burden for them but it would hardly be getting the same amount back in tax revenue the government gives someone $ 1,000 and they spend it all you might generate a couple hundred dollars in taxes over the course of the year if that money keeps changing hands   this solution is not feasible those in occupy need to come up with something more realistic

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

the prices reflect what the market will bear   people have more money things will likely cost more   think of it in terms of percentages and you can start to justify the higher housing costs my father likes to tell me that his first mortgage cost him $ 75 a month and he had no idea how he was going to pay it each month   he also earned $ at his job   so his housing costs were 15 of his gross income   my dear father almost passed out when he learned that my mortgage was $ 1000 a month but since i earn $ gross i am really only paying 25 of my salary   numbers made up so if he complains i pay 10 more so be it but complaining i pay $ more is n't worrying to me because of my increased salary so if your complaint is the amounts you must take ratios percentages and relative comparisons   however if you are baffled by people having money and wasting it on silly or foolish purchases i am with you   i still do n't understand why people will use the closest atm and just pay the $ 2 fee do right by yourself and do n't mind what others are up to

that is such a vague statement i highly recommend disregarding it entirely as it is impossible to know what they meant their goal is to convince you that index funds are the way to go but depending on what they consider an active trader they may be supporting their claim with irrelevant data their definition of active trader could mean any one or more of the following 1 retail investor 2 day trader 3 mutual fund 4 professional investor 5 fund continuously changing its position 6 hedge fund i will go through all of these 1 most retail traders lose money there are many reasons for this some rely on technical strategies that are largely unproven some buy rumors on penny stocks in hopes of making a quick buck some follow scammers on twitter who sell newsletters full of bogus stock tips some ca nt get around the psychology of trading and thus close out losing positions late and winning positions early or never at all i myself use to do this i am certain 99 of retail traders ca nt beat the market because most of them to be frank put less effort into deciding what to trade than in deciding what to have for lunch even though your pension funds presentation is correct with respect to retail traders it is largely irrelevant as professionals managing your money should not fall into any of these traps 2 i call day traders active traders but its likely not what your pension fund was referring to day trading is an entirely different animal to long or medium term investing and thus i also think the typical performance is irrelevant as they are not going to manage your money like a day trader anyway so the important question becomes do active funds lose 99 of the time compared to index funds no no no no according to the wsj actively managed funds outperformed passive funds in 2007 2009 2013 2015 2010 was basically a tie so 5 out of 9 years i do nt have a calculator on me but i believe that is less than 99    what s interesting is that this false belief that index funds are always better has become so pervasive that you can see active funds have huge outflows and passive have huge inflows it is becoming a crowded trade i will spare you the about large crowds and small doors also index funds are so heavily weighted towards a handful of stocks that you end up becoming a anyway the s&p is almost indistinguishable from aapl earlier this year only 6 stocks were responsible for over 100 of gains in the nasdaq index do nt think fb has a good long term business model or that gilead and amzn are a cheap buy well too bad if you bought qqq because those 3 stocks are your now see here 6 that graphic is for mutual funds but your pension fund may have also been including hedge funds in their 99 figure while many do nt beat their own benchmark its less than 99 and there are reasons for it many have investors that are impatient fortress just had to close one of its funds whose bets may actually pay off years from now but too many people wanted their money out some hedge funds also have rules eg long only which can really limit your performance while important to be aware of this that placing your money with a hedge fund may not beat a benchmark that does not automatically mean you should go with an index fund so when are index funds useful when you do nt want to do any thinking when you do nt want to follow market news at all then they are appropriate

you ask a few different though not unrelated questions everywhere you turn today you hear    people talk about how much they need    to save or how important it is to find    a good deal on things in this    economy they use phrases like now    more than ever and in these    uncertain times it seems to be a lot    of doom and gloom some of this is marketing   you may notice that when the economy goes south the number of ads for the cheaper alternatives goes north   e.g. hair discount grocery stores discount just about anything   truth is we should always be looking for ways to save money on goods and services we purchase   the question is what is acceptable to you for your desired lifestyle   and is that desired lifestyle reasonable for your income age and personal situation   generally speaking the harder times are the more we find discounted cheaper alternatives acceptable    is there really a good reason that    people should be saving more than    spending right now how much you are putting away is a personal matter   i can still remember my dad whenever he could n't save half of his paycheck   that said putting away half your paycheck may lead to a rather lifestyle   this of course depends on the size of your paycheck and your desired lifestyle   you could be raking it living simply and potentially put away more than half your income with relative ease if you have a stable job and a decent cash reserve is it anymore dangerous to make a large purchase now than it was seven years ago who knows   honestly no one   predicting the future is a fool 's errand   if you are interested in reading more on this view point i suggest the black swan you mention the correct approach in this question   ensure that you have liquid assets cash or cash equivalents i.e. money that you can draw on immediately and is n't credit which covers at least 3 6 months of your necessary expenses rent mortgage bills car payments food   there is no reason that you could n't try to increase this to 1 year especially in this economy you should also strive to have money available for emergencies that do n't necessarily include loss of income   of course make sure you 're putting away for retirement as appropriate for your retirement goals   after that should come discretionary items including investing entertainment the large purchase you mentioned etc    you should never use money that you may need immediately 5 10 years for investing   this does n't necessarily include the large purchase you are contemplating   for example if you are considering purchasing a home the down payment may be one of the items for which you need money in the immediate future is it really only because of unemployment numbers this is probably the big one that is the focus of everyone 's attention   that said the human attention span is limited   we have a natural need to simplify things   this is one of the reasons that we tend to focus on a few hopefully important things   however the unemployment numbers are not that the only thing of concern   credit is still pretty hard to come by these days   the overall economy is still hurting even if we are technically no longer in a recession   there are also concerns about u.s. government borrowing consumer spending recent trucking numbers etc   it may not be obvious but trucking is used as a barometer of economic activity   if there are n't as many trucks goods across the country it probably means that there is less economic activity   the headline number these days is unemployment as most census workers have now been returned to the pool to answer the overall question we should always be saving money in good times or in bad   be that by squeezing more value out of our purchases or by putting some money away   we should always try to reduce our risks by having an emergency cash cushion   we should always be saving for retirement   truth be told it is probably more important to put money away in good times before the hardships hit

quantitative easing explained the short of it is that you 're right the fed or another country 's central bank is basically creating a large amount of new money which it then injects into the economy by buying government and institutional debt this is in fact one of the main jobs of the central bank for a currency to manage the money supply which in most fiat systems involves slowly increasing the amount of money to keep the economy growing if there is n't enough money moving around in the economy it 's reflected in a slowdown in gdp growth while controlling inflation the devaluation of a unit of currency with respect to most or all things that unit will buy including other currencies inflation 's primary cause is defined quite simply as too many dollars chasing too few goods when demand is low for cash because you have a lot of it while demand for goods is high the suppliers of those goods will increase their price for the goods because people are willing to pay that higher price and will also produce more with quantitative easing the central bank is increasing the money supply by several percentage points of gdp much higher than is normally needed this normally would cause the two things you mentioned inflation inflation 's primary cause is too many dollars chasing too few goods when money is easy to get and various types of goods and services are not people bid up the price on these things to get them this usually happens when sellers see high demand for a product and increase the price to take advantage and to prevent a shortage this often happens across the board in a situation like this but there are certain key drivers that can cause other prices to increase things like the price of oil which affects transportation costs and thus the price to have anything shipped anywhere whether it be the raw materials you need or the finished product you 're selling with the injection of so much money into the economy rampant inflation would normally be the result however there are other variables at play in this particular situation chief among them is that no matter how much cash is in the economy most of it is being sat on in the form of cash or other safe havens like durable commodities gold and t debt so most of the money the fed is injecting into the economy is not chasing goods it 's repaying debt savings and generally being hoarded by consumers and institutions as a hedge against the poor economy in addition despite how many dollars are in the economy right now those dollars are in high demand all around the world to buy treasury debt one of the biggest safe havens in the global market right now so much so that buying t debt is considered saving this is why the yields on treasury bonds and notes are at historic lows it 's bad everywhere and u.s. government debt is one of the surest things in the world market especially now that euro bonds have become suspect currency devaluation this is basically specialized inflation when there are more dollars in the market than people want to have in order to use to buy our goods and services demand for our currency the medium of trade for our goods and services drops and it takes fewer euros yen or yuan to buy a dollar this can happen even if demand for our dollars inside our own borders is high and is generally a function of our trade situation if we 're buying more from other countries than they are from us then our dollars are flooding the currency exchange markets and thus become cheaper because they 're easy to get again there are other variables at play here that keep our currency strong first off again it 's bad everywhere nobody 's buying anything from anyone relatively speaking and so the relative trade deficits are n't moving much in addition devaluation without inflation is self if currency devalues but inflation is low the cheaper currency makes the things that currency can buy cheaper which encourages people to buy them at the same time the more expensive foreign currency increases the cost in dollars of foreign made goods all of this can be beneficial from a money policy standpoint devaluation makes american goods cheaper to americans and to foreign consumers alike than foreign goods and so a policy that puts downward pressure on the dollar but does n't make inflation a risk can help american manufacturing and other producer businesses china knows this just as well as we do and for decades has been artificially fixing the exchange rate of the b yuan lower than its true value against the dollar meaning that no matter how cheap american goods get on the world market chinese goods are still cheaper because by definition the yuan has greater purchasing power for the same cost in dollars in addition dollars are n't only used to buy american made goods and services the u.s. has positioned its currency over the years to be an international medium of trade for several key commodities like oil and the primary currency for global lenders like the imf and the world bank that means that dollars become necessary to buy these things and are received from and must be repaid to these institutions and thus the dollar has a built in demand pretty much regardless of our trade deficits   on top of all that a lot of countries base their own currencies on our dollar by basically buying dollars using other valuable media like gold or oil and then holding that cash in their own central banks as the store of value backing their own paper money this is called a dollar board their money becomes worth a particular fraction of a dollar by definition and that relationship is very precisely with 10 billion dollars in the vault and 20 billion issued from 's central bank a is worth $ .50 print an additional 20 billion and the value of one decreases to $ .25 buy an additional 10 billion dollars and the 's value increases again to $ .50 quite a few countries do this mostly in south america again creating a built in demand for u.s. dollars and also tying the u.s. dollar to the value of the exports of that country if 's goods become highly demanded by europe and its currency increases relative to the dollar then the u.s. dollar gets a boost because by definition it is worth an exact fixed number of and also because a country with a dollar board typically has no problem accepting dollars as payment and then printing to maintain the exchange rate

a market crash wo n't affect your cash held with your broker however if the broker defaults goes bankrupt you may lose some or all of that cash if you read the customer agreement that you signed when opening the account it 's very likely that there 's a clause that stipulates that under certain circumstances the broker has the right to use your cash and/or your positions without notice if the broker default you may not be able to recover the assets they 've been using as an example look at clause 14 of the interactive brokers us customer agreement this is a fairly standard clause depending on your jurisdiction you may have a partial or full legal protection against such an event e.g. the sipc protection for us based brokers which would apply to you if your broker is ib llc even if you are not a us resident citizen

as far as the banker himself goes it 's a customer service issue   wf is not going to tell you about their internal discipline or ought n't anyway other than potentially to confirm that the banker does or does not still work there that 's the closest they should get to telling you about it   i 'm a very former retail manager and that 's absolutely the most i 'd ever do in a case like this and trust me even with good customer service reps you get requests to fire someone a lot sometimes valid sometimes not you did the correct thing from your end you brought the issue to their attention   despite the quota it 's hopefully not permitted to sign people up without their permission since that 's illegal and i can say that in my retail experience with these promotions with great incentive to cheat in this manner one of the main things our loss prevention department did was to monitor data to see if people were signing people up for cards or otherwise cheating the system   that could be a very bad thing from a customer service point of view and from a legal point of view what you should have done or possibly did but it 's not clear in your post is after you reported the issue asked for a re contact on a particular date in the future not after you 've looked into it but next friday i would like to get a call from you to discuss the resolution   again they 're not going to tell you the discipline but they should tell you at least that they 've investigated it and will make sure it does n't happen again or similar   it 's possible they will want more information from you at this point and this is a useful way to make sure that request does n't fall off of their plate   they should be able to at least tell you if there was a perceived issue on their end it might be something meaningless to you like he thought you said to sign up or something more descriptive like he pushed the button to send you a notice but our computer system screwed that up and made it an application   you never know these days how easy it is to screw these things up now they certainly should have fixed the issues on your end   hopefully they did whatever you needed them to do banking wise or else you withdrew your money and went somewhere else   if not follow up with that supervisor 's supervisor or go up a level or two to a regional director or equivalent   they may not be able to cancel the card for you but the other banking related things they certainly should fix   the card you probably just have to cancel and be done with as far as the misuse of personal information one thing i 'd consider doing is placing a freeze on your credit report   then this could never have happened you would have to lift it to have your report pulled to be given the card   this is not free though so consider this before doing this

well it would appear that you had a wash sale that canceled out a loss position   without seeing the entire report i could n't tell you exactly what was happening or how you triggered 1091   but just from the images it appears as though your purchase of stock was layered into multiple tranches perhaps you acquired more of the stock in the period than you sold possibly because of a prior holding    if in the period around the sale of stock 30 days before and 30 days after you also acquire the same stock including by contract or option then it out your loss   if you held your stock for a while then in a period bought more and sold some then any loss would be washed out by the acquisition   of course it is also a wash sale if your purchase of the stock follows your sale rather than it   your disallowed loss goes into the basis of your stock holding so will be meaningful when you do have a true economic sale of that stock from irs pub 550 a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you buy substantially identical stock or securities acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities or acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account ira or roth ira if you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock you also have a wash sale looking at your account images we can see a number of positions sold at a loss sale proceeds less than basis but each one is adjusted to a zero loss   i suspect the fuller picture of your account history and portfolio will show a more complicated and longer history with this particular stock   that is likely the source of the wash sale disallowed loss you might be able to confirm that all the added numbers are appearing in your current basis in this stock or were reflected upon your final exit from the stock

if your money market funds are short term savings or an emergency fund you might consider   moving them into an online saving account   you can get interest rates close to 1 often above 1 in higher rate climates and your savings are completely safe and easily accessible   online banks also frequently offer perks such as direct deposit linking with your checking account and discounts on other services you might need occasionally i.e. money orders or certified checks    if your money market funds are the lowest risk part of your diversified long term portfolio you should consider how low risk it needs to be   money market accounts are now typically fdic insured they did n't used to be but you can get the same security at a higher interest rate with laddered cd 's or u.s. savings bonds if your horizon is compatible if you want liquidity or greater return than a cd will give you then a bond fund or etf may be the right choice and it will tend to move counter to your stock investments balancing your portfolio    it 's true that interest rates will likely rise in the future which will tend to decrease the value of bond investments   if you buy and hold a single u.s. savings bond its interest payments and final payoff are set at purchase so you wo n't actually lose money but you might make less than you would if you invested in a higher rate climate   another way to deal with this if you want to add a bond fund to your long term investment portfolio is to invest your money slowly over time dollar cost averaging so that you do n't pay a high price for a large number of shares that immediately drop in value

most patterns can be used on various time frames for example you could use candle stick reversal patterns on monthly charts weekly charts daily charts or intra day charts like one hour or even one minute charts obviously if you are looking for longer term positions you would be looking at daily weekly or monthly charts and if you are looking for shorter term positions you would be looking at intra day to daily charts   you can also use a combination of time frames for example if you are trying to enter a trade over a long term uptrend you could use a weekly chart to determine if the stock is currently uptrending and then use a daily chart to time your entry into the trade most patterns in general do n't really determine how long you will be in the trade but instead usually can provide an entry trigger a stop loss location and possibly a profit target   so in general a pattern which is being used to enter into longer term trades on weekly charts can also be used to enter shorter term trades on intra day charts

nyt a nifty infographic that shows how the s&p 500 performs over various time horizons if you study it for a bit you 'll see that 10 percent is not likely over time that you 'll earn 10 percent annually after inflation most people quoting the higher number are working with numbers before inflation   the above linked chart is misleading in the following sense it groups into five categories who 's boundaries are by percentages of interest but we 'd rather see them clustered by those percentages for example percent falls into the neutral category better than investing in fixed interest securities but still below market average but 7.1 falls into the above average category the effect is that we will treat the neutral color that dominates the long term trend as being somewhere in the middle of 3 7 when i suspect that 's not the case some day i 'll probably make my own version and see how that plays out   so that all said if you look at the 30 year diagonal you can see there 's still quite a bit of variation in returns unfortunately i ca n't turn this into a single number for you but grab a spreadsheet and some market data if you want one

a closed end fund is a collective investment scheme that is closed to new investment once the fund starts operating   a typical open ended fund will allow you to buy more shares of the fund anytime you want and the fund will create those new shares for you and invest your new money to continue growing assets under management   a closed end fund only using the initial capital invested when the fund started operating and no new shares are typically created always exception in the financial community   normally you buy and sell an open end fund from the fund company directly   a closed end fund will usually be bought and sold on the secondary market here is some more information from wikipedia some characteristics that distinguish a closed end fund from an ordinary open end mutual fund are that another distinguishing feature of a closed end fund is the common use of leverage or gearing to enhance returns cefs can raise additional investment capital by issuing auction rate securities preferred shares long term debt and/or reverse repurchase agreements in doing so the fund hopes to earn a higher return with this excess invested capital

to understand the answer we first have to understand what goodwill is goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name good customer relations good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology an article from the economist explains this very well and actually talks about time warner directly the goodwill the bad and the ugly when one firm buys another the target ’s goodwill essentially the    premium paid over its book value is added to the combined entity ’s    balance sheet goodwill and other intangibles on the books of    companies in the s&p 500 are valued at $ 2.6 trillion or 10 of their    total assets according to analysts at goldman sachs as the economy and more firms trade down towards or even    below their book value empire builders are having to mark down the    value of assets they out on in times a recently    announced $ 25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push time warner    into an operating loss for 2008 for instance michael of    goldman sachs thinks such hits could amount to $ 200 billion or more    over the cycle investors have so far paid little attention to    intangibles but as write downs they are likely to become    increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to    assets such as health care consumer goods and telecoms how bad things get will depend on the american firms    used to be allowed to goodwill over many years since 2002    when an accounting rule change ended that practice goodwill has had    to be tested every year for impairment in this environment    with auditors than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on    clients companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any    doubt about their value the point out that this has no effect on cashflow since such    charges are non cash items moreover some investors take goodwill    write offs with a pinch of salt preferring to look past such    non recurring costs and accept the higher earnings    numbers to which managers understandably cling the largest companies    are thus able to survive blows that might otherwise floor    them such as the $ 99 billion loss that the newly formed but    ill conceived aol time warner as it then was reported for 2002 but    the impact can be all too real as write downs reduce overall book    value and increase leverage ratios a particular concern in these    debt averse times

you want to regard loans as short term last ditch desperate effort for when you get caught in a bad spot and have a good workable plan to get out of it   you do n't ever want to start a business on borrowed money unless you 're an expert in the field of your business with a lot of experience in running businesses in that sector     the best thing to do is to get a job and save all your money to start a business that will make you enough money to start the business you really want   you may need to start a business to get the money to start a business to get the money to start a business to get the money to start the business you want   whatever it takes really   just do it all yourself   do n't accept loans or favors   also the whole world except amazon is moving from brick and mortar to the internet and you 're trying to move internet sales to brick and mortar   it 's a little backward looking   it could work but there 's probably some research you could do to test the feasibility of this idea   you need to be creative in designing effective science based ways to predict your success or failure   do n't worry about licensing issues with wholesalers   that 's not something to be worried about at this point

rule of thumb the earlier you pay down your balance the less interest you will accrue and the faster you will pay off the debt as a whole but lets play with some real numbers here   you cited $ 5000 balance and a $ 750 payment but with various bills and things adding onto the balance over the course of a month now if your purchases and payments add up to the same number you are in a losing game so for the sake of argument i am going to say you are putting $ 500 + interest on the card each month and making a $ 750 payment   we also need an interest rate to work with i am going to use and 30 day months to keep the math a bit easier to follow    you basically have two choices in this scenario you can pay 750 a month on the card then use it to make your $ 500 in purchases other payments over time as you suggest in your question   or you can pay $ 250 and hold back $ 500 to make those other payments directly without running them through the card as has been suggested in some other answers so let us compare the two if i start the cycle at $ 5000 make a $ 250 payment on the first day of the cycle then have no other activity i will have a balance of $ for the month and accrue $ in interest at the close of the cycle   balance going into the next period is now $   carry this out for a year and your balance at the close of the 12th cycle is $ and $ of your payments went to interest by contrast if you pay $ 750 at the start of the month then add $ 100 back every 6 days so that you spend $ 500 over the course of the cycle you will have an average daily balance of $ which results in $ in interest charges being accrued at the end of the month   this gives you a balance of $ going into the next cycle putting you about $ 3 ahead of the previous method   push this pattern out for a year and your ending balance is with going to interest   resulting in a savings of over making the smaller payment and paying cash for your other expenses   if this happens to be a rewards card you also have gained whatever rewards benefit it gives you this demonstrates that by the strict numbers game the scenario you propose should come out a small but measurable distance ahead of making a smaller payment in order to avoid putting things back on the card   so why do so many people advise you to not do this    most of it has to do with psychology and risk   the cash method does not leave any room for you to over spend   you have or locked up the credit card so it ca n’t be used casually and when you run out of cash you ca n’t spend any more   which forces you to pay much closer attention to where your money is going    when you are running things through the credit card you generally do n’t have that hard stop unless you are up against your credit limit and even then most issuers are quite happy to let you go over and charge you extra fees for doing so   so if you have this plan where you are intending to put $ 500 on the card in a month then lose track of something you did early in the month and inadvertently spend $ 800 you are digging yourself deeper into the hole instead of climbing your way out there is also a risk in terms of income loss   in the cash method you no longer have the money to spend and you are forced to make the hard decisions about where to allocate what you do have making you much more likely to cut back on luxury items to preserve the necessities   in the card method it is easy to say eh the card has room i can catch up again later and not realize the mess you are causing yourself until you are in way over your head   i personally have run all my bills through a credit card in the past so that i could have one single payment to make   then i was unemployed for six months and ended up moving before i found a new job   everything in between including the move went on the card   next thing i know i am carrying a balance of $ 15k where i used to always have it paid in full   it took roughly 10 years including several years of working strictly in cash to get that back under control i currently have a card that is carrying a balance and i am running select expenses such as fuel and food through it while i the balance back down   most of my main bills are still paid directly from cash specifically so that i do n’t fall back into the same trap i did before   even so there were several months in the past year where the balance was creeping up instead of down because we were not paying that close of attention to our spending    then my wife lost her job and it forced us to closely evaluate where our money was going   we still run certain things through said card but we are much stricter about it being only those select things and the balance is trending down again   the main reason we are still those expenses that way is because this is a cash back reward card and we will be getting roughly $ 1000 back here in a couple more months

it really depends a lot on you and how much time you are putting into it since you 're saying you want your money to work for you i 'm going to assume you want as little hassle as possible a few general tips save a fixed percentage of your monthly income do n't try to save whenever you have money left over you will just end up spending it somehow invest long term do n't trade do n't try to beat the market it will just take up too much time and statistically you will end up making less hedge if you invest in the company industry you work in you will be double screwed if the sector drops lose job + savings at the same time optimally you should invest in something that will benefit when the company you work for is doing bad pay off high interest debt usually debt will have a higher interest than any safe investment you can make spend money to save make money sometimes the best investment you can make is on stuff that will save you money in the long run like buy an apartment close to work less transport costs or get a more expensive car that will save you money on gas insurance etc

it depends if cost of tuition + income forgone during studying years is less than your lifelong discounted incremental cash flows you receive thanks to your education then it is not worth it   if your studies are say 150 k and you forego another 60k y during 4 years of university you will need to make roughly 39 k more per year until you retire than you otherwise would have or more for your degree to be worth it i do n't see that as very realistic scenario for 90 of the people who get degrees    obviously cheaper more expensive degrees different discount rate assumptions and different salaries before during after university are different from person to person that 's why everyone has to make their own calculation and then decide whether or not to make such a risky investment in themselves

once you buy stocks on x day of the month the chances of stocks never actually going above and beyond your point of value on the chart are close to none how about enron   gm worldcom lehman brothers   those are just a few of the many stocks that went to 0   even stock in solvent companies have an all time high that it will never reach again    please explain to my why my thought is   it is based on flawed assumptions specifically that stock always regain any losses from any point in time   this is not true   stocks go up and down sometimes that have losses that are never made up even if they do n't go bankrupt   if your argument is that you should cash out any gains regardless of size and you will never lose i would argue that you might have very small gains in most cases but there are still times where you are going to lose value and never regain it and those losses can easily wipe out any gains you 've made    never bought stocks and if i try something stupid i 'll lose my money so why not ask the professionals first if you really believe that you ca n't lose in the stock market then do not buy individual stocks   you may as well buy a lottery ticket not really those are actually worthless   stick to index funds or other stable investments that do n't rely on the performance of a single company and its management   yes diversification reduces not eliminates risk of losses   yes chasing unreasonable gains can cause you to lose   but what is a reasonable gain   why is your guaranteed x% gain better than the unreasonable y% gain how do you know what a reasonable gain for an individual stock is

no one can really answer this for you   it is a matter of personal preference and the details of your situation   there are some really smart people on here when placed in your exact situation would do completely different things   personal finance is overall personal if it was me i 'd never borrow money in retirement   if i had the cash i 'd use it to help fund the purchase   if i did n't i simply would n't   for me wealth retention in your case is surprisingly more about behavior than math even though i am a math guy   you are simply creating a great deal of risk at a season in your life with a diminished ability to recover from negative events   in my opinion you are inviting tales of woe to be part of your future if you borrow others would disagree with me   they would point to the math and show how you would be much better off on borrowing instead of pulling out of investments provided a sufficient return on your nest egg   they may even have a case as you might have to pay taxes on money pulled out magnifying the difference in net income on borrowing versus pulling out in a lump sum   here in the us the money you pulled out would be taxed at the highest marginal rate   to help with a down payment of 50 k you might have to pull out to pay the taxes and have enough for the down payment the third option is to not help with a down payment or to help them in a different way   perhaps giving them a few hundred per month for two years to help with their mortgage payment   maybe watch their kids some to reduce day care costs or help with home improvements so they can buy a lower price home   those are all viable options   perhaps the child is not ready to buy a home having said all that it really depends on your situation   say your sitting on 5 million in investments your pensions is sufficient to have some disposable income and they are asking for a relatively small amount   then pull the money out and do n't be concerned   you nest egg will quickly recover the money

i do n't have anything definitive but in general positions in a company are not affected materially by what is called a corporate action corp actions can really be anything that affects the details of a stock common examples are a ticker change or exchange change ipo ie a new ticker doing a split or merging with another ticker all of these events do not change the total value of people 's positions if a stock splits you might have more shares but they are worth less per share a merger is quite similar to a split the old company 's stock is converted two the new companies stock at some ratio ie 10 shares become 1 share and then converted to the new symbol shorting a stock that splits is no different you shorted 10 shares but after the split those are now 100 shares when you exit the position you have to deliver back 100 new shares though dollar for dollar they are the same total value i do n't see why a merger would affect your short position the only difference is you are now shorting a different company so when you exit the position you 'll have to deliver shares of the new company back to the brokerage where you borrowed the shares you shorted

in my view it 's better to sell when there 's a reason to sell rather than to cap your gains at 8 i 'm assuming you have no such criteria on the other side i.e. hold your losses down to 8 that 's because what matters is how much you make overall in your portfolio not how much you make per trade example if you own three stocks equal amounts and two go up 20 but one falls 20 if you sell your gains at 8 and hold the loser you have net lost money so when do you actually sell you might say a fall of 10 from the last high is good enough to sell this is called a trailing stop which means if a stock goes from 100 to 120 i 'll still hold and sell if it to 108 needless to say if it had gone from 100 to 90 i would still be out the idea is to ride the trend for as long as you can because trends are strong and keep your trailing stops wide enough for it to absorb natural because you may get stopped out of a stock that falls 4 but eventually goes up 200 or sell under other conditions if the earnings show a distinct drop or the sector falls out of favor   whenever you decide to sell also consider what it would take for you to buy the stock back increased earnings strong prices a product release whatever because getting out might seem like a good thing but it 's just as important to not think of it as saying a stock is crappy it might just be that you had enough of one ride that does n't mean you ca n't come back for another one

my first question to you is if you itemize   if not the charitable contributions will not do any good   along these lines donating unused items to goodwill or similar can help boost your charitable giving    the bottom line is that the 401 k is one of the few real deductions high earners have   if you anticipate earning similarly next year you could both contribute the max   you still have some time before the end of the year can you get more in your wife 's account does your state have income tax   you might be able to deduct sales tax for larger purchases if you made any   however i would not justify a large purchase just to write off the sales tax   conventional wisdom will tell you that you should have a large mortgage in order to deduct the interests   however it does not make sense to pay the bank 10 k so you can get 3 k back from the government   that seems pretty dumb if you did not do additional withholding you probably will have to pay a significant amount plus penalty if you owe more than $ 1000   you still have time to make one more quarterly payment so you may want to do so by january 15th for next year i would recommend the following the funny thing about giving is that it rarely helps the recipient it does so much more for the giver   it helps you build wealth for myself i like to give to charities that have a bent to helping people out of poverty or homelessness   we have two excellent ones here in orlando fl   orlando rescue mission and christian help   both have significant job training and budgeting programs

on topic of healthcare needs i think it depend on individual   for example my employer 's dental plan offer ppo $ 34 per month and $ 12 per month i have my favor dentist that i have been going for years he only accept ppo i already had most of my dental works done so i only use him for teeth clean he charge $ 100 without insurance and free with insurance i can only use my insurance for teeth clean twice a year so $ = $ vs $ 200 if i go with i wo n't get to see my doctor and since i get my teeth once a year why not just save that money and go to my favor doctor instead the doctors and if i need major dental works done which is n't immediate i can go to taiwan for dental works that is way cheaper than u.s.   i think if you 're a healthy young man women you should put more money toward your retirement and only keep insurance for emergency you can do a medical tourism mentioned in 60 minutes that can be more cost effective and those doctors are u.s. trained   for older folks a full health care insurance is more needed than retirement just my two cents

document how you came to have the stuff in the first place first to defend against potential government inquiry and second to establish that you held the asset more than one year so you qualify for long term capital gains rate   i would n't sell it privately all at once if you can avoid it    if you can prove you held it more than a year   you should pay the long term capital gains tax rate which is fairly low   you 'll keep most of it   a huge windfall often goes very badly people do n't change their financial habits burn through their winnings shockingly fast overspend it and wind up deep in debt   at the end of the crazy train their lives end up worse    that was n't your question but you 'll do better if you 're on guard for that with good planning and a desire to invest it in things which give you deferred income in the future that 's the cooler thing when your investments mean you do n't have to go to work i do n't mean donate all of it to charity but feel free   if you hold a security more than one year and donate it to charity you get a tax deduction for the appreciated value even though the security did n't actually cost you that link do not convert the btc to cash then donate the cash donate it as btc   your tax deduction works against your highest tax bracket   if you are paying in a 28 tax bracket your next $ 100 of income has $ 28 tax then for every $ 100 of charitable donation you get $ 28 back on federal it does the same to state tax and you also avoid the 10 15 capital gains tax because you did n't sell the securities   do your 1040 both ways and note the difference your charitable deduction of appreciated securities is capped at 30 of agi   any excess will carryover and becomes a tax deduction for the next year and it can carryover for several years   use a donor advised fund if you have are donating more than $ 5000 you do n't need to search for a charity that will take bitcoin and you also do n't need to pick a charity now   instead open a special type of giving account called a donor advised fund   the daf itself is a charity it specializes in accepting complex donations and liquidating them into cash   the cash credits to your giving account   you take the tax deduction in the year you give to the daf   then when you want to give to a charity you tell the daf to donate on your    you can tell them to give on your behalf anonymously or merely conceal your address so you do n't get the endless charity junk mail    the daf lets you hold the money in index funds so your charity nest egg can grow with the market   mine has more than doubled thanks to the market   this money is no longer yours at this point you ca n't give it back to yourself only to licensed charities the fidelity donor advised fund makes a big thing of taking bitcoin and i really like them i love my daf and it has been a charitable giving   it turns you into a philanthropist and that changes you life in ways i can not describe certainly makes me more level headed about money    lottery winner syndrome is just not a risk for me partly because i 'm now on the board of charities and oversee an endowment   donating generally will reduce suspicion criminals do n't do that but donating to a daf even moreso   since the daf would have to return ill gotten gains they 're involved   their lawyers will back you up   the prosecutor is up against a billion dollar corporation instead of just you   with fidelity particularly bitcoin is a crusade for them and their lawyers know how to defend bitcoin   a fidelity daf is a good play for that reason alone imo   the gory details presumably you are donating to regular charities or a donor advised fund and these are 50 limit organizations since it 's capital gains you have a 30 limit if your donation is more than 30 of agi or if you have carryover from last year you use worksheet 2 in publication you plug your donations into line 4 then the worksheet grinds through all the math and shows what part you deduct this year and what part you carryover to the next year   i specifically asked managers at two whether they were ok with someone donating a complex asset to the daf and immediately giving the entire cash amount to a charity   the daf does n't get any fees if you do that   they said not only are they ok with it most of their donors do exactly that and most daf accounts are empty   they make it on the 0.6 a year custodial fee on the other accounts and charitable giving to them     mind you you can only donate to type charities what irs calls 50 limit organizations   this actually protects you from donating to organizations who lie about their status   i 'm not with fidelity but i am a satisfied daf customer   the daf funds its overhead by deducting 0.6 per year from your giving account if you invest the funds in a mutual fund within the daf that investment pays the 0.08 to 1.5 expense ratio of the fund    i can live with that   i just the value of donating $ 100 of appreciated security instead of taking it as capital gains income   28 fed tax 15 fed cap gains 8 state tax on both   take the $ 100 as income pay $ 23 in cap gains tax   donate $ 100 in securities the $ 23 tax goes away since you did n't sell it really   the $ 100 charitable deduction offsets $ 100 in income also saving you $ 36 in regular income tax   net tax savings $ 59   however you lost the $ 100   so you are net $ 41 poorer   it costs you $ 41 to donate $ 100 to charity   this gets better in higher brackets

market cap probably is n't as big of an issue as the bid ask spread and the liquidity although they tend to be related the spread is likely to be wider on lesser traded etf funds we are talking about pennies likely not an issue unless you are trading in and out frequently the expense ratios will also tend to be slightly higher again not a huge issue but it might be a consideration you are unlikely to make up the cost of paying the commission to buy into a larger etf any time soon though

i think playing certain kinds of lottery is as economically sound as buying certain kinds of insurance   a lottery is an inverted insurance let me elaborate   we buy insurance for at least two reasons the first one is clear we pay a fee to protect ourselves from a risk which we do n't want to or can not bear although on average buying insurance is a loss because we pay all the insurance 's office buildings and employee 's salaries it still is a reasonable thing to do but it should also be clear that it is unreasonable to buy insurance for risks one could easily bear oneself the second reason to buy insurance is that it puts us at ease we do n't have to be afraid of theft or of a mistake we make which would make us liable or of water damage to our house in that sense we buy freedom of for a fee even if the damage would n't in fact ruin us that 's totally legitimate now i want to make the argument that buying a lottery ticket follows the same logic and is therefore not economically unreasonable at all while buying a lottery ticket is on average a loss it provides us with a chance to obtain an amount of money we would normally never get eric made this argument already the lottery fee buys us a small chance of something very valuable much as the insurance frees us from a small risk of something very bad if we do n't buy the ticket we may have 0 chance of becoming extremely rich if we buy one we clearly have a chance > 0 which can be considered an improvement imagine you 'd have a chance to save the life of a loved one with a ticket who 'd be 100 doomed otherwise you 'd bite even the second argument that an insurance puts us at ease can be mirrored for lotteries the chance to win something may provide entertainment in our otherwise dull everyday life considering that playing the lottery only makes sense for the chance to obtain more money than otherwise possible one should avoid lotteries which have lots of smaller prizes because we are not really interested in those it would be more economical to save the money for smaller amounts we ideally only want lotteries which lean on the big money prizes

firstly if a stock costs $ 50 this second the bid ask would have to be   if the bid ask were the stock would cost $ 51 this second   what you 're likely referring to is the last trade not the cost   the last trading price is history and does n't apply to future transactions to make it simple let 's define a simple order book   say there is a bid to buy 100 at $ 49 200 at $ 48 500 at $ 47   if you place a market order to sell 100 shares it should all get filled at $ 49   if you had placed a market order to sell 200 shares instead half should get filled at $ 49 and half at $ 48   this is of course assuming no one else places an order before you get yours submitted   if someone beats you to the 100 share lot then your order could get filled at lower than what you thought you 'd get   if your internet connection is slow or there is a lot of latency in the data from the exchange then things like this could happen   also there are many ecns in addition to the exchanges which may have different order books   there are also trades which for some reason get delayed and show up later in the time and sales window but to answer the question of why someone would want to sell low the only reason i could think is they desire to drive the price down

a fund is generally speaking a collection of similar financial products which are bundled into a single investment so that you as an individual can buy a portion of the fund rather than buying 50 portions of various products e.g. a bond fund may be a collection of various corporate bonds that are bundled together the performance of the fund would be the aggregate of each individual item generally speaking funds are like pre packaged diversification rather than take time and fees to buy 50 different stocks on the same stock index you could buy an index fund which represents the values of all of those stocks a portfolio is your individual package of investments ie the 20k you have in bonds + the 5k you have in shares + the 50k you have in funds + the 100k rental property you own you might split the definition further buy saying my 401(k portfolio my taxable portfolio my real estate to denote how those items are invested the implication of portfolio is that you have considered how all of your investments work together ie your 5k in stocks is not so risky because it is only 5k out of your entire portfolio which includes some low risk bonds and funds another way of looking at it is that a fund is a special type of portfolio that is a fund is a portfolio that someone will sell to someone else see daniel 's answer below for example imagine you had $ 5,000 invested in ibm shares and also had $ 5,000 invested in apple shares call this your portfolio but you also want to sell your portfolio so let 's also call it a fund then you sell half of your fund to a friend so your friend let 's call him maurice pays you $ 4,000 to invest in your fund maurice gives you $ 4k and in return you given him a note that says maurice owns 40 of 's fund   the following month ibm pays you $ 100 in dividends but maurice owns 40 of those dividends so you give him a cheque for $ 40 some funds automatically reinvest dividends for their clients instead of paying them out immediately then you sell your apple shares for $ 6,000 a gain of $ 1,000 since you bought them but maurice owns 40 of that 6k so you give him $ 2,400 or perhaps instead of giving him the money immediately you reinvest it within the fund and buy $ 6k of microsoft shares why would you set up this fund because maurice will pay you a fee equal to let 's say 1 of his total investment your job is now to invest the money in the fund in a way that aligns with what you told maurice when he signed the contract ie maybe it 's a tech fund and you can only invest in big tech companies maybe it 's an index fund and your investment needs to exactly match a specific portion of the new york stock exchange maybe it 's a bond fund and you can only invest in corporate bonds so to reiterate a portfolio is a collection of investments think of an artist 's portfolio being a collection of their work usually people refer to their own portfolio of personal investments a fund is someone 's portfolio that other people can invest in this allows an individual investor to give some of their decision making over to a fund manager in addition to relying on expertise of others this allows the investor to save on transaction costs because they can have a well diversified portfolio see what i did there while only buying into one or a few funds

sadly most jurisdictions do n't think this way when they assign property taxes   you have x acres our standard for this county is $ y per acre so you owe $ property taxes     and if you tax by dwelling size and features you are saying a poor person can not live in a nice house   lets say joe millionaire buys a fancy $ 2 m house with a fancy pool and all the trimmings   sure joe millionaire can afford the high taxes of say $ 20k year   but what if jim who makes only $ 35k year spends 10 years and about $ 100k building a similar nice house out of scrap materials he finds purchases on sale or on craigslist etc   he rents a and   a gun and builds himself a fancy pool it really nice and the county comes in and says well jim that 's a $ 2 m house you owe us $ 20k year in taxes for it   jim ca n't afford it and the county takes his house for unpaid taxes   screw you and your efforts poor person   and before you say he can just sell it for $ 2 m well what if he made it unique to his tastes and no one wants to buy it   or the market is bad right now     and yes this has happened to someone i know though the house was valued at $ 500 k he still could n't afford the taxes   and since it was not yet fully finished he had to sell it for only about $ 100k after working on it for several years   so yes as long as you want to make sure poor people can not live in nice places property tax is the way to go

historical volatility of a stock is going to be based on past performance basically its current trend   that can be useful but really is no indication of how it will perform in the future   especially with a big swing in the market now if you 're talking about implied volatility iv of an options contract that 's a little different   iv is derived from an option ’s price and shows what the market implies about the stock ’s volatility in the future thus it is based on the actions of active traders and market makers   so it gives you a bit more insight into what 's going on but at times has less to do with fundamentals i guess a good way to think of iv based on options contracts is as an educated opinion of the market as a whole with regards to how much that stock could likely move over a period of time options expiration also note that iv represents the potential for a stock to move but it does not forecast direction i do n't know of any studies off the top of my head but i 'm sure there have been plenty
