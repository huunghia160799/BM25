i realize this is a stale topic but to anybody who may swing by looking for an answer to this question on the recently revised w-8ben a foreign taxpayer can get an individual taxpayer identification number itin without being resident in the us   however an itin will often not be necessary for w-8ben purposes if you have a tax number from your local jurisdiction   check the form w-8ben instructions for your specific situation but some taxpayers will need neither a us issued itin nor a foreign issued tin forming a delaware or nevada llc would be expensive and generally subject to federal and state tax and filing obligations   it would also moot the need for a w-8ben which only applies to foreign taxpayers the equivalent form for domestic taxpayers is form w-9

you should not form a company in the u.s. simply to get the identification number required for a w-8ben form by establishing a u.s based company you 'd be signing yourself up for a lot of additional hassle   you do n't need that   you 're a european business not a u.s. business   selling into the u.s. does not require you to have a u.s. company   you may want to consider what form of business you ought to have in your home country however anyway to address your immediate concern you should just get an ein only   see what is a w8-ben   quote    there are other reasons to    fill out the w8-ben but for most of    you it is to make sure they do n’t hold    back 30 of your payment which for a    small company is a big deal    how do i get one of these ein us taxpayer identification numbers ein stands for employer identification    number and is your permanent number    and can be used for most of your    business needs e.g. applying for    business licenses filing taxes when    applicable etc   you can apply by    filling out the form but the    easier preferred way is online however i also found at irs.gov online ein frequently asked questions the following relevant q. are any entity types excluded from    applying for an ein over the internet    a.    if you were incorporated outside of the united states or the u.s.    territories you can not apply for an    ein online please call us at      941 1099 this is not a toll free    number between the hours of a.m.    to p.m. eastern time so i suggest you call the irs and describe your situation   you are a european based business sole proprietor selling products to a u.s based client and would like to request an ein so you can supply your client with a w-8ben the irs should be able to advise you of the correct course of action disclaimer i am not a lawyer   consider seeking professional advice

zero ten grand somewhere in the middle it depends your stated salary in u.s. dollars would be high five figures you certainly should not be starving but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement money can indeed be tight month to month at that salary level especially since even in you 're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most u.s. markets edit actually apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on food

's response is generally correct you would n't have to pay taxes on insurance benefits since those are in fact bringing you whole to what you 've lost however in some cases you do need to consider taxes specifically if the insurance payout is higher than your cost basis in the lost property while you may think that this never happens why would the insurance company pay more than what it cost you it in fact quite frequently does specific example would be a car used in your business if you used your car as part of your business and deducted car depreciation on your tax return your cost basis was reduced by the depreciation getting a full car cost payout form insurance would in fact constitute taxable income to you for the difference between your cost basis adjusted for the depreciation and the payout another example would be collectibles say you bought a car 20 years ago at $ 5000 you maintained it well during the years assume you spend another $ 5000 on repairs and it is now insured at fmv of $ 50000 but alas it got destroyed by a mountain lion who climbed over the fence and pushed it over a cliff you got a $ 50000 payout from your insurance company because you insured it for full fmv coverage as a collectible should be insured of which $ 40000 will be taxable to you there may be more specific cases where insurance payouts are partially taxable however as a general rule they 're not as long as they 're at or below your cost basis level

if i understand your question you 're misunderstanding the buy sell spread and at least in this instance seem to be in an unfortunate situation where the spread is quite large the polish zloty gbp ideal exchange rate is around   thus when actually exchanging currency you should expect to pay a bit more than zloty to get one pound sterling and you should expect to get a bit less than zloty in exchange for one pound sterling   that 's because you 're giving the bank its cut both for operations and so that it has a reason to hold onto some zloty that it ca n't lend out   it sounds like barclay 's has a large spread buy sell   i would guess british banks do n't need all that many zloty so you have a higher spread than you would for usd or eur other currency exchange companies or banks particularly those who are in the primary business of converting money may have a smaller spread and be more willing to do it for you   also it looks like the polish banks are willing to do it at a better rate certainly they 're giving you more zloty for one pound sterling so it seems likely the other way would be better as well though since they 're a polish bank it 's certainly easier for them to give you zloty so this may be less true   barclay 's is certainly giving you a better deal on pounds for a zloty than they are zloty for a pound in terms of how far off their spread is from the ideal

it is n't that the companies force traders it is more the other way around traders would n't trade without margin the main reason is liquidity and taking advantage of minor changes in the forex quotes it goes down to pips and traders make on movement of pips maybe by 1 or 2 and in some cases in or less of a pip so you need to put in a large amount to make a profit when the quotes move up or down supposedly if they have put in all the amount upfront their trading options are limited and the liquidity in the market goes out of the window the banks and traders can not make a profit with the limited amount of money available at their disposal so what they would do is borrow from somebody else so why not the broker itself in this case maybe the forex company and execute the trades so it helps everybody forex companies make their profit from the fees more the trades done more the fees and hence more profit traders get to put their fingers in many pies and so their chances of making profits increases so everybody is happy

if you have wage income that is reported on a w2 form you can contribute the maximum of your wages what you can afford or $ 5500 in a roth ira    one advantage of this is that the nominal amounts you contribute can always be removed without tax consequences so a roth ira can be a deep emergency fund i.e. if the choice is $ 2000 in cash as emergency fund or $ 2000 in cash in a 2015 roth ira contribution choice 2 gives you more flexibility and optimistic upside at the risk of not being able to draw on interest gains until you retire or claim losses on your tax return   if you let april 15 2016 pass by without making a roth ira contribution you lose the 2015 limit forever   if you are presently a student and partially employed you are most likely in the lowest marginal tax rate you will be in for decades which utilizes the roth tax game effectively    if you 're estimating a few hundred then what you pick as an investment is going to be less important than making the contributions   that is you can pick any mutual fund that strikes your fancy and be prepared to gain or lose call it $ or pick a single stock and be prepared to lose it all   at some point you need to understand your emotions around volatility and the only tuition for this school is taking a loss and having the presence of mind to examine any panic responses you may have   no reason not to learn this on a few hundred   while it 's not ideal to have losses in a roth a few hundred is not consequential in the long run    if you 're not prepared at this time in your life for the possibility of losing it all or will need the money within a year or few as your edit suggests keep it in cash and try to reduce your expenses to contribute more   can you contribute another $ 100   you will have more money at the end of the year than investment choice will likely return

quick lowes story   i just shopped at lowes for the first time a few days ago found the bbq i wanted king baron 440 available there it was cheaper at sears but since they are another dying large box retailer and do n't answer their phone i decided to go to lowes when their customer support team said they would price match   when i got to the till with my purchase and showed them the website for the price match they said they were n't sure if they could do it because it said out of stock online   15 minutes later and a call to the boss and they said sorry we can not match the $ sale price at sears but we can offer you 10 off sears original price of $   quick math shows that 10 off $ is in fact $    so you have to go out of your way to say you can not do the price match but actually you are doing the price match accidental customer service   all of these stores that do business this way are slowly dying the only reason i 'm there is for customer service i can usually order online and it will be easier and most likely cheaper    an immediate price match would be a great customer experience and would likely lead me to venture back to lowes in the future instead i left feeling like they did n't really want to help me out but accidentally did

former wfm team member here about a decade and still have a lot of store management staff as friends   wfm has always wanted to be the tech company of grocery stores but their implementation strategy has been absolutely worthless and piecemeal due to their method of expansion in in the 90s and early 2000s where they would buy up regional organic grocery chains across the nation and pretty much just integrate them into the company as a separate entity   imagine wfm as really 7 different companies that have almost zero in common with each other from policies to product selection to buyers to computer systems so they 've never been able to get the it part of their business to be effective even though they 've desperately wanted to because every region has had different it that was n't entirely compatible with the others   on top of that they tried to upgrade the current systems to a perpetual inventory system that did not work you ca n't just modify current systems to be fundamentally different from what their original intended function was   with amazon coming in hopefully they can gut the system and start over fresh using wfm 's current regional distribution as a hub for expanding their own product offerings honestly i think amazon was looking at its seattle store with no employees as a prototype for what they could achieve with an actual chain   a lot of what 's holding wfm back on the price of their products is that they huge distribution costs they 're relying on which is in my experience not exactly great if amazon can utilize what they do well inventory management shipping technology and business support services i think they can decrease the cost of their products by the 20 25 target they need to hit to remain competitive in natural and organic foods because right now they 're getting absolutely by kroger trader joe 's walmart sprouts and so many others

you have several options depending on your tolerance for risk certainly open an investment account with your bank or through any of the popular discount brokerage services then take however much money you 're willing to invest and start earning some returns you can split up the money into various investments too a typical default strategy is to take any money you wo n't need for the long term and put it in an index fund like the s&p 500 or a european equivalent yes it could go down especially in the short term but you can sell shares at any time so you 're only 2 3 days away at any time from liquidity historically this money will generate a positive return in the long run for smaller time frames a short term bond fund often gives a slightly better return than a money market account and some people like me use short term bond funds as if it were a money market account there is a very low but real risk of having the fund lose value so you could take a certain percentage of your money and keep it close in a bond fund likewise you can sell shares at any time win or lose and have the cash available within a couple days

this is obviously a spam mail your mortgage is a public record and mortgage brokers and insurance agents were are and will be soliciting your business as long as they feel they have a chance of getting it nothing that that particular company offers is unique to them nothing they can offer you can not be done by anyone else it is my personal belief that we should not do business with spammers and that is why i suggest you to remember the company name and never deal with them however it is up to you if you want to follow that advice or not what they 're offering is called refinance any bank credit union or mortgage broker does that the rates are more or less the same everywhere but the closing fees and application fees is where the small brokers are making their money big banks get their money from also servicing the loans so they 're more flexible on fees all of them can do streamline refinance if your mortgage is eligible none if it is n't note that the ones who service your current mortgage might not be the ones who own it thus renegotiating the rate is most likely not an option fha backed loans are sold to fannie and freddie the original lenders continue servicing them but do n't own them refinancing is a more likely option and in this case the lender will not care about your rate on the old mortgage

one of the of free trade is that there is now a global labor market so companies routinely review their operations and think strategically about where the company is going standard options are because the disincentives that once existed in the past are gone the need for humans to do work tariffs regulation poor infrastructure in the developing world the available supply of labor is greater and demand lower thus wages are falling in real terms think in the simplest terms in an office environment   in 1980 to make you needed a xerox machine that required a technician on site every couple of weeks to make adjustments change toner etc there was probably a local rep you called to schedule break fix now technology has replaced that copy machine with a cheap multi function device that requires no maintenance and any technical support is delivered by a person sitting in a indian call center so to answer your question the incremental money from rising prices goes to a number a places alot of it goes to oil producers and other commodity producers much of it consists of indirect costs that fulfill other mandated services when you buy something buried in that cost are things like health insurance prescription drugs and school taxes

you owe no tax on the option transaction in 2015 in this case   how you ultimately get taxed depends on how you dispose of the position   if it expires then you will have a short term capital gain on the option position at expiration   if it is exercised then the option is gone for tax purposes and your basis in the underlying is adjusted   from irs publication 550 if a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss the gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock in your case this will be a long term capital gain for completeness if you buy to cover the option back from the market before expiration or exercise then it is also a short term capital gain also keep in mind that this all assumes that this covered call is qualified so that it does not count as a straddle   you can find more about that in pub 550 all of this is for us tax purposes

here 's a little different perspective i 'm not going to talk about the quality of the investment the expected return or any of the other things you normally talk about when evaluating investments this is about family and the most important thing here is the relationships   what you need to do here is look at the different possible scenarios and figure out how each of these would make you feel only you can evaluate this for example here are some questions to ask yourself i know how i would answer these questions but that would n't help you any but the advice i would give you is assuming you have this money to lose and are also investing elsewhere evaluate this solely on the basis of the effect on your family relationships   the only other piece of advice i would give you is to knock out that student loan and car loan debt as fast as you possibly can minimize your investments until that debt is gone so you can get rid of it even faster

this is really an extended comment on the last paragraph of 's answer when the manager of a mutual fund sells securities that the fund holds for a profit or receives dividends stock dividends bond interest etc the fund has the option of paying taxes on that money at corporate rates and distributing the rest to shareholders in the fund or passing on the entire amount categorized as dividends qualified dividends net short term capital gains and net long term capital gains to the shareholders who then pay taxes on the money that they receive at their own respective tax rates if the net gains are negative i.e. losses they are not passed on to the shareholders see the last paragraph below   a shareholder does n't have to reinvest the distribution amount into the mutual fund the option of receiving the money as cash always exists as does the option of investing the distribution into a different mutual fund in the same family e.g. invest the distributions from vanguard 's s&p 500 index fund into vanguard 's total bond index fund and/or vice versa this last can be done without needing a brokerage account but doing it across fund families will require the money to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account such cross transfers can be helpful in reducing the amounts of money being transferred in re balancing asset allocations as is recommended be done once or twice a year those investing in load funds instead of no load funds should keep in mind that several load funds waive the load for re investment of distributions but some funds do n't the sales charge for the reinvestment is pure profit for the fund if the fund was purchased directly or passed on to the brokerage if the fund was purchased through a brokerage account as ben points out a shareholder in a mutual fund must pay taxes in the appropriate categories on the distributions   from the fund even though no actual cash has been received because the entire distribution has been reinvested it is worth keeping in mind that when the mutual fund declares a distribution say $ a share the net asset value per share drops by the same amount assuming no change in the prices of the securities that the fund holds and the new shares issued are at this lower price that is there is no change in the value of the investment if you had $ 10,000 in the fund the day before the distribution was declared you still have $ 10,000 after the distribution is declared but you own more shares in the fund than you had previously in actuality the new shares appear in your account a couple of days later not immediately when the distribution is declared   in short a distribution   from a mutual fund that is re invested leads to no change in your net assets but does increase your tax liability ditto for a distribution that is taken as cash or re invested elsewhere as a final remark net capital losses inside a mutual fund are not distributed to shareholders but are retained within the fund to be written off against future capital gains see also this previous answer   or this one

it only matters for purposes of the dependent so if you are clearly at 50 then you do n't need to calculate this cost   if it is close to not being 50 then you will have to allocate between your sister and mother   to calculate support costs you can of course include the costs incurred for transportation per pub 17 p 34   if you and your sister have an arrangement where she uses the car and in exchange she shoulders extra costs for your mother then that 's legitimately your expense for your mother as long as this is a true agreement then it was money she owed you but paid directly to the vendors and creditors that you would have paid note that there is a simpler avenue   if your sister agrees that you will claim your mother as dependent and nobody else provides any substantial support of costs then she can just agree that it 's you who will claim her   if you like such an agreement may be attached to your taxes possibly using form   as a general rule though you do not need to use or any other agreement nor submit any support calculations   if your sister verbally agrees that she has n't and wo n't claim your mother then it 's unlikely to cause any problems   her signed agreement not to claim your mother is merely the most conservative possible documentation strategy but is n't really necessary   see pub 17 p 35 on multiple support agreements for more info

it looks like fair market value when you receive your virtual currency is counted as income and you 're also subject to self employment tax on that income here 's an faq from the irs does a taxpayer who mines virtual currency for example uses    computer resources to validate bitcoin transactions and maintain the    public bitcoin transaction ledger realize gross income upon receipt    of the virtual currency resulting from those activities yes    when a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency the fair market    value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible    in gross income see publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income    for more information on taxable income is an individual who    mines virtual currency as a trade or business subject to    self employment tax on the income derived from those activities    if a taxpayer ’s mining of virtual currency constitutes a trade or    business and the mining activity is not undertaken by the taxpayer    as an employee the net earnings from self employment generally    gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business less    allowable deductions resulting from those activities constitute    income and are subject to the self employment tax see    chapter 10 of publication 334 tax guide for small business for more    information on tax and publication 535 business    expenses for more information on determining whether expenses are    from a business activity carried on to make a profit you 'd of course be able to offset that income with the expense of mining the virtual currency depreciation of dedicated mining equipment electricity not sure what else edit here 's a good resource on filing taxes with bitcoin filling in the 1040 income from bitcoins and all crypto currencies is    declared as either capital gains income or ordinary income for    example from mining income ordinary income will be declared on either    your 1040 line 21 other income for an individual or within your    schedule c if you are self employed or have sole proprietor business    capital gains capital gains income or losses are declared on    schedule d. since there are no reported 1099 forms from bitcoin    exchanges you will need to include your totals with box c checked for    short term gains and with box f checked for long term gains interesting notes from that article your first example could actually be trickier than expected if you started mining before there was a monero to usd exchange also there can also be capital gains implications from using your virtual currency to buy goods which sounds like a pain to keep track of

# 494295
there are a couple of things you could do but it may depend partly on the type of orders your broker has available to you firstly if you are putting your limit order the night before after close of market at the top of the bids you may be risking missing out if bid offer prices increase by the time the market opens the next day on the other hand if bid offer prices fall at the open of the next day you should get your order filled at or below your limit price secondly you could be available at the market open to see if prices are going up or down and then work out the price you want to buy at then and work out the quantity you can buy at that price i personally do n't like this method because you usually get too emotional start chasing the market if prices start rising or start regretting buying at a price and prices fall straight afterwards my preferred method is this third option if your broker provides stop orders you can use these to both get into and out of the market how they work when trying to get into the market is that once you have done your analysis and picked a price that you would want to purchase at you put a stop buy order in for example the price closed at $ 9.90 the previous day and there has been resistance at $ 10.00 so you would put a stop buy trigger if the price goes over $ 10 say $ 10.01 if your stop buy order gets triggered you can have either a buy market order or a limit order above $ 10.01 say $ the market order would go through immediately whilst the limit order would only go through if the price continues going to $ or above the advantage of this is that you do n't get emotional trying to buy your securities whilst sitting in front of the screen you do your analysis and set your prices whilst the market is closed you only buy when the security is rising not falling as your aim is to be in long term you should n't be concerned about buying a little bit higher than the previous days close on the other hand if you try and buy when the price is falling you do n't know when it will stop falling it is better to buy when the price shows signs of rising rather than falling always follow the trend

if your goal is to simply save money on shaving supplies there are easier ways to do so   if you are buying the latest multi blade razor cartridge then yes you are spending a lot of money on razor blades consider switching to an old fashioned double edge safety razor   pick up a nice razor for $ 20 $ 50 i like my hd then buy the blades for cheap   i buy a 2 year supply of double edge blades for less than $ 20 if you really want to turn in your man card and get your facial hair permanently removed then it is really easy to calculate the payback time   just figure out what you are spending in razor blades get a quote for your face off and compare   if you are paying $ 10 a year for blades like i am the payback time is going to be long one more thought remember permanent means permanent   this is comparable to a tattoo except tattoos are easier to reverse    others have noted that the procedure is n't really permanent what i understand from reading i do n't have firsthand experience is that it is temporary in the sense that you will eventually need to start shaving again but permanent in the sense that you will never be able to grow a proper beard again if you wish basically it is the worst of both worlds it wo n't accomplish your goal of not having to shave anymore but will make permanent changes to your face the fact that you will need to shave again even if only occasionally affects your payback time calculation

how do treasury auctions work first the us government will issue a notice indicating how much money it would like to borrow below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise $ 23 billion   the announcement indicates the date of the auction march 8th 2011 in the example as well as deadlines for competitive am and noncompetitive am bids if you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times competitive bid the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security all treasuries are priced in $ 100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner $ 100 when the security matures $ 100 is the face or par value noncompetitive bid the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement these bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction there is a limit of $ 5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction for competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35 of the total offering in order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let 's go back to the example the table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the $ 23 billion being issued the bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a $ 100 par value note bid 1 $ 5 billion max price do n't care bid 2 $ 10 billion max price do n't care bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 notice there is a total of $ 40 billion in bids the auction is only for $ 23 billion this means some bids will go unfilled the ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid to cover ration for our example it is $ a high bid to cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders a low ratio indicates weak demand a ratio under 2.0 is considered weak the bids are filled in the following manner results of our example auction bid 1 $ 5 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 2 $ 10 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 10 billion filled at $ 95 bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 only $ 3 billion filled at $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 not filled bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 not filled once the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction below is the actual results of the auction   there are some additional items that are reported from the auction high rate this is the highest yield or the lowest price that was accepted at the auction for our example this would be $ 95 allotted at high this is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield or lowest accepted price for our example the last $ 3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be $ = 13 price price as determined by the auction median rate half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above low rate the lowest yield or highest price submitted for the competitive bids the announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories there is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as this stands for system open market account this represents treasuries that are held by the federal reserve if the federal reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries for our example auction the fed had no bills maturing at the time if they did then the fed would also get the same price determined at the auction here is an article i wrote with a little more detail on the auction process   i 've included my sources at the end of the article as for treasuries being a safe investment   i 'm not so sure   right now the yield on 10 years is around 2.5   who in their right mind would lend money to the government for 10 years at 2.5   not me

assuming that the etf is tracking an index is there a reason for not looking at using details on the index   typically the exact constituents of an index are proprietary and companies will not publish them publicly without a license   s&p is the in this area and the exact details of the constituents at any one time are not listed anywhere   they do list the methodology and announcements as to index changes but not a full list of actual underlying constituents is there a easy way to automatically ie through an api or something not through just reading a prospectus get information about an etf 's underlying securities i have looked for this information before and based on my own searches in a word no   index providers and providers of apis which provide index information make money off of such services   the easiest way may be to navigate to each provider and download the csv with the full list of holdings if one exists   you can then drop this into your pipeline and write a program to pull the data from the csv file   you could drop the entire csv into excel and use vba to pull the data into a usable format for example on the page for on the blackrock site after clicking the all holdings tab there is a link to download holdings which will provide you with a csv   i am not sure if all providers look at this alternatively you could write the etf company themselves

for a parent deciding on contributing to a 529 plan the first consideration is the plan run by the state government that will trigger a state income tax deduction you do have to at least look at the annual fees for the program before jumping into the state program but for many people the state program offers the best deal because of the state tax deduction unfortunately for you california does not offer a state tax deduction for 529 plan contributions which means that you can pick another states program if the fees are more reasonable or if the investing options are better you can even select a nationwide plan with a state is run by tiaa cref tiaa cref is a large company that runs pension and 403(b funds for many state and local governments many teacher unions use them   they are legitimately authorized by the state of california the investment board sets investment policies and    oversees all activities of the state ’s 529 college    investment plan the program enables californians to save for college    by putting money in tax advantaged investments after tax    contributions allow earnings to grow tax deferred and disbursements    when used for tuition and other qualified expenses are federal and    state tax free the plan is managed by tiaa cref tuition    financing inc. the investment board also oversees the governor ’s    scholarship programs and california memorial scholarship program note before picking a plan from another state make sure that they allow outside contributions

to transfer us$ 30,000 from the usa to europe ask your european banker for the swift transfer instructions   typically in the usa the sending bank needs a swift code and an account number the name and address of the recipient and the amount to transfer   a change of currency can be made as part of the transfer    the typical fee to do this is under us$ 100 and the time under 2 days   but you should ask or have the sender ask the bank in the usa about the fees   in addition to the fee the bank may try to make a profit on the change of currency   this might be 1 2     if you were going to do this many times one way to go about it is to open an account at interactive brokers which does business in various countries   they have a foreign exchange facility whereby you can deposit various currencies into your account and they stay in that currency   you can then trade the currencies at market rates when you wish   they are also a stock broker and you can also trade on the various exchanges in different countries   i would say though they they mostly want customers already experienced with trading i do not know if they will allow someone other than you to pay money into your account trading companies based in the usa do not like to be in the position of collecting on cheques owed to you that is more the business of banks   large banks in the usa with physical locations charge monthly fees of $ or more that might be waived if you leave money on deposit online banks have significantly lower fees   all us banks are required to follow us anti terrorist and anti crime regulations and will tend to expect a usa address and identity documents to open an account with normal customers    a good international bank in europe can also do many of these same sorts of things for you i 've had an account with they were ok there were no monthly fees but there were fees for transactions   in some countries i understand the post even runs a bank   paypal can be a possibility but fees can be high ~3 for transfers and even higher commissions for currency change   on the other hand it is probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to move amounts of $ 1000 or less provided both people have paypal accounts

the answer is just close your eyes and ignore it in your words i 'm right there with you the amount of detail that i track in my personal finances would be called obscene by some people   but as you look at these features in any accounting application you need to ask the question what does this information represent in the case of your bank and credit card accounts the reconciliation marker represents that you have received documentation from the issuing institution which you have verified against your accounts   marking them off confirms that you have reviewed the information and that you checked for errors    these markers exist on all transactions whichever end of the splits you are looking at   when reviewing the expense side of the transaction it might make less sense to see these reconciliation markers because as you stated nobody receives documentation related to their expenses   however if you itemized your expenses and kept a separate log of certain transactions like a notebook where you track gasoline and/or mileage on your car it might be useful to reconcile your records once a month   checking off individual transactions and verifying a new balance in terms of gas consumed or miles driven would allow you to identify any inconsistencies in your records not everyone would find such an activity useful thus the reconciliation markers are present everywhere but required nowhere

another possibility is that a lot of it is bought using borrowed money especially if much of your own money is in the stock market it may be beneficial to take out a loan to buy something compared to selling other assets to raise the same amount of cash even going by the likely relatively conservative £ 200k year before taxes you are looking at a very nice house going for perhaps around 3 5 years worth of pre tax income let 's say you have good contacts at the bank and can secure a loan for £ 500 k at 3.5 interest not at all unreasonable if you make half that before taxes in a single year and purchase something that can be used as collateral for the money borrowed with a bit of negotiating i would n't be surprised if one could push the interest rate even lower and stock in a publicly traded company can also trivially be used as collateral that 's less than £ 1500/month in interest before any applicable tax effects less than 10 of the before tax income and like @victor wrote i think it 's reasonable to say that especially if the company is publicly traded the ceo makes more than £ 200k year given an income of £ 200k year and assuming 30 taxes on that amount the marginal tax would likely be higher and this includes e.g. interest expense deductions the money left over after taxes and interest payments on a £ 500 k 3.5 debt is still about £ 10k month even with a pretty rapid amortization schedule and even if the actual tax rate is higher that leaves quite a bit of money to be away in savings and other investments

i do n't know much about new zealand but here are just some general thoughts on things to consider the big difference between buying a house and investing in stocks or the like is that it is fairly easy to invest in a diversified array of stocks via a mutual fund but if you buy a house you are investing in a single piece of property so everything depends on what happens with that specific property   this in itself is a reason many people do n't invest in real estate   shares of a given company or mutual fund are fungible if you buy into a mutual fund you know you 're getting the same thing everyone else in the fund is getting   but every piece of real estate is unique so figuring out how much a property is worth is less of an exact science   also buying real estate means you have to maintain it and manage it or pay someone else to do so   it 's a lot more work to accurately assess the income potential of a property and then maintain and manage the property over years than it is to just buy some stocks and hold them    another difficulty is if and when you do decide to sell the property doing so again involves work   with stocks you can pretty much sell them whenever you want although you may take a loss   with a house you have to find someone willing to buy it which can take time so a big factor to consider is the amount of effort you 're prepared to put into your investment   you mention that your parents could manage the property for you but presumably you will still have to pay for maintenance and do some managing work yourself at least discussing things with them and making decisions   also if you own the property for a long time your parents will eventually become too old to take care of it at which point you 'll have to rethink the management aspect so that 's sort of the psychological side of things   as for the financial you do n't mention selling the house at any point   if you never sell it the only gain you get from it is the rent it brings in   so the main factor to consider when deciding whether to buy it as a rental is how much you can rent it for   this is going to be largely determined by where it is located so from the perspective of making an investment the big question which you do n't address in the info you provided is how much can you rent this house for and how much will you be able to rent it for in the future   there is no way to know this for sure and the only way to get even a rough sense of it is to talk with someone who knows the local real estate market well e.g. a broker appraiser or landlord   if the property is in an up and coming area i.e. more people are going to move there in the future rents could skyrocket if it 's in a rents could remain stagnant indefinitely basically if you 're going to buy a piece of real estate as a long term investment you need to know a lot about that property in order to make any kind of comparison with another investment vehicle like a mutual fund   if you already live in the area you may know some things already like how much you might be able to rent it for   even so though you should try to get some advice from trustworthy people who know the local real estate situation

here 's an excerpt from visa 's card acceptance guidelines for visa merchants pdf   the merchant name is the single most important factor in cardholder    recognition of transactions therefore it is critical that the    merchant name while reflecting the merchant ’s doing business as    dba name also be clearly identifiable to the cardholder this can    minimize copy requests resulting from merchant    merchant applications typically list the merchant name as the merchant    dba this may differ from the legal name which can represent the    corporate owner or parent company and may differ from the owner ’s    name which for sole proprietorships may reflect the business owner i think that the key statement above is therefore it is critical that the merchant name be clearly identifiable to the cardholder since this merchant was not clearly identifiable to the cardholder they are in breach of a critical point in these guidelines this is from visa but i would assume that all other major credit cards would have similar guidelines for their merchants however keep in mind that these are guidelines and not necessarily rules

this does n't seem smart but people also seem unable or unwilling to do the smart thing vs the thing they want to do   in other news the average car price is over $ 34,000 which is 63 of median household income   compare that with 1985 when the average cost of a new car was 38 of median income   so yeah it 's not surprising that there 's a desire to stretch that out a bit   but cars last longer too   so there 's that

in the case of an initial public offering the brokers underwriting the share issue will look at the current earnings being generated by the company and compare these to those of other competitor companies already listed in the stock market   for example if a new telephone company is undertaking an initial public offering then the share price of those telephone companies which are already traded on the stock market will serve as a reference for how much investors will be willing to pay for the new company 's shares   if investors are willing to pay 15 times earnings for telecom shares then this will be the benchmark used in determining the new share price in addition comparative growth prospects will be taken into account   finally the underwriter will want to see a successful sale so they will tend to slightly under price the new shares in order to make them attractive none of this is an exact science and we often see shares trading at a large premium to the initial offer price during the first few days of trading   more often that not prices then settle down to something closer to the offer price   the initial price spike is usually the result of high demand for the shares by investors who believe that past examples of a price spike will repeat with this initial public offering   there will also usually be high demand for the new shares from funds that specialise in shares of the type being issued in the case of a rights issue where an existing publicly traded company wishes to raise capital by issuing new shares the company will price the new shares at a significant discount to the current market price   the new shares will be initially offered to existing shares holders and the discounted price is intended to encourage the existing shareholders to exercise their rights since the new shares may have the effect of diluting the value of their shares   any shares which are not purchased by existing share holder will then be offered for sale in the market

october 18 2017 by john goldman sachs making too little money is not the worst of the world ’s problems but inside the investment bank ’s new york headquarters it feels like an insult   goldman is not suffering a financial crisis as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of wall street could collapse it faces something deeper an identity crisis   it used to be the role model for many rival banks even while for its single minded focus on investment banking and trading but as tuesday ’s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed banking has changed instead of lenders such as jpmorgan chase wanting to become as glamorous as goldman it needs to be more like them   this is a telling moment albeit less dramatic than 2008 investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades spurred by globalisation and financial goldman ’s revenues rose from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007 and boomed in 2009 it could do no wrong financially although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers   but guess what regulation works governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives the securities business in which goldman specialised more expensive and less profitable the rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of   no one really planned the second aspect of the bank ’s difficulty the huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has volatility and made markets more predictable hedge funds themselves under pressure no longer need to reward goldman and others for taking on financial risk   goldman ’s bond and commodities trading division from which emerged a of leaders including lloyd blankfein its chairman and chief executive tells its own story it used to occupy two floors of the new york office but has shrunk to one as wall street ’s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009 more prices are calculated by computers than humans   when you rely heavily on one engine and that engine you are in trouble the bank ’s financial advisory and capital raising division is performing well and it has an investment management arm but it lacks a consumer powerhouse like morgan stanley ’s wealth management operation or the lending and credit card activities that drive banks such as jpmorgan   the truth for goldman is that us retail banking has become not only more reliable than investment banking but more profitable jpmorgan ’s balance sheet is three times the size of goldman ’s and its retail banking arm made a 19 per cent return on equity in the third quarter compared with goldman ’s 11 per cent   the best historical comparison for goldman ’s predicament is ironically the jpmorgan of the 1990s jpmorgan was a blue chip corporate bank but found that this business was no longer profitable enough as lending margins fell it launched an effort to return to investment banking having been separated from morgan stanley in by the glass steagall act   jpmorgan had a good stab at it compensating for the fact that goldman and others dominated wall street ’s bulge bracket by credit derivatives which later turned out badly but it could not make enough progress alone and settled for being bought by chase manhattan in 2000   both banks have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking the new york times noted in its account of the merger years and one financial crisis later jpmorgan has reversed this order of profitability   so goldman is now trying to do the opposite of the old jpmorgan by adding banking to investment banking jpmorgan ’s former dilemma has not gone away lending to blue chip companies is not much of a a more tempting target is the high margins that banks make on credit cards   hence marcus goldman ’s online lender named after its founder marcus goldman which offers loans to prime us consumers as an alternative to credit card debt marcus which will launch next year in the uk accounts for $ of the $ in new lending and financing planned by goldman in the next three years as it diversifies   but it is no simpler for goldman to break into main street than it was for the old jpmorgan to break back into wall street $ on a balance sheet of $ is an interesting financial experiment not a revolution it would need to inflict on consumer banking with technology what amazon did to the retail industry to rival fully jpmorgan and bank of america   we ’re a bank and we ’re committed to being a bank says one partner firmly but selling personal loans and mortgages which could be marcus ’s next target is not a job designed for masters of the universe this is goldman ’s identity crisis regulation and economics are rendering it ordinary

believe it or not this is done as a service to you the reason for this has to do with a fundamental difference between a credit card account and a checking account   with a credit card account there is no money in the account every charge is borrowed money when you get to your credit limit your credit transactions will start getting declined but if the bank does for some reason let one get approved it 's not a big deal for anyone it just means that you owe a little more than your credit limit note that almost every credit card transaction today is an electronic transaction   a checking account however has real money in it when it is gone it is gone when a balance inquiry is done the bank has no way of knowing how many checks you 've written that have not been cashed yet it is a customer 's responsibility to know exactly how much money is available to spend   if you write more checks than you have money for in your account technically you have committed a crime unfortunately there are too many people now that are not taking the responsibility of calculating their own checking account balance seriously and bad checks are written all the time when a bank allows these transactions to be paid even though you do n't have enough money in your account they are preventing a crime from being committed by you the fee is a finance charge for loaning you the money but it is also there to encourage you not to spend more than you have   even if you use a debit card it is still tied to a checking account and the bank does n't know if you have written enough checks to overdraw your account or not it is still your responsibility to keep track of your own available balance   every time this happens to you thank the bank as you pay this fee and then commit to keeping your own running balance and always knowing how much you have left in your account

stock market indexes are generally based on market capitalization which is not the same as gdp   gdp includes the value of all goods and services produced in a country this includes a large amount of small scale production which may not be reflected in stock market   thus the ratio between countries may not be the same as the ratio of their total market capitalization   for instance us gdp is approximately 3.8 times as much as japan 's see here but us total market cap is about 5.5 as much as japan 's see here the discrepancy can be even more severe when comparing developed economies like the us to developing or less developed economies in which there is less participation in large scale financial systems like stock markets   for instance us gdp is roughly 10 times that of brazil but us total market cap is roughly 36 times that of brazil   switzerland has a total market cap nearly double that of brazil despite its total gdp being less than half of brazil 's   since the all world index includes all investable economies it will include many economies whose share of market cap is disproportionately lower than their share of gdp in addition according to the fact sheet you linked to that index tracks only and mid cap stocks   this will further skew the weighting to developed economies and to the us in particular since the us has a disproportionate share of the largest companies obviously one would need to take a more detailed look at all the weights to determine if these factors account precisely for the level of discrepancy you see in this particular index   but hopefully that explanation gives an idea of why the us might be weighted more heavily in a stock index than it is in raw gdp

some of the information on the form would have been useful to complete the income tax paperwork the next spring it would have had numbers for taxes and interest that were addressed at the settlement it is possible it is mixed in with the next years tax information if i needed a form from 15 years ago i would n't ask the real estate agent i would ask the settlement company they might have a copy of the paperwork they might have to retrieve it from an archive so it could take time and they could charge a fee the local government probably does n't have a copy of the but they do have paperwork documenting the sale price when the transaction took place i know that the jurisdictions in my area have on line the tax appraisal information going back a number of years they also list all the purchases because of the change in ownership and many also list any name changes   you probably do n't want a screen capture of the transactions page but the tax office might have what you need this is the same information that the title search company was retrieving for their report question is there going to be capital gains for a single person there is no gains unless the increase in price is $ 250,000 for a couple it is $ 500,000 i am ignoring any time requirements because you mentioned the purchase was 15 years ago i am also assuming that it was never a rental property because that would require a lot more paperwork

square use ssn to verify identity and they only ask for the last 4 digits for that purpose if she entered the full ssn then she entered it into the tax i d field which was a wrong thing to do it is also worth mentioning that since you mentioned a business partner that should have taken care of taxes that you should have a tax adviser whose job would be to take care of taxes and ensure that your interests are well represented i would suggest not to try interacting with the irs on your own hire a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state to do that that tax adviser will be able to fix the problem there are different ways of doing it depending on the circumstances and also verify that the business taxes were properly taken care of when dealing with business partners assume that what they 've supposedly did was not done until you see it with your own eyes saying that supposedly her business partner took care of all tax issues means in this case that you 've been caught with unreported income that you tried to conceal it is your your sister 's responsibility to prove otherwise it is a very weak defense when the irs comes knocking on the door for their money

what i think warren means is that people like him are really good at making money and setting things up to continue being rich in warren 's case he 's very good at evaluating businesses and if they would be good investments in the micro this is n't really a problem instead the problem is on the macro level when enough potential market participants i.e. people businesses are n't enabled to participate in the economy in the same way this feeds into a growing wealth inequality the people who have the resources to continue playing the game can also continue with more chances it 's a principle situation no opportunity to play little to improve and a continually disadvantaged population add time into the soup rich get richer the poor poorer the gap widens more add inflationary mechanics and the fact that being poor is more expensive add debt and an inability to purchase for long term solutions you get a situation where 99 of the money is cycling around in the top 1 of players   the other 99 of potential market participants are poorly utilized up to the point where their wealth is something they have trouble spending for things like healthcare   the idea of poorly utilized market participants is key a growing economy wants more bandwidth it wants more agents or market participants contributing to the flow get rich enough and you 'll find you ca n't spend more than the interest on investments on the contrary if you do n't have very much money it 's easy as hell to spend it quickly it 's straightforward to say that if more of the global population were n't in debt if they were n't in a state where they ca n't participate in economic growth then maybe the economic growth of human society would n't be so bottle

this does not seem to me to be a very good indication regarding the    risk of the person not paying their balances off if you do not have a source of income then how are you going to repay your debt   not to mention there is for creditors to garnish wages   that is not possible if you have no income   the risk assessment is about the ability of the creditor to recover any moneys loaned and costs and still make a profit for example students have their parents pay them some pocket money to    cover for expenses or a person might be working on    consulting gigs that do not have a fixed monthly or yearly component most credit card companies that are willing to issue to college students will allow you to include money from your parents in your income   credit card companies are looking for customers that will carry a balance and incur fees but be able to pay them   these companies do not make money off of fees and interest that they do not collect   as such work increases risk is it possible for people to get approved for unsecured credit cards    if they do n't hold or have not held for some time a job at the time    of application i was able to while i was in college   though i did have a part time job   if you can show that you have the ability to pay you can usually get a credit card if you do not have bad credit   it will probably be high interest and have alot of fees some of them you will have to pay upfront   but what you probably mean to ask is is it possible to get a no cost unsecured credit card with out a reliable source of income   the answer to that is probably not   even the ones that look like they are free probably have hidden fees

generally if you are using fifo first in first out accounting you will need to match the transactions based on the number of shares in your example at the beginning of day 6 you had two lots of shares 100 50 and 10 52   on that day you sold 50 shares and using fifo you sold 50 shares of the first lot   this leaves you with 50 50 and 10 52 and a taxable capital gain on the 50 shares you sold note that commissions incurred buying the shares increase your basis and commissions incurred selling the shares decrease your proceeds   so if you spent $ 10 per trade your basis on the 100 50 lot was $ and the proceeds on your 50 60 sale were $   in this example you sold half of the lot so your basis for the sale was half of $ or $ so your capital gain is $ = $ the sales you describe are also wash sales in that you sold stock and bought back an equivalent stock within 30 days   generally this is only relevant if one of the sales was at a loss but you will need to account for this in your code   you can look up the definition of wash sale it starts to get complex if you are writing code to handle this in any generic situation you will also have to handle stock splits spin offs mergers etc which change the number of shares you own and their cost basis   i have implemented this myself and i have written about 25 30 custom routines one for each kind of transaction that i 've encountered   the structure of these deals is limited only by the imagination of investment bankers so i think it is impossible to write a single generic algorithm that handles them all instead i have a framework that i update each quarter as new transactions occur

if your debit card atm card is stolen or lost someone else might be able to withdraw money from the checking account that it is tied to or buy things with the card and have the money taken out of the checking account to pay the merchant subject to daily withdrawal limits imposed by your bank a considerable amount of money could be lost in this way at least in the us   debit or atm cards although they are often branded mastercard or visa do not provide the same level of protection as credit cards for which the liability is limited to $ 50 until the card is reported as lost or stolen and $ 0 thereafter   note also that the money in your savings account is safe unless you have chosen an automatic overdraft protection feature that automatically transfers money from your savings account into the checking account to cover overdrafts so that is another reason to keep most of your money in the savings account and only enough for immediately foreseeable needs in the checking account and to think carefully before accepting automatic overdraft protection offers these days with mobile banking available via smartphones and the like transferring money yourself from savings to checking account as needed might be a preferred way of doing things on the go until the smartphone is stolen

treat each position or partial position as a separate lot each time you open a position a new lot of shares is created if you sell the whole position then the lot is closed done but if you sell a partial quantity you need to create a new lot split the original lot into two the quantities in each are the amount sold and the amount remaining if you were to then buy a few more shares create a third lot if you then sell the entire position you 'll be closing out all the remaining lots this allows you to track each buy sell pairing for each lot simply calculate return based on cost and proceeds you ca n't derive an annualized number for all the lots as a group because there 's no common timeframe that they share if you wish to calculate your return over time on the whole series of trades consider using it treats these positions plus the cash they represent as a whole portfolio see my post in this thread how can i calculate a running return using xirr in a spreadsheet

convenience and of course money in case of an event you 'll have to spend the full worth of money to fix replace while if you 're insured you get the insurance to pay for it it is up to you to decide if the money saved on the lower premiums worth the risk of paying much more in case of an event of course the cheaper the car the more it makes sense not to pay the premiums many people do that regarding the bargaining power i actually think that you would pay less if it is not going through insurance than the bill the insurance pays i fixed a nasty dent for like $ 300   at one shop while at the other they said it 's $ 1200 but what do you care your insurance will cover it i had $ 500 deductible so in the end it was cheaper for me to pay $ 300 without the insurance at all

so i see that you replied again despite i am done with you thanks we will resolve this debate one day   gt when you say something is maybe it is factual but when i say something is maybe it 's fiction i had assumed something else   you really try very hard to not understand simple things and it seems that you succeed in that   again my maybe is about how trump will reduce drug prices as he said and says he would your maybe"(s are about how trump does not want and will not reduce drug prices despite him saying he would so you have a maybe facts that trump will not reduce drug prices while i have a maybe on how he would do it    any additional questions objections or misunderstanding on your side in regards to this subject    gt i did give you a possibility which is a maybe so that means i am wrong and global warming is no risk at all yes what you say is starting to make sense   if there are clear proofs that global warming very slight rise in temperature is or will cause instability or expenses then i ca n't argue back   so all you can come up with are possibilities and more maybe"(s to tell us about and expenses and you think this will convince anyone except members of the church of    for god sake i even asks for specifics and you did not and can not name any will we have wars will we have diseases and will we have hunger    of course not wars will not start because it 's slightly more hot disease will not spread because it 's a bit more hot hunger will not occur because warmer weather and more rain is just even more food   what on earth are you talking about what are the terrible things that will happen if it 's a bit hotter    are you going to be al gore again who in his an inconvenient truth truth movie in 2006 predicted there will be no more and other catastrophes well an inconvenient truth the will come out and sorry we have and nothing from the first movie became true nothing i loved how he said in the first movie stronger storms will kill and destroy the last few years had less storms than ever   gt;&gt how could a person like you who seek truth vote for democrats   gt it can only be because i have serious mental health problems there is no other explanation   yes i believe you   blind belief in a religion far left liberalism and/or make any person blind to truth logic facts and even moderate views   gt;&gt you are trying to convince me that russia knew he trump would win the gop debate against 13 others and colluded with him between july until the elections november to make him win   gt that is totally it i am so impressed that even though i never mentioned russia at all you were able to see through my facade an my actual goal in this discussion   yes you did not mention russians but you see i easily figure out people like you   you actually also believe that russians are responsible for trump in addition to all the terrible things you believe about trump    but the dnc and hillary oh no they are fine despite hillary selling and getting for selling 20 of usa uranium to russia making $ 500,000 for a speech to russian bankers etc   so i will not stop and demand if you can to tell me about one action by trump you oppose to   also tell me why i it would be better if voted hillary dnc what would they do better for us that trump does not do

it would be difficult but it 's a statistical task and you 'd need to refer to a competent statistician to really get a sense of what sort of certainty could be derived from the available data   i believe that you 'd start by looking over your state by state data on a granular level to try to find if there was any persistent correlation between amazon 's market penetration in a particular area and employment data from the retail industry   with regards to ma amp pa 's complaint you 're sort of wrong and sort of right   obviously they have no direct knowledge that online retail was responsible for the decline in sales that they saw   in terms of sustainability and mismanagement however they can show you their books   if the business had been established from some time it would be easy to see whether it had indeed been a sustainable business model in prior years   sustainability and mismanagement however are when it comes to reasoning about causes   in measuring the effect of amazon 's entry into the market on local businesses we can just as easily use a model that assumes a perfect market that inefficiencies on the part of amp would lead them to be displaced by amp and that on average amp manage their business sufficiently well to extract an optimal return on effort     if circumstances are such that the role of vendor is not fungible and the supply of mas and pas does not respond to the demand for family stores then i do n't actually know how to do the math but on the other hand i do recognize a smoking gun

there are a few factors at work here supply and demand being the main one the office for national statistics has some good information supply has historically struggled to compete with demand in the uk and this situation has been since the 1980s when margaret thatcher was prime minister   she set up a variety of schemes to encourage people to own their own home such as tax relief and since then home ownership in the uk has increased dramatically the then conservative government also set up the right to buy scheme in 1980 that allowed council tenants to purchase their council houses at a discounted rate   the effect of this was to increase the number of home owners whilst reducing the amount of housing available for councils to rent to new tenants   anecdotal evidence i ca n't find a documented source to back this up suggests that councils did not build sufficient new homes to replace those purchased by their ex tenants the population of the uk has also increased by around 10 million since 1980 around 20 and this has pushed up demand for housing   house building in the uk has not kept pace with these factors that has led to a shortage of supply that has pushed up prices there 's another factor at play here as well   if you go back to the 1970s around 53 of women would go out to work but in 2013 this figure increased to 67 as it became more common for households to have double incomes   this extra supply of cash also pushed up house prices your question regards a debt based monetary system is not entirely clear but there are limitations put onto how much money people can borrow that are potentially limiting how much house prices can rise by   today most lenders are more conservative in how much they will lend but this was n't the case in the mid 2000s when house prices rose very quickly    lenders are more cautious today after the crash of the late 2000s but things are to relax again and they are starting to lend more which could in turn lead to further house price rises in line with what was seen in the 2000s recessions have with house prices falling back or at least being stable   in the 1980s house prices from 1980 to 1988 but then fell back a little as the recession hit before starting to rise again in 1997   this rise was sustained until 2008 during which time prices again   based on this you could assume prices will again as we come out of the recession as long as this is sustained for 8 years or so however as the potential for more households to become double income is reduced high female employment already and wages are unlikely to raise that quickly this may not be realistic unless the mortgage lenders become extremely lax to the point of reckless to answer your other question about the affordability of housing this will be based on the level of wages in the uk and how strict or lax the lenders are also taking into effect the availability of housing for purchase   if wages rise house prices will rise if lenders are willing to lend more money house prices will rise and if demand continues to supply prices will rise none of the major uk political parties are likely to solve the problems of population growth and not enough houses being built so it is likely prices will rise but you could argue that they are not far off a peak based on current wages and lenders attitudes   if the uk economy continues to recover from the recession it is possible they will fuel another housing boom by lending ever increasing salary multiples as happened in the 2000s unless there is government intervention ie regulation of the lenders

unless you need extremely large sums of money i suggest you use an atm or look for a credit card that has no foreign transaction fees rare afaik it 's not possible for a retail buyer to purchase currency at the current exchange rate quoted online   you are always going to be paying some spread above that and the atm gets you the closest you could also try to use a bank that has branches in your country and japan like hsbc and do your banking there   then you likely would n't have to pay as much in fees and possibly could draw on your account in japan

if and only if there is a zero interest installment plan available technically the only risk is that there will likely be a hard inquiry on your credit report which may or may not also have a corresponding debt obligation attached to it personally i recently signed up for one such plan with google and i had a hard inquiry but no debt added to my report the other risks are that 1 your monthly payment goes up so if you are living on a tight budget the added payment might make it harder to meet your next bill and 2 you could miss a payment which generally triggers interest to accrue retroactively at a high rate and in some cases could be grounds for immediate repayment the pro reward of these plans is that you have to spend less of your capital upfront which you may be able to use for other purposes presumably with a higher net present value than purchasing the item you 're considering outright a larger example would be purchasing a new car you want to buy a $ 50k car and you have the cash on hand to pay in full but you are being offered 0 interest for 36 months you may be more inclined to take a loan at 0 with 0 down payment and invest your money in another vehicle no pun intended that offers you a decent rate of return and you will come out ahead in the end of course this example works in a perfect world where you can get such an offer there are no extra fees available you are n't worrying about your debt to income ratio in preparation for a big purchase like a house there is n't a higher insurance premium to consider etc in short 0 financing be it for a phone or a car can be a nice perk for the informed consumer who is not using the financing as a way to purchase outside their financial means but it is offered by companies as a way to make people buy things they normally would not and hopefully capitalize on people missing payments in order to reap the sweet 20%+ interest rates generally seen with these offers   in your specific situation with the phone you should consider if you get a discount on your monthly plan for purchasing outright or if you can get the phone subsidized if you sign a contract and you know you like your provider enough to stay for its duration if the monthly plan rate stays the same and you 're looking at either $ 500 now or $ 500 over 24 months and you do n't mind a hard inquiry there 's not much of compelling reason to pass on the financing and hold on to your $ 500

are you talking about a country besides the us   and you 're talking about a commercial bank right   in the us banks do n't buy gold from consumers   the last time they sort of did in the early 1900s they were trading gold coins for gold certificates and then they later stopped allowing consumers to trade them back   this is known by a well known financial term gotcha suckers if someone were naive enough to deposit a $ 50 gold american eagle today in a bank the depositor will get a credit of $ 50 on their account and later some clever person will ask the teller if they have any strange money lying around and that lucky person will be able to withdraw a $ coin for $ 50 if it lasted for even a second in the teller 's drawer but let 's say you 're going to a place that does indeed still buy gold coins the discount depends on the type of coin and the type of damage   an old collectible coin has a part of its value set by the gold value and part by the collector 's premium   better command better collector 's premiums so a damaged coin as long as it is n't a chunk of the coin missing wo n't be worth less than the melt value   you may not get that much from a dealer but it should be fairly close   if part of the coin is missing then the person buying it should weigh the coin and adjust the price proportionately   it 's likely though that if you have the items in a safe you may have a or of gold but it should still all be there unless someone takes it   gold at about 1850 degrees but it would take half the surface temperature of the sun for it to boil away   if it 's it may need to be again

as a minor you certainly can pay tax the government wants its cut from you just like everyone else however you do get the personal allowance like everyone else so you wo n't have to pay income tax until your net income reaches £ that 's the figure for the tax year from april 2015 to april 2016 it 'll probably change in future years once you 're 16 you will also have to pay national insurance which is basically another tax at a lower threshold the current rates are £ if you are making £ a year or more and also 9 on any income above £ up to £ your net income or profits are the income you receive minus the expenses you have to support that income note that the expenses must be entirely for the business they ca n't be for personal things the most important thing to do immediately is to start keeping accurate records keep a list of the income you receive and also the expenses you pay for hardware etc make sure you keep receipts perhaps just electronic ones for the expenses so you can prove they existed later keep track of that net income as the year goes on and if it starts collecting at the rate you 'd have to pay tax and national insurance then make sure you also put aside enough money to pay for those when the bill comes there 's some good general advice on the government 's website here in short as well as keeping records you should register with the tax office hmrc as a sole trader this should be something that anyone can do whatever their age but it 's worth calling them up as soon as you can to check and find out if there are any other issues they 'll probably want you to send in tax returns containing the details of your income and expenses if you 're making enough money it may be worth paying an accountant to do this for you

bp holdings management on taxes and thier original intents is designed to generate enough revenue to sustain essential public service such as public safety civil infrastructure for communication and transportation and basic health services when you see a government hospital you know your taxes support the upkeep of that institution and when you see soldiers fighting in you can be sure tax went into training them and keeping them fit and equipped to preserve our national security    as essential as tax is to our national existence many do not know the true value of what taxes can do other than what we have mentioned above here are some generally unknown facts about taxes and what you need to do to make full use of their benefits    1 taxes should not favour one group over another   taxes are intended to be neutral and must not cater to any one sector or group of people over another neither should it impose or interfere with individual decision making    what this signifies is that taxes as they were originally conceived had an altruistic purpose meant to benefit people equally without favoring any individual or any societal unit it is a fund to provide services and public amenities for all people alike so whether you earn only so much or make millions you walk or drive over the same road or bridge that taxes helped to build we can not discount the goodwill and welfare taxes have brought to both ancient and modern societies   pay your taxes so you can enjoy them    2 taxes must be predictable    in order for a government to function well it must have some stability in terms of its fiscal health without the necessary funds to run a government chaos would ensue and so taxes must flow into a state ’s coffers at a regular schedule and at a reasonably predictable amount or the oil will run out at a time when the engine of progress badly needs it    now we understand why the state imposes and does not merely request that taxes be paid at a particular time of the year why april for many countries it is the time of the year when people have probably paid off last year ’s debts or recovered from the expenses of the holiday season in the previous year it is also the time when most parents have extra cash because their children are on school vacation unfortunately it is also the time when many people want to spend a vacation so it is either you pay your tax or spend a nice vacation during spring for most people    3 taxes must be simple   assessment and computation of tax and determination should be easily understood by the average taxpayer but this has been forgotten by tax officials in recent years it has not only become more complex in terms of schedule as the tax calendar seems to nowadays it has also become so hard to decipher through the many pages now incorporated in the tax return the best thing to do if you have extra cash is to let an accountant do your tax    4 taxes must not be forced but enforced to encourage voluntary compliance   the key is convenience as much as possible it is the tax duty to encourage voluntary compliance among taxpayers through creative implementation without making people feel they are being harassed or unduly burdened ordinary taxpayers have to go through a lot of stress figuring out forms and lining up to pay their tax perhaps a more convenient way can be implemented using modern technology and the banking system if we can pay bills in malls or online now why can not tax be paid in the same way    5 taxes earmarked for specific purposes must result in direct benefits   certain taxes such as gasoline tax for road maintenance must be dedicated to the particular purpose they were intended based on a direct cost benefit link today much of the corruption in government circles arise from taxes or diverting them from their intended purposes thus losing sight of the original intent of the tax    what can the taxpayer do to prevent these things from happening aside from joining protest rallies or talking to your congress representative you can actually form or join small groups that could create awareness among people through the media or internet this is already being done on facebook and twitter how effective it is may be hard to measure but time will come when a critical mass of concerned people will have a force of a virtual army that can change the tide of events in a society    inevitable as taxes may be enjoying their ultimate benefits can be a much better motivation that spending our time looking for ways to avoid them

i think you need to be very careful here covered calls do n't reduce risk or increase performance overall if they did every investment manager would be using them in a typical portfolio over the long term the gains you give up when your stock goes beyond the strike of your calls will negate the premiums you receive over time psychologically covered calls are appealing because your gains happen over a long period and this is why many people suggest it but if you believe the black scholes model used for pricing options this is what the model predicts over the long term that you wo n't do any better than just holding stock unless you have some edge other traders do n't now you say you want to reduce diversification and raise your risk keeping in mind that there is no free lunch there are several ways to reduce your risk but they all come at a price for simplicity there are three elements to consider risk potential gain and cash these are tradeoffs and you ca n't simultaneously make them all favorable you must trade one or more of them to gain in the others let 's say you wanted to concentrate into a few stocks how could you counteract the additional risk 1 covered calls very popular strategy usually intended for increasing returns you get the bonus of cash along with marginally less risk but you give up a substantial amount of potential return you wo n't have returns if you do this you still face substantial risk 2 collar your stock you sell a covered call while using the cash from the sale to buy puts for protection you give up potential gains you 're neutral on cash but gain significantly on reducing risk   3 use calls as proxy for stock you do n't hold stock but only calls in equivalent delta to the stock you would have held substantially lower risk while still having potential gain your tradeoff is the cash you have to pay for the calls when using this one must be very very careful not to   4 puts as protection for stocks this is basically the same as 3 in tradeoffs you wo n't and you also get dividends but for the most part it 's the same these are the main ways to reduce the risk you gain by concentrating options themselves are far broader but keep in mind that there is no free money all these techniques involve tradeoffs that you have to be aware of

although there are some good points made here as to the cause of inflation mostly related to supply and demand does head in a different direction one which i myself was going to take let me give a different angle however another cause of inflation is the printing of money by the government not simply replacing old money with new but adding to the total money in circulation if the government doubles the amount of currency in circulation for the sake of argument and easy math the value of all money decreases by a factor of 2 that 's inflation and the way g. edward in the creature from island puts it it 's really tantamount to a hidden tax in a nutshell the federal government wants to buy some cool stuff like new tanks or planes or they want to give a bunch of food stamps to poor people or they want to fly their private jets around but they do n't have enough money from taxes so they print money and spend it and buy their stuff because they 've just increased the money in circulation however money loses its value for example your savings has dropped in value by half despite the fact that the same number of dollars is in your savings account this is just a way the government can tax you without taxing you they buy stuff and you now have less money i.e. your retirement is worth less and you do n't even know you just got taxed makes me sick that we let our leaders get away with this

in a similar situation i wrote about how i made $ 4,000 + on a cash back credit card offer the total was actually $ and was from an insane offer from a new credit card my bank advertised 10 cash back on all spending during the first 90 days i wondered if gift card purchases counted and more than store cards i saw that visa gift cards with a $ 500 value sold for a $ 4.95 fee a 1 hit   it would have been foolish to load up and realize that they were somehow excluded so i bought 2 and followed the transaction on line when i saw the 10 credit i went full steam and bought these $ 2000 at a time as that was the limit cvs imposed in the end i stopped at $ 50,000 and the bank killed the online offer about $ 25 k into this but still honored my 90 days yes i had to make payments mid cycle to avoid the card limit $ 20 k but in the end the bit of effort paid off it took a bit over a year and a half to burn through them in hindsight i 'd do it for $ 100 k if the opportunity came up cash in the bank is earning near zero     tl dr make a small purchase and confirm your card gives you the bonus you expect

let me ask you another question if that person stayed at home and made a widget instead would exporting that widget benefit his home country there is no difference economically between the two situations a foreign worker sending home remittances is no different from a local manufacturer exporting their products both are earning export dollars for themselves and their home countries is this a good thing or a bad thing clearly the answer is yes this is a good thing or a bad thing but we can not know which in isolation however in general foreign worker remittances are overwhelmingly beneficial for the host which gets work done that otherwise would not be done and the source which gets export income with reference to your particular question about local inflation a rise in exports causes appreciation in the exchange rate i.e. local currency becomes more expensive with respect to in this case the euro appreciation in the exchange rate actually puts downward pressure on inflation however the absence of our worker from the local economy puts upward pressure on local wages and and hence inflation both of these effects are small and other factors will dominate them

eh it 's what walmart will do the real question is will they do it quietly or make a about it because the last thing anyone wants is walmart heads with its employees in an election year but those crazy bastards running the show in are n't above being when everyone thinks believes they 'll just back down and wait for a time to drop rocks on people 's heads    that 's what the source of entertainment is going to be here how will walmart handle this and will the politicians stick their noses in it too and is this a union organised thing or an informal affiliation of employees that agreed to do this also will it spread    that 's about the sum total of stuff we have to think about since they do n't actually change any unemployment numbers around by firing experienced employees and hiring people they have to train up and deploy again hell they do it so often it probably does n't really cost them any extra either

for various reasons if you can defer tax payment it 's good for you when you can give uncle sam $ x tomorrow why give it today some reasons are you may plan to return back to your country after x years and then you can pay tax at a lower bracket e.g. convert 401k to rollover ira then do roth conversion and pay lower tax bracket paying now versus later is purely based on your anticipated future tax bracket if future bracket is same say 25 today and after say 20 years 25 there is absolutely no difference between today payment or future payment of tax you can mathematically prove the returns are the same for roth ira or versus ira or 401k having a bigger balance in case of 401k compared to can also give you a sense of more security since there are provisions for hardship withdrawal tax may be due

a closed end fund is a collective investment scheme that is closed to new investment once the fund starts operating   a typical open ended fund will allow you to buy more shares of the fund anytime you want and the fund will create those new shares for you and invest your new money to continue growing assets under management   a closed end fund only using the initial capital invested when the fund started operating and no new shares are typically created always exception in the financial community   normally you buy and sell an open end fund from the fund company directly   a closed end fund will usually be bought and sold on the secondary market here is some more information from wikipedia some characteristics that distinguish a closed end fund from an ordinary open end mutual fund are that another distinguishing feature of a closed end fund is the common use of leverage or gearing to enhance returns cefs can raise additional investment capital by issuing auction rate securities preferred shares long term debt and/or reverse repurchase agreements in doing so the fund hopes to earn a higher return with this excess invested capital

i have had pension programs with two companies   the first told you what your benefit would be if you retired at age x with y years of service each year of service got you a percentage of your final years salary there was a different formula for early retirement and there was an offset for social security they were responsible for putting enough money away each year to meet their obligations just before i left they did add a new feature you could get the funds in the account in a lump sum when you left if you left early you got the money in the account if you left at retirement age you got the money that was needed to produce the benefit you were promised which was based on current interest rates the second company had a plan where they published the funding formula you knew with every quarterly statement how much was in your account and what interest it had earned and what benefit they estimated you would receive if you stayed until retirement age this fund felt almost like a defined contribution because the formula was published if most people took the lump sum that was the only part that mattered both pension plans had a different set of formulas based on marriage status and survivor rules the interest rates are important because they are used to determine how much money is needed to produce the promised monthly benefit they are also used to determine how much they need to allocate each year to cover their obligations   if you ca n't make the math work you need to keep contacting hr you need to understand how much should be flowing into the account each month

there are some etf 's on the indian market that invest in broad indexes in other countries here 's an article discussing this   be aware that such investments carry an additional risk you do not have when investing in your local market which is currency risk   if for example you invest in a etf that represents the us s&p500 index and the us dollar weakens relative to the indian rupee you could see the value if your investment in the us market go down even if the index itself is up but not as much as the change in currency values a lot of investment advisors recommend that you have at least 75 of your investments in things which are denominated in your local currency well technically the same currency as your liabilities and no more than 25 invested internationally   in large part the reason for this advice is to reduce your exposure to currency risk

the plumber will apply for and receive a refund of the amount of vat he paid on the purchase amount   that 's the cornerstone of how vat works as opposed to a sales tax   so for example rounded approximate amounts for simplicity now at each point the amount between original cost vat and new vat is refunded   so by the end a total of £ 3 vat is paid on the pipe not £ 6.2 and at each point the business adding value at that stage pays that much   the material company adds £ 1 value the producer adds £ 4 value the supplier adds £ 5 value the plumber adds £ 5 value    each pays some amount of vat on that amount typically 20 unless it 's zero reduced rated   so the pipe supplier pays £ 1 but gets a £ 0.2 refund so truly pays £ 0.8   the plumber pays £ 3 from your payment but gets a £ 2 refund    so at each level somebody paid a bit and then that bit is then refunded to the next person up the ladder with the final person in the chain paying the full amount   the £ 0.2 is refunded to the producer the £ 1 is refunded to the supplier the £ 2 is refunded to the plumber

instead of giving part of their profits back as dividends management puts it back into the company so the company can grow and produce higher profits when these companies do well there is high demand for them as in the long term higher profits equates to a higher share price so if a company invests in itself to grow its profits higher and higher one of the main reasons investors will buy the shares is in the expectation of future capital gains in fact just because a company pays a dividend would you still buy it if the share price kept decreasing year after year lets put it this way company a makes record profits year after year continually keeps beating market expectations its share price keeps going up but it pays no dividend instead reinvests its profits to continually grow the business company b pays a dividend instead of reinvesting to grow the business it has been surprising the market on the downside for a few years now it has had some profit warnings lately and its share price has consistently been dropping for over a year which company would you be interested in buying out of the two i know i would be interested in buying company a and i would definitely stay away from company b. company a may or may not pay dividends in the future but if company b continues on this path it will soon run out of money to pay dividends most market gains are made through capital gains rather than dividends and most people invest in the hope the shares they buy go up in price over time dividends can be one to investors but they are not the only one

exactly what you do with the money depends on various personal choices you 'll have to make for yourself   investing your money in vanguard index funds such as the ones you mentioned is certainly one smart move   however i think you 're quite right to be suspicious of an advisor with a 1 fee   in many cases such advisors are not worth their costs   the thing to remember is that typically with that type of fee structure you always pay the costs even if the advisor turns out to be wrong and your money does n't grow one thing to check is whether the advisor you mentioned is paid only by the fees he charges a fee only financial planner or whether he also makes money via the sales of financial products   some advisors earn money by selling you financial products such as mutual funds which can create a conflict of interest   you can read about fee only financial advisors and choosing a financial advisor on investopedia

this will happen automatically when you open an interest bearing account with a bank    you did n't think that banks just kept all that cash in a vault somewhere did you   that 's not the way modern banking works    today and for a long long time banks will keep only a small fraction of their deposits on hand called the reserve to fund daily withdrawals and other operations   the rest they routinely lend out to other customers which is how they pay for their operations someone has to pay all those tellers branch managers loan officers and pay interest on your deposits as well as a profit for their owners it 's not a charity service   the fees charged for loan origination as well as the difference between the loan interest rate and the deposit rate make up the profit    banks rarely hold their own loans   instead they will sell the loans in portfolios to investors sometimes retaining servicing rights they continue to collect the payments and pass them on and sometimes not the payments are now due to someone else   this allows them to make more loans    banks may sometimes not have enough capital on hand   in this case they can make inter bank loans to meet their short term needs   in some cases they 'll take those loans from a government central bank   in the us this is the fed or the federal reserve bank    in the us back around the late 1920 's and again in the 1980 's some banks experienced a run or a situation where people lost confidence in the bank and wanted to withdraw their money   this caused the bank to have insufficient funds to support the withdrawals so not everyone got their money   people panicked and others wanted to take their money out which caused the situation to snowball   this is how many banks failed   in the 80s it was savings and loans that failed still a kind of bank   today we have the fdic federal deposit insurance corporation to protect depositors   in the crashes in the early 2000 's many banks closed up one night and opened the next in a and then were literally doing business as a new bank without depositors necessarily even knowing   this protected the consumers   the bank as a company and its owners were not protected

has a great answer about dividends generally but to answer your question specifically about yield traps here are a few things that i look for as with everything if it looks too good to be true it probably is   a 17 yield is pretty out of this world even for a reit   and i would n't bet on it holding up   compare a company 's yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different standards for what is considered a high or low yield dividends have to come from somewhere and that somewhere is cash flow   look at the company 's financial statements   do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend   have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation   how are earnings holding up   debt levels cash on hand sudden moves in stock price   a sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise   sometimes this indicates a bargain but if the drop is due to a real worry about the company 's financial health see 2 it 's probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming what does their dividend history look like   do they have a consistent track record of paying out good dividends for years and years   companies with a track record of paying dividends consistently and/or increasing their dividend regularly are likely to continue to do so

mlp stands for master limited partnership investors who buy into one are limited partners rather than shareholders and have their taxable income reported on rather than 1099s mlps are engaged in businesses e.g. real estate natural resources that generate a lot of cash that does n't need to be reinvested or put back into the company because of this feature the irs will exempt it from corporate tax if it pays out at least 95 of its income in the form of dividends the advantage is that you avoid the double taxation common to most corporations and get a higher yield as a result   the disadvantage is that the company ca n't retain earnings for growth and needs to borrow money if it wants to grow in this regard an mlp is much like a utility except that a utility has to pay corporate taxes and is otherwise heavily regulated by the federal and/or state governments you can look upon an mlp as an unregulated utility this means that mlps are most suitable for utility type investors who are more interested in current income than capital gains because they are unregulated they are riskier than utilities

there are moral distinctions that can be drawn between gambling and investing in stocks first and i think most important in gambling you are trying to get money for nothing you put $ 100 down on the roulette wheel and you hope to get $ 200 back in investing you are not trying to get something for nothing you are buying a piece of a hopefully profit making company you are giving this company the use of your money and in exchange you get a share of the profits that is you are quite definitely giving something the use of your money for a period of time you invest $ 100 of your money and you hope to see that grow by maybe $ 5 or $ 10 a year typically you may get a sudden windfall of course you may buy a stock for $ 100 today and tomorrow it jumps to $ 200 but that 's not the normal expectation second gambling is a zero sum game if i gamble and win $ 100 then someone else had to lose $ 100 investing is not a zero sum game if i buy $ 100 worth of stock in a company and that grows to $ 200 i have in a sense won $ 100 but no one has lost $ 100 to give me that money the money is the result of the profit that the company made by selling a valuable product or service to customers when i go to the grocery store and buy a dozen eggs for $ 2 some percentage of that goes to the stockholders in the grocery store say 5 cents so did i lose 5 cents by buying those eggs no to me a dozen eggs are worth at least $ 2 or i would n't have bought them i got exactly what i paid for i did n't lose anything carrying that thought further investing in the stock market puts money into businesses it enables businesses to get started and to grow and expand assuming these are legitimate businesses they then provide useful products and services to customers gambling does not provide useful products and services to anyone except to the extent that people enjoy the process of gambling in which case you could say that it is equivalent to playing a video game or watching a movie third and these are all really related the whole goal of gambling is to take something from another person while giving him nothing in return again if i buy a dozen eggs i give the store my $ 2 or whatever amount and i get a dozen eggs in exchange i got something of value and the store got something of value we both walk away happy but in gambling my goal is that i will take your money and give you nothing in return it is certainly true that buying stocks involves risk and we sometimes use the word gamble to describe any risk but if it is a sin to take a risk then almost everything you do in life is a sin when you cross the street there is a risk that you will be hit by a car you did n't see when you drink a glass of water there is the risk that it is contaminated and will poison you when you get married there is a risk that your spouse will divorce you and break your heart etc we are all we all sin every day but we do n't sin quite that much btw i do n't think that gambling is a sin nothing in the bible says that gambling is a sin but i can comprehend the argument for it i think gambling is foolish and i do n't do it my daughter works for a casino and she has often said how seeing people lose money in the casino regularly reminds her why it is stupid to gamble like she once commented on people who stand between two slot machines feed them both coins and then pull the levers down at the same time so that she said they can lose their money twice as fast

taxing wealth is an easy idea but i do n't think it can ever work wealth is too easily hidden transformed or taxing actual cash flows works because two parties have to declare it taxing wealth would cause huge conflicts as to how wealth is measured that said i 'm a big fan of the idea that the estate tax should be massively increased and would only involve a single evaluation per taxpayer rather than every year taxing more measurable forms of wealth like stocks would cause wealth to flow from stocks into property which would then be valued as low as possible causing a general market crash and another great depression   i 'm most curious about a tax scheme which is where taxes are levied on un improved property per wikipedia based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves but that the economic value derived from land including natural resources should belong equally to all members of society    so most taxes in society would be generated by those who owned property as a speculation and did n't invest in it incentives would be to make all property held privately be as economically productive as possible

to quote adam smith everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it in this case that means the value of a stock is equal to the price that someone will pay for it if you buy shares in a company the number of people who want shares in that company has just gone up by 1 if you buy shares in companies profiting from the dapl you are increasing demand for those shares you are actually making those shares more valuable not less if you bought all those shares then you could simply shut the pipeline down but that means you 'd be spending billions of dollars to do so and that money would go to the people who own the company now the concept of shareholder activism that you refer to is actually more that an individual who owns a substantial number of shares usually in the 10 ballpark will become on the direction of the company and attempt to elect board members who will take action to suit their liking this is done to increase the profits of the company so that the shareholder can make more money off of their investment it is very expensive and not generally done for reasons of ethics unless those ethics align with a view to long term profit in this case you 'd need at least $ to buy enough of a stake in the dapl to make a difference what you may instead want to consider is ethical investing this refers to the concept that you should only put your investments in companies which act ethically for example you could buy shares in a solar company if you felt that was an ethical industry in this way you drive up demand for those types of companies and reward the business owners who act in that fashion

the easiest and least expensive way of doing this similar to the answer from randy is to write a check and deposit it into the canadian institution since this transfer is between accounts you own the easiest thing to do is to do a deposit by mail contact your current institution on where you would need to mail your deposit to you can then write yourself a check on the us bank and mail it to the canadian bank be sure to write for deposit only along with your account number and branch number for canada on the back this is the slowest but cheapest method an alternative option is to use wire transfers but they can be very costly you 'll usually incur a fee when sending and when receiving i only recommend them when you need the money in the account fast they are usually settled within an hour

it is a legitimate practice the dealers do get the loan money up front because they 're not holding the loan themselves they promptly sell it to someone else or more commonly just act as salesmen for a lending institution and take their profit as commission or origination fees the combined deal is often not a good choice for the consumer though remember that the dealer 's goal is to close a sale with maximum profit if they 're offering to drop the price $ 2k they either did n't expect to actually get that price in the first place or expect at least $ 2k of profit from the loan or some combination of these standard advice is to negotiate price loan and trade in separately first get the dealer 's best price on the car compare it to other dealer and other cars and walk away if you do n't like their offer repeat for the loan checking the dealer 's offer against banks credit unions available to you if you have an older car to unload get quotes for it and consider whether you might do better selling it yourself = = = = = = = = = standard unsolicited plug for reports car facts service if you 're buying a new car which is n't usually the best option late model used is generally a better value for a small fee they can tell you what the dealer 's real cost of a car is after all the hidden incentives and rebates that lets you negotiate directly on how much profit they need on this sale and focuses their attention on the fact that the time they spend haggling with you is time they could be using to sell the next one simply walking into the dealer with this printout in your hand cuts out a lot of nonsense the one time i bought new i basically walked in and said it 's the end of the model year i 'll give you $ 500 profit to take one of those off your hands before the new ones come in if you 've got one configured the way i want it closed the deal on the spot the only concession i had to make was on color   it does n't always work some salesmen are idiots in that case you walk away and try another dealer i am not affiliated in any way with cu or the automotive or lending industries except as customer and yes this touch keyboard is typo prone

as pointed out they usually mean libor or the ffr or for other countries the equivalent risk free rate of interest i will just like to add on to what everyone has said here and will like to explain how various interest rates you mentioned work out when the risk free rate moves for let 's denote the risk free rate by rf the savings account interest rate as rs a mortgage interest rate as and a term deposit rate with the bank as savings account interest rate when a central bank the overnight lending rate or the prime rate repo rate etc in some countries banks are not obliged to increase the savings account interest rate usually a downward revision will force them to lower it because they net they will be paying out = rf rs on the other hand if rf goes up and if one of the banks increases the rs then other banks may be forced to do so too under competitive pressure in some countries the central bank has the authority to revise rs without the overnight lending rate term deposits with the bank or certificates of deposit usually movements in these rates are more in sync with rf than rs is the chief difference is that savings account offer more liquidity than term deposits and hence banks can offer lower rates and still get deposits under them the higher interest rate offered by the term deposit as a liquidity risk premium generally interest rates paid by instruments of similar risk profile that offer similar liquidity will move in parallel otherwise there can be arbitrage sometimes these rates can move to anticipate a future change in rf mortgage loan rates or other interests that you pay to the bank if the risk free rate goes up banks will increase these rates to keep the net interest they earn over risk free (= = rf the same if rf drops and if banks are not obliged to decrease loan rates then they will only do so if one of the banks does it first wherever i have said they will do so when one of the banks does it first i am not referring to a but merely to the competitive market theory under such a theory the first one to cut down the profit margin usually has a strong business incentive to do so e.g. gain market share or eliminate competition by lowering profit margins etc others are forced to follow the trend

if you go to a grocery store and purchase retail gift cards along with other products and you pay with a credit card your credit card company generally does not know what you spent the money on they do n't get an itemized receipt if this is the case with your rewards card then yes you would get the cashback reward on the gift cards because all the credit card company knows is that you spent $ 100 at the grocery store they do n't know or care really that $ 50 of it was for an olive garden gift card this of course should be fairly easy to test   buy the gift card wait for your statement and see if they included the purchase when calculating your rewards note i do n't have an american express card but from some quick googling i see that it is possible that american express does actually receive itemized billing details on your purchases from some merchants   if your grocery store is sending this data to amex it is possible that the gift cards could be excluded from rewards   but again i suggest you just test it out and see

i 'd contact paypal to request clarification   in the meantime most banks will credit outgoing transfers immediately but process later and only debit incoming after it passes through a processing team so while the money will go out right away it may take a few days for your bank to actually process the withdrawal and the subsequent reversal from paypal in reality paypal does n't usually recieve the money immediately either but they extend you credit to speed up things either way it does n't hurt to contact paypal to make sure they have reverted the amount to your bank and if they confirm such you can also reach out to your bank and ask where the money is stuck usually delays like this will happen in the interface between two unrelated financial institutions

an actual discussion question i just wanna push fluff to get traffic on my blog the millenials did it   in all seriousness the housing market is all about supply and demand namely there are nt many housing being built across the us right now so that s driving prices up cheap loans also helped diminish the supply because those who could bought up a lot of rental properties since 08 so these things have caused home prices to steadily climb especially in desirable places to live such as large college towns boston san fran etc   but keeping demand in check are a few too rates are now going up and few millenials can afford starter homes due to student debt and relatively lower income in their late 20s than their parents plus they re having less kids at the moment so that s all pushing demand down especially in rural areas   the wild card imo will be the impending recession and the huge sell off in 10 15 years when all the boomers start hitting their late 70s and early 80s so there s your major volatility

there are quite some options but without additional information i can only provide examples last year i had the option to buy a house but i decided against it because in my area it is getting harder and harder every year to sell it at a reasonable price but if i had bought a house my mother would have lent me the money with me paying it back to her over the years on 3 interest so it would have been some kind of a private loan but my mom would never have taken ownership of the house since it was not her intention to own it in any way does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you if yes and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying then this is an option the second option the one we discarded because of the additional cost is that i could have taken a loan paying 4.5 interest to the bank which would then pay under 1 to my mom and keep the rest banks always want to make profit and this profit has to come from somewhere from the difference between the interest rates if your dad has 230k on the bank and you owe 230k to the bank you are better off if you keep the bank out at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money and you are comfortable with owing him money my gf would never money from her mother because her mother would always play the you are in my debt card on each and every visit and whenever she needed help in any way so the key is what does your dad feel comfy with and what do you feel comfy with if possible keep the banks out but set up a written contract between you and your dad

you have two problems money exchange commissions and currency risk commissions are always exorbitant first you must find the cheapest way to get your money converted to the foreign currency and into your brokerage account the absolute cheapest way may involve some research and financial institution also i 'd forget about anything other than usd for the foreseeable future any other foreign currency will probably have higher commissions and a weaker market once you have that down you must avoid needlessly exchanging currencies keep a balance in the foreign currency keep all dividends and capital gains there and only take local money out of your brokerage account right before using it   that means of course that you need to keep enough local currency to pay taxes on any gains etc as for currency risk there are two solutions one solution is to buy your risk away using forex you sell an amount of usd lots that is mostly equivalent to your current investments and then just make sure you do n't get margin calls i 'm not sure just how cheap your rates would be in the uae but on average your investments should still have positive returns the other solution is to just stop seeing exchange rate fluctuations as losses if you had usd 100k and now you have usd how are you losing money exchange rates can go the other way just fine you know and holding usd is a good way to hedge against your country going south

all this is completely true but i was going for a more basic level theoretical   in this case yes one person not paying of their loans would not hurt anything except the person in question as you point out but if people not paying of their loans is bad as it would rob money from the system basically $ 0 of the $ 30 would come back or at least so little that the banks stopped loaning   while the government can inject money that could only go so far   really i was just trying to explain why not paying off loans was bad for the economy even though staying in sustainable debt is good for the economy but not necessarily the individual   thanks for the info though

if they leave the extra funds in the account the irs will consider it as employer match they were n't funds from your paycheck they were from the employers profits because they do n't have a formal matching program the extra funds will still keep then under the max match   there is one other explanation that needs to be considered if the last paycheck from 2011 was near the end of the year the last friday of 2011 was december 30th the 401 k funds from that final paycheck may not have been deposited into your 401 k until early january 2012 if you count contributions when looking at your 401 k statement it will look like one two many for 2012 but the irs only cares when it was deducted from your paycheck not when it was deposited into your account the department of labor only requires they be deposited by the 15th of the following month

from investopedia   beating the market is a difficult phrase to analyze it can be used    to refer to two different situations 1 an investor portfolio manager fund or other investment specialist    produces a better return than the market average the market average    can be calculated in many ways but usually a benchmark such as the    s&p 500 or the dow jones industrial average index is a good    representation of the market average if your returns exceed the    percentage return of the chosen benchmark you have beaten the market    congrats to learn more read benchmark your returns with indexes 2 a company 's earnings sales or some other valuation metric is    superior to that of other companies in its industry matching the market i would presume will be generating returns equivalent to the index you are comparing your portfolio with if for a sector industry then it would be the returns generated by the sector industry as an index is more or less a of the market as a whole people tend to use an index

depends on the stock involved but for the most part brokerages allow you gain entry at 50 meaning you can short twice the cash on hand you have    going forward you need to maintain 30 so on a $ 10,000 short you 'd have to maintain $ 3000 in your account example an account with $ 5000 cash you can short $ 10,000 securities   let say 100 shares of xyz at $ 100 per share after trade settles you wo n't receive a margin call until your balance falls to $ 3000 probably right around the time xyz rises to $ 120 per share   riskier stocks will have higher margin maintenance requirements leveraged vehicles like triple leveraged require 90 margin if they are allowed to be shorted at all

firstly how far behind on rent are they have you sent them notices in writing about late rent and if so how many have you had to send how often do they say they are going to do things like pay overdue rent and they never do to tell you the truth imho if they are starting to be regularly late in rent payments and they do n't do things they say they are going to do then it is time to evict them in nsw australia if the tenant is more than 2 weeks late in rent and prior to them reaching 2 weeks late you have called them asking for late rent and sent notices you can evict the tenants if the tenants do not leave you can apply to the tribunal to get them out and ask for outstanding money to be paid to you however if it does get to this stage the tenants may be pissed off so may do some damage to the property in retaliation then you have to go back to the tribunal to get the tenant 's bond security deposit and any other funds to repair any damages done to your place the longer you leave it the worse it will get we had some tenants similar to this which we finally got out earlier this year they would say they would pay rent due by the end of the week and no money would come by the end of the week we took them to tribunal and got them out and we got the bond plus unpaid rent and other money for damages and leaving the place dirty over and above the bond awarded to us just under $ 4k.   the tenants said they could n't pay and so went on a payment plan to pay about $ every 2 weeks they did n't pay any of the payments so then we went to the local court to get a sheriff to go to their new place and take their property the must have gotten scared from this because they approached the local court and agreed to pay $ 60 per week we have currently received about 10 payments so it will be a long time before we get all our money back as i said the longer you leave it the worse it can get you should also look at improving your criteria for selecting new tenants i have given an answer to this question how to choose a good tenant as a private landlord hopefully it can give you some ideas of what to ask for when searching for your next tenant update due update in question six weeks behind in rent is quite a bit to be behind if the landlord had been asking the tenant to pay the late rent during this period and the tenant had been giving excuses why the rent was late and saying they would pay it by a certain time but never did it is a big sign that they will tell you lies   if this is the first time they have been late in paying rent and now they are back up to date with the rent you might want to give them one more chance if this is a pattern that happens regularly it is better to get them out as it will happen again you will get in an argument with them and then they might stop paying rent altogether you can usually gain a better perspective of the tenants from their action rather than their words that is why their past rental history is so important when finding a new tenant

he would spend it into the economy that is accepting his dollars as an example the apple maker might borrow $ 100 with $ 10 interest for the deer then later on get the $ 100 back from the deer hunter in trade for 150 apples and then pay this $ 100 to the banker now the apple maker still needs $ 10 to pay off his loan the banker says he 'll trade his $ 10 in interest profit for 15 apples now the apple maker can resolve his debt without further borrowing   the difference between spending interest earnings and issuing a loan is that when the banker is spending they are getting something for their own use when they are issuing the loan they are n't getting anything but the promise to repay that loan

good question   and it depends a bit on your current plan your future income and the plan you are moving too mostly you want to roll out of your existing 401k.   there will likely be a fee and your investment choices are limited   you will want to do a direct transfer and going with a quality company such as fidelity or vanguard   both of those have zero fees for accounts and pretty good customer service however if your future income is likely to be high there is something else to consider   if you are over the limits do a roth and are considering doing a backdoor roth a key success for this strategy is keeping your roll over ira balance low or zero    so you may want to either leave the 401 k where it is or roll it to your new 401 k plan   in that case you will have to call the two 401 k custodians and select the best choice as far as fees and fund choice

basic arbitrage is the purchasing and selling of things that are convertible    the classic example is the international trading of equities if someone in london wants to purchase a hundred shares of shell for 40 gbp ea and someone in new york wants to sell you a hundred shares of shell for 61 usd ea you can buy the shares from the guy in new york sell them to the guy in london and convert your gbp back in to usd for a profit of $ minus fees   now if after you buy the shares in new york the price in london goes down you 'll be left holding 100 shares of shell that you do n't want so instead you should borrow 100 shares in london and sell them at the exact same time that you buy the shares in new york thus keeping your net position at 0 in fact you should also borrow and convert them to usd at the same time so that exchange rate changes do n't get you

there are times when investing in an etf is more convenient than a mutual fund when you invest in a mutual fund you often have an account directly with the mutual fund company or you have an account with a mutual fund broker   mutual funds often have either a front end or back end load which essentially gives you a penalty for jumping in and out of funds etfs are traded exactly like stocks so there is inherently no load when buying or selling   if you have a brokerage account and you want to move funds from a stock to a mutual fund an etf might be more convenient with some accounts an etf allows you to invest in a fund that you would not be able to invest in otherwise   for example you might have a 401k account through your employer   you might want to invest in a vanguard mutual fund but vanguard funds are not available with your 401k   if you have access to a brokerage account inside your 401k you can invest in the vanguard fund through the associated etf another reason that you might choose an etf over a mutual fund is if you want to try to short the fund

if everyone bought used cars who would buy the new cars so that everyone else could buy them used rental car companies your rant expresses a misunderstanding of fundamental economics as demand for used cars increases so will prices but economics is off topic here so let me explain why i bought a new car that i am now in the 10th year of driving when i bought the car i currently drive i was single i was working full time and i was going to school full time i bought a 2007 toyota corolla for about $ 16,500 cash out the door i wanted a reliable car that was clean and attractive enough that i would n't be embarrassed in it if i took a girl out for dinner i could have bought a much more expensive car but i wanted to be real about myself and not give the wrong impression about my views on money i 've done all the maintenance and the car is still very nice even after 105 k miles it will handle at least that many more miles barring any crashes could i have purchased a nice used car for less certainly but because it was the last model year before a redesign the dealer was clearly motivated to give me a good deal so i did n't lose too much driving it off the lot there are a lot of reasons why people buy new cars i did n't want to look like a chump when out on a date real estate agents often like to make a good impression as they are driving clients to see new homes some people can simply afford it and do n't want to worry about what abuse a prior owner may have done i do n't feel defensive about my decision to buy a new car those years ago the other car i 've purchased in the last 10 years was a four year old used car and it certainly does a good job for my wife who does n't put too many miles on it i will not rule out buying another new car in the future either some times the difference in price is n't significant enough that used is always the best choice

why it is good to be risky the reason why it is good to be risky is because risky investments can result in higher returns on your money the problem with being risky is there is a chance you can lose money however in the long term you can usually benefit from higher returns even if you have a few slip ups let me show you an example   these two lines are based off of placing $ 2,000 in a retirement fund at age of 20 and then at age of 25 start investing $ 6,500 a year based off of a salary of $ 65,000 with a company that will 1 to 1 match up to 5 ira contribution presumably someone with a master 's should be able to get this and then being able to increase your contribution amount by $ 150 a year as your salary begins to increase as well the blue line assumes that all of this money that you are putting in a retirement account has a fixed 3 interest compounded yearly for simplicity sake every year until you retire the red line is earning a 12 interest rate while you are 20 years old and then decreasing by 0.5 per year until you retire since this is using more risky investments when you are younger i have even gone ahead and included losing 20 of your money when you are 24 another 20 when you are 29 and then again another 20 when you are 34 as you can see even with losing 20 of your money 3 different times you still end up with more money then you would have had if you stuck with a more conservative investment plan if i change this to 50 each 3 times you will still come out about equal to a more conservative investment now i do have these 3 loses placed at a younger age when there is less to lose but this is to be expected since you are being more risky when you are young when you are closer to retirement you have less of a chance of losing money since you will be investing more conservatively why it is ok to be risky when you are young but not old lets say you loose 20 of your $ 2,000 when you are young you have 30 40 years to make that back that 's roughly $ 1 a month extra that you are having to come up with so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are young you have plenty of time to account for it before you retire   now lets say you have $ 1,000,000 when you are 5 years from retiring and loose 20 of it you have to come up with an extra $ a month if you want to retire on time so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are close to retiring you will most likely have to work for many more years just to be able to recover from your loses what to invest in this is a little bit more difficult question to answer if there was one right way to invest your money every one would be doing that one right way and would result in it not turning out to be that good of investment what you need to do is come up with a plan for yourself my biggest advice that i can give is to be careful with fees some places will charge a fixed dollar amount per trade while others might charge a fixed dollar amount per month while even others might charge a percentage of your investment with only having $ 2,000 to invest a large fee might make it difficult to make money

you 're correct that the trading costs would be covered by the expense ratio just to be clear here the expense ratio is static and does n't change very often it 's set in such a way that the fund manager expects it to cover all of their operational costs it 's not some sort of slider that they move around with their costs   i 'm not familiar with any etf providers doing agreements which cover rent and equipment hedge funds do see hedge fund hotels etf providers do routinely enter into agreements with larger institutions that cover stuff like marketing for a while outsourced all of the management of the to bny and was responsible solely for marketing it themselves

still i wonder and please explain my if greece started a building project that would pay a group of workers the workers would get money to pay for their demand the crisis is not led by demand rather by lack of private money yes now this money starts to circulate and different factories suddenly get paid more because the workers are buying stuff to keep up with this new demand the factories employ new workers which in turn get paid and then buys more stuff from other companies i know this is very simplistic but why would it not work this way if the government started building projects

some sample prices for straightforward pay for hours or planners i think i 've seen some similar rates elsewhere too i 'd feel like you might get something and boilerplate for too much less than $ 1000 how could the person afford to spend much time and i 'd feel like lots more than $ 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff basically you 're paying $ 1000 for a day or two of work you do n't want just a couple hours of work but you do n't need a week of work either anyway extracting the general guideline since prices may vary or over time you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it from there you can decide what 's fair adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues this is assuming you 're paying for time and which is not a given the biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models there are other models but these are the ones i 've seen most the difference between these two models is a lot of money over time hourly is going to be much cheaper because it 's a one time cost instead of ongoing and unrelated to what you have in assets however you wo n't get investment management which can be valuable if you are n't the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you the investment management planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money hourly planners do n't really have as good a business from a business owner 's perspective but they are cheaper from a customer perspective as long as you 're happy to diy a bit one thing i like about hourly planners is that i do n't really feel investments are the main place planners can add value so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that insurance estate planning taxes etc are where it 's harder for a to know all the ins and outs and diy from what i 've seen the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like usaa or vanguard if you have an account with them however they will only recommend products from the company in question so that 's a downside and you probably wo n't get to meet them in person this question may be useful too what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

private equity is simply some type of an investment company which is owned in a way not accessible to the public ie warren buffet runs berkshire which is an investment company which itself is traded on the new york stock exchange this means that anyone can buy shares in the company and own a small fraction of it if warren buffet owned all the shares of berkshire it would be a private equity company note that equity refers to the ownership of the company itself a private investment company may simply buy bonds which are a form of debt in which case they would not be technically considered a private equity company a hedge fund is a very broad term which i do n't believe has significant meaning technically it means something along the lines of an investment fund either public or private which attempts to hedge the risks of its portfolio by carefully considering what type of investments it purchased this refers back to the meaning of hedge ie hedging your bets in my opinion hedge fund is not meaningfully different from investment fund or other similar terms it is just the most popular way to refer to this type of industry at the present time   you can see the trend of using the term investment fund vs hedge fund using this link note that the high point of the use of hedge fund occurred on october 2008 right at the peak of the global financial crisis the term a certain image of high finance wall street types that may exploit various situations such as tax legislation or secret information for their own gain without a clear definition however it is a term without much meaning if you do a similar comparison between hedge fund and private equity you can see that the two correlate very closely i believe the term private equity is similarly misused to generally refer to investment bankers however in that case private equity has a more clear definition on its own merits

first do n't save anything in a tax sheltered vehicle you will be paying so little tax that there will be essentially no benefit to making the contributions and you 'll pay tax when they come out tax free compounding for 40 years is terrific but start that after you 're earning more than a stipend second most people recommend having a month 's expenses readily available for emergencies for you that would be $ 1500 if you put $ 100 a month aside it will take over a year to have your emergency fund it 's easy to argue that you should pick a higher pace so as to have your emergency money in place sooner however the emergencies usually cited are things like home repair car repair needing to replace your car and so on since you are renting your home and do n't have a car these emergencies are n't going to happen to you ask yourself if your home was destroyed and you had to replace all your clothes and possessions including furniture how much would you need keep in mind any insurance you have the only emergency expense i ca n't guess about is health costs because i live in canada i would be tempted to tell you to get a credit card with a $ 2000 limit and consider that your emergency fund just because grad student living is so tight to the bone been there and 25 years ago i had $ 1200 a month so it must be harder for you now if you do manage to save up $ 1500 and you 've really been pinching to do that walking instead of taking the bus staying on campus hungry instead of popping out to buy food let up on yourself when you hit the target delaying your graduation by a few months because you 're not mentally sharp due to hunger or will be a far bigger economic hit than not having saved $ 200 a month for 2 or 3 years the former is 3 6 months of your new salary the latter 5 you know what you 're likely to earn when you graduate right

you are right rollover is a process and not an account type the result is a traditional ira there is no such thing as a rollover ira account rolling a 401(k over to a traditional ira makes sense if a you have to because you leave the employer the 401(k is with b because you traditional ira is cheaper or more flexible or in other ways better for you or c if your next step is a backdoor rollover to a roth ira most of the time it does n't make sense because employer 401(k are often better and cheaper of course for the investment company where you roll it too it makes a lot of sense because they get your money so they recommend it but that 's only good for them not for you of course you can roll into an existing account if you want to roll making a new account has no advantage i can not imagine any ira custodian would n't take rollovers they would shoot themselves in the foot by that what can happen and you should consider this that your ira only accepts cash and does not allow to transfer the shares you have in the 401(k that means you have to sell and then re buy and you might lose a lot in fees there

a moving average will act as support or resistance to a stock only when the stock is trending the way it acts as support for instance is similar to a trend line take the daily chart of cba over the last 6 months the first chart shows cba with an uptrend support line   the second chart shows cba during the same period with 50 day ema as a support   both can be used as support for the uptrend generally you can used these types of support or resistance in a downtrend to determine when to buy a stock and when to sell a stock if i was looking to buy cba whilst it was uptrending one strategy i could use was to wait until it hit or got very close to the support trend line and then buy as it re bounces back up if i already held the stock i could use a break down below the uptrend support line as a stop to exit out of the stock

the reason to go public is to get money not to be snarky but your question is like asking why should a company try to sell its products when if they just piled them up in a warehouse they would n't have to worry about shipping and customer complaints and collecting sales tax the answer of course is because they want the money sure there are disadvantages to going public like more regulation required financial disclosures and having to answer to stockholders that 's the price you pay for accepting money from people they 're not going to give you money for nothing

cutting workers instead of creating jobs that sounds logical the epitome of a healthier economy   if mr. billionaire ca n't handle losing one or two billion of his multiple billions he should just quit looks due past his retiring age anyway and give the company to someone who can run it without being a pussy   way for david siegel to first amendment rights     over the past four years i have had to stop building my dream house cut back on all of my expenses and take my kids out of private schools simply to keep this company strong and to keep you employed   hahaha oh wow seriously   i feel bad for people who have to work with a ceo who 's that much of a public dick   hey david ever wonder what your employees have to sacrifice to keep their jobs y'know your employees right   the people who keep your fucking company afloat   without them you would n't have your billions   if you think you 're so well off without your workers why do n't you fire them all and run the company yourself   that way you could keep all that you earn   go ahead   let 's see what happens   no dream house when your current house is probably a million dollar mansion   boo fucking   excuse me as i pull out my tiniest

if you are looking to transfer money to another person in the us you can do do with no tax consequence   the current annual gift limit is $ 14k per year per person so for example my wife and i can gift $ 56k to another couple with no tax and no forms for larger amounts there is a lifetime exclusion that taps into your $ estate tax it requires submitting a form 709 but just paperwork no tax would be due this is the simplest way to gift a large sum and not have any convoluted tracking or structured loan with annual forgiveness one form and done if the sum is well over $ 5 m you should consider a professional to guide you not a q&a board

anarchy is an absence or of all governing authority i certainly do n't and did n't confuse that with capitalism    but capitalism is control of trade and industry by private entities rather than by government attempting to guide the economy at large to a specific outcome through government regulation is at odds with capitalism    however we obviously have never had a purely capitalist system and i do n't see that changing anytime soon

does the sentence apply for etfs and etf companies no the value of an etf is determined by an exchange and thus the value of the share is whatever the trading price is thus the price of an etf may go up or down just like other securities money market funds can be a bit different as the mutual fund company will typically step in to avoid breaking the buck that could happen as a failure for that kind of fund to wit    must etf companies invest a dollar in the etf for every dollar that an    investor deposited in this etf no because an etf is traded as shares on the market unless you are using the creation redemption mechanism for the etf you are buying and selling shares like most retail investors i 'd suspect if you are using the creation redemption system then there are baskets of other securities that are being swapped either for shares in the etf or from shares in the etf

assuming this is a public company i 'd recommend reading the analyst calls from the last several quarters this will give you an idea of what investors and therefor likely the board and senior leadership are focused on at a very high level you re an intern so do nt feel like you need to blow the doors off but showing that you are aware of the company 's major objectives and asking some thoughtful questions about them is probably a good start

yes but the trendy new term is plant based diet and i think the attraction for a vegan fast food would be to get a quick healthy meal that is reminiscent of typical fast food   the way meat protein is consumed in the us and elsewhere is typically in conjunction with other processed ingredients   if someone figures out a good menu with relatively healthy vegan food i definitely think they could be successful     something like juice where they have many locations inside or next to gyms seems like it could work   do n't always cut it and a quick cheap healthy snack would be fantastic after or before a work out   honestly i never go to restaurants that serve meats and order something that is strictly vegan vegetarian   if there was a place i could go to quickly that specializes in vegan food i would love to give it a try

as mr. money money mustache once said if you have credit card debt you should feel like your hair is on    fire student loan debt is different than credit card debt   rather than having spent the money on just about anything it was invested in improving yourself and probably your financial future   this was probably a good decision however unlike most credit card debt if you ever have to file for bankruptcy your student loans will not be erased   they will follow you forever pay your debts off as quickly as you can   while it may be true that long term return on the stock market is about 7 you can not assume that this will always be the case especially in the short term   what if you had made this assumption in 2007 to assume that your stocks will beat a 6.4 guaranteed return over the next few years is not really investing   it 's gambling

after doing a little research i was actually surprised to find many internet resources on this topic including sites from intuit gave entirely incorrect information the information that follows is quoted directly from irs publication rules for dependents first i will assume that you are not living on your own and are claimed as a dependent on someone else 's tax return such as a parent or guardian if you were an minor that would be a completely different question and i will ignore this less common case so how much money can you make as a minor who is someone else 's dependent well the most commonly quoted number is $ 6,300 but despite this numbers popularity this is not true this is how much you can earn in wages from regular employment without filing your own tax return but this does not apply to your scenario selling your products online as an independent game developer would generally be considered self employment income and according to the irs a dependent must also file a tax return if he or she had wages of $ or more from a church or qualified church controlled organization that is exempt from employer social    security and medicare taxes or had net earnings from self employment of at least $ 400 so your first $ 400 in earnings triggers absolutely no requirement to file a tax return blast away and good luck after that you do not necessarily owe much in taxes however you will need to file a tax return even if you owe $ 0 as this was self employment income if you had for instance a job at a grocery store you could earn up to $ 6,300 without filing a return because the store would be informing the irs about your employment anyway as well as deducting medicare and social security payments etc how much tax will you pay as your income grows beyond $ 400 based upon the irs pages for self employment tax and family businesses while you will not likely have to pay income tax until you make $ 6,300 in a year you will still have to pay social security and medicare taxes after the first $ 400 roughly this should be right about 16 of your income so if you make $ 6000 you 'll owe just under $ 1000 and be keeping the other $ 5000 if your income grows even more you may want to learn about business expense deductions this would allow you to pay for things like advertisement software a new computer for development purposes etc and deduct the expenses out of your income so you pay less in taxes but do n't worry having such things to wonder about would mean you were raking in thousands of dollars and that 's an awfully good problem to have as a young entrepreneur so should you keep your games free or try to make some money well first of all realize that $ 400 can be a lot harder to make when you are first starting in business than it probably sounds second do n't be afraid of making too much money tax filing software even totally free versions make filing taxes much much easier and at your income level you would still be keeping the vast majority of the money you earn even without taking advantage of special business deductions   i 'd recommend you not be a afraid of trying to make some money i 'd bet money it will help you learn a lot about game development business and finances and will be a really valuable experience for you whether you make money or not having made so much money you have to pay taxes is not something to be afraid of it 's just something adults like to complain about good luck on your adventures and you can always come back and ask questions about how to file taxes what to do with any new found wealth etc

collateralized secured are interchangeable terms note the following two quotes from wikipedia links below a secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset e.g. a car or property as collateral for the loan which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan in lending agreements collateral is a borrower 's pledge of specific property to a lender to secure repayment of a loan this website also uses the terms interchangeably loan line of credit are not interchangeable terms   in a loan you receive a one time disbursement repay it over a fixed amortization schedule think home mortgage in a line of credit you can pay back re borrow from your credit line as often as you need think credit card or home equity line of credit
