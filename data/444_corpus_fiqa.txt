lending is n't profitable when interest rates are this low   consider what 's involved to offer a savings or checking account   the bank must maintain branches with tellers   the bank has to pay rent or buy and pay property taxes and utilities   the bank has to pay salaries   the bank has to maintain cash so as to make change   and pay for insurance against robbery   all of that costs money    at 6 interest a bank can sort of make money   not great money but it takes in more than it has to pay out   at 4 interest which is about where ten year mortgage rates are in canada the bank does n't make enough margin   they are better off selling the loan and closing their branches than offering free checking accounts    an additional problem is that banks tend to make money from overdraft fees   but there 's been a move to limit overdraft fees as they target the most economically vulnerable   so canadian banks tend to charge monthly fees instead   uk banks may also start charging monthly fees if interest rates stay low and other fees get curtailed

the other answers in this thread do a fine job of explaining the economic situation that banks are in in addition to that information i would like to point out that it is not hard to avoid a monthly fee for canadian bank accounts usually this involves keeping a minimum balance of a few thousand dollars at all times actual examples as of dec 2016 for the lowest tier chequing accounts includes information on the minimum balance to waive the monthly fee and the monthly fee otherwise

you have to check your contract to be sure what is it you 're paying for typically you get some of the following features which can be unavailable to you in banks which do n't charge a monthly fee arguably these expenses could be paid by the interest rates your money earn to the bank notice how banks which do n't charge a fee usually require you to have a minimum amount of cash in your account or a minimum monthly cash flow when you pay for your bank 's services in cash there 's no such restrictions i 'm not sure if typical banks in the uk would take away your credit card if you lose your job and do n't qualify for that kind of card any more but i do know banks who would the choice is yours and while it 's indeed sad that you do n't have this kind of choice in canada it 's also not like you 're paying solely for the privilege of letting them invest your money behind your back

arguably because they can   canada 's banking industry is dominated by five chartered banks who by virtue of their size pretty much determine how banking is done in canada yes they have to abide by government regulation but they carry enough weight to influence government and to some extent shape the regulation they have to follow while this situation makes canada 's financial system very stable and efficient it also permits anti competitive behavior   there was a time when u.s. banks were not permitted to operate across state lines when the smallest of canada 's big 5 was bigger than the biggest u.s. bank despite our economy having always been about 1/10 the size of the u.s. that scale and their small number gives the big 5 the ability to invest heavily in and collaborate on whatever they decide to be in their own interest so if they want to charge fees they do

if you have enough earned income to cover this amount you should be all set if i understand you correctly you proposed two transactions the first a withdrawal from the beneficiary ira some of which is an rmd the rest is an extra withdrawal of funds   next you propose to make a deposit to a combination of your ira and your wife 's ira as long as there 's earned income to cover this deposit your plan is fine   to be clear you ca n't take a ira and deposit the rmd to an ira but money is fungible the dollars you deposit are n't traceable only need to be justified by enough earned income a ira is a great way to get the money to increase your own ira or 401(k deposits   further details the 2016 contribution limit is $ 5,500 per person so i did make the assumption you knew the $ 9000 deposit need to be split between the 2 iras with no more than $ 5500 going into either one

genius answer do n't spend more than you make pay off your outstanding debts put plenty away towards savings so that you do n't need to rely on credit more than necessary guaranteed to work every time   answer more tailored to your question what you 're asking for is not realistic practical logical or reasonable you 're asking banks to take a risk on you knowing based on your credit history that you 're bad at managing debt and funds solely based on how much cash you happen to have on hand at the moment you ask for credit or a loan or based on your salary which is n't guaranteed except in cases like professional athletes where long term contracts are in play   you can qualify for lower rates for mortgages with a larger down payment but you 're still going to get higher rate offers than someone with good credit   if you plan on having enough cash around that you think banks would consider making you credit worthy why bother using credit at all and not just pay for things with cash   the reason banks offer credit or low interest on loans is because people have proven themselves to be trustworthy of repaying that debt based on the information you have provided the bank would n't consider you trustworthy yet even if you have $ 100,000 in cash they do n't know that you 're not just going to spend it tomorrow and not have the ability to repay a long term loan you could use that $ 100,000 to buy something and then use that as collateral but the banks will still consider you a default risk until you 've established a credit history to prove them otherwise

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

thanks for your reply   i agree shooting down the majority of chinese as being shady is perhaps unfair i was just left with a really bad taste after all the crazy situations i was in during those 10 years i am sure they have some strong opinions about americans also    on the usa side i did bring my usual law firm in on a consultation and even contacted and consulted with a firm who specializes in transportation law my wife and the chinese side thought that was a waste of money but it was valuable on answering many of the questions you bought up including things like a dot registration and so on as for it being i think not as i can not work with someone i do n’t trust the recovery is not much just under $ 3000 as it was caught before the warehouse lease was signed etc   part of the problem was i required a good faith payment from them before the lease signing which they did not do the chinese side is scared of me for some of the reasons i alluded too in my original post and they have agreed to pay that amount on monday i will give them a receipt for their payment and move on without any further action i think my wife has learned a lot from this i have perhaps also both about my wife and what she is willing to do and how much she wants to start a business i agree that my is perhaps not 100 when i feel i will try to temper that some in future but most importantly through clearly defined roles and responsibilities thanks again

tl;dr please please please do the conversion first joetaxpayer 's answer is correct but i am of the opposite opinion first there 's just about no reason to have post tax dollars in a traditional ira   you 'll eventually have to pay tax on the earnings those dollars generate so it 's essentially the same as having that money in a regular taxable account   meanwhile if you roll those dollars into a roth ira you get to earn tax free money on them for the rest of your life and even after your death second even if you did have some reason for keeping those post tax dollars where they are the last thing you ever want to do is mix them with pre tax dollars from say your 401k   as soon as you mix them all the dollars become subject to pro rata taxation as joe mentioned so any future decision you were planning to make about what to do with just your post tax dollars is moot you have given away your right to think separately about your pre- and post tax dollars as an example let 's say the accounts you want to combine look like this in the future you decide you want to move $ 2,000 from the above account into a roth   because you mixed the money the irs insists that your rollover consists of so now you owe tax and it 's regular income tax i believe not even capital gains tax on $ 1,500   that was money that you away specifically to avoid taxes and now you 've gone and paid taxes on it   now there are valid arguments for intentionally moving pre tax dollars from a traditional to a roth like this but the point is that you should n't even have to be having that argument you have post tax dollars in your traditional ira that almost certainly belong in a roth   by mixing your 401k into your traditional ira you can no longer do anything with just the post tax dollars   the irs will forever insist that you do these pro rated calculations say in the future you suddenly realize that a roth is much better for your financial situation than a traditional ira   or you might still prefer a traditional ira but as explained in the next sentence it 's not available to you   unfortunately because you 're covered by a new 401k or maybe because you earn too much money to contribute pre tax dollars to either a traditional or roth ira you 're out of luck   you 're simply not allowed to contribute to a roth most people in this situation can make use of what 's called a back door roth   they contribute up to the maximum amount per year $ 5,500 or whatever it is now post tax to a traditional ira and then immediately roll it over to their roth   you can still try this but guess what   yep because you 're mixing these new post tax dollars with pre tax money in your traditional ira every year your rollover will be tainted with that pre tax money diluting the whole point of the back door roth   you 'll be paying taxes on money you never wanted to pay taxes on and you 'll be leaving post tax money behind in your traditional ira if it sounds like i 'm annoyed about this situation from personal experience it 's because i am by doing the conversion first you never mix pre- and post tax money and your money goes where you want it of course assuming you eventually do roll over your 401(k into a traditional ira the really annoying consequence above will still plague you but at least you 'll have cleanly converted that first post tax amount

the standard approach is to reach an agreement and put it in writing what you agree upon is up to you but in the us if you want to avoid gift taxes larger loans need to be properly documented and must charge at least a certain minimal interest rate or at least you must declare and be taxed upon that minimal income even if you do n't actually charge it last i looked the federal requirement was somewhere under 0.3 so this is n't usually an issue there may also be state rules when doing business with friends treat it as business first friendship second otherwise you risk losing both money and friendship regarding what rate to charge that is something you two have to negotiate based on how much the borrower needs the money how much lending the money puts the lender at risk how generous each is feeling etc sorry but there is no one size fits all answer here what i charge or insist on paying to my brother might be different from what i charge my cousin or a co worker or best friend or if both parties think it 's fair it 's fair if you ca n't reach an agreement of course the loan does n't happen

it is true that this is possible however it 's very remote in the case of the large and reputable fund companies such as vanguard fdic insurance protects against precisely this for bank accounts but mutual funds and etfs do not have an equivalent to fdic insurance one thing that does help you in the case of a mutual fund or etf is that you indirectly through the fund own actual assets in a cash account at a bank you have a promise from the bank to pay and then the bank can go off and use your money to make loans you do n't in any sense own the bank 's loans with a fund the fund company can not legally take your money out of the fund except to pay the expense ratio they have to use your money to buy stocks bonds or whatever the fund invests in those assets are then owned by the fund legally a mutual fund is a special kind of company defined in the investment company act of 1940 and is a separate company from the investment advisor such as vanguard funds have their own boards and in principle a fund board can even fire the company advising the fund though this is not likely since boards are n't usually independent a quick google found this article for more maybe someone can find a better one if vanguard goes under the funds could continue to exist and get a new adviser or could be liquidated with investors receiving whatever the assets are worth of course all this legal stuff does n't help you with outright fraud if a fund 's adviser says it bought the s&p 500 but really some guy bought himself a yacht madoff style then you have a problem but a huge well known etf has auditors tons of different employees lots of brokerage and exchange traffic etc so to me at least it 's tough to imagine a risk here with a small fund company with just a few people and there are lots of these then there 's more risk and you 'd want to carefully look at what independent agent holds their assets who their auditors are and so forth with regular mutual funds not etfs there are more issues with diversifying across fund companies with etfs there probably is n't much downside to diversifying since you could buy them all from one brokerage account maybe it even happens naturally if you pick the best etfs you can find personally i would just pick the best etfs and not worry about advisor diversity update maybe also deserving a mention are exchange traded notes etns an etn 's legal structure is more like the bank account minus the fdic insurance of course it 's an iou from the company that runs the etn where they promise to pay back the value of some index there 's no investment company as with a fund and therefore you do n't own a share of any actual assets if the etn 's sponsor went bankrupt you would indeed have a problem much more so than if an etf 's sponsor went bankrupt

the piece is a little misguided at best and poor journalism at worst the problem lies in the difference between what 's deductible for individuals and what 's deductible for corporations the short version of the story is that corporations can deduct a hell of a lot more things than individuals can individual deductions are spelled out in the internal revenue code stuff like medical expenses above 7.5 of your agi certain educational things etc   for corporations the basic rule is that they can deduct any ordinary and necessary business expenses that includes operating travel interest employee etc   i wish that the article had cited specific sections of the code if this was some kind of loophole or something but alas it appears that they did n't that leads me to believe that these companies are deducting the portion not paid to the government as a business expense    what it 's worth i do n't believe that a company can deduct those expenses for tax purposes unless it 's to protect their business interests my assumption i do n't have the time or desire to search case law right now is that settlements with the us government are considered to fall under that   edit see my comment r business for the relevant treasury regulation dealing with this

i think you 're doing the right thing one of the benefits of tax deferred account aside of it being tax deferred is that it keeps the money locked from you some people think it 's a bad thing i think it 's a good thing the amount of money locked is not that significant relatively to your income 10 in your case which is a lot relatively to others of your age and shows that you think ahead and plan for your future but it builds up a cushion to fall to when you 're old many people do n't think of the time they 're old or think they 'll be the same or better income wise as they 're now that is not so although during the period of your life your marginal tax will indeed grow in the end it goes back down again for most of the people and that is because your income goes down it is then that you need the money you 're putting aside now and the more you put aside and the earlier you put it aside the more you will have then the fact that it 's locked promises that you will have it then not before when you want to buy a house you ca n't afford or impress a girl with a car you ca n't pay for in my mind that 's the best benefit and the fact that the earlier you start putting the money there the more gains it will acquire until you actually need it so keep up the good work and save for your future lock out that 10 and invest the rest in other channels which may be more risky and with more potential gains

the only ways to increase your after tax income are to increase your tax deferred savings 401k increase your tax deductions or increase your pre tax income increasing tax deferred savings is great for the long term but will usually not result in a bigger paycheck though net pay including the savings will go up this is however probably your best bet for reducing current tax liability increasing deductions usually involves spending money on charity mortgage interest other taxes etc so while you may reduce your tax liability you probably wo n't end up with more money in your pocket also if you are single and are n't paying a mortgage it probably wo n't be easy to exceed the standard deduction which pretty much leaves you with asking for a raise getting a better paying job or taking on a second job to increase your top line income

this question has the united kingdom tag so the information about usa or other law and procedures is probably only of tangential use except for understanding that no this is not something to ignore it may well indicate someone trying to use your i d fraudulently or some other sort of data processing foul up that may adversely impact your credit rating the first thing i would do is phone the credit card company that sent the letter to inform them that i did not make his application and ask firmly but politely to speak to their fraud team i would hope that they would be helpful it 's in their interests as well as yours added later by the way do not trust anything written on the letter it may be a fake letter trying to lure or panic you into some other sort of scam such as closing your compromised bank account and transferring the money in it to the fraud team for safety yes it sounds stupid but con men are experts at what they do and even finance industry professionals have fallen victim to such scams so find a telephone number for that credit card company independently for example google and then call that number if it 's the wrong department they 'll be able to transfer you internally if the card company is unhelpful you have certain legal rights that do not cost much if anything this credit company is obliged to tell you as an absolute minimum which credit reference agencies they used when deciding to decline your application yes you did not make it but it was in your name and affected your credit rating there are three main credit rating agencies and whether or not the bank used them i would spend the statutory £ 2 fee if necessary with each of them to obtain your statutory credit report which basically is all data that they hold about you they are obliged to correct anything which is inaccurate and you have an absolute right to attach a note to your file explaining for example that you entries x y and z were fraudulently caused by an unknown third party trying to steal your id they may be factually correct e.g. credit search on so it 's possible that you can not have them removed and it may not be in your interests to have them removed but you certainly want them flagged as unauthorized   if you think the fraudster may be known to you you can also use the data protection act on the company which write to you requiring them to send you a copy of all data allegedly concerning yourself which it holds this costs £ 10 in particular you will require sight of the application and signature if it was made on paper and the ip address details if it was made electronically as well as all the data content and subsequent communications you may recognise the but even if not you then have documentary evidence that it is not yours as for the ip address you can deduce the internet service provider and then use the data protection act on them they may decline to give any details if the fraudster used his own credentials in which case again you have documentary evidence that it was not you and something to give the police and bank fraud investigators if they get interested i suspect they wo n't be very interested if all you uncover is   fraudulent applications that were declined however you may uncover a successful fraud i.e. a live card in your name being used by a criminal or a store or phone credit agreement in which case obviously get in touch with that company to get it shut down and to get the authorities involved in dealing with the crime in general write down everything you are told including phone contact names and keep it confirm anything that you have agreed in writing and keep copies of the letters you write and of course the replies you receive you should n't need any lawyer the uk credit law puts the onus very much on the credit card company to prove that you owe it money and if a random stranger has stolen your i d it wo n't be able to do that in fact it 's most unlikely that it will even try unless you have a criminal record or a record of financial delinquency but it may be an awful lot of for years to come if somebody has successfully stolen your id so even if the first lot of credit reference agency print outs look clean check again in about six weeks time and yet again   in maybe 3 months finally there is a scheme that you can join if you have been a victim of id theft i 've forgotten its name but you will probably be told about it your credit reference files will be tagged at your request with a requirement for extra precautions to be taken this should not affect your credit rating but might make obtaining credit more hassle for example requests for additional id before your account is opened after the approval process oh and post a letter to yourself it 's not unknown for fraudsters to persuade the post office to redirect all your mail to their address

please note before taking any steps towards a transaction involving possible capital gains tax exclusions please consult your cpa attorney or tax advisor i am not a cpa or tax advisor since you have only lived in it 11 months you do n't meet the use test for full exclusion however even if you have n't lived in it that long you may be able to exclude some of the gains due to a unforeseen circumstance not just because you wanted to move you say you are ready for a change and so that means it 's an arbitrary decision not a forced one to calculate the partial exclusion take the number of months you lived there before the sale and divide it by 24 = 0.45 so for an unmarried person you can exclude up to $ 250,000 multiply that by and you get $ if your profit after everything is taken out is only $ 35,000 then you can exclude that from capital gains because it is less than $   all that being said you will need documentation in case you get audited for more information see irs publication 551 basis of assets and look for the section on real property see also this irs tax topic on sale of your home

your calculations are correct it is likely that the bank 's software has a rounding error   in effect either your bank is overstating your interest by eight cents per month or your bank is insisting that you prepay your principal by eight cents per month   if the bank 's ongoing interest calculations are correct your final payment will be slightly smaller because of the prepaid principal and because of compound interest on those prepayments   i have performed similar calculations for my mortgages over the years and except upon early payoff in the middle of the month i have always matched my banks calculations to the penny   ironically this means that my banks formulas are a bit weird after making these adjustments even my calculations for the mid month payoff matched to the penny

did n't lose your job you just had temporary employment   same as back in the late 1990 's when unemployment was really low a lot of people got jobs they really were n't qualified for and were paid far more at least on a scale relative to their co workers than they were really worth   the sad thing about that is that they came to believe they were truly worth that amount of money   the same with houses   my home bought in late 2000 increased in estimated market value by 75 i.e. to 175 of it 's previous sale price when i bought it and the bubble around here was n't anything like it was in other regions of the us and of course now it has ostensibly sunk back down to very nearly the price i paid for it   the problem for a lot of people with that is that even if they did n't buy during the peak bubble years they refinanced or based on that higher estimated value and so ended up basically removing and then spending the lion 's share of equity that they had built up in their house   for others it was much the same as the late 90 's employment they came to believe that their house was worth more and they have difficulty letting go of that illusory estimated market price   so they are experiencing the wealth loss effect just as they once experienced a wealth effect   i was saved from those things because    a i realized that the price of houses is always at the margin and is never guaranteed by what the place cost or what you have invested in it or even what the owner or mortgage company thought it was worth rather when you go to sell it will be determined by what the want are capable of paying    b i was far more concerned with what my total cost of buying would be including all of the interest paid on the mortgage this led me to first of all only buy what i needed in a house i.e. single guy = small place and secondly to pay the whole thing off asap which i did dramatically lowering the total lifetime cost of the place    and finally and probably most importantly though in part due to b above   c it does n't really matter to me whether the price goes up or down because i know that i will always need a place to live and that generally speaking due to overall market conditions the prices of all houses will tend to go up down together and though not necessarily in lock step there are always factors of neighborhood local economy housing trends etc but still should i desire to move i will essentially be able to trade my house for a similar one in a similar market with only a small 6 to 10 cost   d but i also know that if i move up market attempt to move to an area house that has a relatively higher demand higher price that i will then have to pay more or get an even smaller place smaller home less land no garage shop etc yet conversely if i for some reason decide to move down market to an area house with a relatively lower demand price i may be able to either pay less or to get slightly more house additional land etc   note i also took into account demographic changes when i bought and think i made the right choice even though it has n't played out yet with the typical household actually becoming smaller single parents fewer kids more retirees wanting to downsize etc i figured way back in 2000 that in 15 20 30 years circa 2015 2045 the big would be aging and in huge oversupply whereas smaller homes would be in relatively higher demand and given things like smart growth planning probably in lesser supply and so would be more likely to retain value   again this has n't played out yet though there definitely are signs that it is starting but i am also really not interested in selling so it 's a moot point at present and even if i am proved wrong it will probably merely prove to be the loss of an upside and not an actual loss per se

there are probably specific laws that control landlord tenant rent disputes but your friend 's argument assumes that there are n't let 's assume that there are n't so there are two possibilities either the contract directly addresses this issue or it does n't if the contract directly and specifically addresses this issue then that controls your friend is not claiming that it is specifically addressed so the general principle is this when something occurs within a contract that was n't explicitly discussed by the parties courts will try to figure out what the parties likely would have agreed to had they discussed the specific issue without changing the agreed terms of the contract this should produce the result that is fair to both parties your friend is arguing then that had he and the landlord discussed the issue the landlord would have agreed that in the event he is no longer able to accept credit cards easily your friend could live there rent free that does n't seem right to me does it seem right to you much more likely they would have agreed that he might have some leeway to work out a new payment scheme and maybe some late rent should be forgiven if he made an attempt to pay on time but could n't make arrangements but i do n't see more than that being reasonable

all things being equal a defined benefit pension is far better than an ira or a 401(k   think about it this way let 's say you can have a guaranteed $ 100 a month or the chance at $ 100 a month   which is better    now obviously your tolerance for risk is the difference but this is the beauty of a defined benefit plan your employer is picking up the risk   assuming that the pool of investments is about the same which unless if their funds are tremendously under performing they are the question is who takes the risk you or them especially if you are moving into a new position having a defined benefit plan is like having a risk free asset in your portfolio   it increases your safety   the only reason to roll this over into a 401(k or ira is if your expected value risk payout is better   a worked example if half the time you would earn more than $ 100 and half the time less then you could imagine the two as being equally good only if you really love risk would you take that chance   in reality only half the investments out there will beat the average and as such you actually have less than a 50/50 shot of beating a db unless if there are really low returns to it   more likely i suspect you are over estimating your ability to get a higher return

when you are putting your money in an index fund you are not betting your performance against other asset classes but rather against competing investments withing the same asset class the index fund always wins due to two factors diversity and lower cost   the lower cost attribute is essentially where you get your performance edge over the longer run that is why if you look at the universe of mutual funds where you get your diversification very few will have beaten the index assuming they have survived winters

the simple answer is that brokerages have to close the books at the end of the year before they can send out the tax forms what this entails is off topic for this site i doubt that printing and mailing the forms takes very long it is simply the process of reconciling the books so they do n't have to send out corrected forms if errors are corrected during that reconciliation process

i can only answer about the u.s. for question 2 i believe the answer is no if you are a non resident alien for tax purposes then only income connected to the u.s. is reported as income on the tax return unless there were any non deductible contributions to your pre tax iras when you convert to roth ira the entire amount of the conversion is added to your income so the tax consequence is the same as if you had that much additional u.s. income if you are a non resident alien with no other income in the u.s. then the income you have to report on your u.s. tax return will basically consist of the conversion non resident aliens do not have a standard deduction however all people have a personal exemption if we take 2013 as an example the exemption is $ 3900 per person we will assume that you will file as single or married filing separately non resident aliens can not file as married filing jointly the first $ 3900 of income is covered by the exemption and is not counted in taxable income for single and the next $ of income is taxed at 10 then next $ of income is taxed at 15 and so on so if you convert less than the personal exemption amount every year $ 3900 in 2013 then in theory you do not pay any taxes if you convert a little bit more then some of the conversion will be taxed at 10 etc

this is just an addition to 's answer   in order to maximize your overall wealth and wellbeing in a long run it is not enough to look only at the expected value ev in his example of always keeping $ or having $ 10000 99 of the time ev in the second case is greater $ > $ and if you are bill gates than you should not take an insurance in this case but if your wealth is a lot less than that you should take an insurance take a look at kelly criterion and utility functions if i offer you to take 100 million dollars no strings attached or to take a risk to get 200 million dollars 60 of the time and $ 0 40 of the time would you take that risk you should n't but bill gates should take that risk because that would be a very good investment for him utility functions can help you choose if you want an insurance or not maybe you want to insure your house because the value of the house is a large percentage of your wealth but on the other hand you do n't need to insure your car if it is very easy for you to afford another one but not easy to afford another house lets calculate what your wealth should be in order not to take this $ 150 insurance on a $ 10000 item if you pay $ 150 for an insurance you have guaranteed $ but choosing not to take an insurance is the same as betting $ in order to gain $ 150 99 of the time by using kelly criterion formula fraction of the wealth needed to make this bet is = + 1 = 1/3   that means that if your wealth greater than $ you do n't need an insurance but if you want to be sure it is advised to use fractional kelly betting for example you could multiply fraction by 1/2 and in that case if your wealth is more than $ you do n't need an insurance for this item

companies often provide cafeteria or catering services to employees tax free at subsidized rates i 'll use cafeteria as an illustration the irs says that in order to avoid lunch being taxed as income the employees must pay the direct costs of the lunch food and labor in addition to those costs add two more items to come up with the total tab overhead the cost of renting the space and of course profit the company can waive the last two and charge employees only materials and labor that 's why subsidized cafeteria food can cost as little as half of what it would cost elsewhere

all discount brokers offer a commission structure that is based on the average kind of order that their target audience will make different brokers advertise to different target audiences they could all have a lot lower commissions than they do the maximum commission price for the order ticket is set at $ 99 by the industry securities regulators when discount brokers came along and started offering $ 2 $ 9.99 trades it was simply because these new companies could be competitive in a place where incumbents were overcharging the same exists with robinhood the market landscape and costs have changed over the last decade with regulation and other brokerage firms never needed to update drastically because they could continue making a lot on commissions with nobody questioning it the conclusion being that other brokers can also charge a lot less despite their other overhead costs robinhood like other brokerage firms and anyone else trading directly with the exchanges are paid by the exchanges for adding liquidity not only are many trades placed with no commission for the broker they actually earn money for placing the trade if robinhood was doing you any favors they would be paying you but nobody questions free commissions so they do n't robinhood like other brokerage firms sells your trading data to the highest bidder this is called payment for order flow these subscribers see your order on the internet in route to the and before your order gets to the exchange the subscriber sends a different order to the exchange so they either get filled before you do analogous to front running but different enough to not be illegal or they alter the price of the thing you wanted to buy or sell so that you have to get a worse price these subscribers have faster computers and faster internet access than other market participants so are able to do this so quickly they are also burning a lot of venture capital like all startups you should n't place too much faith in the idea they are making enough money they also have plans to earn interest off of balances in a variety of ways and offer more options at a price like margin accounts

customers are regularly confused by software pricing microsoft 's windows for example either they 're dumb and should n't confuse the customers or they know what they 're doing i 'm betting the latter   at 99 bucks a product can seem expensive but if the other offerings are 89 and 150 99 seems like you 're saving a lot on the 150 while only paying a bit more than the 99 yet without those other options 99 might seem expensive   business consumers are more likely to pay more so you can gouge them with the enterprise edition at 150 99 for the gold edition and 89 for lite 99 will sell great and if that 's what you were hoping for in the first place that 's good   do n't think of the premium getting just thing of the premium edition as a way to capture the consumer surplus of businesses

in simple terms is how of your own money to how much of borrowed money    so in 2008 typical leverage ratios were investment banks means that for every 1 unit of banks money shareholders long term debts there was 30 units of borrowed money from deposits for other institutions etc this is a very unstable situation as typically say you lent out 31 to someone else half way through repayments the depositors and other lends are asking you 30 back you are sunk now lets say if you lent 31 to some one but 30 was your and 1 was from deposits etc then you can anytime more easily pay back the 1 to the depositor in day trading usually one away the position the same day or within a short period hence say you want to buy something worth 1000 in the morning and are selling it say the same day you are expecting the price to by and a gain 5 now when you buy via your broker trader you may not be required to pay 1000 normally one just needs to pay a margin money typically 10 varies from market to market country to country so in the first case if you put 1000 and get by 5 you made a profit of 0.5 however if you were to pay only 10 as margin money rest 990 is assumed loan from your broker you sell at the broker deducts his 990 and you get 15 so technically on 10 you have made 5 more ie 50 returns so this is leveraging of 10:1 if say your broker allowed only 5 margin money then you just need to pay 5 for the 1000 trade get back 5 you have made a 100 profit but the leveraging is   now lets say at this high leveraging when you are selling you get only 990 so you still owe the broker 5 if you ca n't pay up and if lot of other such people ca n't pay up then the broker will also go bankrupt and there is a huge risk   hence although leveraging helps in quite a few cases there is always an associated risk when things go wrong badly

investment is very uncertain so i believe that unless you have loads of money you should not play around with houses for the sole purpose of investing here are the questions which i would consider to judge the situation note that this is based on the current situation in the netherlands income your income is 1800 a month nett which means your gross annual income should be somewhere below allowed mortgage amount your maximum morgage amount is then roughly is it expensive given your maximum morgage buying a 200k appartment would consume pretty much all your cash there is some cost of buying the appartment so basically if you buy it you will not have much cash to decorate or deal with unforseen maintenance if you are conservative i would say that buying a appartment is financially much more relaxing in your situation what will be the monthly expense monthly mortgage payments will be about so your cashflow will suffer a bit   the amount you actually burn on interest in the early months is about 180 nett assuming an interest rate just below 2 and tax deductions there will be additional costs more heating long term maintenance etc so overall the amount of money you burn will be close to the amount of money you burn on rent of course over time there will be less interest so this should go down value change the value may go up or down in the very long term i would bet on it going up but on the short or medium term it is quite uncertain if you may live there for less than a decade value change is more of a risk than a benefit break even point as you mention that you will buy a house for 200k i will assume it is not in the heart of a major city and that renting it out may not be very attractive however i will also assume that it is not the middle of nowhere and that it will only take a reasonable amount of time to sell the house so if you want to move out you will probably sell it at a reasonable price in this case a rule of thumb is that living in an affordable house is usually a good idea when you live there for more than 5 years is it likely that you will find a partner in this period of time and will you live at your place then or somewhere else buying a 200k appartment would leave you completely cashless after you move in something i would not recommend unless you can depend on your parents for instance to bridge the gap when your cashflow dries up from a monthly expense point of view you are probably going to be ok as long as you survive the short run and financially it only makes sense if you are going to live there for a while and are fairly confident in your position in the labour market i would personally recommend you to think hard on your family situation and only buy a house if it leaves you with some cash in your pocket

as the op expressed their thought it seemed to me they were suggesting or rather anyone who is rich however that is defined non invested money be taxed at this high rate and that strikes me as naive you do n't think they would leave the country or invest it in a savings account earning .05 or most likely spread across many so it was fdic insured    gt i bet the rich would find something to do with that idle cash overnight if it was taxed at a 75 rate or so     they were basically suggesting the us government the savings of wealthy people    the question of whether the highest effective tax rate on income should be raised is   a completely different discussion personally i favor a higher tax rate and some new tax brackets for the very highest earners i do n't really think it 's necessarily fair in a progressive system to treat the rich as a piggy bank but it is what it is they benefit the most so they are called to contribute the most    i think i 'd favor some kind of alternative minimum tax for rich people so they had to pay a minimum of of their income above some sort of cap 5 million per year 100 million per year and capital gains   applied this would close the buffet loophole    my biggest reason for this though is not because i do n't think they deserve their money it 's because coffers basically guarantee that the legislation will be written for them and by them there is always this tension between the poor and middle class that want more services and the upper class that wants to pay less taxes    i am starting to get to the point where i think it might be better to have a smaller government and less services because they abuse their power and our money so much sopa afghanistan and iraq wars etc i do like the idea of social safety nets but perhaps those should be more local    anyways sorry for the wall of text

think of options as insurance an insurance company makes money by selling the policies at a rate slightly higher than the average payout   most options expire worthless this is because most options are purchased by hedge funds to hedge means taking out insurance in case your position goes against you so the sellers of options obtain a price that covers their averaged losses plus provides them with a profit for their trouble   an option has an amount that it declines in value each day called theta at the expiration date the option is worth zero if it is out of the money so it is option writers that typically make money in the options market as they are the sellers of insurance if they did n't make money selling options they would not sell them   for example the february call option on spy strike 200 traded at on since then it has in value to 0.14 the option writer currently stands to make a huge profit   so just as with insurance you generally never make money by buying insurance but the sellers of insurance tend to make money as do the writers of options   edit theta investopedia

typically developing economics are marked by moderate to high inflation as they are growing at a faster pace higher in savings rate and higher lending rates if you reduce the lending rate more business start up will borrow at cheaper rate this in turn means lowers savings rate and leads to higher inflation to combat this central banks make borrowing expensive which lowers inflation and increases the saving rate essentially all these 3 are tied up as to why these countries offer higher interest on usd is because most of the developing countries have trade current account deficit they need to bring in more usd in the country one of the ways is to encourage non resident citizens to park their foreign earning back home ensuring more funds usd inflow   the rate differential also acts as a guide as to how the currency would be valued against usd for example if you get 8 on usd less than 12 had you converted same to rouble at the end of say 3 years the exchange rate between usd and rouble would factor that 4 ie rouble will go down developed countries on the other hand are marked by low inflation they have already achieved everything as there is no in growth it more they are also characterized by low savings and lending rates

what you 're looking for are either fx forwards or fx futures    these products are traded differently but they are basically the same thing agreements to deliver currency at a defined exchange rate at a future time    almost every large venue or bank will transact forwards when the counterparty you or your broker has sufficient trust and credit for the settlement risk but the typical duration is less than a year though some will do a single digit multi year forward on a custom basis   then again all forwards are considered custom contracts   you 'll also need to know that forwards are done on currency pairs so you 'll need to pick the currency to pair your nok against   most likely you 'll want eur nok simply for the larger liquidity of that pair over other possible pairs a quote on a forward will usually just be known by the standard currency pair ticker with a settlement date different from spot   e.g. eur nok 12 m for the 12 month settlement futures on the other hand are exchange traded and more standardized   the vast majority through the cme chicago mercantile exchange   your broker will need access to one of these exchanges and you simply need to qualify for futures trading process depends on your broker   futures generally have highest liquidity for the next expiration quarterly expiration on well known standard dates but i believe they 're defined for more years out than forwards    at one fx desk i 've knowledge of they had 6 years worth of quarterly expirations in their system at any one time   futures are generally known by a ticker composed of a globex or cme code for the currency with another code representing the expiration   for example is nok for norwegian h for march and 6 for the nearest future date 's year that ends in 6 i.e. 2016    note that you 'll be legally liable to deliver the contracted size of if you hold through expiration   so the common trade is to hold the future and net out just before expiration when the price more accurately reflects the current spot market

it looks like with the sale of your current home you have enough liquidity to obtain credit on the best terms without tapping your wife 's ira the biggest factor to consider is the deduction on mortgage interest which reduces the effective interest on your mortgage significantly particularly as you jump into a higher tax bracket along these lines deferred retirement savings should have a higher priority than paying down the mortgage or your student loans student loans should probably be your biggest priority to pay down with the mortgage deduction a 4 rate becomes effectively a 3.4 rate if you are in the 15 bracket but as low as 2.6 effective rate if you are in the 35 bracket both of these are lower than the 3.5 rate that you can get on the student loans after refinancing   this also assumes you are n't hit with the amt this is probably worth the cost of a quick consultation with a tax professional to go over these options and how they affect your taxes

the point of an rrsp is that you can put money in when you are paying a lot of taxes maybe a 50 marginal rate and take it out later when you are paying less taxes maybe a 30 marginal rate you will thus end up with more money since you are not paying high taxes on your modest income this aspect of an rrsp does n't really apply to you when the time comes that you start withdrawing from your rrsp you will pay taxes on the entire withdrawal both principal and interest a tfsa on the other hand allows withdrawals typically limited to some small number a year without the principal or the interest being considered taxable income that seems like a better approach for you however they are not very liquid you ca n't deposit withdraw deposit withdraw week after week look around for not exactly banks that offer higher interest rates than the banks do set up a tfsa with one and put about 8k in it if you have time to investigate gics etfs and whatnot fine investigate that for a while and set up a tfsa that holds those put the other 2k in a high interest savings account from that institution high interest will be between 1 and 2 which is n't very high but oh well assuming you get some notice when you need to replace your car you could withdraw from the tfsa to get that money or you might be lucky and need a car at a terrible time for dealers to sell cars and get a great deal on a new car with a long warranty something you could keep for another 15 or 20 years if you could afford the loan payment then your savings could stick around for a day

you 're talking about modern portfolio theory the wiki article goes into the math here 's the gist modern portfolio theory mpt is a theory of finance that attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets at the most basic level you either a pick a level of risk standard deviation of your whole portfolio that you 're ok with and find the maximum return you can achieve while not exceeding your risk level or b pick a level of expected return that you want and minimize risk again the standard deviation of your portfolio you do n't maximize both moments at once the techniques behind actually solving them in all but the most trivial cases portfolios of two or three assets are trivial cases are basically programming because to be realistic you might have a portfolio that a does n't allow short sales for all instruments and/or b has some securities that ca n't be held in fractional amounts like etf 's or bonds then there is n't a closed form solution and you need computational techniques like mixed integer programming plenty of firms and people use these techniques even in their most basic form also your terms are a bit strange it has correlation table for i and j running from 1 to n this is usually called the covariance matrix i want to maximize 2 variables namely the expected return and the additive inverse of the standard deviation of the mixed investments like i said above you do n't maximize two moments return and inverse of risk i realize that you 're trying to minimize risk by maximizing negative risk so to speak but since risk and return are inherently a tradeoff you ca n't achieve the best of both worlds maybe i should point out that although the above sounds nice and theoretically it 's sound as one of the comments points out it 's harder to apply in practice for example it 's easy to calculate a covariance matrix between the returns of two or more assets but in the simplest case of modern portfolio theory the assumption is that those do n't change over your time horizon also coming up with a realistic measure of your level of risk can be tricky for example you may be ok with a standard deviation of 20 in the positive direction but only be ok with a standard deviation of 5 in the negative direction basically in your head the distribution of returns you want probably has negative   because on the whole you want more positive returns than negative returns like i said this can get complicated because then you start minimizing other forms of risk like value at risk for example and then modern portfolio theory does n't necessarily give you closed form solutions anymore any actively managed fund that applies this in practice since obviously a completely passive fund will just replicate the index and not try to minimize risk or anything like that will probably be using something like the above or at least something that 's more complicated than the basic undergrad portfolio optimization that i talked about above we 'll quickly get beyond what i know at this rate so maybe i should stop there

none of your options or strategies are ideal have you considered looking at the stock chart and making a decision is the price currently up trending or is it down trending or is it going sideways as knuckle mentions you could just set a limit price order and if it does not hit by friday you can just sell at whatever price on friday however this could be very damaging if the price is currently down trending it may fall considerably by friday i think a better strategy would be to place a trailing stop loss order say 5 from the current price if the stock starts heading south you will be stopped out approximately 5 below the current price however if the price goes up your trailing stop order will move up as well always trailing 5 below the highest price reached if the trailing stop has not been hit by friday afternoon you can sell at the current price this way you will be protected on the downside only approx 5 below current price and can potentially benefit from any short term upside

one of the biggest laws in economics is that if an opportunity is very profitable and is very easily even by complete beginners then it will very soon stop being profitable that 's how the market works if you buy stock when it is at the lowest then you are making money but most of the time someone else is losing money and if there was a magic hour of the day when buying would be the most profitable then soon everybody would want to buy at that time and no one would want to sell anything so the scheme would collapse

you should look at the opportunity cost for your money i.e. what kind of return it could generate otherwise   we took advantage of these types of offer zero interest for x months in the past with the goal to redirect the money to the mortgage it was 7.5 back then and we made sure we do n't get hosed by the surprisingly high interest rate by having a big reminder in the bulletin board in the kitchen to make sure we pay off the money before the interest rate kicks in   so we basically reduced our interest on the mortgage during that period   oh we use an all in one account one so that was real nice i would stay away from those interest deferred offers it 's totally not worth it

yes you are trickling down only works when there are enough jobs all those that are being displaced by graduates or pa 's will try to find a new job   but the economy is n't very good so career options are limited and the chance of improving your career are slim   so these receptionists apply to cleaning positions or mcdonald   cleaning companies might think hey here is someone who has proven to be reliable and being able to communicate with clients they hire the receptionists where do the cleaners go not enough jobs = not enough jobs when you have a comfortable middle class career switching might be an option but for the working class it is almost impossible in a bad economy

i 'd pile up as much cash as you can in a savings account you will need money for the move even if it 's just gas money and it 's going to be hard to predict where house prices are going so you might or might not be underwater when it comes time to sell the house or you might be so deep underwater by then that the extra money does n't make much of a difference anymore anyway once you 're actually in the process of selling the house you can figure out if you can or need to use the savings to cover the shortfall closing costs or if you just built up a little wealth during the time you put the money aside

certainly yes a zero coupon bond can go down in price if interest rates rise before your bond matures the price of the bond will go down and the longer to maturity the more it will tend to drop   depending on when you bought and how much interest rates rise you can incur a capital loss the bond is guaranteed to be worth a certain amount at maturity as long as the issuer has n't defaulted but before maturity the market price of the bond will fluctuate primarily based on interest rate movements   in fact zero coupon bonds are even more interest rate sensitive than regular bonds which have periodic coupon interest payments

economically you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes they are largely separate markets   only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is sticky for example once you buy a house prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment in both markets there is a supply and demand curve but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals the market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house   most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market   this describes a supply demand graph with a very steep demand curve   additionally because of the leverage provided by mortgages the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans   thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change on the other hand apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parent 's easily move into apartments if prices change   a small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded   this is the situation where the demand curve is shallow   in addition rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions in a recession people avoid buying but renters continue to rent

yes it is possible as long as the broker you use allows conditional orders i use cmc markets in australia and they allow free conditional orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock see the place new order box below   once you have selected a stock to buy the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders the first condition is a place order if conditional order here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first   say the stock last traded at $ and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at $ 10.00 so you would place order if price is at or above $ 10.00 so if the next day the price moves up to $ 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market the second condition is a stop loss conditional order here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price it will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded so if you wanted to place your stop loss at $ 9.00 you would type in 9.00 in the box after if at or below and select if you want a limit or market order the third condition is a take profit conditional order this allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price say you wanted to take profits at 50 that is if the price reached $ 15.00 so you would type in 15.00 in the box after if at or above and again select if you want a limit or market order these conditional orders can all be placed at the time you enter your buy order and can be edited or deleted at any time the broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional orders and some brokers may have many more conditional orders than these three so investigate what is out there and if you are confused in how to use the orders with your broker simply ask them for a demonstration in how to use them

nobody can predict the affects of brexit but it is wise to consider them we saw the pound weaken after the vote to leave and it is possible the pound will weaken further after brexit and this devaluation could be quite dramatic if that happens it is likely to increase inflation uk inflation has gone from under 1 around the time of the referendum to 3 today and it could well go higher if inflation continues to increase the bank of england is likely to put up interest rates as it has historically done this to hedge against inflation   we have been living in a world of artificially low interest rates since the global crash of 2008 as the boe has tried to stimulate recovery with lower rates   the rates can not continue at this level if inflation starts to rise that in turn will put up mortgage rates   so for example if you have a £ 100k mortgage at currently this is a reasonable rate to have your repayments will be £ 523 a month   if your mortgage rate goes up to say 7 then your repayments are £ a month if it goes up to 10 then it 's £ a month and so on there is a mortgage calculator you can use to try playing with different amounts here my advice would therefore be try to get as small a mortgage as you can and make sure you can afford it quite comfortably in case rates go up and you need to find a few hundred pounds a month extra there are other risks from brexit as well house prices could fall as people decide not to buy properties due to excessive interest rates overall nobody knows what will happen but it is good to be planning ahead for all i am not a financial advisor this advice is given in good faith but with no financial qualification

hi alex   i 've been alerted you 're seeking a better answer to this question   please accept my apologies for not coming back to this question sooner it got buried   no in general you can not make an early withdrawal penalty free from a 403(b account to use towards the purchase of a home withdrawals before age 59 1/2 are generally subject to the 10 early withdrawal penalty on top of ordinary income tax some 403(b plans may allow for a loan but the availability and conditions vary by plan if you 'd consider a loan you should check with your plan administrator or your plan 's summary plan description often available at one 's company intranet or hr web site   i do contract work for an hr consulting firm that assists others in building such sites and are usually something made available for download in a retirement or wealth section of such web sites note that a loan from a 403(b would need to be paid back into the plan over some period of time e.g. 5 years though i have come across examples of some plans that do permit a longer pay back period of 10 15 even 30 years if the loan is used for a home purchase   but consider this article the 403(b loan the new debtors prison finally to your last point   yes if you have an ira there are rules permitting withdrawal of up to $ 10,000 penalty free for use towards the purchase of a first home   see page 53 in irs publication 590   there 's also a good article at all about iras for first time home buyers such a withdrawal from a traditional ira remains subject to ordinary income tax   if have a roth ira you can withdraw free of income tax but you need to pay attention to the roth ira 5 year rule additional resources

not sure why this has n't received any answers yet the link to the investopedia page you posted explains it pretty well however when you hear about a golden cross in the media it is most likely a reference to the sma crossing above the sma   in general a golden cross consists of a short term ma that was previously below a long term ma crossing above that lt ma however the most common reference will imply a day cross because this is considered as a stronger signal compared to shorter mas with that said it 's important to realize that the golden cross is just one of many technical analysis signals and the entire field of technical analysis is considered controversial to say the least   many studies such as those examined in a random walk down wall street have found that after transactions costs are considered e.g. the commissions you pay to your broker on every trade charting is a losing proposition in the end

you mentioned you have a bunch of credit cards with no balance while others have fairly high balances i would not recommend you to close the 0 balance credit cards if they have lower apr you can transfer the balance to those cards with lower apr now if those 0 balance cards do not have lower apr closing them will reduce my overall balance and hurt my credit rating and that is true assume that you mean overall credit line instead of overall balance but to my understanding if you keep the payments good and on time that effect is only temporary and therefore you can definitely close them   do n't forget paying off your balance can also lower your utilization rate and therefore increase your credit ratings and you can focus more on that instead also larger number of accounts with amounts owed can indicate higher risk of over extension therefore you should pay off your low balance accounts first and do not open new credit accounts until you have paid off the current balance

a stock insurance company is structured like a normal company it has shareholders that are the company 's investors who elect a board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company the directors and thus the executives and employees have a legal responsibility to manage the company in a way which is beneficial for the shareholders since the shareholders are the ultimate owner of the company a mutual insurance company is similar except that the people holding policies are also the shareholders that is the policyholders are the ultimate owners of the company and there generally are n't separate shareholders who are just investing in the company these shareholders elect the board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company in practice it probably does n't really make a whole lot of difference since even if you 're just a customer and not an owner of the company the company is still going to want to attract customers and act in a reasonable way toward them also insurance companies are generally pretty heavily regulated in terms of what they can do because governments really like them to remain solvent it may be comforting to know that in a mutual insurance company the higher ups are explicitly supposed to be working in your best interest though rather than in the interest of some random investors some might object that being a shareholder may not give you a whole lot more rights than you had before see for example this article from the boston globe at mutual insurance firms big money for insiders but no say for policyholders it has grown into something else entirely an opaque poorly understood and often immensely profitable world in which some executives and insiders operate with minimal scrutiny and no coincidence often reap maximum personal rewards policyholders despite their status as owners have no meaningful oversight of how mutual companies spend their money whether to lower rates pay dividends or fund executive salaries and perks and few avenues to challenge such decisions another reason that one might not like the conversion is the specific details of how the current investor shareholders are being paid back for their investment in the process of the conversion to mutual ownership and what that might do to the funds on hand that are supposed to be there to keep the firm solvent for the policyholders from another boston globe article on the conversion of sbli to a mutual company insurer sbli wants to get banks out of its business professor robert wright is cautiously optimistic but wants to ensure the prior shareholders are n't overpaid robert wright a professor in south dakota who has studied insurance companies and owns an sbli policy said he would prefer the insurer to be a mutual company that does n’t have to worry about the short term needs of shareholders but he wants to ensure that sbli does n’t overpay the banks for their shares it ’s fine as long as it ’s a fair price he said that article also gives sbli 's president 's statement as to why they think it 's a good thing for policyholders if the banks remained shareholders they would be likely to demand a greater share of the profits and eat into the dividends the insurance company currently pays to the policyholders about half of whom live in massachusetts said jim morgan president of based sbli we ’re trying to protect the policyholders from having the dividends diluted morgan said i 'm not sure there 's an obvious pros cons list for either way but i 'd think that i 'd prefer the mutual approach just on the principle that the policyholders ought to be the owners because the directors and thus the executives and employees are then legally required to manage the company in the best interest of the policyholders i did cast a yes vote in my proxy on whether sbli ought to become a mutual company i 'm a sbli term life but policy terms are n't changing and it 'd be hard to tell for sure how it 'd impact any dividends i assume the whole life policies must be the ones to pay dividends or company solvency either way since it 's not like we 'll get to run a scientific experiment trying it out both ways i doubt you 'd have a lot of regrets either way whether it becomes a mutual company and you wish it had n't or it does n't become one and you wish it had

if you were asking if you should buy silver for an emergency fund i 'd say no but you already have it   note i wrote most of the below under the assumption that this is silver bullion coins bars it did n't occur to me till the end that it could be jewelry   both of you have good arguments for your points of view breaking it down her points 1 a very good point and while she may not be irresponsible maybe the of it is good for her psychology it 's her 's so her comfort is important here 2 good make sure it 's explicitly listed on the policy 3 bad i think it will as well at least the long run but this is not a good reason for an emergency fund the whole point of which is to be stable in case of emergencies 4 good identity theft is a concern though unless her info is already out there it 's insufficient for the emergency fund and besides she could keep cash your points 1 iffy on the one hand you 're right on the other hand cyprus it is good to remember that money in accounts is in someone else 's control not yours as the found out to their and of course it ca n't happen here but that 's what they thought too there is value in having some hard assets physically in your control think of it as an emergency emergency fund cash works too but precious metals are better for these mega upheaval scenarios again find out how having such an emergency fund would make her feel does having that give her some comfort a gift from a family member of this much silver leads me to assume that her family might have a little bit of a culture if so then even if she is not a herself she may derive some comfort from having it just in case it 'll be baked into her background definitely a topic to discuss with her 2 excellent point this is precisely why you want your emergency fund in some form of cash 3 bad you can walk into any pawn shop and sell it in a heartbeat or you can send it in to a company and have cash in days 4 bad if you know a savings account that pays please please please tell me where it is so i can get one fact is all cash instruments pay negligible interest now and all such savings are being eroded by inflation 5 maybe there is value to looking at your net worth this way but my experience has been that those that do take it way too far i think there 's more value at looking at allocation within a few broad buckets emergency fund savings car house college etc and retirement fund if this is to be an emergency fund as per point 1 then you should look at it as its own bucket and maybe add a little cash too       another thought to add this is a gift from a family member they gave her a lot of silver of course it 's your so 's now and she can do whatever she wants with it but how would the family member react if she did liquidate it if that family member is a and gave her this with the emotional desire to see her they may be upset if she sold it it just occurred to me this may be jewelry your so may not have sentimental attachment to it but what about the family member 's sentiments they may not like to see family silver they loving maintained and passed on casually discarded for mere cash by your so another thing to discuss with her       wrap up generally you are right about not keeping a 6 month emergency fund in silver but there are other factors to consider here there 's also the fact that it 's already bought the cost of buying paying over market has already been taken   edit so it 's ah so it 's well scratch everything except how the family member feels about which now looms large   this does n't have much value as an emergency fund nor really as an investment if you did keep it as an investment think of it as an investment in collectibles art less so in precious metals if no one will get upset i 'd say pick out the set to keep for special occasions and sell the rest find out first if it has collectible or historical value it may be worth far more than the pure weight in silver ebay might be the way to go to sell it

well that 's the whole point of this issue and why there 's a debate    and concerning the analogy whether retail and manufacturing can be the same entity or not and whether as a retailer you can push only your own brands is also up for debate   it 's called regulation it 's meant to prevent monopolies and cartels from forming among other things we 've seen this happen elsewhere too transportation electricity water healthcare etc businesses do not have the right to do whatever they want    i also think what has not been is that internet provision is effectively a cartel in the us with different isps holding monopolies in different parts of the country which has been allowed to continue    anyways i 'm not in the us so i 'm not affected by this where i live has confirmed net neutrality and anti monopoly legislation is important and anyways there 's isp competition so this bullshit can not be applied unless they work together but i think if this goes through the us internet will end up even more like the us cable industry to the detriment of users i 'm also worried about the knock on effects this will have with the rest of the world

two different takes on an answer the net loss concept you mentioned and a core business concept if a store is actually a net loss and anybody is willing to buy it it may well make sense to sell it   depending on your capital value invested and how much it would take you to make it profitable it may be a sound business decision to sell the asset   the buyer of the asset is of course expecting for some reason to make it not a net loss for them perhaps they have other stores in the vicinity and can then share staff or stock somehow the core business is a concept   investors seem to go in cycles like can like well diversified companies that are resilient to a market downturn in one sector but then they also like so called pure play companies where you are clear on what you are owning   to try an example which is likely not the case here lets say that in 5 of its stores had migrated away from a gas station model to a one stop gas and repairs model therefore they had to have service parts and trained staff at those locations   these things are expensive and could be seen as not their area of expertise selling gas so as an investor if i want to own gas stations i do n't want to own a full service garage so perhaps i invest in somebody else once they sell off their non core assets they free up capital to do what they know best it is at least one possible explanation

there are many technical answers above but the short story to me is that very few active fund managers consistently beat the market look at the results of actively managed funds depending on whose analysis you read you will find out that somewhere between 80 90 of fund managers in a given year do not beat passive index funds so go figure how you will do compared to a mutual fund manager who has way more experience than you likely have so that in itself is moderately interesting but if you look at same manager performance over several consecutive years it is rare to find anyone that goes beats the market for more than a few years in a row there are exceptions but go pick one of these guys good luck getting in and out of the market is a loser this is because there is no way to see market spikes and down turns there are many behavioral studies that have been done that show people do the wrong thing they sell after losses have occurred and they buy after the market has gone up missing an up spike and not being in before the spike is as devastating as missing a down turn and not getting out in time there is another down side if you are trading in a personal account rather than a tax deferred account going in and out of stocks has tax complications in short a broad based equity index will over time beat about anything out there and it will do it in a tax efficient manner   exchange traded funds etfs are a wonderful way to obtain diversification immediately at very low cost

one thing i would add to @littleadv buy an etf instead of doing your own answer would be ensure that the dividend yield matches   expense ratios are n't the only thing that eat you with mutual funds the managers can hold on to a large percentage of the dividends that the stocks normally pay for instance if by holding onto the same stocks you would normally receive 3 a year in dividends but by having a mutual fund you only receive .75 that 's an additional cost to you   if you tried to match the djia on your own you would have an advantage of receiving the dividend yields on the stocks paying dividends   the downsides distributing your investments to match and the costs of actual purchases

in a sole proprietorship and an llc the expenses can still be deducted against the profits or losses from the operations the irs does not even require that a profit seeking activity be incorporated under its own entity hence why this is also applicable in a sole proprietorship from what you 've said there is no reason to use a more complicated and costly corporate structure at all in comparison a sole proprietorship and single member llc will be completely pass through entities to the irs and all of their earnings go to you with the llc you have the option of letting the llc 's earnings remain with the entity itself or you can just treat it as your own and pay individual income taxes on it this has nothing to do specifically with a gambling business and is largely a red herring to your profit seeking motives gambling in casino games and lotteries already enjoy favorable tax treatment in some regards gambling in capital markets also enjoy a myriad of favorable tax laws a business entity related to this purpose should be able to deduct costs related to this trade and pass an audit more convincingly than not having formed an llc and business bank account

you 're not being over taxed the withholding is just aggressive   employer 's do n't know your whole tax situation all they can go on is the amount they pay you minus deductions then extrapolate that to an annual number and withhold according to your w4 you could ratchet up your w4 exemptions and this will help your current withholding   when you do your taxes next april this will all shake out and you will likely receive a large refund    it 's also worth noting that your federal withholding given the numbers above is just about 19 not 27 which does match the federal tax table if your annual income was $ 72,000 as your semi monthly paycheck indicates   that should be closer to 14 at an annual income of $ 36,000   the medicare related taxes are flat amounts   so really you 're talking about an approximately 5 discrepancy on the $ 18,000 you 'll earn during this internship or about $ 900 if you feel like you 're being welcome to paying taxes

gt that is in large part do to insane healthcare costs passed on to the consumers by the aca healthcare spending has increased on average 1.5 annually since 2009 where as the highest growth in spending from 1991 until 2006 was 1.3   health care costs have actually been on the rise for decades now it was only noticed by the majority party i.e. the gop who had held the majority for 16 of the years prior to 2009 when the aca was enacted suddenly health care costs started to explode the truth is that health care costs have been on a steady rise in the time period from 1972 to 1982 costs rose on average 14 per causes of rising healthcare keep in mind this was prior to the expansion of medicare from 1983 1992 costs grew at a rate of 9 per year 3 times faster than inflation from 1993 to 2010 cost rose at a rate of 6.4 per year the aca of course was passed in 2009 but did n't start to take effect until 2011 since 2010 health care costs has risen about 4 per year that is a 2 drop in a short amount of time compared to the previous years however the numbers are already so big just like the national debt that the gop who had as much part to play in the health care costs as they did in the debt had tons of numbers they could use to make it seem like health care costs have exploded    in reality what happened is that people who never had health insurance before were forced to get it and started to realize how expensive it is when it actually covers what it was intended to cover preventative care as well as emergent care the gop has been on a steady march to undermine the new law as much as possible since it passed because it made some of their biggest donors and health care insurance providers uncomfortable the fact that they had to share their cost information and that the health care exchange required them to do a line item by line item comparison with other companies out there    so here we are the aca is going to be cut and millions of people are going back to be uninsured or what you are going to see is the rate of costs growth start to increase again after decades of slowly decreasing rates why because of the renewed ability of insurance providers to hide the costs to hide costs increases it will also cause hospitals to greatly overcharge the uninsured as they were doing before but there will be many more of them the goal being that the uninsured are unlikely to pay for the very large medical bills so knowing this hospitals artificially inflate the bill in the hopes of getting a larger portion of that unpaid bill liquidated through medicare    uninsured populations also lead to more unhealthy people you would think that not having health insurance would make people want to remain more healthy however studies show the opposite to be articles business in actuality people stress more about their health and avoid periodic checkups both of which lead to bad health results    trying to blame the cost increases in health care on government meddling or say it is a problem brought on by the aca is weird since there are so many examples of government sites s healthcare ranked dead last compared health care programs out there which are so much more efficient less costly and have resulted in much healthier populations    gt i do nt have health insurance and an er visit with costs me less out of pocket than 90 of the country why is that    i am going to call bs number one that is a huge claim to make without supporting evidence number two you would have to demonstrate how much that same visit would cost to those with health insurance    gt do you think it has to do with the fact that with the aca hospitals know they are getting paid with 0 questioning on pricing so charge whatever they want and with me they think shit this guy might not ever pay us lets just give him a decent price and get some money from him because all we can do is send his bill to collections    actually no the exact opposite they now because you are uninsured that you are unlikely to pay so they overcharge you for the same services because they know that they will only be reimbursed a percentage of the costs if it goes to medicare for non payment    gt the swiss do everything better   you keep referring back to switzerland do n't get me wrong they are a very good country and have the number 2 ranked health care system in the world however i do n't think they are the low tax haven that you think they are they have an average corporate tax rate of wiki whereas the us has it at 32 their highest income tax bracket is whereas the us is at 39 their sales tax goes at high as 8 where ours go as high as 11 their average effective rate is around 11 while ours is around 18 including social security puts switzerland at 17 and the us at 24    so they are definitely a lower tax rate country but in no way are they a no tax rate country then again switzerland has no military to speak of while the us spends more on military then the next 7 countries put together    gt this is the dumbest statement you ve made this entire time    i have been very patient i have stuck with this conversation in spite of the put downs and remarks i have a little too but you can go back to most of my remarks and see that i have been more i have given you some leeway because of your age and i am almost twice as old as you    so you gave me your background i will give you mine i am closer to 50 then i would prefer i left the house at 17 enlisted in the navy and spent the next 15 years serving in the military i ended my career in a select community i have been out for ten years this july i am now owner of a company that does r&amp;d and works with the government a lot of my knowledge about inventions and how commercial works with government comes from my own personal experiences i have seen the best and worst of government as well as seen the same on the commercial side of the house anyone comes to this game with the that government ca n't get anything done as well as commercial quickly learns that is not true anyone comes thinking that commercial equals efficient learns that is not always true too    gt take apple for instance where is all the government funding they recieved to be one of the most innovative companies in human history or microsoft   as i said previously that you thought was a dumb comment commercial is very good at taking existing systems and finding ways to make them efficient and better apple and microsoft is the same they both made their mark in history by expanding on and creating innovation with existing technologies that had their foundation in government r&amp;d projects including the digital wiki as well as computers like the and the issues and the advancements into tech ibm invent the personal computer answer which lead to the first efficient and cost effective personal computers the touchscreen was actually first invented in by engineers at wiki and of course we know that the internet started as a government funded project called news ask history who invented the internet    i think you would be surprised how much many if not most of the things we take for granted today have a foundation in government funded r&amp;d. my company is a commercial company and we do a great job creating our own products and innovation and yet still our best selling product is a design of a national laboratory that we license from them commercial industry is great at manufacturing and producing something the government is not as good at and so often they will license out designs for production to companies like ours some of the biggest commercial companies out there do the same

looked at the model quickly the most likely reason is you calculated a fcf lower than the market you have fcf decreasing due to shrinking margins over the model period your terminal value then has the fcf growing by 2.3 into perpetuity so that does n't really coincide i mean it could but i would n't use it i personally think the shrinking margin assumption going forward is a little much    for your terminal value calc do n't you want that to be the final model year cash flow times 1 plus the terminal growth rate     also i find it interesting that the risk free rate is the terminal growth rate any particular reasoning behind that   it works now at the 2.3 but probably would n't in a different interest rate environment

the question do they is a fair one but the answer we can only observe the past and that 's what they did may not be so satisfying to you   it 's safe to say that any longer term view of any market will show far less volatility than a short one it only takes a glance at the return of the 2000 's   2009    2008   2007         2006   2005      2004    2003     2002       2001 2000      for the s&p to see that in an awful decade containing and that the full decade was only down 9 in total or just less than 1 per year compounded i 'm not predicting any particular returns forward just noting this is how the math works   dca performs well through such a decade better than in a rising one you are offered the opportunity to buy into a market selling below the long term trend   added note in response to 's answer below on the linked article i see where the author cites who clearly made a logical error he concludes that since a 20 month s&p put costs triple what a 2.3 mo put costs that there 's more risk the market falls over the longer period not less american options can be sold or exercised at any time if a 2 year option were cheaper than a 2 month option no one would buy the shorter term it 's pretty simple that the options pricing models take time into account and their value put or call increases along with the time till expiration   on a lighter note when i take the s&p data for 1871 2012 i know no s&p back then but it 's schiller 's data i get average 40 year returns of similar to the author 's conclusion $ 1 k growing to $ but the standard deviation is 28 so the high end of + 1 is $ 72 k not the author 's $ although the low end 44 comes close to his $ 14 k figure $ 16 k is a long term return which today does n't look bad when the article was written the author was looking at a 6 short term risk free rate

the reason is that although the american economy is functioning normally mortgage rates are stupid low and are below a prudent expectation of long term 30 year rates of return in the market    i manage endowments so i say prudent in the context of endowment investment which is the picture of caution and subject to law the p being prudent     what 's more there are tax benefits   yes you pay 15 long term capital gains tax on investment income   but your mortgage interest is tax deductible at your tax bracket rate of 25 28 or 33 this being the tax you would pay on your next dollar of earned income   and in the early years of a mortgage mortgage payments are nearly 100 interest   so even if it 's a wash you gain $ 10k in the market but pay $ 10k in mortgage interest you pay $ 1500 tax on the gains but the interest deduction tax by $ 2800 so you are still $ 1300 ahead    tldr the government pays us to do this

a flat tax rate is terrible economically but also morally on the one hand it seems morally right to me that the rich should contribute to a larger share of government spending    but that aside economically it makes sense for wealthier people to be taxed more as they are far to save any spare money at the end of the month which by definition if they are rich should be plenty with a flat rate poorer people meanwhile are far to spend any extra income either out of necessity and or perhaps as investments that they have been putting off even small luxuries can now be fitted into the budget like meals in a restaurant or strong comfortable shoes       my point is that this very consumption creates a demand becomes vital to maintaining more demand and have you heard how demand that needs supply creates it 's own demand i know it 's crazy but it 's an actual concept called say 's news economics brief our series looks reasoning made jean say

pump and dump strategy is happening everywhere less so in developed market i can tell an experience from emerging market perspective usually several securities brokers work together to pump several penny stocks 5 7 stocks they together and searching for several investors who have money and willing to participate in this scheme these investors will then agree to invest usually with margin from securities to start pumping the stocks the stocks will be pumped until several research analysts take interest in it once the news were spread out regarding these highly speculative stocks the investors gradually dumps the stocks with help of their brokers the things that you need to keep an eye for low trading volume in the previous 3 6 months relative to their peers low p e ratio with earning growth no positive catalyst or material news regarding the company stocks have high momentum observe on weekly rather daily returns pump and dump usually last between 3 months to 6 months

you can hedge your house price from losing value if you believe that the housing market is correlated with major stock indices speak with a commodities broker because they will be able to help you buy puts on stock indices which if correlated with housing prices will offer somewhat of a hedge example house prices drop 30 because of weak economy stocks will generally drop around that same amount 30 if you have enough exposure to in the puts compared to your house value you will be protected you can also buy calls in 30 year bonds for interest rate lock if you are not on a fixed interest rate many investors like warren buffet and carl icahn have been protecting them selves from a potential market downward turn speak to a local commodity broker to get some detailed advice not etrade or any discount brokers they wo n't be able to help you specialize your trades look for a full time commodity broker house

yes this is a huge security loophole and many banks will do nothing to refund if you are scammed   for example for business accounts some wells fargo branches say you must notify within 24 hours of any check withdrawal or the loss is yours   basically banks do n't care they are a monopoly system and you are stuck with them   when the losses and complaints get too great they will eventually implement the european system of electronic transfers but the banks do n't want to be bothered with that expense yet    sure you can use paypal another overpriced monopoly or much better try dwolla or bitcoin

you should also examine gross costs the us per capita is paying twice what canada does and is getting worse results lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality not exactly a bargain   a significant part of the rate of increase in costs is likely due to the shifting demographics bulge of baby boomers aging if you look at these topics you 'll see that there 's a a lot more folks in their 50 's than before and nearly one third of lifetime expenditures is incurred during middle age and nearly half during the senior articles   in the report you linked the medical trend reported includes the increases in both price inflation and utilization for 2009 so it 's impossible to say how much medical inflation there actual was i.e. is the cost of a flu shot rising faster slower than inflation which makes the report a bit slimy in that it compares directly against the rate of inflation

market capitalization is the equity value of a company it measures the total value of the shares available for trade in public markets if they were immediately sold at the last traded market price some people think it is a measure of a company 's net worth but it can be a misleading for a number of reasons share price will be biased toward recent earnings and the earnings per share eps metric the most recent market price only reflects the lowest price one market participant is willing to sell for and the highest price another market participant is willing to buy for though in a liquid market it does generally reflect the current consensus in an imperfect market for example with a large institutional purchase or sale prices can diverge widely from the consensus price and when multiplied by outstanding shares can show a very distorted market capitalization it is also a misleading number when comparing two companies market capitalization because while some companies raise the money they need by selling shares on the markets others might prefer debt financing from private lenders or sell bonds on the market or some other capital structure some companies sell preferred shares or non voting shares along with the traditional shares that exist all of these factors have to be considered when valuing a company large cap companies tend to have lower but more stable growth than small cap companies which are still expanding into new markets because of their smaller size

first   great job on getting it together   this is good for your family in any respect i can think of   this is a life long process and skill but it will pay off for you and yours if you work on it your problem is that you do n't seem to know where you money goes   you ca n't decide how your expenses are until you know what they are   looking at just your committed expenses and ignore the other stuff might be the problem here   you state that you feel you live modestly but you need to be able to measure it completely to decide i would suggest an online tool like mint.com if you can get it in your country because it will go back for 90 days and get transactions for you   if you primarily work in cash this is n't helpful but based on your credit card debt i am hoping not   although a cash lifestyle would be good if you tend to overspend take the time and sort your transactions into categories   do n't setup a budget just sort them out   i like to limit the number of categories for clarity sake especially to start do n't get too crazy and do n't get too detailed at first   if you buy a magazine at the grocery store just call it groceries once you know what you spend then you can setup a budget for the categories   if somethings are important create new categories   if one category is a problem then break it down and find the specific issue the key is that you budget not be more than you earn but also representative of what you spend follow up with mint every other day or every weekend so the categorization is a quick and easy process   put it on your iphone and do it at every lunch break   share the information with your spouse and talk about it often

they can go to an atm and deposit it in to their account the atm does not care to read the name and the bank does not care to verify anything if the check goes through meaning the bank it is drawn on pays so if nobody complains that 's it he has your money you would need to go to the check writer 's bank and ask for help or look at the check writer 's cancelled check copy if you get to it that bank can find out where it was deposited to and then you have to go after the guy and get your money back if it is still recoverable if it is a poor and he already blew your 5 grand you can sue his pants off but there are no 5 grand in them anywhere so bad luck for you technically the bank is not supposed to accept the check if the name does n't match at the counter that might get a question but as said above there are deposit atms and he could also just endorse the check to himself and sign the endorsement with some and claim that this is your signature how would joe the teller know either way he gets the check in his account and then he can take it out and blow it it is legally clearly theft or fraud and probably a federal crime but if the guy is bankrupt that does n't help you much depending on that bank 's fine print they might or might not cover your loss but i would n't hold my breath better do n't lose a check

figure out how much money you earn what you spend it on and how that will change when you have kids will one of you stay at home if not how much will daycare cost and how do you finance the first few month when your child is still too young for daycare you will usually plan to spend your current rent without utilities on your mortgage the that is secured by your house keep in mind though that a house usually has a higher utility cost than an appartment when you 've figured out what you can save pay towards a house now and how that will change when you have kids you can go on to the next step if you do n't want to buy now but want to commit to saving up for a house and also want to secure today 's really low interest rates consider getting a bausparvertrag   i did n't find a good translation for bausparvertrag so here is a short example of how it works you take a building saving sum of € with a savings goal of 50000 € the savings goal is usually between 20 and 50 of the sum and then you make monthly payments into the bausparvertrag until you reach the savings goal at which point you can take out your savings and a loan of 100000 € or whatever your difference between the and is if you 're living in an area you 're likely to need more than but this is just an example upsides downsides if you decide to buy sooner you can also use your bausparvertrag to refinance later if you have a decent income and a permanent job then ask your bank if they would consider financing your house now to get a sense of what you 'll be able to afford google and use a few of the many online calculators remember that these websites want to sell you on the idea of buying a house instead of paying rent so they 'll usually overestimate the raise in rents repeat the calculation with rent raise set to 0 to get a feeling for how much you 'll be able to afford in today 's money also do n't forget that you 're planning to get children so do the calculation with only one income not two and add the cost of raising the kids to your calculation once you 've decided on a property shop around a bit at different banks to get the best financing if you decide to buy now or soon start looking at houses now go to model homes to find out what style of house you like this is useful whether you want to buy an existing house or build a new one if buying an existing house is an option for you start visiting houses that are on sale in your area in order to practice what to ask and what to look for you should have a couple of visits under your belt before you really start looking for the one you want to buy once you 're getting closer to buying or making a contract with a construction company consider getting an expert when buying an existing house they can help you estimate the price and also estimate the renovation cost you 'll have to factor in for a certain house new heating better insulation when building a new house they can advise you on the contract with the construction company and also examine the construction company 's work at each major step source own experience

well i 'm not going to advise whether it 's a good idea to invest in this company though often otc is pretty scary but it does have a product an ad blocker it did post financials and it 's trading on the otc qb which is better than the pink sheets so you need to look these over and study up on the product to decide if it is overpriced or not   what might have occurred the patriot farm becoming is that the latter bought up the stock of the former this is i believe called using a shell which is not necessarily a bad thing and is using this as a way to be registered i.e. sell to non accredited investors via the otc market   so i 'm really just answering your third question   yes you have to do a lot of due diligence to see if buying this stock is a good deal or not   it might be the next big thing   or it might not it certainly is the case that low trading volume allows a relatively small trade to really change the stock price so the penny stocks do tend to be easier to inflate side comment   the bid ask spreads are pretty big with a best bid of 0.35 and best ask of

first off some companies do something like this   microsoft for example was well known for consistently hitting earnings estimates every quarter nearly never missed them and most of the time did n't exceed by much either   in order to do this and not be prosecuted for accounting fraud you typically have to be a service or good company like microsoft used to be where you can manipulate the amount of product on hand and move costs fairly easily from one quarter to the next   a company like say home depot or caterpillar both of which have tangible goods they 're either or producing has less flexibility there although they will still try to move profits around to match earnings estimates more closely however you have to be consistently doing well to be able to do this   you ca n't manufacture additional total revenue so if you have one down quarter you have to either have moved some revenue into it from the previous quarter or you have to be able to move some into it from the next quarter   that obviously does n't work consistently unless you 're a fast growing company or have an extremely stable base   it 's also hard to do this in a legal seeming fashion technically this sort of manipulation is illegal so decisions have to be justifiable   companies like microsoft that are expanding can also do things to encourage slightly lower expectations   a company in need of a stock price bump issues press releases touting its inventions and products as amazing things that will drive profits through the roof and an aggressive profit forecast just as easy to issue a press release with a conservative forecast meaning the bar will be lower to hit    it 's also not really necessary to manipulate earnings to have a consistently well performing stock   this article for example shows that companies who miss earnings estimates do n't really suffer much when controlling for their actual earnings changes of course in the long run   your price might drop a bit but if your company is otherwise sound it will recover finally companies do sometimes come out with information ahead of earnings that cause expectations to be lowered   for example just lowered its earnings expectations due to various reasons   some companies choose to do this in order to dilute the effect on the market   i 'm not sure if this is ever required but it seems to me that some companies are much quicker to restate earnings expectations than others

with your windfall you 've been given a second chance you 've become debt free again and get to start over here is what i would recommend from this point on decide that you want to remain debt free it sounds like you 've already done this since you are asking this question commit to never borrowing money again it sounds overly simplistic but if you stop using your credit cards to spend money you do n't have and you do n't take out any loans you wo n't be in debt   learn to budget here is what is going to make being debt free possible at the beginning of each month you are going to write down your income for the month then write down your expenses for the month make sure you include everything you 'll have fixed monthly expenses like rent and variable monthly expenses like electricity and phone you 'll also have ongoing expenses like food transportation and entertainment you 'll have some expenses like tuition which does n't come up every month but is predictable and needs to be paid for these you 'll can set aside part of the money for the expense each month and when the bill comes you 'll have the funds to pay it ready to go using budgeting software such as ynab which i recommend will make this whole process much easier you are allowed to change your plan if you need to at any time but do not allow yourself to spend any money that is not in the plan   take action to address any issues that become apparent from your budget as you do your budget you will probably struggle at first you will find that you do n't have enough income to cover your expenses fortunately you are now armed with data to be able to tackle this problem there are two causes either your expenses are too high or your income is too low   cut your expenses if necessary before you had a written budget it was hard to know where your money went each month now that you have a budget it might be apparent that you are spending too much on food or that you are spending too much on entertainment or even that a roommate is stealing money do what you need to do to cut back the expenses that need cutting   increase your income if necessary you might find from your budget that your expenses are n't out of line you live in as cheap a place as possible you eat you do n't go out to eat etc in this case the problem is n't your spending it is your income in order to stay out of debt you 'll need to increase your income get a job i know that you said that this will slow your studies but because you are now budgeting you have an advantage you did n't have before you now know how short you are each month you can take a part time job that will earn you just enough income to remain debt free while maximizing your study time   build up a small emergency fund emergencies that you did n't plan for in your budget happen to remain debt free you should have some money set aside to cover something like this so you do n't have to borrow when it comes up the general rule of thumb is 3 to 6 months of expenses but as a college kid with low expenses and no family to take care of you wo n't need a huge fund $ 500 to $ 1000 extra in the bank to cover an unexpected emergency expense could be all it takes to keep you debt free

in gambling the house also takes a cut so the total money in the game is shrinking by 2 10 percent   so if you gain $ 100 it 's because other people lost $ 105 and you do this for dozens of plays so it up   the market owns companies who are trying to create economic value take nothing and make it something they usually succeed and this adds to the total pot and makes all players richer regardless of trades    gambling is transactional there 's a pull or a roll or a hand and when it 's over you must do new transactions to continue playing    investing parks your money indefinitely you can be 30 years in a stock and that 's one transaction and given the long time virtually all your gains will be new economic value created at no one else 's expense i.e. nobody loses   now it 's possible to trade in and out of stocks very rapidly causing them   to be transactional like gambling the extreme example is day trading   when you 're not in a stock long enough for the company to create any value paid in dividends or the market appreciating the value then yes for someone to gain someone else must lose and the house takes a cut e.g. etrade 's $ 10 trading fee in and out   in that case both players are trying to win and one just had better info on average    another case is when the market drops for instance right after brexit i dumped half my domestic stocks and bought euro index funds i gambled euro stocks would rebound better than us stocks would continue to perform   obviously others were that american stocks will still grow more than euro will rebound   who won that gamble   certainly we will all do better long term but some of us will do better er and that 's what it 's all about

in a perfect market share prices are by definition a perfect reflection of the true value of a share hence you always get $ 10 for a share that 's worth that much in reality the market is imperfect prices are somewhat of an average of all different estimates and there 's a cost of trading margin between sales and buy prices hence in a perfect market it does n't matter whether you have a stop loss order at $ 9.00 that just trades your stock worth $ 9 for cash worth the same $ 9 in an imperfect market that trade nets you less furthermore is risk a linear function of money perhaps not if you bought on margin need to lend extra and your interest rate increases with the extra credit demand

brokerage firms are required to report the number of shares being shorted   this information is reported to the exchange nyse of nasdaq and is made public   most financial sites indicate the number of shares being shorted for a particular stock   the image below from yahoo finance shows million shares of cmg were being shorted at the close of 9 28 2012   this is over 12 of the total outstanding shares of cmg   for naked short selling additional information is tracked   if the brokerage is unable to borrow shares to deliver before the settlement date of a short sale then the transaction is recorded as fails to deliver   no money or shares are exchanged since the brokerage is unable to deliver the shares that were agreed upon   a large amount of fails to deliver transactions for a stock usually indicates an excessive amount of naked shorting   when investors and brokerage firms start to aggressively short a stock they will do so without having borrowed the shares to sell   this will result in a large amount of naked short selling   when there are a large number of naked short sellers not all the sellers will be able to borrow the necessary shares before the settlement date and many fails to deliver transactions will be recorded the sec records the number of fails to deliver transactions the table below summarizes the fails to deliver transactions from 1 1 2012 through 9 14 2012 data obtained from here the ext amount column shows the total dollar value of the transactions that failed i.e. fail qty share price   the volume column is the total number of shares traded in the same time period   the volume shows the percentage of shares that failed to deliver as a percentage of the total market volume the table orders the data in descending order by the quantity of shares that were not delivered   most of the companies at the top of the list no longer exist   for many of these companies the quantity of shares that failed to deliver where many multiples of the number of shares traded during the same time period   this indicates massive naked short selling as many brokerages where unable to find shares to borrow before the settlement date more information here

it is legal   they 're probably going to give you a 1099-misc which is required of businesses for many cash payments over $ 600 in value to all sorts of counterparties   probably box 3 of 1099-misc as is typical in cash for keys situations where one is paid to early    a 1099-misc is not necessarily pure income but in this case you do have money coming in   this money is n't a return of your security deposit or a gift the payment could possibly be construed by you as a payment to make you whole but the accounting for this would be on you   this is not a typical situation for irs reporting    however if you are uncomfortable with potentially explaining to the irs how you implemented advice from strangers over the internet the safest course is to report it all as income   look at it this way you did enter into a mutual contract where you were paid consideration to release your leasehold interests in the property

i do n't get it are you saying they did commit fraud but it 's hard to pin on any one person you say there is little evidence there was fraud but that it 's too hard to prove there was fraud so what did they do if it was n't fraud this is what wikipedia says happened    gt;the subprime mortgage crisis arose from bundling american subprime and american regular mortgages into mbss which were traditionally isolated from and sold in a separate market from prime loans these bundles of mixed prime and subprime mortgages were the basis asset backed securities so the probable rate of return looked superb since subprime lenders pay higher premiums and the loans were anyway secured against real estate and so theoretically could not fail   if selling shit you know is bad but looks good to investors is n't fraud i do n't know what is    is deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain

in england currently and for most of the last fifty years the standard length of the mortgage term is 25 years a mortgage can be either a capital and interest mortgage or interest only in the former you pay off part of the original loan each month plus the interest on the amount borrowed in the latter you only pay interest each month and the original amount borrowed never reduces you pay premiums on a life insurance policy additionally which is designed to pay off the original sum borrowed at the end of the 25 years no one in england thinks that a 25 year loan has any drawbacks the main point to appreciate is that the longer the period of the loan the less you need to pay each month because you are repaying the original loan the capital over a longer period of time thus in principle a mortgage is easier to repay the longer the term is because the monthly payment is less if you have a 12 year mortgage you must pay back the original amount borrowed in half the time the capital element in your payment each month is double what it would be if repaid over 25 years i.e. if repaid over a period twice as long only if the borrower is less than 25 years away from retirement is a 25 years mortgage seen as a bad idea by the lender because obviously the lender relies on the borrower having an income sufficient to keep up the repayments there are many complicating factors an interest only mortgage where you pay back the original amount borrowed from the maturity proceeds from a life policy puts you in a situation where the original capital sum never reduces so you always pay the same each month but on a straight repayment mortgage the traditional type you pay less and less each month as time goes by for you are reducing the capital outstanding each month and because that is reducing so is the amount of interest you pay each month as this is calculated on the outstanding capital amount there are to avoid if you can for example some mortgage contracts impose penalties if the borrower repays more than the due monthly amount hence in effect the borrower faces a possibly heavy financial penalty for early repayment of the loan but not all mortgages include such a condition if house prices are on a rising trend the market value of the property will soon be worth considerably more than the amount owed on the mortgage especially where the mortgage debt is reducing every month as each repayment is made so the bank or other lender will not be worried about lending over a 25 year term because if it forecloses there should normally be no difficulty in recovering the outstanding amount from the sale proceeds if the borrower falls behind on the repayments or house prices fall he may soon get into difficulties but this could happen to anyone it is not a particular problem of a 25 year term where a default in repayment occurs the bank will often suggest the mortgage term from 25 years to 30 years in order to reduce the amount of the monthly repayment as a means of helping the borrower so longer terms than 25 years are in fact a positive solution in a case of financial difficulty   of course the longer the term the greater the amount that the borrower will pay in total but the longer the term the less he will pay each month at least on a traditional capital and interest mortgage so it is a question of balancing those two competing factors   as long as you do not have a mortgage condition that the borrower for paying off the loan more quickly it can make sense to have as long a term as possible to begin with which can be shortened by increasing the monthly repayment as fast as circumstances allow in england we used to have tax relief on mortgage payments and so in times gone by it did make sense to let the mortgage run the full 25 years in order to get maximum tax relief the rules were very complex but it tended to maximise your tax relief by paying over the longest possible period but today with no income tax relief given on mortgage payments that is no longer a consideration in this country the practical position is of course that you can never tell how long it might take you to pay off a mortgage it is a gamble as to whether your income will rise in future years and whether your job will last until your mortgage is paid off you might fall ill you might be made redundant you might be mortgage interest rates might rise it is never possible to say that you can pay off the loan in a short time   if you hope to do so the only matters that actually fall within your control are the conditions of the mortgage contract itself get a good lawyer tell him to watch out for early redemption penalties get a good financial adviser tell him to work out what you will need to pay in additional premiums on your life policy if you are considering taking an interest only mortgage try to fix your mortgage rate in the first few years for as long as possible so that in your most vulnerable period with the greatest amount owing you are insulated against unexpected interest rate fluctuations only the initial conditions can be controlled so it might be prudent to take as long a term as possible even though a prudent borrower will leave himself room to reduce that term and a prudent lender will leave room to extend it in case of unpredictable changes in the financial circumstances in england most lenders are in my experience reluctant to grant mortgages for less than 25 years that is simply a policy rightly or wrongly the borrower usually has no choice about the length of the term hence in the uk it can be difficult to find a choice of interest rates based on differing mortgage terms i am aware that the situation in the usa is rather different but if i personally were faced with the choice i would be uncomfortable about taking on a short term mortgage because of the factors i have outlined above

the short of it is that bonds are valued based on a fundamental concept of finance called the time value of money stated simply $ 100 one year from now is not the same as $ 100 now if you had $ 100 now you could use it to make more money and have more than $ 100 in a year conversely if you did n't invest it the $ 100 would not buy as much in a year as it would now and so it would lose real value therefore for these two benefits to be worth the same the money received a year from now must be more than $ 100 in the amount of what you could make with $ 100 if you had it now or at least the rate of inflation or the amount received now could be less than the amount recieved a year from now such that if you invested this lesser amount you 'd expect to have $ 100 in a year the simplest bonds simply pay their face value at maturity and are sold for less than their face value the difference being the cost to borrow the cash interest these are called zero coupon bonds and they 're around if maybe uncommon the price people will pay for these bonds is their present value and the difference between the present value and face value determines a yield a rate of return similar to the interest rate on a cd now zero coupon bonds are uncommon because they cost a lot if i buy a zero coupon bond i 'm basically tying up my money until maturity i see nothing until the full bond is paid as such i would expect the bond issuer to sell me the bond at a rate that makes it worth my while to keep the money tied up so basically the bond issuer is paying me compound interest on the loan the future value of an investment now at a given rate is given by fv = to gain $ 1 million in new cash today and pay a 5 yield over 10 years a company or municipality would have to issue $ million in bonds you see the effects of the compounding there the company is paying 5 a year on the principal each year plus 5 of each 5 already accrued adding up to an additional 12 of the principal owed as interest instead bond issuers can offer a coupon bond a coupon bond has a coupon rate which is a percentage of the face value of the bond that is paid periodically often annually sometimes semi annually or even quarterly a coupon rate helps a company in two ways first the calculation is very straightforward if you need a million dollars and are willing to pay 5 over 10 years then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ worth with a 5 coupon rate and a maturity date 10 years out a $ 100 5 coupon bond with a 10-year maturity if sold at face value would cost only $ 150 over its lifetime making the total cost of capital only 50 of the principal instead of 62 now that sounds like a bad deal if the company 's paying less then you 're getting less right well yes but you also get money sooner remember the fundamental principle here money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later you do realize a lower overall yield from this investment but you get returns from it quickly which you can turn around and reinvest to make more money as such you 're usually willing to tolerate a lower rate of return because of the faster turnaround and thus the higher present value the income yield from your table is also referred to as the flat yield it is a very crude measure a simple function of the coupon rate the current quote price and the face value r p v for the first bond in your list the flat yield is 100 = this is a very simple measure that is roughly analogous to what you would expect to make on the bond if you held it for one year collected the coupon payment and then sold the bond for the same price you 'd earn one coupon payment at the end of that year and then recoup the principal the actual present value calculation for a period of 1 year is pv = which to r = fv pv 1 plug in the values present value future value and you get exactly the same result this is crude and inaccurate because in one year the bond will be a year closer to maturity and will return one less coupon payment therefore at the same rate of return the present value of the remaining payout of the bond will only be $ which makes a lot of sense if you think about it the bond will only pay out $ 112 if you bought it a year from now so why would you pay $ 114 for it another measure not seen in the list is the simple apy quite simply it is the yield that will be realized from all cash flows from the bond all coupon payments plus the face value of the bond as if all those cash flows happened at maturity this is calculated using the future value formula fv = pv where fv is the future value the sum of the face value and all coupon payments to be made before maturity pv is present value the current purchase price r is the annual rate which we 're solving for n is the number of times interest accrues and/or is paid for an annual coupon that 's 1 and t is the number of years to maturity for the first bond in the list the simple apy is this is the effective compound interest rate you would realize if you bought the bond and then took all the returns and stuffed them in a mattress until maturity since nobody does this with investment returns it 's not very useful but it can be used to compare the yield on a zero coupon bond to the yield on a coupon bond if you treated both the same way or to compare a coupon bond to a cd or other compound interest bearing account that you planned to buy into and not touch for its lifetime the yield to maturity which is seen is the true yield percentage of the bond in time valued terms assuming you buy the bond now hold it to maturity and all coupon payments are made on time and reinvested at a similar yield this calculation is based on the simple apy but takes into account the fact that most of the coupon payments will be made prior to maturity the present value of these will be higher because they happen sooner the ytm is calculated by summing the present values of all payments based on when they 'll occur so you 'll get one $ 4 payment a year from now then another $ 4 in two years then $ 4 in 3 years and $ 104 at maturity the present value of each of those payments is calculated by flipping around the future value formula pv = the present value of the entire bond its current price is the sum of the present value of each payment = + + + you now have to solve for r which is difficult to isolate the easiest way to find the rate with a computer is to goal seek intelligently guess and check   based on the formula above i calculated a ytm of for the first bond if you bought on sept 7 2012 and thus missed the upcoming coupon payment buying today you 'd also be entitled to about 5 weeks worth of the coupon payment that is due on sept 07 2012 which is close enough to the present day that the discounted value is a rounding error putting the ytm of the bond right at this is the rate of return you 'll get off of your investment if you are able to take all the returns from it when you receive them and reinvest them at a similar rate similar to having a savings account at that rate or being able to buy fractional shares of a mutual fund giving you that rate

the key to this is budgeting without a budget you do n't know what you are spending your money on   let 's say you would like to go to a movie with a friend   can you afford it   without a budget it is difficult to answer this question   yes you have enough money in your wallet but if you do n't go to the movies you could be saving that money for a house   but you might say to yourself surely one movie with my friend wo n't prevent me from saving my $ 10k for my house   and you might be right but when you add up all the movies coffees and other discretionary spending up it very well could    at this point you might be discouraged   do i seriously need to give up every single to make this work   i do n't have that kind of willpower   luckily here is where budgeting comes to the rescue budgeting is simply a plan for your money   you have some monthly expenses that are more or less fixed your rent your utility bills etc   you have other expenses that are not exactly fixed but are still necessary groceries fuel for your car etc   you also have longer range expenses such as insurance premiums that you only pay once or twice a year but need to be accounted for   list all of these expenses and figure out how much that comes to each month   what you have left over is available to you for other things next you need to figure out how fast you want to save for this house and balance that with the other things you might want to spend money on such as entertainment   if you start from $ 0 and want to save $ 10k you could do it by saving $ 100 a month in a little over 8 years you 'll have your $ 10k   if you can increase this to $ 300 a month you 'll be there in less than 3 years now that you have a plan and everything is accounted for very little willpower is needed   you do n't need to feel guilty every time you buy coffee if the money is there in your coffee snacks budget go for it   if you 've got extra money for the month in your entertainment budget take a date to the movies   your budget allows you to spend on those things because you have a plan in place and are not in danger of spending your rent money or your home savings this can all be done on paper in excel or even by placing cash in different envelopes   however it is easier to use budgeting software such as ynab mvelopes or everydollar

the general answer to any is it worth it insurance question is no because the insurance company is making a profit on the insurance to decide if you want the insurance you need to figure out how much you can afford to pay if something happens how much they cover and how badly you want to transfer your risk to them   if you wo n't have trouble coming up with the $ 4000 deductible should you need to then do n't get this extra insurance   i did not mean to imply that insurance is always a bad idea or that insurance companies are cheating their customers please let me explain further   when you buy any product from a business that business is making a profit and there is nothing wrong with that at all they are providing a service and should be compensated for their efforts   insurance companies also provide a service but unlike other types of businesses their product is monetary you pay them money now and they might pay you money later if they pay you more money then you spent you came out ahead and if you spend more money then they give you it was a loss for you   in order for the insurance company to make a profit they need to bring in more money than they pay out in fact they need to bring in a lot more money then they pay out because in addition to their profit they have all the overhead of running a business   as a result on average you will come out behind when you purchase insurance this means that when you are on the fence about whether or not to purchase any insurance product the default choice should be no   on average you are financially better off without insurance   now that does n't mean you should never buy insurance as mentioned by commenter insurance companies spread risk across all of their customers if i am in a situation where i have a risk of financial ruin in a certain circumstance i can eliminate that risk by purchasing insurance for example i have term life insurance because if i were to pass away it would be financially catastrophic for my family i 'm hoping that the insurance company makes 100 profit on that deal i also continue to buy expensive health insurance because an unexpected medical event would be financially devastating however i always decline the extended warranty when i buy a $ 300 appliance because i do n't have any trouble coming up with another $ 300 in the unlikely event that it breaks and i would rather keep the money than contribute to the profits of an insurance company unnecessarily   in my original answer above i pointed out how you would determine whether or not to purchase this particular insurance product this product pays out a bunch of relatively small amounts for certain events up to a limit of $ 4000 would this $ 4000 be hard for you to come up with if you needed to if so get the insurance but if you are like me and have an emergency fund in place to handle things like this then you are financially better off declining this policy

you definitely can not be guaranteed to get the bid or ask if you are selling more than are available desired at those prices what prices you do get depends on who is watching that contract and how willing they are to trade with you this question is not much different from the question of whether you can easily get into or out of a large position in an illiquid small stock easily   you can get out quickly if you are willing to take pennies on the dollar or you may get a reasonable price if you take a long time to get out of or into your position   you ca n't normally do both in general taking large positions in illiquid assets is not something people want to do without lining up a buyer seller beforehand   instead see if you can achieve your objective with liquid investments

that is mostly true in most situations when there are more buy orders than sell orders higher buy volume orders than sell volume orders the price will generally move upwards and vice versa when there are more sell orders than buy orders higher sell volume orders than buy volume orders the price will generally move downwards note that this does not always happen but usually it does you are also correct that for a trade to take place a buyer has to be matched with a seller or the buy volume matched with the sell volume but not all orders get executed as trades say there are 50 buy orders in the order book with a total volume of 100,000 shares and the highest buy order is currently at $ 10.00 on the other side there are only 10 sell orders in the order book with total volume of 10,000 shares and the lowest sell order is currently $ at the moment there wo n't be a trade unless a new buyer or seller enters the market to match the opposing side or an existing order gets amended upper or lower to match the opposing side with more demand than supply in the order books what will be the most likely direction that this stock moves in most likely the price will move upwards if a new buyer sees the price moving higher and then looks at the market depth they would most likely place an order closer to the lowest sell order than the current highest buy order say $ 10.01 to be first in line in case a market sell order is placed on the market as new buy orders enter the market it drives the price higher and higher until the buy orders dry up

your asset mix should reflect your own risk tolerance   whatever the ideal answer to your question it requires you to have good timing not once but twice let me offer a personal example in 2007 the s&p hit its short term peak at or so as it tanked in the crisis a coworker shared with me that he went to cash on the way down selling out at about 1100 at the bottom or so i his brilliance sarcasm here and as it passed 1300 just 2 years later again mentions how he must be thrilled he doubled his money he admitted he was still in cash done with stocks so he was worse off than had he held on to his pre crash assets for sake of disclosure my own mix at the time was 100 stock that 's not a recommendation just a reflection of how my wife and i were invested   we retired early and after the 2013 excellent year moved to a mix closer to at any time a crisis hits and we have 5 6 years spending money to let the market recover if a long term decline occurs social security kicks in for us in 8 years   if my intent was n't 100 clear i 'm suggesting your long term investing should always reflect your own risk tolerance not some short term gut feel that disaster is around the corner

from personal experience i can tell you that bank account numbers are not unique   someone from another branch of my bank was able to withdraw money from my account at my branch because they had the same account number   you are supposed to enter your branch number on the withdrawal slip in front of your account number   the person who got my money did not do this   because it was at my branch the teller debited my account for the transaction   i caught this on my monthly statement and immediately complained to my branch manager he was able to retrieve the withdrawal slip and saw what had happened   he credited my account and said he was going to talk to the teller who should have asked for the branch number and/or should have noticed that the name and address on the withdrawal slip did not match those on my account   i would not have thought that the bank would allow this situation considering how many numbers are available to assign but they did

market makers are essentially just there to process the buys and sells of traders so just like you and i buy and sell at the ask and bid prices they do to they are just completing the process of making our orders a reality market makers are just representative of brokers meaning that when you place your order at ask or bid you are placing that particular brokers order at ask or bid people often say that certain brokers have too many shares and claim that they are games when really that just means that there happen to be a lot of people using a particular broker all at once or more troubling perhaps even company execs using a broker to sell a large amount of shares

there is a service transferwise through which you can send money from uk banks to eur bank accounts in the eu for a 1 gbp fee much cheaper then about 25 gbp for a swift transfer you send them a uk national gbp transfer to their uk hsbc account and they send the equivalent amount in eur from their irish eur bank account to your eur account for example in germany what is best is that they use bare mid market forex exchange rates without any markup on the gbp to eur exchange rate which is usually in the range of 2 to 5 in banks so you do n't lose anything on the exchange rate

any time you are optimizing a portfolio the right horizon to use for computing the statistics you will use for optimization expected return covariance etc will be the same as your rebalance trading frequency   if you expect your trading strategy to trade once a day you should use daily data for optimization   ditto for monthly or quarterly   if at all possible you should use statistics across the board that are computed at the same frequency as your trading regarding currency pricing i see no reason you ca n't take the reported prices and convert them to whatever currency you want using that day 's exchange rate   foreign exchange rates are available for free at the fed and elsewhere   converting prices from one currency to another is not rocket science since you are contemplating putting actual money behind this note that using data to compute statistics is less reliable for lower statistical moments   the mean expected return is the first moment so using historical returns is extremely unreliable at predicting future returns   the variances and are second moments they are better   and yet better   the fact that the expected return ca n't reliably be estimated from past returns is the major downfall of the markowitz method resulting portfolios are often very crazy and will depend critically on the data period you use to set them up    there are approaches to fixing this such as black 's 1992 method but they get complicated fast

reading and analyzing financial statements is one of the most important tasks of equity analysts which look at a company from a fundamental perspective   however analyzing a company and its financial statements is much more than just reading the absolute dollar figures provided in financial statements you need to calculate financial ratios which can be compared over multiple periods and companies to be able to gauge the development of a company over time and compare it to its competitors for instance for an equity analyst the absolute dollar figures of a company 's operating profit is less important than the ratio of the operating profit to revenue which is called the operating margin   another very important figure is free cash flow which can be set in relation to sales (= free cash flow sales   the following working capital related metrics can be used as a health check for a company and give you early warning signs when they deviate too much you can either calculate those metrics yourself using a spreadsheet e.g. excel or use a professional solution e.g. bloomberg professional reuters or worldcap

whether it is better to buy or to rent depends on several factors   most of them are fairly uncertain but calculations can be made to see how they play out in the long term for insight into their impact the results below are made on the basis that both the buyer and the tenant spend the same amount in this case $ per month   the buyer pays his mortgage and when it 's all paid for he switches to investing $ per month at the fund deposit rate   meanwhile the tenant pays rent and invests whatever remains from $ per month at the fund deposit rate the amount $ is set by the mortgage case and used by buyer and tenant for equal comparison taking some hopefully not too unrealistic rate estimates these are the calculation all percentages are expressed as effective annual rates plot of buyer 's and tenant 's accumulated assets over time the simulation extends for twice the term of the mortgage   if the investment fund can return 7 and a $ 900 rental is comparable to a $ 300,000 house then there is n't much of a compelling case either way lowering the expected fund return shows a different picture   sticking with the fund return lowering the rent brings the tenant 's asset accumulation closer to the buyer 's   if there is a particular set of inputs you would like to see plotted i 'm sure i could add another example to this post there is also an interactive version of the calculation which you can find via this page   however unlike the examples above which include a deposit and grant it just explores the simple case of a 100 mortgage the aim is just to see how rate variations affect asset value over time

no income inside an rrsp is sheltered from income tax until you withdraw it that is indeed the major benefit of rrsps note that you will eventually declare this as income consider the following case in 2015 you make $ 1000 in income in 2015 you contribute $ 100 to your rrsps you store this in an account that pays interest rather than investing it in stocks bonds or mutual funds between 2015 and 2025 your money makes an additional $ 100 in interest in 2025 you are retired and pull out the entire amount in your rrsp i.e. $ 200 now between 2015 and 2025 you did not declare the income from interest you 'd have had to do this if the money was in a regular bank account instead of an rrsp or a tfsa indeed your bank would have issued tax forms in that case but you do n't report income sheltered in an rrsp this is good as it increases the power of compounding in 2015 you pay tax on only $ 900 rather than the full $ 1000 in 2025 you pull out the entire $ 200 you report all $ 200 as income or actually as a withdrawal from your rrsp but it 's the same thing you pay tax on the initial $ 100 investment which you did not do in 2015 and you also pay tax on the $ 100 that your investment has made and which you are now pulling out the hope is that your income is now lower as you are retired so you 'll end up paying less income tax plus your investment has had many years of opportunity to compound tax free you do n't pay tax on or report gains in an rrsp account the bank or investment house wo n't even issue tax forms not until you withdraw the money

ex date is a function of the exchange as well as the dividend consider deutsche bank ag db on the nyse on xetra for a given dividend each exchange sets the ex date for trades on that exchange   see for a description of how it works in the us other exchanges countries are similar this ex date is normally based on the dividends record date which is when you must be on the company 's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend and based on when trades for an exchange are settled the ex date is the first date for which trades on that date will not settle until after the record date this means that the ex date can be different for different exchanges if you sell your shares on an exchange before the ex date for that exchange you will not get the dividend if you sell your shares on or after the ex date for the exchange you do not get the dividend so it depends on the time zone of the exchange most stock exchanges trade t+3 but this can still come into play if there are bank holidays in different countries at different times

investopedia has a good explanation of the term shorting which is what this is in the simplest of terms someone is borrowing the bond and selling it with the intent to replace the security and any dividends or coupons in the end the idea is that if a bond is overvalued one may be able to buy it back later for a cheaper price and pocket the difference there are various rules about this including margin requirements to maintain since there is the risk of the security going up in price enough that someone may be forced into a buy to cover in the form of a margin call if one can sell the bond at $ now and then buy it back later for $ then one could pocket the difference part of what you are n't seeing is what are other bonds doing in terms of their prices over time here the key point here is that brokers may lend out securities and accrue interest on loaned securities for another point here

as advised you need to budget but there are a few simple things you can do to make it easier work out how much your fixed bills are every month for example council tax gas and electric mortgage and rent etc on pay day move an amount of cash equal to this into another bank account when you get paid   it 's easier if this other account let 's call it a bills account can pay the bills automatically via direct debits you can then forget about it now your budget should tell you how much you spend on things that are more variable food fuel travel etc   again on pay day move an amount of cash aside to cover this plus a small buffer amount into another account whatever is now left in your main account is yours to spend or save as you see fit   you just need to make sure you are sticking to your budget and it 's as easy as that   if you can not pay direct debits from the other accounts you just need to move the money over to cover them when they need paying most banks will let you set up extra accounts so you can the money easily using internet banking or by a monthly standing order   if they wo n't let you have several current accounts you can use savings accounts but will need to manually move the money around as the bills are due   if you get all your direct debits to debit on pay day that makes it even easier if you are struggling for money then paying off debt first and the debt with the highest interest rate

the error in the example is here now if you contribute 5 to a roth 401(k your employer would match your after tax 5 contribution if the tax rate is 25 that would be 5 of $ 60,000 which is $ 3,000 however that $ 3,000 is put in to a traditional 401(k so it is taxed when withdrawn assuming the tax rate is still 25 when you withdraw you are only getting $ essentially you are giving up $ 750 of free money in this case you set your contribution to roth 401k as a function of the gross 80,000   you choose 5 and contribute 4000 your employer matches 4000 at the end of the year your taxable income to the irs is and you pay 30 or   you have k to live on or 52 k if you chose the alternate regular 401k then you contribute 4 k your income to the irs is 80 and you pay 30 k in tax   you have 80 4 or k to live on or to come at it the other way you have 4000 30 = 1200 extra tax reduction in your income this year    if the extra income in 401k versus extra current year tax in roth ira means you have to reduce less like 2800 k to the roth so you maintain a k lifestyle then yes the roth ira match is reduced   if you have the cash flow to prepay the current year tax and maximum match contribution you will get the full match based on your gross income

if you have a 20,000 balance and a 8.75 interest rate you should be paying between $ 145 and $ 150 in interest each month with the balance going to principal   and that times 20,000 is as interest is compounded daily it 'll be a little higher than that   if the minimum is below $ 145 then you are not covering the interest i suspect that is what is happening here and they 're reporting interest paid that was n't covered in a prior month assuming you have some months where you only pay the statement minimum which is less than the total accrued interest assuming you 're in the us or most other western countries your loan servicer should be explaining the exact amount each payment that goes to principal and interest   i recommend calling them up and finding out exactly why it 's not consistent what should be happening assuming you pay more than the amount of interest each month is the interest should go down very slowly each month and the amount paying off principal should go up also slowly   eg etc until eventually the interest is zero and your loan is paid off   it probably wo n't go this quickly for this size of loan you 're only paying off a tiny percentage of principal each month $ or so you wo n't make too much headway at this rate    even adding another $ 25 would make a huge difference to the length of the loan and the amount of interest paid but that 's another story    you will eventually at this rate pay off the loan at $ 200 a month for all 12 months this is n't dissimilar to a 30 year mortgage in terms of percent interest to principal in fact it 's better   $ 50 a month times twelve is $ 600 400 payments would take care of it so a bit over 30 years   however as you go you pay more principal and less interest so you will actually pay it off in 15 years if you continue paying $ 200 a month exactly what you may be seeing in your case is a combination of things in months you pay less ie $ 100 say the extra $ 45 in interest needs to go somewhere   it effectively becomes part of the principal but from what i 've seen that does n't always happen directly ie they account it differently at least for a short time up to a year in my experience this is because of tax laws if i understand correctly the amount you pay in interest is tax deductible but not the amount of the principal so it 's important for you to have as much called interest as possible   thus if you pay $ 100 this month and $ 200 next month that total of $ 300 is paying of interest and $ 10 of principal just as if you 'd paid it $ 150 each month if you had any penalties such as for late payments those come out off the top before interest they may sometimes take that out as well all in all i strongly suggest having an enforced minimum on your end of the interest amount at least that prevents you from being in a situation where your loan grows   if you ca n't always hit $ 200 that 's fine but at least hit $ 150 every single month   otherwise you have a never ending cycle of student loan debt that you really do n't want to be in separately on the $ 1000 payment as long as you make sure it 's not assigned in such a way that the lender only accepts a month 's worth at a time which should n't happen but there are shady lenders it should n't matter what is called principal and what is called interest   the interest wo n't go up just because you 're making a separate payment it 'll go down   the portion that goes to interest will go to paying off the amount of interest you owe from the time of your last payment plus any accrued but unpaid interest plus principal   you wo n't have the option of not paying that interest and it does n't really matter anyway it 's all something you owe and all accruing interest it only really matters for accounting and taxes   double check with your lender on the phone and on their website if possible that overpayments are not penalized and are applied to principal immediately or within a few days anyway and you should be fine

to expand on what and some others are saying   the only way to look at it is that the parents have invested because the parents get a of the property in the end rather than the original loan amount plus interest   it is investment it is not a loan of any kind   one way to understand this is to imagine that after 20 years the property in value or halves in value   the parents participate as if they had invested in 75 ownership of the property and the op as if 25 ownership of the property note that with a loan there is a potentially changing outstanding loan balance that could be paid to end the loan to pay off the loan and there is an agreed upon an interest rate that is computed on the outstanding balance none of those apply to this situation further with a loan there is no of the property though the property may be used to secure the loan that is n't ownership basically since the situation bears none of the qualities of a loan and yet does bear the qualities of investment the parents have bought a ownership of the property the parents have invested in 75 of the real estate and the op is renting that 75 from them for the total rent the op is paying the parents for their 75 of the property is then at least $   a rental rate of $ for 75 of the property equates to a rental price of $ for the whole property this arrangement is only fair to both parties when the fair market rental value of the whole property is $ it is unfair to the op when the fair market rental value of property is less and unfair to the parents when the fair market rental value of property is more    of course the fair market rental value of the property is variable over time so the overall fairness would need to understand rental values over time i feel like this is n't actually a loan if i can never build more equity in the condo am i missing something no it is n't a loan   you and your parents are co investing in real estate   further you are renting their portion of the investment from them for comparison with a loan you have 100 ownership in the property from the start so you the owner would see all the upside downside as the property valuation changes over time whether the loan is paid off or not the borrower owes the loan balance and interest not some of the property   a loan may be secured by the property using a lien but that is quite different from ownership   typically a loan has a payment schedule setup to reduce the loan balance steadily over time so that you eventually pay it off   with a loan you gain equity the amount you own outright free clear in two ways 1 by gradually paying off the loan over time so the portion of the property grows and 2 if the valuation of the property increases over time that gain in equity is yours not the lenders   however note that the legal ownership is all 100 yours from the start are my parents ripping me off with this deal that does n't allow me to build my equity in my home you can evaluate whether you are being ripped off by comparing the $ rate to the potential rental rate for the property over time which will be a range or curve and there are real estate websites like or others to help estimate what fair market rent might be are there similar deals like this   a straight forward loan would have the borrower with 100 legal ownership from the start just that the property secures the loan   whereas with co investment there is a division of ownership that is fixed from the start    it is unusual to have both investment and loan at the same time where they are setup for gradual change between them   investment and loan can certainly be done together but would usually be done as completely separate contracts one loan one investment with no adjustment between the two over time to do both investment and loan would be unusual but certainly be possible i would imagine however that is not the case here as being described   i am not familiar with contracts that do both so as to take over the equity ownership investment over time while also reducing loan balance   perhaps some forms of rent to own work that way something to look into still usually rent to own means that until the renter owns it 100 the landlord owns 100 rather than a gradual transfer over time gradual transfer would imply co ownership for a long time something that most landlords would be reluctant to do    transfer of any particular of real estate ownership typically requires filing documents with the county and may incur fees   i am not aware of counties that allow gradual transfer with one single filing   still the courts may honor a contract that does such gradual transfer outside of county filings if so what should i do explain the situation to your parents and in particular however far out of balance the rental rate may be   decide for yourself if you want to rent vs. buy and where that property or some other   if your parents are fair people they should be open to negotiation   if not you might need a lawyer    i suspect that a lawyer would be able to find several issues with which to challenge the contract the other terms are important as well namely gross vs. net proceeds as others point out because selling a property costs a to real estate agents and possibly some taxes as well and as the others have pointed out if the property ultimately looses value that could be factored in as well it is immaterial to judging the fairness of this particular situation whether getting a bank loan would be preferable to renting 75 from the parents   further loan interest rates do n't factor into the fairness of this rental situation but of course interest rates do factor into identifying the better of various methods of investment and methods of securing a place to live e.g. rent vs. buy contributed by if your parents view this as an investment arrangement as described then you need to clarify with them if the payments being made to them are considered a buy out of their share this would allow you to gain the equity you seek from the arrangement terms would have to be or have been declared to that effect this would involve specifying some schedule and/or rates   it would have to be negotiated this it is not something that could go assumed or

there 's nothing much you can do here and i do n't think you 'll succeed in placing blame on the lawyers in order for ssa to have the tax withheld from your benefits you need to submit form here are the details on how to get it and what to do with it this form is voluntarily submitted i.e. no one will ask for it you have to actively send it out on your own as to repayment of the ltd benefits since they were not taxable there 's no change in the taxable income on your behalf what you got was n't taxed so what you gave back does n't provide any tax benefit as to why ssa benefits are taxable and ltd benefits are not this is because ssa is pre tax and ltd premiums were in your case apparently post tax however the ltd benefits management company does n't care or may be even know about this and they do everything they can to reduce their own liability to you if you 're entitled to ssa benefits it reduces their liability that 's why they insisted on your claim with ssa as to the ssa dragging their feet they want to reduce their taxpayers essentially liability as well however once they decided in your favor you received what was rightfully yours including back pay ssa benefits are taxable in the year received so you got a lump sum taxable as a lump sum sorry but that 's the way it is this is an example where post tax ltd premiums do n't actually pay off

technically of course almost any company can go bankrupt one small note a company goes bankrupt not its stock its stock may become worthless in bankruptcy but a stock disappearing or being delisted does n't necessarily mean the company went bankrupt bankruptcy has implications for a company 's debt as well so it applies to more than just its stock i do n't know of any historical instances where this has happened but presumably the warning signs of bankruptcy would be evident enough that a few things could happen   another company e.g. another exchange holding firm etc could buy out the exchange that 's facing financial difficulty and the companies traded on it would transfer to the new company that 's formed if another exchange bought out the struggling exchange the shares of the latter could transfer to the former this is an attractive option because exchanges possess a great deal of infrastructure already in place depending on the country this could face regulatory scrutiny however other firms or governments could bail out the exchange if no one presented a buyout offer the likelihood of this occurring depends on several factors e.g. political will the in question etc for a smaller exchange the exchange could close all open positions at a set price this is exactly what happened with the hong kong mercantile exchange that mentioned when the exchange collapsed in may 2013 it closed all open positions for their price on the thursday before the shutdown date i do n't know if a stock exchange would simply close all open positions at a set price since equity technically exists in perpetuity regardless of the shutdown of an exchange while many derivatives have an expiration date furthermore this might not be a feasible option for a large exchange for example the chicago mercantile exchange lists thousands of products and manages hundreds of millions of transactions so closing all open positions could be a significant undertaking   if none of the above options were available i presume companies listed on the exchange would actively move to other more financially stable exchanges these companies would n't simply go bankrupt contracts can always be listed on other exchanges as well considering the high level of mergers and acquisitions both unsuccessful and successful   in the market for exchanges in recent years i would assume that option 1 would be the most likely see the nyse deutsche merger talks and the nyse ice merger that 's currently in progress but for smaller exchanges there is the recent historical precedent of the that speaks to 3 also the above answer really only applies to publicly traded stock exchanges and not all stock exchanges are publicly held entities for example the shanghai stock exchange is a quasi governmental organization so i presume option 2 would apply because it already receives government backing its bankruptcy would mean something occurred for the government to withdraw its backing or that it became public and a discussion of those events occurring in the future is pure speculation

generally a share of stock entitles the owner to all future per share dividends paid by the company plus a fraction of the company 's assets net value in the event of liquidation   if one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts as time goes by the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid it will cease to contribute to the stock 's value because people are not they generally do n't know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make   a sane price for a stock however may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments   if unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward the price of the stock should increase   if events cause estimates to be revised downward the price should fall in a sane marketplace if the price of a stock is below people 's estimates of its payouts current cash value people should buy the stock and push the price upward   if it is above people 's estimates they should sell the stock and push the price downward   note that in a sane marketplace rising prices are a red flag indicator for people to stop buying   unfortunately sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead   when that happens prices may soar through the roof but it 's important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts   if that value is $ 10/share someone who buys a share for $ 50 basically gives the seller $ 40 that he was not entitled to and which the buyer will never get back   the buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him $ 60 for the share but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one $ 50 that he was n't entitled to either   if the price falls back to $ 10 calling that fall a market correction would n't be a but rather state a fact the share was worth $ 10 before people sold it for crazy prices and still worth $ 10 afterward   it was the market price that was in error the important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in   it 's not necessary to look only at present price earnings ratios since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year   what 's important however is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost

considering i 'm in a nearly identical situation i 'll speak to my personal strategy and maybe there 's some value for you as well    you have in loans which you say you could pay off today   so what i read is that you 're sitting there with a $ 22k investment and want to know which investment to make pay down debt invest in yourself start up or some variation between those options   any investor worth his salt will ask a couple of questions what is my risk and what is my gain paying off your student loans offers no financial risk at the cost of opportunity risk and gains you returns of 3.4 6.8 3.4 4.5 and 6.8   those percentage gains are guaranteed and the opportunity risk is unknown investing in a startup is inherently risky with the potential for big payoffs but with this investment you are accepting a lot of risk for potentially some gain it could be the next apple it could also fail   so with your situation like mine i 'd say it 's best to accept the easy investment for now and fully vet out your tech start up idea in the meantime

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

in some sense the share repurchasing program is better if the company does not foresee the same profit levels down the road   paying a dividend for several years and then suddenly not paying or reducing a dividend is viewed as a slap in the face by investors   executing a share repurchase program one year and then not the next is not viewed as negatively from an investor 's standpoint i would say a dividend is preferred over a share repurchase program for a similar reason   typically companies that pay a dividend have been doing so for quite some time and even increasing it over time as the company increases profits   so it can be assumed that if a company starts paying a dividend it will do so for the long run

i do n't see a way out of this that does n't involve economic upheaval on a scale that would make 2008 look like boom times   economic upheaval could also be considered economic re formation and re organization   the danger lies in the political sphere that the problems inherent in any such even will create a mob that makes demands which inevitably result in strong man rule i.e. a full blown dictator   americans themselves that we have never had this in the past when in fact we have several times most notably fdr we just retained the forms of a democracy and the labels of a republic and then we got very lucky that the dictator died when he did and power transitioned to someone who was a token place holder and not party to his grand scheme and so unwound the whole thing   iow we may be headed over a proverbial cliff but that does n't necessarily mean that it will be an apocalyptic affair just that it will be tough to weather and get through though the agile will still manage and there is potential hope for the other side however minimal
