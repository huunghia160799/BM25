i assume the same criteria apply for this as your previous question you want to physically transfer in excess of 50,000 usd multiple times a week and you want the transportation mechanism to be instant or very quick i do n't believe there is any option that wo n't raise serious red flags with the government entities you cross the boundaries of even a cheque which a person in the comments of op 's question suggests would n't be sufficient due to government regulation requiring banks to put holds on such large amounts

yes that 's what a classical intelligent conservative a rare breed in internet chat rooms would say and it is of course true as far as it goes this is a point where real conservatism as opposed to its internet actually touches base with the real left as opposed to its internet believe it or not many of the people you mention are doing exactly what you recommend the fly in the is that being on the left they do n't start with a rock hard belief that there is nothing wrong with the system that it is the best of all possible worlds and that all people have to do to solve the problems of a group and its individuals is to play along and put their nose to the    there are such things as social norms quite separate from laws and even in the most benevolent utopia there have to be and will be these vague of what one should do so your advise true as it may be only captures part of the solution a fuller solution goes beyond individual response and involves shifts in political power

the first thing that strikes me is is this a time limited offer because if you can expect the offer to still be valid in a few weeks why not just wait that month which will earn you the money and buy the car then the second thing you need to consider is obviously the risk that in the interim there will be an actual emergency which would require the money that you no longer have the third thing to consider is whether you need the car now do you require a car to get around and your current one is breaking down perhaps even to the point that repairing it would cost you more than buying a new car and it is currently not safe to drive if so compare the cost of repairing to the cost of buying if the difference is small and the new car would be more likely to be reliable than the old car after spending the money then it can make sense to buy a new car and perhaps sell the old one in its current condition to someone who likes to tinker even if you only recover a few hundreds of dollars that 's still money that perhaps you would n't otherwise have the fourth thing i would consider especially given the time frame involved is can you get a loan to buy the new car even if the interest rate is high one month 's worth of interest expense wo n't set you back very far and it will keep the money in your emergency fund for if there is an actual emergency in the weeks ahead doing so might be a better choice than to take the money out of the emergency fund if you have the opportunity save the emergency fund for when that opportunity does not exist and of course without knowing how much you earn take care to not end up with a car that is no more reliable than what you have now without knowing how much you earn and what the car you have in mind would cost it 's hard to say anything for certain but if the car you have in mind costs less than a month 's worth of net pay for you consider whether it 's likely to be reliable maybe you are making an absolutely stellar pay and the car will be perfectly fine but there 's that risk running the car by a mechanic to have it briefly checked out before buying it may be a wise move just to make sure that you do n't end up with a large car repair expense in a few months when the transmission gives up for example

ca nt even reliably get a robot to recognize an object like a chair   my first thought in response to your statement was that you were wrong but then i started thinking about the very wide variety of what we consider to be a chair and i realized that that s actually quite true especially if you include or chairs in the set of chairs     however i think that s a bad example because not being able to do that particular task reliably and rapidly for another five years or so without spending a huge amount of money is n't going to save any particular jobs that i know of because we 're not at the stage yet where we need to solve those particular kinds of problems    the kinds of machine vision problems that are impacting jobs are much more mundane and much easier to solve   for example distinguishing between kinds of fruit produce etc in a grocery or determining visually if fruit is ripe etc in various agricultural applications

this was a really unusual deal because a fund owned by one of the owners of the company was buying much of the shares seems that maybe someone at the company realized that they could get an ipo for much less than 7 because the bank was n't really doing much work or taking much risk for their cut and that nobody figured to put contingencies for this in a contract because how often does it happen   edit do people even read the articles for these things   you do an ipo where an existing shareholder and company director is buying half the deal that 's not quite the same as doing an ipo where the banks are just selling shares to investors that the banks dig up and when that shareholder decides that he 'd rather not buy his escape is not so much refusing to pay for his shares as it is trying to get the deal pulled   if sues the banks they can turn around and sue saying that this is a backdoor way of getting out of their contract

my understanding it that the signature requirement is at the retailer 's discretion if the merchant decides to require a signature it protects them against fraudulent charge back claims but increases their administrative costs in some situations it just is n't practical for a retailer to require a signature consider for example mail order or online purchases which i 've never had to sign a credit card slip for

your practice of waiting until you can pay cash is a good one it will certainly prevent you from getting into debt now to be clear your question puts a credit card in the same category as a loan but it does n't have to be you could use a credit card almost like cash if you are careful i 'm not familiar with the system in france but in the us even if you are paying cash all the time there are some benefits to getting a credit card and paying it off in full every month instead of simply paying with cash some of those benefits are one pretty big downside of having a credit card depends on your personality some people once they have credit end up spending beyond their means and end up getting into debt please look into whether credit cards work the same way in france before considering the above advice as for your question regarding getting a loan vs paying cash that will usually be personal preference since with a loan you can buy expensive items such as a house or car much sooner than you otherwise could if you waited until you saved the money for example it might take 10 years or more to build up enough money to purchase a house with cash so if you do n't want to wait that long you 'll need to finance it

small cap and mid cap shares tend to outperform large cap shares in a bull market but they tend to underperform large cap shares in a bear market since the stock markets tend to go up in the long term this suggests that a low cost small and mid cap index etf should offer the best long term returns    having said that we are currently in a mature bull market having experienced over seven years without a bear market   if a bearish outlook is something you worry about then perhaps a broad market index which will be heavily weighted towards large cap shares may be a better choice for you at this time with an eye toward switching to small and mid cap indices during the next bear market

it was not 100 clear if you have held all of these stocks for over a year   therefore depending on your income tax bracket it might make sense to hold on to the stock until you have held the individual stock for a year to only be taxed at long term capital gains rates   also you need to take into account the net investment income if your current modified adjusted income is above the current threshold   beyond these i would think that you would want to apply the same methodology that caused you to buy these in the first place as it seems to be working well for you 2 3 no   you trigger a taxable event and therefore have to pay capital gains tax on any gains   if you have a loss in the stock and repurchase the stock within 30 days you do n't get to recognize the loss and have to add the loss to your basis in the stock wash sales rules

not for the tax break no as others have said that still costs you money however with rates being low right now and brought a bit lower by the tax break this is an opportunity for the safest form of leveraged investing you will ever find if you invest that money the returns on investment will probably be better than the mortgage rate and that leaves you with a net profit there is some risk if the market collapses but it 's less risk than any other form of borrowing to invest that also leave you with more flexibility if you need cash in a hurry you can draw down the investments rather than taking another loan if the risk bothers you you can do what i did and split the difference i put 50 down and financed the rest i sometimes regret not having pushed it harder since it has worked out well for me but that was the level of risk i was comfortable with

if a company 's shares trade in multiple exchanges the prices in every exchange are very near to each other otherwise you could earn money by doing arbitrage deals buying in one selling in the other and people do that once it becomes worth it which stock exchange you use is more a convenience for the buyer seller many investment banks offer only something local near and you have to go to specific investment banks to use other exchanges for example in germany it is easy to deal in frankfurt but if you want to trade at the the nasdaq you have to run around and find a bank that offers it and you probably have to pay extra for it in the usa most investment banks offer nasdaq but if you want to trade in frankfurt you will have run around for an international company that offers that as a stock owner buyer you can sell buy your shares on any stock exchange where the company is listed again assuming your investment broker supports it so you can buy in frankfurt and sell in tokyo seconds later as nothing needs to be physically moved companies that are listed in multiple stock are typically large and offer this to make trading their shares easier for a larger part of the world considering your theoretical buy all shares the shares are not located in the exchanges they are in the hands of the owners and not all are for sale for various reasons the owners decide if and when they want them offered for sale and they also decide which stock exchange they offer them on so you would need to go to all exchanges to buy them all however if you raise your offer price in one exchange only slightly someone will see the arbitrage and buy them in the other locations and offer them to you in your stock exchange in other words for a small fee the shares will come to you but again most shares are typically not for sale it 's the same as trying to buy all chevy even if you had the money most owners would n't know or care about you you would have to go around and contact every single one and convince them to sell

the answer is simple you can generally claim a deduction for an expense if that expense was used to derive an income of course social policy sometimes gets in the way and allows for deductions where they usually would n't be allowed your rent is not tax deductible because this expense is not used to derive your income if however you were working from your home example you had a home based business and you dedicated a part of your home for your work say an office then part of your rent may then become tax deductible

carmax will be interested in setting a price that allows them to make money on the reselling of the vehicle they wo n't offer you more than that the determination of the value compared to the value is based on condition and miles the refinancing of the auto loan could lower your monthly payment but may not save you any money in the short term the new lender will also want an evaluation of the vehicle and if it is less than the payoff amount of the current loan they will ask you to make a lump sum payment this is addition to the cost of getting the new loan setup if you can pay the delta between the value of the car and loan then do so when you sell the car do n't refinance unless you plan on keeping the car for many months or you are just adding paperwork to the transaction

i can see apprenticeships making a comeback   i know of very few apprenticeships these days i 'm guessing most of them were replaced way back with certifications   the most obvious one is tattoo artists    to actually work at a tattoo place of business not a house basement you must serve for a year under someone who is a legitimate experienced tattoo artist   you will make half of what the tattoo is priced and the person getting the tattoo is well informed of who is doing the tattoo sometimes they get a discount because of it    after a year you are certified and can begin working by yourself and setting your own rates with a portion going to the business you usually rent a room in a tattoo shop    i 'm sure these standards vary depending on where you are but with economics turning the way they are i think apprenticeships can cover some of the downturn we are experiencing i 'm not sure how much it would cover but it would cover something however small   it also weeds out any who are n't serious and might otherwise produce terrible results

daniel first of all i 'm jealous of your predicament   that said i think you 've gotten some good advice already so i wo n't repeat what 's been said   but i will throw out a few ideas that have n't come up   my first thought is that you may be underestimating upcoming expenses   it sounds like your current expenses are low and that 's great   i 'm impressed that you 're living below your means and looking for the best way to use your extra cash   but you may not be thinking of a few things you have a girlfriend and maybe your relationship is n't such that you are planning a wedding quite yet   but regardless of whether your current girlfriend is your future life partner or not if you think marriage may be in your future at all you 'll save yourself a lot of stress if you 've got some savings for a wedding in place before you 're ready to commit next what are you driving   if it 's a good car that you expect to last you another 10 years you 're probably ok right now   but if you may need to replace your vehicle in the next few years start saving now and you may be able to buy it outright   i expect your interest rate on financing a car would be higher than your current student loan rates so i would save for a car before paying down loans with such beautiful rates a house has already been discussed and there was also mention of additional education and both of those require a solid financial plan that begins far in advance in summary i think you need a lot more than $ 5 k in savings   sure have some fun and take advantage of opportunities to travel etc as they come along but if you 're able to bump your savings by $ 500 to $ 1000/month i think you 'll really be glad you did   when it comes time for a new car or you find you 're ready to settle down it will be nice to have somewhere to draw from and if there 's only $ 5 k in your savings you may come to regret choices you made when you were 22

td will only sell the stock for you if there 's a buyer there was a buyer for at least one transaction of at least one stock at but who said there were more obviously the stocks later fell i.e. there were not that many buyers as there were sellers what i 'm saying is that once the stock passed reached the limit the order becomes an active order but it does n't become the only active order it is added to the list and to the bottom of that list obviously in this case there were not enough buyers to go through the whole list and get to your order and since it was a limit order it would only execute with the limit price you put once the price went down you got out of luck   that said there could of course be a possibility of a system failure but given the story of the market behavior it just looks like you and lost on a bet

unless you suffer from the illusion that you can time the market it honestly does n't matter much the difference is lost in the noise that may be true even if you do suffer from that illusion   also as discussed here previously the drop in a stock 's price right after the dividend has been paid just reflects the fact that you are n't about to get an immediate refund in the form of a dividend if you look at the real cost per share it 's meaningless and can should be ignored buying after the dividend is paid may save you a tiny fraction of a cent of short term income tax but that 's meaningless in real terms

i deleted my comment that this was a reply to so i 'll repost it   it was    gt;i do n't know the answer but i 'm pretty sure this is incorrect   you have to take into account the correlations of the securities across the three different markets   it 's definitely not as simple as dividing by three   the reason why i do n't think this is correct is because you can imagine an exchange in which there is only one other security and the asset in question is perfectly correlated and therefore has a beta of 1   you could then have a different exchange with thousands of securities where the asset has a beta of 0.3   the   simple average method would produce a beta of when it 's probably true that the correct answer is closer to 0.3   the solution is not so i do n't think it can be right it neglects the relative sizes of the exchanges and the correlation of the underlying assets with each other   which leads me to consider perhaps the right thing to do is to calculate the returns across all three exchanges and the returns of the asset on all three exchanges do a weighted average and use that variance covariance to calculate the beta across all three exchanges   i 'm not sure what purpose practically such a beta would serve   i think the correct answer is to take the beta of the asset with respect to the largest most diversified exchange   ultimately using a basket of securities like the s&amp;p 500 is just a proxy for the market whatever that means   it does n't truly represent the realm of possibilities for the diversified investor but it 's close enough   tl dr i say pick one exchange and go with it

short answer   any long term financial planning e.g. mortgage and retirement planning   long answer inflation does n't really matter in short time frames on any given day you might get a rent hike or a raise or the grocery store might have a sale   inflation is really only relevant over the long term   annual inflation is tiny compared to large unexpected 10   however over 10 years even your large unexpected expenses will still average out to a small fraction of your spending compared to the impact of compounded inflation inflation is really critical when you are trying to plan for retirement which you should start doing when you get your first job   when making long term projections you need to consider not only your expected nominal rate of investment return e.g. 7 but also subtract the expected rate of inflation e.g. 3 alternatively you can add the inflation rate to your projected spending being sure to compound year over year when projecting your income 10 + years out you can use inflation to estimate your annual raises   up to age 30 people tend to get raises that exceed inflation thereafter they tend to track inflation if you ever decide to buy a house you need to consider the impact of inflation when calculating the total cost over a mortgage generally you can expect your house to appreciate over 30 years in line with inflation possibly more in an urban area so a simple mortgage projection needs to account for interest inflation maintenance insurance and closing costs you could also consider inflation for things like rent and income but only over several years generally rent and income are such large amounts of money it is worth your time to research specific alternatives rather than just guessing what market rates are this year based on average inflation while it is true that rent and wages go up in line with inflation in the long run you can make a lot of money in the short run if you keep an eye on market rates every year over 10 20 years your personal rate of inflation should be very close to the average rate when you consider all your spending housing food energy clothing etc

q a everyone that is short is paying interest to the owners of the shares that the short seller borrowed although this your conundrum this is also unrelated to the term interest in this context is just the number in the options market each contract also has an open interest which tells you how many of that contract is being held for your sake think of it as how many are interested but really its just a completely different context

you are right about the stock and index funds with dollar cost averaging over several years the daily price of the security especially a dividend paying security will not matter because your position will have accumulated larger over several entry points some entries with cheaper shares and some entries with more expensive shares in the future your position will be so large that any uptick will net you large gains on your original equity not matter being a reference to even extreme forms of volatility but if you had all your equity in a poor company and tanked never to rise again then you would still be in a losing position even with dollar cost averaging if your only other holdings are bonds then you may want to sell those to free up capital

there are lots of reasons why a crook would want you to do this counterfeit check scam laundering money trying to get your account information getting you used to doing questionable things and then escalating seeing whether you 're the kind of person to go along with bad ideas etc   there are not however much in the way of good reasons for it i gather you can withdraw money from your bank without an atm fee this i am assuming from the fact that it is being proposed that you withdraw money from your account and the fact that this is how pretty much all non predatory banking works if this person 's bank wo n't let them withdraw money without a fee something is seriously wrong and they should get an account at your bank do they get charged for using a live teller as well if not how is getting money from you easier than getting it from a teller how much is the fee if the fee is $ 2 and you 're making $ 10/hour that 's 12 minutes of wages does it take less than 12 minutes to complete this transaction including the time this other person is spending this cartoon comes to mind

there are some etf 's on the indian market that invest in broad indexes in other countries here 's an article discussing this   be aware that such investments carry an additional risk you do not have when investing in your local market which is currency risk   if for example you invest in a etf that represents the us s&p500 index and the us dollar weakens relative to the indian rupee you could see the value if your investment in the us market go down even if the index itself is up but not as much as the change in currency values a lot of investment advisors recommend that you have at least 75 of your investments in things which are denominated in your local currency well technically the same currency as your liabilities and no more than 25 invested internationally   in large part the reason for this advice is to reduce your exposure to currency risk

it 's wrong in several situations   one the business owner counts this as a business expense which it is not and therefore reduces the company 's profit and taxes that would be tax avoidance and probably criminal   two someone who is not the sole owner counts this as a business expense which it is not reduces the company 's profit and when profits are shared the company pays out less money to the other owners that 's probably fraud   third if the owner or owners of a limited liability company draw out lots of money from the company with the intent that the company should go bankrupt with tons of debt that the owners are not going to pay while keeping the money they off for themselves that would probably bankruptcy fraud   apart from being wrong there is the obvious risk that you lose control over your company 's and your own expenses and might be in for a nasty surprise if the company has to pay out money and there 's nothing left that would be ordinary stupidity if you have to tell your employees that you ca n't pay their salaries but offer them to admire your brand new ferrari that 's something i 'd consider deeply unethical

if you owe the money to a and b owes you money and goes bankrupt that has no effect whatsoever on your loan from a.    obviously    your best bet while you still owe and are owed by the same company is either get them to agree to apply your credit to your debt reducing it to $ 30,000 or rush to the courthouse and ask a judge to order this done    you want to do this well before the bankruptcy is filed too close and someone could object to you having been paid or out of turn and claw back the money meaning you now owe it to the bankruptcy trustee    your debt to them is from their perspective an asset   it is an asset with a cash value based on the probability of people in that portfolio paying   it can be sold to gain some immediate cash instead of more cash over a time period   this is routine in the debt world   before or during the of bankruptcy and depending on what the reorganization plan is the bank is quite likely to sell your debt to someone else to raise cash typically a distress sale for a fraction of its principal value e.g. 20 or $ 10,000   that goes into the pool of money to pay creditors such as yourself and if you 're lucky you 'll get some of it    so good on you you got $ 2000 back from the bank and now you owe someone else $ 50,000   i 'm assuming they owe you $ 20,000 for it services or because you put a new roof on their branch or something like that   if it 's money on deposit at the bank then two things are true first pre bankruptcy you can trivially command the bank to dump the entire $ 20,000 into paying down the debt   instantly done and irreversible   the bankruptcy trustee ca n't claw that back because it was never the bank 's money it was yours    second any civilized country has deposit insurance which they typically implement by helping another bank buy out your bank and continue to honor your deposits so this is seamless and hands off for you your old checks continue to work your branch just changes their sign    this deposit insurance has limits which is only a problem for the very rich who are dumb enough to put over the limit in one bank

to summarize the money never existed the best example i can give is the housing bubble houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money when people could n't make their payments the house prices crashed   the boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended boom and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes bust   the real question that people should be asking is not where did all the money go but why is money issued by private banks   money is a social invention to facilitate trade should it not be like a public water utility counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized all natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters degrees etc money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest we essentially pay rent on all money that and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created once again at interest this is why economists generally say some inflation is good finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality money is just an iou that requires no such interest payment for it 's issue   interest should be made if a loan is issued against savings but not for the simple issuance of money there should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment you can read more about this from reading about arthur in this way the public controls the value of it 's money not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class   if you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt read the work of it 's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least wealth is subject to the laws of while debt is an invention of the human will debt never rots or with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest nothing in the natural world does this

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

the tax consequence is that if you wait until january of 2011 to invest you wo n't have the option to sell as a long term capital gain in 2011   however this is not a huge point in practice if your income this year was very low but will go up in 2011 you might want to convert some or all of it into a roth ira this year   this would let you pay the tax on it at your low tax rate for this year rather than at the likely higher rate when you retire    an investment consequence is the fact that your money is sitting there earning a lower expected rate of return than it could be not knowing your situation i ca n't say how aggressive your holdings will be   taking a fairly aggressive portfolio 9 expected yearly return and not investing for a month you lose about .75 on average   not huge but something to consider remember that any decision you make here is n't permanent   if your previous allocation in the 401(k was 100 in stock funds you could put it in something like vti vanguard 's total us stock market etf

for various reasons if you can defer tax payment it 's good for you when you can give uncle sam $ x tomorrow why give it today some reasons are you may plan to return back to your country after x years and then you can pay tax at a lower bracket e.g. convert 401k to rollover ira then do roth conversion and pay lower tax bracket paying now versus later is purely based on your anticipated future tax bracket if future bracket is same say 25 today and after say 20 years 25 there is absolutely no difference between today payment or future payment of tax you can mathematically prove the returns are the same for roth ira or versus ira or 401k having a bigger balance in case of 401k compared to can also give you a sense of more security since there are provisions for hardship withdrawal tax may be due

if you receive a 1099-misc from youtube that tells you what they stated to the irs and leads into most tax preparation software guided interviews or wizards as a topic for you to enter   whether or not you have a 1099-misc this discussion from the irs is pertinent to your question you could probably elect to report the income as a royalty on your copyrighted work of art on schedule e but see this note in most cases you report royalties in part i of schedule e form 1040 however if you are in business as a self employed writer inventor artist etc report your income and expenses on schedule c or schedule c ez form 1040 whether reporting on schedule e or c is more correct or better for your specific circumstances is beyond the advice you should take from strangers on the internet based on a general question however know that there are potentially several paths for you    note that this is revenue from a business so if you paid for equipment or services that are 100 dedicated to your pc upgraded broadband video editing software vehicle miles to a shoot props etc then these are a combination of depreciable capital investments and expenses you can report against the income reducing the taxes you may owe   if the equipment services are used for business and personal use there are further guidelines from the irs as to estimating the split these apply whether you report on sch e sch c or sch c ez     quote self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer fees received for babysitting and lawn cutting are all examples of taxable income even if each client paid less than $ 600 for the year someone who repairs computers in his or her spare time needs to report all monies earned as self employment income even if no one person paid more than $ 600 for repairs

why do stock markets allow these differences in reporting the irs allows businesses to use fiscal calendars that differ from the calendar year there are a number of reasons a company would choose do this from preferring to avoid an accounting rush at end of year during holiday season to aligning with seasonality for their profits some like to have q4 as the strongest quarter smaller businesses may prefer to keep the extra stress of year end to a traditionally slower time for the business and some just start their fiscal calendar when the company starts up you 'll notice the report dates are a couple weeks after fiscal quarter end you would read it as three months ended so for three months ended october 31 2017 so august september october are their q4 months

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

gt;so why not talk to your employer and ask them to pay you in gold dust then when tax time comes just convert some gold dust into the amount of usd in taxes you owe    because selling gold and buying dollars has an effect on the market   it reduces the value of gold and increases the value of dollars   understand   so being forced to use dollars artificially increases the value of   the reason we are forced to use dollars is because the central bank has the monopoly on printing dollars   without legal tender laws that monopoly would be worthless   gt;of course you 'd have to find farmers and and electronic stores willing to accept payment in gold dust as well   as the value of gold increases over time the government taxes the increased value as capital gains tax   so gold can not be money under these circumstances the government considers it an investment now

gt we 've been deficit spending for generations and we 're trillions in the hole and that 's the psychological issue hanging over our heads   let 's unpack that a bit what does trillions in the hole actually mean for the issuer of the dollar it means that the issuer at various points has to redeem its own interest bearing dollars treasuries for its own non interest bearing dollars reserves notes coins that 's not a hole that 's moving a balance from the savings account to the checking account at the same bank   you do n't think of your savings account balance as the bank being in the hole for checking account balances you implicitly understand that the bank simply marks down the number in one account and marks up the number in the other and you do n't fret that the bank might run out of checking account balances   treasuries have this same relationship to reserves not similar not analogous to but the same treasury securities are literally interest bearing accounts at the federal reserve reserves are literally demand accounts at the federal reserve when a treasury matures a treasury securities account is marked down a reserve account is marked up when a treasury is issued a treasury securities account is marked up and a reserve account is marked down   what you 're thinking of as trillions in the hole is just trillions in a savings account balance   that 's what it means to have debt in a currency that you are the issuer of and why foreign denominated debt is fundamentally different   gt;so we can design a system that will keep inflation low while we dump money into the economy   we already have that there 's no inflation monster under the bed if there 's an inflation problem it 's that we 're so paranoid about it we 're not putting enough money into the economy and so unnecessary misery on ourselves   gt the issue in my mind with dumping money while the debt situation is such a concern is that speculators could the bed and devalue our currency   there 's nothing a speculator can do vs a sovereign currency that the issuing central bank ca n't offset so if you are a sovereign and the issuing central bank is within and beneath your authority you have the last word and there 's no such thing as bond   in contrast if you take on sovereign obligations denominated in currencies where the issuing central bank sits outside your authority as is the case when you borrow peg to foreign currency or enter a monetary union like the euro you become just another currency user here your government actually is kinda like a household and can go broke in that foreign   consider how that perspective sheds light on the mystery of why some countries actually experience a debt crisis and others do n't why contrary to all the someplace like japan for example can have 200 debt gdp and near zero interest rates and no sovereign debt crisis it 's because japan issues the yen sets the interest rate on the yen and ca n't run out of yen   people who do n't understand this are what gave the hedge funds feeling confident about the trade in 12 its name time after time they line up to place bets on japanese government bond crisis they 're always wrong and always will be

the new payment on $ 3.5 15yr would be $ compared to $ now 26 bi weekly payments but 12 months assuming the difference is nearly all interest the savings is closer to $ than   note actual savings are different the actual savings is based on the difference in interest over the year since the term will be changing i 'm looking at cash flow which is the larger concern in my opinion     $ is 60 months this is your break even time to payoff the $ higher actually since the $ 17 k will be accruing interest   i did n't see any mention of closing costs or other expenses obviously that has to be factored in as well   i think the trade off is n't worth it as the other answers suggest the rental is too close to break even now the cost of repairs on two houses is an issue in my opinion it 's less about the expenses being huge than being random you do n't get billed $ to paint the house you wake up see too many spots showing wear and get a $ 3000 bill same for all high cost items roof hvac etc   you are permitted to borrow 50 of your 401(k balance so you have $ 64 k in the account i do n't know your age this might be great or a bit low i 'd keep saving not putting any extra toward either mortgage until i had an emergency fund that was more than sufficient the fund needs to handle the unexpected expenses as well as the months of unemployment in general 6 9 months of these expenses is recommended   to be clear there are times a 401(k loan can make sense i just do n't see that it does now   disclaimer when analyzing there are two approaches the first is to look at interest saved after all interest is the expense principal payments go right to your balance sheet the second is purely cash flow in which case one might justify a higher rate and going from 15 to 30 years but freeing up cash that can be better deployed even though the rate goes up say 1/2 the payment drops due to the term take that savings and deposit to a matched 401(k and the numbers may work out very well   i offer this to explain why the math above may not be consistent with other answers of mine

you owe taxes to the state where you earned the income and also to the state where you physically live most maybe all states have laws that let you claim credits for taxes paid to other states so that you 're not paying double taxes by living in one state while working in another most states have deals with all their neighboring states so that you only have to file taxes in one for example i live in michigan and michigan borders ohio lots of people who live near the border live in one state but work in the other so the two have a deal that anyone who lives in michigan but works in ohio just has to file a michigan tax return and pay michigan taxes and anyone who lives in ohio and works in michigan just has to pay ohio taxes oh i should note that these adjacent state deals apply only to employment income not business income if you own a business in another state you 'll still have to file taxes in that state you still should get tax credits in your residence state in general the fact that you use a server in another state does n't make you liable for taxes in that state i understand that new york says that if you work from home and the company headquarters is in new york you have to pay new york taxes maybe there are a few other states who do this but just because a server is in their state i 've never heard of this if i order business supplies that are shipped from a warehouse in arizona that does n't make me liable for arizona income taxes etc   you are legally a resident of the state where you actually live if you have a home and live in it most of the time then you are a resident of the state where that home is a home does n't have to be a house it could be an apartment an rv that you live in in a trailer park a tent etc if you do n't own any sort of fixed home and you travel around a lot this could be tricky you mentioned oklahoma oklahoma defines resident as follows   an oklahoma resident is a person domiciled in this state for the entire tax year domicile is the place established as a person ’s true fixed and permanent home it is the place you intend to return whenever you are away as on     vacation abroad business assignment educational leave or military assignment a domicile once established remains until a new one is adopted i 'm not sure that that clears things up for you you ca n't just pick a state with low taxes and claim that as your residence no way is the state where you actually live going to accept that if you are in an ambiguous situation like you spend 6 months per year in state a and 6 months in state b and you have no fixed home in either maybe you stay at or live in your minivan you might get away with picking the state with the most favorable tax laws as your residence but if you spend 7 months in state a and 5 months in state b state a will almost surely claim you are a resident and owe them taxes if you regularly wander the country never spend more than a few days in any one place and rarely come back to the same place twice then you have a complicated situation and you probably need to talk to a tax lawyer

it looks like these types of companies have to disclose the health of their accounts to cftc commodity futures trading commission that is the gist i get at least from this article about the traders that lost money due to the swiss removing the franc ’s cap against the euro the article says about the u.s. retail forex brokerage most of ’s retail clients lost money in 2014 according to the company ’s disclosures mandated by the cftc the percentage of losing accounts climbed from 67 percent in the first and second quarters to 68 percent in the third quarter and 70 percent in the fourth quarter side note the swiss national bank abandoned the cap on the currency 's value against the euro in mid january 2015 but above paragraph provides data on ’s retail clients in 2014 it could consequently be concluded that even without freak events such as switzerland removing the franc cap it is more likely for an investor to not make a profit on the forex market this is also in line with what and say in their answers

the failure of the facebook ipo has everything to do with public access to markets it certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many armchair analysts in on it less investors got in on facebook at $ 38 + because they liked facebook and everyone they knew liked facebook by and large they could n't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money as such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss very few if any professionals actually it at launch and more than one pro shorted the position and cleaned up i find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice say what you want about the finance industry but for the vast majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option

first of all setting some basics what is a sound way to measure the risk of each investment in order to compare them with each other there is no single way that can be used across all asset classes risks generally speaking you want to perform both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of risks that you identify   quantitative risk assessment may involve historical data and/or parametric or non parametric models using historical data is often simple but may be hard in cases where the amount of data you have on a given event is low e.g. risk of bust by investing in a cryptocurrency parametric and non parametric risk models exist e.g. value at risk var expected shortfall es etc and abound but a lot of them are more complicated than necessary for an individual 's requirements qualitative risk assessment is simply assessing the likelihood and severity of risks by using intuition expert judgment where that applies etc one may consult with outside parties e.g. lawyers accountants bankers etc where their advisory may help highlighting some risks or understanding them better to ease comparing investment opportunities you may want to perform a risk assessment on categories of risks e.g. investing in the stock market vs bond market to compare between those categories one should look at the whole picture quantitative and qualitative with their risk appetite in mind of course after taking those macro decisions you would need to further assess risks on more micro decisions e.g. microsoft or google you would then most likely end up with better as you would be comparing items similar in nature should i always consider the worst case scenario because when i do that i always can lose everything generally speaking you want to consider everything so that you can perform a risk assessment and decide on your risk mitigating strategy see q4 by assessing the likelihood and severity of risks you may find that even in cases where you are comparatively as worse off e.g. in case of complete bust the likelihood may differ for example keeping gold in a personal stash at home vs your employer going bankrupt if you are working for a large firm do note that you want to compare risks both likelihood and severity after any risk mitigation strategy you may want to put in place e.g. maybe putting your gold in a safety box in a secure bank would make the likelihood of losing your gold essentially null is there a way to estimate the probability of such events better than intuition estimating probability or likelihood is largely dependent on data on hand and your capacity to model events for most practical purposes of an individual modelling would be way off in terms of reward benefits you may therefore want to simply research on past events and assign them a 1 5 1 being very low 5 being very high risk rating based on your assessment of the likelihood for example you may assign a 1 on your employer going bankrupt and a 2 or 3 on being this is only slightly better than intuition but has the merit of being based on data e.g. frequency of in your neighborhood should i only consider more probable outcomes and have a plan for them if they occur this depends largely on your risk appetite the more risk averse you are the more thorough you will want to be in identifying tracking and mitigating risks for the risks that you have identified as relevant or of concern you may opt to establish a risk mitigating strategy which is one of accepting sharing by taking insurance for example avoiding and reducing it may not be possible to share or reduce some risks especially for individuals and so often the response will be either to accept or avoid the given risks by opting in or out on an opportunity

cap gains and qualified dividend taxes are the same see link below   first let 's assume were talking about a taxable account in a tax deferred exempt account taxes do n't really matter capital gains taxes are only realized at the end sale so share buybacks will not have any adverse until the gains are realized which in theory should be as far out as possible whereas dividends are taxed in the year they are received because of the compounding the buybacks are better than the dividends which pay tax up front versus on the back end with buybacks yes investors are irrational but i 'm trying to take the long term rational approach additionally dividends are taxed at cap gains rates if the position is held 60 + days so all else held equal share buybacks are more tax efficient in the long run

no virtually ever item in the cpi is adjusted using hedonics which by definition can only be used to lower inflation not adjust it up   hedonics is not necessarily bad but it does n't actually reflect inflation it reflects standard of living vs. purchasing power which is not useful for a purely monetary measure   it also does not correctly reflect that despite the fact that a 1970 's 20 tv can not from an economic standpoint be directly compared to a 2012 20 tv if the price is the same adjusted for inflation inflation represents how the value of the dollar has accrued vs the value of a 20 tv which is what the definition of inflation is   so no i do n't think you 're correct on this this is also kind of glossing over the fact that the cpi essentially makes the bold argument that energy and transportation prices never affect inflation

for what it 's worth and i realize this is n't directly an answer to the question one of the advantages of sticking with mutual funds beyond their being inherently diversified is that it removes a lot of the temptation to try to time the market when you need money you sell shares in such a way that it maintains your preferred investment ratio and simply do n't worry about which stocks are   actually involved i 've gotten 15 apr this year across all my investments for absolutely minimal effort that 's quite good enough for me

this might not be the answer you are looking for but the alternative to do n't patronize these merchants is this do patronize these merchants and pay cash    credit cards are convenient   i use a credit card often   however there is no denying that they cost the merchants an incredible amount in fees and that our entire economy is paying for these fees   the price of everything is more than it needs to be because of these fees   yes you get some money back with your rewards card but the money you get back comes directly from the store you made the purchase with and the reward is paid for by increasing the price of everything you buy   in addition those among us that do not have the credit score necessary to obtain a rewards card are paying the same higher price for goods as the rest of us but do n't get the cash back reward honestly it seems quite fair to me that only the people charging purchases to a credit card should have to pay the extra fee that goes along with that payment processing   if a store chooses to do that i pay cash instead and i am grateful for the discount

budgeting is a tool for planning not for execution it sounds like you do n't have a problem budgeting planning what to spend on what things but rather with the execution of your plan that is living frugally this is primarily an issue of self control and personal psychology not an issue with the mechanics of budgeting and finance which explains why the most popular personal finance gurus dave ramsey suze deal as much with your relationship to money and spending as they do with financial knowledge there is no easy answer here but you can learn to spend less one helpful thought is to realize that whatever your current income is someone in your community is currently making less than that and surviving what would you do differently if your real actual income was $ 100 or $ 200 less than it is currently if your food budget is a concern learn to cook cheaply often this is more healthy you mentioned schooling so i assume you are on or near a college campus many colleges have all sorts of free food opportunities i used to eat free vegetarian meals weekly at a temple price of admission listening to the monk read from the fast food is of course a complete no no on low budget living it probably goes without saying but just in case you have n't cancel cable get a cheap phone plan is excellent if available in your area and otherwise see how you can squeeze a few dollars out of your bills on the subject of frugality i have found no book more enlightening than money secrets of the amish finding true abundance in simplicity sharing and saving

this may effect how much or under what terms a bank is willing to loan us i do n't think this is likely an investment is an investment whether it is money in a savings account or a loan however talk to your bank is it worth getting something by a lawyer definitely you need a lawyer and so do your parents there is a general presumption at law that arrangements between family members are not meant to be contracts you definitely want this to be a contract and engaging lawyers will make sure that it is you also definitely want this to be a proper mortgage so that you get first call on the property should your parents die or go bankrupt in addition a lawyer will be able to advise you of the pitfalls that you have n't seen if both of my parents were to pass away before the money is returned would that document be enough to ensure that the loan is returned promptly no see above tax implications will this count as taxable income for me and if so presumably my parents can still count it as a tax deduction definitely however the ato is very keen that these sorts of arrangements do not result in tax your parents will get a deduction at the rate charged you will pay tax on the greater of the rate charged or a fair commercial rate i.e. what your parents would be paying a bank for example if the going bank mortgage rate is 5.5 and you charged 2 they get the deduction for 2 you pay tax as though they had paid 5.5 property prices collapse and my parents are n't able to make their repayments bank forecloses on the place and sells it but not even enough to cover the outstanding loan meaning my parents no longer have our money i could of course double down and pay their monthly repayments for them in this case first property prices collapsing have no impact on whether your parents can pay the loan if they can it does n't matter what the property is worth if they ca n't then it will be sold as quickly as possible for an amount that covers as far as possible the first mortgagee 's indebtedness   it is only in reading this far that i realise that there will still be a bank as first mortgagee this massively increases the risk profile any other risks i have missed yes among others any for any identified risks talk to a lawyer talk to an accountant talk to an insurance professional anything i flagged as a risk that is not actually an issue no assuming you would advise doing this what fraction of savings would you recommend keeping as a rainy day fund that can be accessed immediately i would n't 100

i believe this argument is most often used when considering which debts to pay back first or when there are other options available such as investment options building up an emergency fund or saving for a large purchase   in that case it 's simply justifying making minimum payments and paying more over the life of the loan in exchange for larger liquidity in the present unfortunately when it comes to choosing between which debts to pay e.g. my mom pays more than the minimum on her car because she ca n't deduct auto loan interest despite her mortgage carrying a higher interest rate it 's only beneficial if the tax savings offsets the interest savings difference the formula for that is tax bracket > 1 target loan interest rate mortgage interest rate that said most people do n't think in the long term either by natural or by necessity need to have an emergency fund

there are certain standards that modern checks need to meet these are n't required by law but banks today generally insist on them if you are able to meet these standards and print your own checks at home you are allowed to do so one way this is commonly done is with purchased check and check printing software office supply stores sell check that fit into standard computer printers this check paper includes the necessary security features of checks and using the check printing software you can print your personal information including your name address your bank 's name and address and your account numbers the account numbers on the bottom of the checks are called the micr code which stands for magnetic ink character recognition normally these numbers were printed with special magnetic ink which was used in automated check reading machines checks that you purchase from your bank still use magnetic ink however modern check readers are optical and do n't require magnetic ink so you should be able to print checks with your printer using standard ink toner and not have a problem without purpose specific check printing software you could still buy blank check paper from the store and with a little trial and error you could print using excel   the biggest challenge with doing this would be printing the micr code you would probably need to install an micr font on your computer and play around with the size and location until you get it where you want it   doing a little googling i see that there are some check printing excel templates out there but i have n't tried any of these and it is unclear to me whether they actually print the micr or whether they assume that you have blank checks with the micr account number and check numbers already printed without purchasing blank check paper you wo n't have any of the security features such as protection anti background etc   as you mentioned if you are depositing checks via mobile phone app as some banks now allow none of these security features are doing any good   the problem however is that you are not writing checks for yourself you are writing checks to other people and you have no way of knowing whether or not their banks are going to give them trouble with your checks   there is enough check fraud out there that lots of bank tellers are very cautious   i recommend sticking with check paper that has the security features because if nothing else it will make your check look more like a real check

i had been pondering this recently myself too   this question motivated me to do a little research   it appears that what happens is that take a deep breath the capital gain does push you into the next tax bracket but the capital gain is always interpreted as the last income you received so that if your non capital gains income is less than the threshold it will all be taxed in the lower bracket and only your capital gain will be taxed in the higher bracket but it will be taxed at the capital gains rate of that higher bracket in short a capital gain can only push capital gains into higher capital gains tax brackets it can not push ordinary income into higher ordinary income tax brackets   in addition the amount of the capital gain is taxed in a marginal fashion such that any portion of the gain that will fit into a lower bracket will be taxed at a lower level with only the portion of any gain being taxed at the top rate this site is one claiming this will capital gain or dividend income push my other income into a higher tax bracket no the tax rates apply first to your ordinary income income from sources other than long term capital gains or qualifying dividends so these items that are taxed at special rates wo n’t push your other income into a higher tax bracket if my ordinary income puts me in the 15 tax bracket can i receive an unlimited amount of long term capital gain at the 0 rate no the 0 rate applies only to the amount of long term capital gain and dividend income needed to fill up the 15 tax bracket for example if your ordinary income is $ 4,000 below the figure that would put you in the 25 bracket and you have a $ 10,000 long term capital gain you ’ll pay 0 on $ 4,000 of your capital gain and 15 on the rest there are several bogleheads forum threads here here here and here that also touch on the same issue the last of those links to the irs capital gains worksheet   i traced through the logic and i believe it confirms this   here 's how it works in conclusion we now know mitt romney 's secret

you are using interchangeably borrow loan and gift they are very different for the mortgage company they would prefer that the money from friends and family be a gift if it is a loan then you   have an obligation to pay it back if they see money added to your bank accounts in the months just before getting the loan they will ask for the source of the money anything you claim as a gift will be required to be documented by you and the person making the gift you do n't want to lie about it and have the other person lie about it they will make you sign documents if they catch you in a lie you can lose the loan or be prosecuted for fraud if the money from friends and family is a loan the payments for the loan will impact the amount of money you can borrow from the view of the irs the gift tax only comes into play if during one calendar year a person makes a gift to somebody else of 14,000 or more there are two points related to this it is person to person so if your dad gives you 14 k and your mom gives you 14 k and your dad gives your wife 14k and your mom gives your wife 14 k everything is fine so two people can give 2 people 56 k in one year please use separate checks to make it clear to the irs if somebody gives a gift above the exclusion limit for the year they will have to complete irs form 709 this essentially removes the excess amount from their life time exclusion in other words from their estate   nothing to worry about from the irs the bank wants to see the documentation also you are not a charity so they ca n't claim it as a donation why do you have 6,000 in cash sitting around the mortgage company will want an explanation for all large deposits so you better have a good explanation from the irs faq on gift taxes what can be excluded from gifts the general rule is that any gift is    a taxable gift however there are many exceptions to this rule    generally the following gifts are not taxable gifts number 3 on the list is the one you care about

gt spoken like one who 's soul has already been sold   soul has been sold it 's comical how apocalyptic your conspiracy theories are just because i 'm willing to admit that not everybody at fox fits into your conspiracy theory   i do n't even know what you 're trying to say here anyways who are you implying bought my soul for what and why would my comment demonstrate that   gt real people know they 're being lied to   yes and fox news viewers include many real people which is why a portion of both viewers and presenters are indeed intelligent well meaning people looking for accurate reporting there are plenty of intelligent and self aware conservatives who are aware of media bias awareness of media bias is in large part why fox viewers were so happy to have a conservative alternative all media has bias and many people are more comfortable in the context of certain biases than others the fact there are also presenters and viewers that do n't fit this high integrity high intelligence and/or high awareness description does n't justify simplifying those who do out of the picture just to give your narrative a more pure sense of good and evil it turns out that the real world is not so conveniently simple there is bad in good there is good in bad you 're enemy may do good things or work with good people your ally may do bad things or work with bad people all people parties governments and businesses have competing interests some of which likely clash with yours and some of which probably align with yours the real world is complex   gt some people do n't understand the extent to which they are being manipulated   this is why my comment suggest that some people are one way and some people are another way there is a big jump between this claim a some statement and your more extreme suggestions all of them none of them statements by disagreeing with my comment you were making a jump to the latter which is not supported by a statement like this and requires the world into an unrealistic black and white

since the tenant reportedly left money in your mailbox and now the money is missing a crime must have been committed   as such have her file a report with law enforcement and provide you with a copy of that report remind her that for her safety it is best to file the report during daylight hours with other people present you did n't make it clear to your tenant the methods in which she could provide payment   that was a mistake   at the same time her decision to leave cash in a mailbox was foolish if she is willing to file a report with law enforcement and provide you with a copy tell her that you will split the loss and only require half her rent as a one time courtesy   make it clear that you are losing half the money too if she is not willing to file a report require the full rent

sorry even if you never file a claim for employment insurance ei you do n't get your premiums back so yes if you paid into ei and never filed a claim your contributions are as you put it wasted insofar that your premiums provided no direct benefit to you however your premiums may have provided a benefit to society perhaps even your previous colleagues   yet some would point out that a good chunk of ei premiums are likely wasted on excessive administration of the program itself   that 's government a couple of cases i 'm aware of where you may be refunded some of the ei premiums paid are meaning a legal way to avoid paying into the ei system altogether is to run your own business   of course you wo n't be able to file an ei claim if your business evaporates overnight   other kinds of claims unavailable to those who do n't pay into ei include maternity parental and sickness benefits although they recently made some changes to permit the self employed to opt in for some special benefits except in the province of quebec where there is a separate quebec parental insurance plan that also covers the self employed

i assume you 've no debt if you do then pay that off i 'd be tempted to put the money into property   if you look at property prices over the past 20 years or so you can see returns can be very good   i bought a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110 of the purchase price   disclaimer past performance is no guarantee of future returns it 's a fairly low risk option property prices appear to be rising currently and it 's always good to get your foot on the housing ladder as quickly as you can as prices can rise to the stage where even those earning quite a good salary can not afford to buy of course you do n't have to live in the house a rental income can be very handy without tying you down too much there are plenty of places in the uk where £ 60k will buy you a reasonable property with a rental income of £ it have to be near where you live currently just to put a few more figures in if you get a house for £ 50k and rent it for £ 400 a month perfectly feasible where i live then that 's very close to a 10 return year on year   plus any gains made by the price of the house the main downside is you wo n't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out   also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair you do n't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time ideally you would then sell the house around the time property prices peak and buy another when they bottom out again   not easy to judge though i 'd review the trust fund against others if you decide to keep it there as 12 over 6 years is n't great although the stock market has been depressed so it may compare keep some rainy day money spare if you can

the general concept is that your money will grow at an accelerating rate because you start getting interest paid on your returns in addition to the original investment   as a simple example assume you invest $ 100 and get 10 interest per year paid annually    the end of the first year you have your $ 100 + $ 10 interest for a total of $ 110 you start the second year with $ 110 and so 10 would be $ 11 for a total of $ 121 -the third year you start with $ 121 so 10 would be $ for a total of $ see how the amount it goes up each year increases if we were talking a higher initial amount or a larger number of years that can really add up that is essence is compound interest most of the complicated looking formulas you see out there for compound interest are just shortcuts so you do n't have to go through the above exercise a bunch of times to find out how much you would have after some number of years this formula tells you how much you would after a certain number of   at a given interest assuming they pay interest n times per year for example you would use 12 for n if it paid interest monthly instead of yearly p represents the   amount you started out with    if you keep investing monthly as shown in your example instead of just depositing it and letting it sit you have to use a more complicated formula finance people refer to this as calculating the future value of an annuity   that formula looks like this a = pmt 1 + 1 r x   a is the amount you would have at the end of the time period    n the number of compounding periods months if you get interest calculated monthly    pmt the total amount you are putting in each period n     r just like before the interest rate you are getting paid be sure to adjust this to a monthly number if n represents months divide apr by 12 most interest rates are quoted as apr which is the annualized interest rate not counting compounding do n't confuse this with apy which has compounding built into it and is not appropriate for use in this formula inserting your example r monthly interest rate = 15 apr 12 = n = 30 years 12 months year = 360 months    a = $ 150 x 1 + 1 x a = $ rounded

they are two different animals when you rent you are purchasing a service   the landlord as your service provider has to make a profit pay employees to do maintenance and buy materials the price of these things will increase with inflation and that rolls into your rent price taxes also are passed to the tenant and those tend to only go upward market forces of supply demand will drive fluctuation of prices as well as other posts have described when you buy you are purchasing just the asset the home this price will also be driven by supply demand in the market but do n't try to compare it to buying a service cheers

as the op expressed their thought it seemed to me they were suggesting or rather anyone who is rich however that is defined non invested money be taxed at this high rate and that strikes me as naive you do n't think they would leave the country or invest it in a savings account earning .05 or most likely spread across many so it was fdic insured    gt i bet the rich would find something to do with that idle cash overnight if it was taxed at a 75 rate or so     they were basically suggesting the us government the savings of wealthy people    the question of whether the highest effective tax rate on income should be raised is   a completely different discussion personally i favor a higher tax rate and some new tax brackets for the very highest earners i do n't really think it 's necessarily fair in a progressive system to treat the rich as a piggy bank but it is what it is they benefit the most so they are called to contribute the most    i think i 'd favor some kind of alternative minimum tax for rich people so they had to pay a minimum of of their income above some sort of cap 5 million per year 100 million per year and capital gains   applied this would close the buffet loophole    my biggest reason for this though is not because i do n't think they deserve their money it 's because coffers basically guarantee that the legislation will be written for them and by them there is always this tension between the poor and middle class that want more services and the upper class that wants to pay less taxes    i am starting to get to the point where i think it might be better to have a smaller government and less services because they abuse their power and our money so much sopa afghanistan and iraq wars etc i do like the idea of social safety nets but perhaps those should be more local    anyways sorry for the wall of text

sounds like you have a in your ear the coinage act does n't restrict you from using foreign currency or lawful commodity or service to fulfill a debt you are free to do that whenever you enter into an explicit or implicit contract with another party if that was n't the case your kid trading his bag of chips for a bag of cookies at lunch would be a criminal act   it does mean that you ultimately must accept us currency to settle a debt following the previous example if your kid gives his friend the bag of chips but the cookies get destroyed somehow before being transferred the friend can offer a couple of dollars to complete the transaction the whole point of the coinage acts is to set a level playing field if you do n't pick one dominant store of value you have a situation where it is impossible to evaluate the cost of goods and services it has nothing to do with some competition with foreign currency a robust modern economy requires an adequate supply of capital and a common reference point for value within the economy think about it further with respect to article 1 section 10 of the constitution would you want a fiscally profligate state like california or new york to be able to print money and compel you as a contractor employee or creditor to accept their scrip as payment or worse require payment in gold or vermont issued dollars but pay you in their money of course not that 's why the federal government controls the currency and a dollar in alaska is the same as a dollar in georgia

blue sky laws refer to various state laws requiring disclosure in new security offerings here 's a summary a blue sky law is a state law in the united states that regulates the    offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud    though the specific provisions of these laws vary among states they    all require the registration of all securities offerings and sales as    well as of stockbrokers and brokerage firms each state 's blue sky law    is administered by its appropriate regulatory agency and most also    provide private causes of action for private investors who have been    injured by securities fraud from the united states securities and exchange commission every state has its own securities laws commonly known as blue sky    laws that are designed to protect investors against fraudulent sales    practices and activities while these laws can vary from state to    state most states laws typically require companies making small    offerings to register their offerings before they can be sold in a    particular state the laws also license brokerage firms their    brokers and investment adviser representatives

first of all realize that buying a home is n't really an investment   it is cheaper to rent   in recent years people were able to sell their houses for astronomical profits but that wo n't be happening much in the future   additionally there are many hidden costs of owning a home regarding the mortgage interest tax deduction do n't buy a house just to get this   it is like spending $ 1 to get back some amount of money less than $ 1   so just keep that in mind are you debt free   if not pay off your other debts before buying a home   i follow the advice of dave ramsey so i 'll echo it here   make sure you have an emergency fund and no debt at this point i think you are ready to buy a house   when you do put down as much as you can above 20 if possible   then get a 15 year fixed rate mortgage at this point start saving for your kid 's college if you believe in that and paying down your home having no mortgage is a dream many people never have   i can not wait until i have no mortgage   do n't get suckered into getting a high priced loan   pay down as much of the price of the house as possible up front   this gives you flexibility too   what if you need to sell quickly   well you will have equity from the get go so this will be much easier good luck with your purchase

i think we are roughly in agreement but i should stress   gt ca n't blame capitalism for shitty politicians   shitty politicians are a natural result of capitalism out of control the big owners call the shots the politicians that take the bribes win elections bc the money buys exposure thru once again private media    the politicians with any amount of ethics or servitude to their electorate will be starved of funds they tend to lose the evolution of the honorable politician to the corrupt one has been a consequence of obscene money the sort of money that apple et al make or the most insidious the federal reserve which is privately owned by a cabal of the richest bankers they get to print money to lend to the government at interest whenever the gov needs to issue bonds they determine interest rates their objective is to make more money for themselves they are not there to provide a service to the people    tl;dr you can not get non shitty politicians without controlling capitalism adam smith warned us 250 years ago in his seminal wealth of nations that a business dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers   the interest of manufacturers and merchants in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the public the proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most but with the most suspicious attention

the economy is not zero sum just because one group is experiencing exponential growth does n't mean they 're exploiting others to achieve it    to figure out whether or not those people deserve their wealth we have to examine exactly how it was accomplished did they lobby to shut out competitors did they take advantage of ip laws did they receive subsidies did they benefit from tax credits did they use eminent domain and for each of these questions follow up with the question of how much these actions affected their bottom line profitability   anything less than this level of examination is lazy analysis and should be regarded as such

nobody can predict the affects of brexit but it is wise to consider them we saw the pound weaken after the vote to leave and it is possible the pound will weaken further after brexit and this devaluation could be quite dramatic if that happens it is likely to increase inflation uk inflation has gone from under 1 around the time of the referendum to 3 today and it could well go higher if inflation continues to increase the bank of england is likely to put up interest rates as it has historically done this to hedge against inflation   we have been living in a world of artificially low interest rates since the global crash of 2008 as the boe has tried to stimulate recovery with lower rates   the rates can not continue at this level if inflation starts to rise that in turn will put up mortgage rates   so for example if you have a £ 100k mortgage at currently this is a reasonable rate to have your repayments will be £ 523 a month   if your mortgage rate goes up to say 7 then your repayments are £ a month if it goes up to 10 then it 's £ a month and so on there is a mortgage calculator you can use to try playing with different amounts here my advice would therefore be try to get as small a mortgage as you can and make sure you can afford it quite comfortably in case rates go up and you need to find a few hundred pounds a month extra there are other risks from brexit as well house prices could fall as people decide not to buy properties due to excessive interest rates overall nobody knows what will happen but it is good to be planning ahead for all i am not a financial advisor this advice is given in good faith but with no financial qualification

buying a house is often more emotional than financial which makes that kind of advice tough to offer staying with the finance side you wrote 2 bedrooms is enough for me is it enough for your girlfriend is she on the same schedule for kids as you are 2 bedrooms means that with just one child you are less able to host a guest and the second child will need to share the bedroom nothing wrong with that just making sure you are aware of these things if the long term plan is to move to a new house a ten year horizon for the second house sounds good to me   i 'll make one brief comment on rent vs buy it 's easy to buy too big and discover you are paying for rooms you do n't use i have a house i 'll be glad to get rid of when our daughter goes off to college a dining room and formal living room go unused save for 3 or 4 days a year it already sounds like you 'll avoid this mistake   your question the right time when you are ready with the downpayment income and desire to do so you should at least have a feeling you plan to stay there for a time else the cost of buying selling would exceed any potential gain

how much should my down payment be ideally 20 of the purchase price because with 20 of the purchase price you do n't have to pay a costly private mortgage insurance pmi   if you do n't have 20 down and come across a good property to purchase it is still a good idea to go forward with purchasing with what you are comfortable with because renting long term is generally never a good idea if you want to build wealth and become financially independent how much should i keep in my emergency fund people say 3 12 months of living expenses   keep in mind though in most cases if you lose your job you are entitled to unemployment benefits from the government how long should my mortgage be 30 year amortization is the best you can always opt to pay more each month   but having that leverage with a 30 year loan can allow you to invest your savings in other opportunities which can yield more than mortgage interest best of luck

rich people use depositor banks the same way the rest of us use banks to keep a relatively small store of wealth for monthly expenses and a savings account for a rainy day the bulk of a wealthy person 's money is in investments money sitting in a bank account is not making you more money and in fact as correctly points out would be losing value to inflation now all investments have risk that 's why interest exists if in some alternate universe charging interest were illegal across the board nobody would loan money because there 's nothing to be gained and a lot to lose you have to make it worth my while for me to want to loan you my money because sure as you 're going to use my loan to make yourself wealthier a wealthy person will choose a set of investments that represent an overall level of risk that he is comfortable with much like you or i would do the same with our retirement funds early in life we 're willing to take a lot of risk because there 's a lot of money to be made and time to recover from any losses closer to retirement we 're much more risk averse because if the market takes a sudden downturn we lose a significant portion of our nest egg with little hope of it before we have to start cashing out the very wealthy have similar variances in risk with the significant difference that they are typically already drawing a living from their investments as such they already have some risk aversion but at the same time they need good returns and so they must pay more attention to this balancing act between risk and return managing their investments in effect becomes their new job once they do n't have to work for anyone else anymore the money does the real work and they make the executive decisions about where best to put it the tools they use to make these decisions are the same ones we have they watch market trends to identify stages of the economic cycle that large movements of money to or from safe havens like gold and t debt they diversify their investments to shield the bulk of their wealth from a sudden localized loss they hire investment managers to have a second pair of eyes and additional expertise in navigating the market you or i can do much the same thing by buying shares in managed investment funds or simply consulting a broker the difference is that the wealthy get a more personal touch so what 's the difference between the very wealthy and the rest of us well first is simple scale when a person with a net worth in the hundreds of millions makes a phone call or personal visit to the financial institutions handling their money there 's a lot of money on the line in making sure that person is well looked after if we get screwed over at the teller window and decide to close our the teller can often give us our entire account balance in cash without an our multimillionaire is at the lower end of being able to alter his banks profit loss statements by his decisions and so his bank will fight to keep his business second is the level of control the very wealthy the upper 1 have more or less direct ownership and control over many of the major means of production in this country the factories mines timber farms software houses power plants recording studios etc that generate things of value and therefore new wealth while the average joe can buy shares in these things through the open market their investment is typically a drop in the bucket and their voice in company decisions equally small our decision therefore is largely to invest or not to invest the upper 1 on the other hand have controlling interests in their investments often majority holdings that allow them far more control over the businesses they invest in who 's running them and what they do

probing for hidden limit orders usually involves sending the orders and then cancelling them before they get filled if they do n't get filled with trades actually going through multiple times for small amounts it looks more like a vwap strategy where the trader is feeding small volumes into the market as part of a larger trade trying to minimize average cost it could be probing but without seeing the orders and any cancels it would be difficult to tell edit i just had another thought it could possibly be a market maker unwinding a bad position caused by other trading sometimes they drip trades into the market to prevent themselves from hitting big orders etc that might move back against them this is probably not right but is just another thought source i work for an organization that provides monitoring for these things to many large trading organizations

for restricted stock i think the vesting date meets the requirements of the second wash sale trigger from irs pub 550 wash sales acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade i base this on these two quotes from irs pub 525 restricted property any income from the property or the right to use the property is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property until the property becomes substantially vested it is owned by the person who makes the transfer to you usually your employer   so on the vest date the transfer is taxable ownership is transferred to you that seems close enough to a fully taxable trade for me   maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date see pub 525 restricted property choosing to include in income for year of transfer obviously if this is important you should consult your tax advisor   technicalities aside i do n't think it passes the sniff test you 're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests if you 're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date that smells like a wash sale to me

i do n't think either of these answers are accurate a beta of 0 means that your stock portfolio does not change accordingly or with the market rather it acts independent a beta above 0 means the stock follows what the market does which means if the market goes up the stock goes up if the market goes down the stock goes down if the stock 's beta is more than 1 the stock will go up more if the market goes up or go down more if the market goes down inversely if the stock is less than 0 the stock will follow the market inversely so if the market goes up the stock goes down if the market goes down the stock goes up again a greater negative beta the more this relationship will be exaggerated

you ca n't directly contribute more however it seems that there is something you can do that can achieve a similar effect you can withdraw your entire account principal + earnings though in your case that 's less than the principal and then contribute up to the $ 5500 contribution limit again the end result is that you put in a net amount of $ 500 and the account ends up with $ 5500 which is what you want the first step is a return of contributions made for the contribution year before the tax filing deadline for that year this kind of withdrawal is not subject to tax and counts as if you never made the contribution at all since you are considered to have never made a contribution you still have $ 5500 that you can contribute before you hit the limit

do n't be afraid to shop around every couple of years when it 's time to renew my auto insurance i call a couple of places to see if i can get a better deal it 's especially important to do this as you get older because your rates go down assuming you keep a clean driving record also as your life changes e.g. if you get married move buy a home get a new car etc at 30 my rates dropped a lot when i bought a home i qualified for a discount by combining my home and auto insurance through the same carrier my suggestion would be to call 3 insurance companies for quotes all on the same day you 'll need to be able to identify the car you 'll be insuring for the most accurate quote do you belong to any organizations that offer insurance discounts e.g. my college alumni association had a program with one of the larger carriers that had the best rates on that i could find

this is an unfortunate situation for you   you have zero chance at your question number 1 if someone was going to bend this rule for you it would have happened already   the answer to question number 2 is pursue solution number 3 the overriding issue is that the irs makes these rules not the employer plan sponsor or the administrator   you ca n't talk the plan administrator in to reimbursing you their system likely does n't even have a function to do so fsa timing issues can be complex and i think that 's the root of your issue because when an expense can be incurred date of service versus date of payment and when a claim must be filed are different things it 's really common to bend the rules on when a claim is submitted but not when it was incurred    it 's really common for an exiting employee to have 30 days to submit expenses for reimbursement   fsa expenses must always be incurred within the specified plan year or within your dates of employment if you were n't employed for the entire plan year this is specified by the irs   it seems like some wires were crossed when you asked this question   you were asking can i still incur claims and they were hearing how long do i have to submit an expense that has already been incurred some plans allow cobra continuation on fsa which generally does not make sense   your contributions to the plan would use after tax dollars but for folks who know they have an eligible expense coming it can make sense to continue via cobra in retain your eligibility under the plan so you can incur a claim after your employment termination regarding number 3   this sort of reimbursement would be outside the plan no precedent is necessary   you 've gotten them to claim it was their mistake they 're going to reimburse you for their mistake it has nothing to do with the fsa good luck

news about a company is not the only thing that affects its stock 's price there is also supply and demand   that of course is influenced by news but it is not the only actor   an insider with a large position in their company 's stock may want to diversify his overall portfolio and thus need to sell a large amount of stock   that may be significant enough to increase supply and likely reduce the stock 's price somewhat that brings me to another influence on stock price perception   executives and other insiders with large positions in their company 's stock have to be careful about how and when they sell some of that stock as to not worry the markets   many investors watch insider selling to gauge the health of the company which brings me to another important point   there are many things that may be considered news which is material to a certain company and its stock   it is not just quarterly filings earnings reports and such   there is also news related to competitors news about the economy or a certain sector news about some weather event that affects a major supplier news about a major earthquake that will impact the economy of a nation which can then have knock on effects to other economies etc there are also a lot of investors with varying needs which will influence supply and demand   an institutional investor needing to diversify may reduce their position in a stock and thus increase supply enough that it impacts the stock 's price   meanwhile individual investors will make their transactions at varying times during the day   in the aggregate that may have significant impacts on supply and demand the overall point being that there are a lot of inputs and a lot of actors in a complicated system   even if you focus just on news there are many things that fall into that category news does not come out at regular intervals and it does not necessarily spread evenly   that alone could make for a highly variable environment

interest means that the money on the accounts belongs to you regardless of who 's name is the account titled to for example if you give money to someone non us person say   trying to avoid fbar requirements and that person puts it in his account but will give you money whenever you ask for it you have interest in that account this is in order for people not to avoid fbar requirements by putting their money into someone 's else accounts signature authority means that although the account is not in your name and the money on it is not your money you have the right to access that account and perform operations on it this usually happens when people are employees of a company and have signature authority over the company 's accounts but it is also frequently the case for people having signature authority over the accounts that belong to their family members for example your parents are not us persons but they gave you access to their account because they do n't know how to work with the bank and you do you have signature authority over the account if you have your own account you have both interest in it and signature authority over it

if the $ 300 due on a credit card is due at the end of the month and you make 2 payments of $ 150 during the month the first half way through the month and the second at the end of the month then yes you will save on interest note if this is a credit card with an interest free period and you are paying the total amount due before the due date then it will not save you anything by paying part of it earlier interest on credit card is calculated daily so if you pay $ 150 half way through the month then you will pay 2.5 x $ 150 365 days x 15 days = $ 0.15 less in interest than if you paid the full $ 300 at the end of the month the higher the interest rate and the more you pay early the higher the savings will be

making extra principal payments will reduce the term of your loan i would n't sign up for a biweekly schedule just do it yourself so you have more flexibility a simple spreadsheet will allow you to play what if and make it clear that extra principal payments are most effective early in the term of the loan my wife and i paid off our home in less than 10 years with this approach some will say that the opportunity costs of not using that money for something else outweighs the gains i would say that not having a mortgage has a positive impact on your cash flow and your assets you own the home which combine to create more opportunity not less that being said it should be obvious that paying off higher interest debt first is the priority paying off a zero percent interest car loan early is just foolish

i 've investigated this and banks are willing to offer a deal similar to what you ask you would take out a securities backed loan which provides you with the down payment on the property for the remainder you take out a regular mortgage   jaganalyst wonders why banks would accept this simple because there 's money to be made both on the securities backed loan and the mortgage both parts of the deal are financially sound from the banks perspective now the 20 number is perhaps a bit low having 20 of the value in shares means you 'd be able to get a loan for 50 of that so only a 10 downpayment

true my thinking is the higher the rates are the less people you 'll have borrowing the less chance of people defaulting more people buying with flat cash and of course cheaper housing prices   whereas with low interest rates you 'll have more people borrowing thus increasing the likelihood of more people defaulting more people buying homes technically not buying technically just borrowing money and putting down mortgages and more expensive housing prices   quite frankly i think the way that the western world can solve its issue with unaffordable housing is by raising the interest rates to at least the double digits like they once were when housing was still cheap

diversification is just one aspect in an investment portfolio the other aspects in investment are risk taking ability liquidity local regulations tax benefits ease convenience cost of carrying out transactions etc investing in other regions is prone fx risk and other risks depending on the region of investment for example investing in emerging markets there is a risk of local regulations being changed additional tax being levied or political instability and host of such risks   investing in local markets give you better understanding of such changes and the risk associated is less plus the ease of carrying out transactions is great less expensive compared to cost of transactions in other markets diversification in investment should also be looked upon how much you invest in equities debt bullion real estate    once you have a sizeable amount of investment in equities or debt it would then make more sense to diversify this portion more to include funds from other regions unless you are an running your own business it makes sense to invest in your line of business if that is performing well the reason being that the benefit returns from the equities is much greater than the salary rise bonus for example i am in information technology and yet invest in all leading it companies because the returns from companies in these segments have been good

straight line depreciation is the easiest method of depreciation do n't over think it   straight line = assets cost assets salvage life   in this case the straight line is $ 2 m per year it is not unless you are looking at accumulated depreciation account on the balance sheet   here is a schedule of the depreciation   year 1 $ 2 m year 2 $ 2 m year 3 $ 2 m year 4 $ 2 m year 5 $ 2 m   see ca n't get much easier than that   once you get into more complicated questions they 'll throw tax rates at you and ask about cash flows or the npv of the cash flows   you need to take into account the fact that the depreciation is not a cash expense but it does affect cash flow by reducing the taxable income of the project   also you need to consider the fact that the asset will be sold in year 5 and the value will need to be part of your cash flow and npv calculations   i hope this was helpful if not i 'll try to do my best answering any other questions   good luck

here are some things you want to look at for evaluating a bank or credit union for your regular spending accounts convenience   do they have a branch in a convenient location for you   do they have no fee atms near you website   if you are like me you will spend more time on the bank 's website than you do inside a branch   some bank 's websites are great some are terrible   unfortunately this is generally difficult to evaluate until you actually get an account   you want a website that is easy to use   it should allow you to easily move money between your accounts get instant lists of transactions show you your monthly statements and have a billpay feature that works well   if you use budgeting software that interfaces online with your bank you want to ensure that it works well with your bank fee structure   some banks will nickel and dime you to death   watch out for minimum balance fees and atm fees   banks and credit unions usually have a fee schedule page on their website that lists every fee they charge making it easy to compare different banks    i would not be very concerned about interest rates for savings   currently all savings accounts have a universally terrible interest rate   therefore i would n't base my bank choice on the interest rate   sure one might offer double the interest rate of another but double next to nothing is still next to nothing   when you accumulate enough savings that you want to start maximizing your earnings you can look for a better rate at another bank to move your savings to and you can keep your checking account at the bank with the best convenience and fee structure in my limited experience i have had better luck with credit unions than with banks when it comes to fees

the other answers have offered some great advice but here is an alternative that has n't been mentioned yet i 'm assuming that you have an adequately sized emergency fund in savings and that your cars are your only non mortgage debt since you still have car debt you probably do n't have anything saved for buying a new car when your current cars are at the end of life consider paying off your car loans early then begin saving for your next car having cash in the bank for a car is very freeing and it changes your mindset when it comes time to purchase a car as it is easy to waste a lot of money on something that depreciates rapidly when you are n't paying for it immediately   this approach might be counterintuitive if your car loan interest rate is less than your mortgage rate but you will probably need another car before you need another house and paying cash for a car is worth doing

the us customs and border protection website states that there is no limit to the amount of currency that can be brought into or taken out of the us    there is no limit on the amount of money that can be taken out of or brought into the united states however if a person or persons traveling together and filing a joint declaration cbp form have $ 10,000 or more in currency or negotiable monetary instruments they must fill out a report of international transportation of currency and monetary instruments fincen 105 former cf the cbp site also notes that failure to declare currency and monetary instruments in excess of $ 10,000 may result in its seizure further the site states that the requirement to report currency on a fincen 105 does not apply to imports of gold bullion   however the legal website the law dictionary includes details of how money laundering laws may come into play here as part of the war on terror and the war on drugs u.s. law enforcement agencies have significantly increased their over money laundering to this effect travelers who carry large amounts of cash without supporting documentation of its legitimate source may be subject to secondary inspections and seizure of funds in some cases law enforcement may confiscate cash in excess of $ 10,000 until supporting documents are produced so far i have described the official position   however reading between the lines i think it is fair to say that in the current climate if you show up at an entry point with a suitcase full of a large amount of cash you would face considerable scrutiny regardless of any supporting documentation you may present if you fail to present supporting documentation then i think your cash would certainly be seized   if you are a us resident then you would be given the opportunity to obtain satisfactory documentation   if you did present documentation then i think your cash would be held for as long as it would take to verify the validity of the documentation   failure to present valid documentation would result in money laundering charges being brought against you and the matter would rest before the courts if you are not a us resident then failing to produce supporting documentation would mean your cash being seized and entry into the us would almost certainly be denied   you would then have to deal with the situation from outside of the us   if you did produce supporting documentation then again i suspect the cash would be held for as long as it takes to verify the validity of the documentation   whether or not you were allowed to enter the us would depend on what other documentation you possess

what is the question   a total return fund seeks to just maximize total returns as opposed to benchmark tracking low vol high vol sectoral whatever this is just a name you got ta read the long prospectus to see how they are supposed to go about doing it   fixed income investing does not rely on on interest rates it relies on the movements of interest rates this is a key difference   when economies are doing poorly there is a flight to quality everyone is scared and lends only to governments driving government interest rate downs and increasing the spread between government rates and corporates   my usual advice is there is never a good time to buy a mutual fund :p better to buy an etf or a portfolio of etf 's that correspond to your views   you need to sit down and ask yourself what type of risk tolerances you 're willing to take as mutual funds by construction deliver negative alpha due to fees

you own a fractional share of the company maybe you should care enough to at least read the proxy statements which explain the pro and con position for each of the issues you are voting on that does n't seem like too much to ask on the other hand if you are saying that the people who get paid to be knowledgeable about that stuff should just go make the decisions without troubling you with the details then choose the option to go with their recommendations which are always clearly indicated on the voting form however if you do this it might make sense to at least do some investigation of who you are voting onto that board i guess as said you could just abstain but i 'm not sure how that is any different than just trashing the form as for the idea that proxy votes are tainted somehow the one missing piece of that conspiracy is what those people have to gain are you implying that your broker who has an interest in you making money off your investments and liking them would fraudulently cast proxy votes for you in a way that would harm the company and your return why exactly would they do this i find your stance on the whole thing a bit confusing though you seem to have some strong opinions on corporate governance but at the same time are n't willing to invest any effort in the one place you have any control over the situation i 'm just update per the following information from the sec website it looks like the meaning of a proxy vote can vary depending on the mechanics of the specific issue you are voting on my emphasis added what do for against withhold mean on the proxy card or voter instruction form    depending on what you are voting on    the proxy card or voting instruction    form gives you a choice of voting    for against or abstain or    for or withhold here is an    explanation of the differences election of directors generally    company bylaws or other corporate    documents establish how directors are    elected there are two main types of    ways to elect directors    vote and majority vote a vote means that the    winning candidate only needs to get    more votes than a competing candidate    if a director runs he or    she only needs one vote to be elected    so an against vote is meaningless    because of this shareholders have the    option to express with    a candidate by indicating that they    wish to withhold authority to vote    their shares in favor of the    candidate a substantial number of    withhold votes will not prevent a    candidate from getting elected but it    can sometimes influence future    decisions by the board of directors    concerning director nominees a majority vote means that directors    are elected only if they receive a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this case    you have the choice of voting for    each nominee against each nominee    or you can abstain from voting your    shares an abstain vote may or may    not affect a director 's election each    company must disclose how abstain or    withhold votes affect an election in    its proxy statement this information    is often found toward the beginning of    the proxy statement under a heading    such as votes required to adopt a    proposal or how your votes are    counted proposals other than an election of    directors matters other than voting    on the election of directors like    voting on shareholder proposals are    typically approved by a vote of a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this    situation you are usually given the    choice to vote your shares for or    against a proposal or to abstain    from voting on it again the effect    of an abstain vote may depend on the    specific voting rule that applies the    company 's proxy statement should again    disclose the effect of an abstain    vote

it was 15 to 1 before the sec decided that big banks needed to be able to risk wiki   it also started teh distrust between banks with 15 to 1 you were pretty sure that another bank you were dealing with was leveraged exactly 15 to 1 when he removed that requirement then banks had a much harder time judging the health of other banks they were dealing with    you just did nt know if they were 20 to 1 or 30 to 1 or higher without going through all their books   this was one of the main reasons the recession was so large in scope housing would have exploded eventually but without the leverage regulations they were able to make it hurt far far far far far far worse several times worse

you ca n't transfer mortgages when you purchase a new property you can purchase a new property now or you can refinance your current property now and leverage yourself as far as possible while rates are low the higher rates you are worried about may not be as bad as you think with higher interest rates that may put downward pressure on housing prices or when rates do rise it may simply move from historic lows to relative lows i had a mortgage at 4.25 that i never bothered refinancing even though rates went much lower because the savings in interest paid minus my tax deduction for mortgage interest did n't amount to more than the cost of refinancing if rates go back up to 5 that will still be very affordable

are there banks where you can open a bank account without being a citizen of that country without having to visit the bank in person i 've done it the other way around opened a bank account in the uk so i have a way to store gbp   given that britain is still in the eu you can basically open an account anywhere   german online banks for instance allow you to anything online should there be cards issued you would need an address in the country   and for opening an account a passport is sufficient you can identify yourself in a video chat   now what 's the downside   french banks online services are in french german banks services are in german   if that does n't put you off i would name such banks in the comments if asked are there any online services for investing money that are n't tied to any particular country can you clarify that   you should at least be able to buy into any european or american stock through your broker   that should give you an ease of mind being fca regulated   however those are usually global depository receipts and denominated in gbp pence so you 'd be visually exposed to currency rates by which i mean that if the stock goes up 1 but the gbp goes up 1 in the same period then your gdr would show a 0 profit on that day also and more dividends are distributed in the foreign currency then exchanged by the issuer of the gdr on that day and booked into your account so if you want to be in full control of the cashflows you should get a trading account denominated in the currency and maybe situated in the country you 're planning to invest in if you 're really serious about it some brokers banks offer multi currency trading accounts again i will name them if asked where you can trade a wide range of instruments i.e. on the primary exchanges and you get to manage everything in one interface   those accounts typically include access to the foreign exchange markets so you can move cash between your accounts freely well for a surcharge   also typically each subaccount is issued its own iban

while the us hosts most of the world 's innovative startups its own financial and banking systems are very slow to change   the infrastructure exists however the ach transfers are not wide spread between individuals banks much prefer the option of bill pay i.e. as you said mailing a check something in other countries people would n't even think of than letting you do it yourself   why because they can there 's no real competition over consumers and the consumers themselves are not educated or sophisticated thus the banks are comfortable with the lack of innovation since as long as they are all lacking innovation consumers wo n't demand it because they wo n't even know things are possible and it is definitely cheaper for the banks not to innovate and keep your money for a week while the bill pay check is en route than try and develop new things in other countries the regulator would step up and force banks to develop new infrastructure and widen the options but in the us regulation is considered a bad thing and people are easily swayed being uneducated and uninformed by the corporations to support politicians who act against their people 's best interest in protecting the corporations and reducing and limiting the regulators even further

it 's one of those things where it was meant economically for the first purpose opportunity cost but has been used by big corporations for the later since you have to have international divisions to really even make it work to some degree it does on the state level however the tax breaks are n't really big enough for it to make sense since the federal is the big one    it 's also a huge reason why big corps have such low effective domestic tax rates on big profits and why the government is debating about restructuring tax law to prevent most forms of you 'd pay taxes on gross income essentially it gets much more complicated than that but france effectively does this now   also it 's very much an accounting thing and accountants tend not to have a big seat at the table hence the reasoning behind stuff often get lost on upper mgmt or they fire the accountant etc that 's a big part of why it often makes things worse even when when the principal makes sense economically

does location of ea or cpa matter   not in particular the ftb has field offices all over the state so if a meeting needs to be arranged it will be in the nearest office when you interview the potential candidates you can ask them how they would deal the case if there 's a need of an in person visit to the ftb and if it is even an option you should be worrying about likely not since as you mentioned before you 're in a mail audit process are there websites that rate eas or cpas for example on how many audits they have won or should i simply rely on ratings there 's no winning in audits ideally given the same data any ea or cpa would reach the same result in the discussion re audits with the ftb obviously some are more experienced and some are less and some are specializing on specific types of audits entities etc yelp is a place to start but take the reviews there with a grain of salt since most reviewers are probably there to rant if you see a repetitive pattern in the reviews take that into consideration for example you probably do n't want to hire someone who 's been repeatedly to their clients not returning calls not answering questions being late etc are all eas and cpas equal   no some are some specialize in a specific area some build practice on representation irs or ftb or both some provide a wide range of services from bookkeeping to tax court representation i suggest looking for those who prominently advertise themselves as specializing in your area whatever your type of business is and representation in front of the ftb specialists especially experienced cost much more keep in mind you 'll be getting what you paid for also when you hire a big shot ea cpa check who 's actually going to do the work and how much oversight the big shot is going to provide anything else that i potentially missed any specific questions that i should ask ea or cpa on initial interview for example if my ea cpa could also talk with auditor in case ftb would want to talk directly with taxpayer if possible well that 's the point of representation to represent they should be talking to the ftb in your name you should verify credentials irs for eas ca cba for cpas make sure their license is current you can ask them about their continued education and how much of it is dedicated to the ca state law and ftb regulations ask them about their experience with similar cases overall a decently qualified tax professional should be able to handle a mail audit without an issue in person representation may be harder since it does not only require being competent in the tax law but also have some people skills

what they re fishing for is whether the money was earned in the u.s.   it 's essentially an interest shelter and/or avoiding double taxation    they 're saying if you keep income you make outside the us in a bank inside the us the us thanks you for storing your foreign money here and does n't tax the interest but the nation where you earned that income might    there is no question that the airbnb income is connected with a us trade or business    so your next question is whether the fraction of interest earned from that income can be broken out or whether irs requires you to declare all the interest from that account    honestly given the amount of tax at stake it may not be worth your time researching    now since you seem to be a resident nonresident alien it seems apparent that whatever economic value you are creating to earn your salary is being performed in the united states if this is for an american company and wages paid in usd no question that 's a us trade or business but what if it 's for a swedish company running on swedish servers serving and paid in to a swedish bank which you then transfer to your us bank does it matter if your boots are on sovereign us soil   this is a complex question and some countries uk say if your boots are in our nation it is trade income in our nation others ca do not   this is probably a separate question to search or ask to be clear the fact that your days as a teacher or do not count toward residency is a separate question from whether your salary as same counts as us income

i think by definition there are n't generally speaking any indicators as in chart indicators i assume you mean   for fundamental analysis off the top of my head i ca n't think of one chart indicator that i would n't call technical even though a couple could possibly go either way and i 'm sure someone will help prove me wrong but the point i want to make is that to do fundamental analysis it is most certainly more time consuming depending on what instrument you 're investing in you need to have a micro perspective company specific details and a macro perspective about the industry it 's in if you 're investing in sector etfs or the like you 'd be more reliant on the macro analysis if you 're investing in commodities you 'll need to consider macro analysis in multiple countries who are big producers consumers of the item there 's no cut and dried way to do it however i personally opt for a macro analysis of sector etfs and then use technical analysis to determine my entry and/or exit

first   great job on getting it together   this is good for your family in any respect i can think of   this is a life long process and skill but it will pay off for you and yours if you work on it your problem is that you do n't seem to know where you money goes   you ca n't decide how your expenses are until you know what they are   looking at just your committed expenses and ignore the other stuff might be the problem here   you state that you feel you live modestly but you need to be able to measure it completely to decide i would suggest an online tool like mint.com if you can get it in your country because it will go back for 90 days and get transactions for you   if you primarily work in cash this is n't helpful but based on your credit card debt i am hoping not   although a cash lifestyle would be good if you tend to overspend take the time and sort your transactions into categories   do n't setup a budget just sort them out   i like to limit the number of categories for clarity sake especially to start do n't get too crazy and do n't get too detailed at first   if you buy a magazine at the grocery store just call it groceries once you know what you spend then you can setup a budget for the categories   if somethings are important create new categories   if one category is a problem then break it down and find the specific issue the key is that you budget not be more than you earn but also representative of what you spend follow up with mint every other day or every weekend so the categorization is a quick and easy process   put it on your iphone and do it at every lunch break   share the information with your spouse and talk about it often

whether to employ a payroll service to handle the taxes and possibly the payroll itself is a matter that depends on how savvy you are with respect to your own taxes and with using computers in general if you are comfortable using programs such as excel or quicken or turbotax or taxact etc then taking care of payroll taxes on a nanny 's wages all by yourself is not too hard   if you take a full of receipts and to your accountant each april to prepare your personal income tax returns and sign whatever the accountant puts in front of you as your tax return then you do need to hire a payroll service it will also cost you a bundle since there are no economies of scale to help you there is only one employee to be paid

you will often receive a lower bill if you simply wait for a second or third billing statement i was once given the advice to never pay a medical bill until after they had sent three notices because they will almost certainly reduce the amount due sounds crazy right i have excellent credit so the idea of risking it by ignoring bills disturbed me greatly and i at the advice   i then had a similar experience to you and decided to take the advice by the third statement the bill was reduced to less than half of the original with zero intervention on my part i then paid it without any impact to my credit whatsoever i 've since done that every time i receive healthcare services and the bill is always reduced on subsequent statements generally to less than half of the original bill sometimes it 's because insurance finally got around to paying sometimes a credit is mysteriously added sometimes line items disappear without explanation line items sometimes appear over time too but the overall balance generally goes down i do n't know the reason for it but it works this has happened with a variety of providers so it 's not just one company that does it granted i never called to negotiate the price so i ca n't say if i would've gotten a better deal by doing that i like it because it requires no time or effort on my part and it has greatly reduced my medical bills with zero impact to my credit i only have personal anecdotes to back it up but it 's worked for me

in addition to the answer from cqm let me answer your am i missing anything question then i 'll talk about how your approach of simplifying this is making it both harder and easier for you last i 'll show what my model for this would look like but if you are n't capable of stacking this up yourself then you really should n't be borrowing 10,000 to try to make money on the margin am i missing anything yes you 're forgetting 1 taxes specifically income tax and 2 sales fees   on the first you have not considered anything in your financial model for taxes you should include at least 25 of your expected returns going to taxes because anything that you buy and then sell within 12 months is taxed as income not capital gains on the second you will incur sales commissions and/or transaction fees depending on the brokerage you are using for your plan these tend to vary widely but i would expect to spend at least $ 25 per sale so if i were building out this model i would think that your break even would have to at least cover monthly interest + monthly principal payment income tax when sold commissions and broker 's fees every time you sell holdings on over simplifying you have the right idea with thinking about both interest and principal in trying to sketch this out but as i mentioned above you 're making this both harder and easier for yourself you are making it harder because you are doing the math wrong the actual payment for this loan assuming it is a normal loan can be found most easily with the pmt function in excel = nper pv fv = 24 0 that returns a monthly payment   of principal + interest of   so you actually are over calculating the payment by $ with your ballpark approach however you did n't actually have all the factors in the model to begin with so that does n't matter much   you are making it artificially easier because you have not thought about the impact of repaying principal what i mean is this in your question you indicate   i 'm guessing the necessary profit is just the total interest on this loan = = $ 720 usd so i 'll break even on this loan if and only if i make $ 720 from stocks over 24 months so the rate of return is + 720 = this sounds all you need is a total return across two years but assuming this is a normal loan and not an interest only loan you have to get rid of your capital a little bit at a time to pay back the loan in essence you will pay back 1/3 of your principal the first year and then you have to keep making the same fixed interest + principal payments out of a smaller base of capital   so for the first few months you can cover the interest easily but by the end you have to be making phenomenal returns to cover it   here is how i would build a model for it i actually did and your breakeven is about per month at that outstanding annual return you would be earning a whopping $ 4 at least as far as the variables are concerned you need to be considering your current capital balance because month 1 you may have $ 10,000 but month 2 you have just after paying back some principal   your rate of return if you do this in excel you can play with it some but you should save the time and just invest somewhere else your actual return that month rate of return existing capital balance   loan payment = for the parameters you gave earlier   income tax = actual return .25 with this kind of loan you 're not actually making enough to preserve the 10,000 capital and you 're selling everything you 've gained each month   commission = $ 25 per month assuming that covers your trade fees and broker commissions i guarantee you that this is not the deal breaker in the model so do n't get excited if you think i 'm over estimating this and you realize that scottrade or somewhere will let you have trades at $ each    monthly ending balance = = next month 's starting capital balance   stack it all up in excel for 24 months and see for yourself if you like the key thing you left out is that you 're repaying each month out of capital that you 'd like to use to invest with this makes you need much higher returns   even if your initial description was n't clear and this is an interest only loan you 're still looking at a rate of about 7.6 annually that you need to hit in order to just break even on the costs of holding the loan and transferring your gains into cash

are there any laws against doing this   so long as you are truthful in your application for the loan none that i know of technically you could use the loan to pay for school and the cash that you would have used instead to invest    are there other reasons why this is a very bad idea i think you 've already identified the biggest one but here are my reasons will you go broke or go to jail likely not but there is significant risk in investing with borrowed money you might come out ahead but you might also lose a bundle   if you 're willing to take that risk that 's your right but i would not call it a good idea under any circumstances

this answer should be taken as a counterpoint to s 's excellent answer i have comprehensive insurance on my vehicle that is if i crashed it and wrote it off my insurance would cover the replacement costs now if this happened i would be able to deal with the replacement costs myself even without insurance it would not significantly impact my lifestyle and would not put my emergency funds at risk though obviously i would n't be happy about this as the insurance company is planning on making money off of me it 's clearly not in my financial best interests to carry this insurance statistically speaking it 's a cost to me and a profit for the insurance company so why do i do it because i find it easy to pay a small amount of money every month for the peace of mind that if i crash my car i will not have to cover the large expense i am perhaps irrationally risk averse i 'm happier paying a small amount of money in exchange for a guarantee that i will not have to pay a large amount of money i mitigate a potentially larger cost albeit with low likelihood for the certainty of a smaller cost my monthly insurance payments this is separate from the mandatory public liability public damage insurance that i am required to cover that insurance fits into 's definition of a devastating event

yes you will come out ahead slightly by putting the money in the savings account then paying off your mortgage later   however we do n't know what will happen to these interest rates after 1 year if you put the £ 300 per month into the savings account for a year then put the money into you mortgage you will save about £ 78 for the year over just putting the money toward your mortgage in the first place   for me i 'm more concerned about longer term strategy what happens to your mortgage rate after 2 years what happens to your savings account rate after 1 year the mortgage rate likely goes up and the savings account rate likely goes down making the savings of this strategy even less after the first year instead you may want to put this £ 300 per month toward retirement investments assuming you have no other debt which should over the long term earn more than the savings account

i 've been in a similar situation before while contracting sometimes the recruiting agency would allow me to choose between being a w2 employee or invoicing them via i already had a company set up s corp but the considerations are similar typically the rate was higher than the w2 rate to account for the extra 7.65 fica taxes and insurance but there were a few times where the rate offered was identical and i still choose because it enabled me to deduct many of my business expenses that i would n't have otherwise been able to deduct in my case the deductions turned out to be greater than the fica savings your case is slightly different than mine though in that i already had the company set up so my company related costs were sunk as far as my decision was concerned for you though the yearly costs associated with running the business must be factored in for example suppose the following due to these expenses you need to make up $ in tax deductions due to the llc if your effective tax rate on the extra income is 30 then your break even point is approximately $ 8 k in deductions = > x = $ so with those made up numbers if you have at least $ 8 k in legitimate additional business expenses then it would make sense to form an llc otherwise you 'd be better off as a w2 other considerations

great so we agree it 's not a fraud and the title of the bloomberg article is grossly misleading   even still to call it a bubble you 'd need to first agree to what the non bubble valuation of bitcoin would be the consensus among those who use the word tulip frequently when talking about bitcoin is that the non bubble valuation of bitcoin is zero 0   this of course means that bitcoin has been in a bubble ever since the first exchange of good was made with it which tells us was a purchase of 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins establishing a price of under $ 0.01 per bitcoin ever since for the past 7 years bitcoin has been in a bubble    furthermore for as long as bitcoin 's market value remains at or above $ 0.01 per bitcoin it will still be in a bubble if me and a few hundred thousand of my closest friends have anything to say about it that will never happen and therefore bitcoin will remain in a bubble indefinitely   now that to me seems like a very unusual bubble if that strikes you as a stretch of the concept too then maybe we need to revisit an assumption or two here   for one is the non bubble valuation of bitcoin really zero is there perhaps something about bitcoin that might give it some intrinsic value that say tulips or babies may not have and if there is is there a way to estimate what that value may be does that value change over time is it perhaps possible that the value of bitcoin correlates in some fashion with its reach and its network effect    those are harder questions to answer and their answers is certainly not as neat and precise as zero or bubble but maybe it 's useful to think about them when trying to reason about what bitcoin is and is n't

i 'd recommend an online fx broker like xe trade at xe.com   there are no fees charged by xe other than the spread on the fx conversion itself which you 'll pay anywhere they have payment clearing facilities in several countries including uk bacs so provided you 're dealing with a major currency it should be possible to transfer money free of wire charges at least   the fx spread will be much better than you would get from a bank since fx is their primary business the additional risk you take on is settlement risk   xe will not pay the sterling amount to your uk bank account until they have received the euro payment into their account   if xe went bankrupt before crediting your uk account but after you 've paid them your euros you could lose your money xe is backed by custom house which is a large and established canadian firm so this risk is very small indeed there are other choices out there too is another that comes to mind although xe 's rates have been the best of those i 've tried

your bank 's fund is not an index fund   from your link to provide a balanced portfolio of primarily canadian securities that produce income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in canadian money market instruments debt securities and common and preferred shares this is a very broad actively managed fund   compare this to the investment objective listed for vanguard 's voo invests in stocks in the s&p 500 index representing 500 of the largest u.s. companies there are loads of market indices with varying formulas that are supposed to track the performance of a market or market segment that they intend to track   the 2000 the wilshire 1000 the s&p 500 the dow industrial average there is even the gender diversity index   some body comes up with a market index   an index fund is simply a mutual fund or exchange traded fund etf that uses a market index formula to make it 's investment decisions enabling an investor to track the performance of the index without having to buy and sell the constituent securities on their own   these index funds are able to charge lower fees because they spend $ 0 on research and only make investment decisions in order to track the holdings of the index i think 1.2 is too high but i 'm coming from the us investing world it might not be that high compared to canadian offerings   additionally comparing this fund 's expense ratio to the vanguard 500 or total market index fund is nonsensical similarly comparing the investment returns is nonsensical because one tracks the s&p 500 and one does not nor does it seek to as an example the 5 largest holding of the cibc fund is a government of canada 2045 3.5 bond everyone should diversify their holdings and adjust their investment allocations as they age   as you age you should be reallocating away from highly volatile common stock and in to assets classes that are historically more stable less volatile like national government debt and high grade corporate local government debt   this fund is already diversified in to some debt instruments depending on your age and other asset allocations this might not be the best place to put your money regardless of the fees personally i handle my own asset allocations and i 'm split between large mid and small cap low fee index funds and the lowest cost high grade debt funds available to me

the credit card may have advantages in at least two cases in some instances at least in the us a merchant will put a hold on a credit card without charging it   this happens a lot at hotels for example which use the hold as collateral against damages and incidental charges   on a credit card this temporarily reduces your credit limit but never appears on your bill   i 've never tried to do it on a debit card but my understanding is that they either reject the debit card for this purpose or they actually make the withdrawal and then issue a refund later   you 'll actually need to account for this in your cash flow on the debit card but not on the credit card if you get a fraudulent charge on your credit card it impacts that account until you detect it and go through the fraud resolution process   on a debit card the fraudulent charge may ripple through the rest of your life   the rent payment that you made by electronic transfer or in the us by check for example is now rejected because your bank account is short by the amount of the fraud even if you did n't use the debit card to pay it   eventually this will probably get sorted out but it has potential to create a bigger mess than is necessary personally i never use my debit card i consider it too risky with no apparent benefit

here 's a different take   look through the lists of companies   that offer shareholder perks here 's one from hargreaves lansdown   see if you can find one that you already spend money with with a low required shareholding where the perks would actually be usable   note that in your case being curious about the whole thing and based in london you do n't have to rule out the agm based perks unlike me my reason for this is simple with 3 out of 4 of the companies we bought shares in directly all for the perks we 've made several times the dividend in savings on money we would have spent anyway either with the company in which we bought shares or a direct competitor   this means that you can actually make back the purchase price plus dealing fee quite quickly probably in in our case and you still have the shares we 've found that pub restaurant hotel brands work well if you use them or their equivalents anyway caveats it 's more enjoyable than holding a handful of shares in a company you do n't care about and if you want to read the annual reports you can relate this to your own experience which might interest you given your obvious curiosity

yes there is regulation in place see here quote from the page instant access savings accounts    as with current accounts if a bank is to reduce the interest rate on an instant access savings account it generally has to give two notice other savings accounts    to change the interest rate on other savings    accounts such as those with a notice period and cash isas a bank    should give you reasonable notice that it intends to make a material    a reduction is consider to be if you have £ 500 or more in    your account and the interest rate falls by more than 0.25 at one    time or by 0.5 or more over 12 months this should give you enough time to move your money to another    account without penalty if you are not happy with the reduced rate

and the fact that if notes trade up high enough they tend to get taken out with lower yielding notes pending the call schedule so in theory there is more limited upside in high yield whereas equity could theoretically trade to infinity   the positives for high yield is that they generate monthly cash flow via coupon payments and have less down side relative to equities naturally this lower down side comes at the expense of lower up side as well

not to mention that what they were doing was the right way to do it for many decades it was simply seen as the norm that you would have a job take part of your savings and put that into a 401k because it was the only way to really provide for a safe future   so that 's what we did oops   the other big difference between gen x and the surrounding generations in regards to retirement is social security the baby boomers will have social security for most of the rest of their lives it 's funded and it wo n't be a problem millenials have mostly come of age knowing that 's a joke gen x on the other hand grew up and worked at least part of their lives under the assumption that social security while having problems would at least provide some help however with the way the economy and government is going it 's very possible that wo n't be a guarantee without major adjustments decreased payout increased retirement age etc so they 're going to be taking it there as well   that 's not even to get started on the mortgage situation for a lot of us x'ers we bought homes near or at the top of the bubble again because everyone was telling our generation that we were foolish for renting why with the tax incentives in place and the way housing prices have been rising the last 20 years you 're just throwing your money away by renting so again the baby boomers enjoyed 20 30 years of rising home prices giving them a chance to build up a lot of equity and refinance at lower and lower rates the millenials again were shielded simply by not being at the point in their lives where it would be a problem once again it 's gen x that was just trying to do what they had observed as working their entire life   i think generation x will rise out of everything that has happened much wiser most of us have been through enough at this point that i think we 're beginning to become very of the way things are and that will have heavy ramifications as the reigns of power fall from the boomers to the x'ers   may you live in interesting times

leverage comes in many forms   you 'll learn about things like operational leverage financial leverage and total leverage throughout school   in the real world tier 1 capital ratio has become the most commonly scrutinized because it is essentially a ratio of the core equity capital of a firm divided by the risk weighted assets assets multiplied by a credit weighting which for most banks now a days is using the standard of basel 2.5 and moving towards basel iii   the multiples you talked about were references to the reciprocal of this formula   you could the ratio and get a whole number that is the multiplier   this multiplier would show for every 1 $ in core capital how much the firm held in risk weighted assets   the 30x number would have represented a tier 1 cap of 3.33   the concept behind it being a 10 growth in risk weighted assets with a 3.33 would result in a 300 growth in core equity capital value   as proven in 2008 it is a double edge blade and works the same way in both directions

the most likely reason for this is that the relocation company wants to have a guaranteed sale so as to get a new mortgage in the new location   understand that the relocation company generally works for a prospective employer   so they are trying to make the process as painless as possible for the homeowner who is probably getting hired as a professional either a manager or someone like an engineer or accountant    if the sale is guaranteed to go through regardless of any problems then it is easy for them to arrange a new mortgage   in fact they may bridge the gap by securing the initial financing and making the downpayment then use the payout from the house you are buying to buy out their position   that puts them on the hook for a bunch of money a downpayment on a house while they 're waiting on the house you 're purchasing to close    this does not necessarily mean that there is anything wrong with the house   the relocation company would only know about something wrong if the owner had disclosed it   they do n't really care about the house they 're selling   their job is to make the transition easy   with a relocation company it is more likely that they are simply in a hurry and want to avoid a busted purchase   if this sale fails to go through for any reason they have to start over   that could make the employment change fall through    this is a variation of a no contingencies sale   sellers like no contingencies sales because they are easier   buyers dislike them because their protections are weaker   but some buyers will offer them because they get better prices that way   in particular house flippers will do this frequently so as to get the house for less money than they might otherwise pay   this is better than a pure no contingencies sale as they are agreeing to the repairs    this is a reasonable excuse to not proceed with the transaction   if this makes you so uncomfortable that you 'd rather continue looking that 's fine   however it also gives you a bit of leverage as it means that they are motivated to close this transaction quickly   you can consider any of the following    or you can do some combination of those or something else entirely that makes you fell more secure   if you do decide to move forward with any version of this provision get a real estate lawyer to draft the agreement   also insist on disclosure of any previous failed sales and the reason for the failure before signing the agreement   the lawyer can make that request in such a way as to get a truthful response    and again in case you missed it when i said this earlier   you can say no and simply refuse to move forward with such a provision   you may not get the house but you 'll save a certain amount of worry   if you do move forward you should be sure that you are getting a good deal   they 're asking for special provisions they should bear the cost of that   either your current deal is already good and it may be or you should make them adjust until it is

the ancient roman 's paid for things in silver there were 2 main methods of silver production a mine or a neighbor and taking their silver   silver was in use by many of rome 's neighbors the tribal regions did n't accept it and the taxation method was imposed   however the roman 's also practiced money as debt just as the original poster stated caesar himself took a million pound loan to finance his bread and campaign eventually rome was saddled with such enormous debt that it is given as one of the possible factors in it 's decline and fall   money originated not to pay taxes but to replace barter once the utility of it as paying taxes to a government became known the forces leading to standardization and central banking develop taxation is a key step on the ladder toward developing a central currency it is however not the only one

this answer is based on the us banking system if that is n't where you are please edit appropriately there are probably two places the thief could go to cash the check your bank the issuer 's bank third party banks are unlikely to want to cash a check drawn on a different bank for a payee who is n't their customer   so notifying both of these banks would be a good start also hopefully the thief does not look like you and wo n't be able to pass using your id   the thief will also have to forge your endorsement on the check if he goes to your bank they can check it against your signature which they have on file and hopefully it wo n't match   the issuer 's bank would n't notice that of course so read on even if the check is cashed you should ultimately be okay as i understand it   the issuer of the check still owes you the money he ca n't prove he 's paid you until he has the cancelled check or its image showing your valid endorsement   so he needs to give you another check eventually   this assumes the check was payment for a debt of some kind if it was a gift or some other sort of voluntary payment he could at this point change his mind and decide not to pay you after all the issuer should be okay too   if the check is cashed and debited from his account he should go to his bank and tell them the endorsement is forged   they may ask you to sign something where you state under penalty of perjury that the signature is n't yours   then they will re credit his account so that he can pay you again normally the bank   that cashed the check will be on the hook for the loss it was their responsibility to make sure they were paying the rightful payee and they failed in that responsibility   various procedural issues can shift that liability between banks but ultimately it should n't be either customer who suffers unless someone did something really negligent like not reporting the theft for months obviously this would all be much simpler if the issuer can call his bank right away and stop payment   this can be done over the phone or online so out of town should n't be an issue unless he is out in the woods or something   if he can talk to you he can talk to them

your chart and your claim do n't match you 're looking at one marginal tax rate and saying that its historical change does n't impact overall federal revenues this is true on the surface but you 're only looking at one aspect of the overall picture   saying that federal revenue does n't correlate with tax rates is disingenuous an across the board cut or an across the board increase will both have significant effect likewise an increase to the top marginal tax rate by itself would have an impact as long as there were no corresponding cuts or increased expenditures to wipe out the impact   a budget is a budget whether it 's a great big one like the federal government 's or a small one like a household budget   revenues and expenses need to match in order for the budget to balance increasing tax rates increases revenue from everyone within the affected tax bracket it makes an impact

i think what he is trying to say is that if we fix our economic mindset of trickle down economics and shift the wealth so it is more middle class focused america will be able to have more paying customers with greater disposable incomes thus allowing businesses to have a more constant and heavier flow of revenue which would in turn allow the businesses to expand in employees facilities r&amp;d etc

gt i 'm not so sure that performance measurement of students is all that difficult   you assume that student performance is a good proxy for teacher performance one of the bigger influences on student performance is parent engagement particularly the parent engagement that happens prior to school age but also the engagement once they 're in school often these differences run along socioeconomic lines and schools are generally divided on neighborhood lines with students attending the school closest to their home   if you judge based on student performance you 'll likely assume that the teachers in the richer neighborhoods are better students perform better on standardized tests students are more likely to graduate high school and even go on to college etc the fact is there 's a lot of good teachers who take the hard jobs because even a little improvement can go a long way put those same teachers in the richer neighborhoods and you might judge things differently

i do nt think we disagree i believe the notion of control is elusive in this day and age we have leverage or influence at best i agree that if the government is asked to invest or subsidize in another organization it has the right as should any investor to expect that its opinions will be heard and its interests will be protected in that context if any investor decides that its interests extend to amending management compensation i think that is reasonable

for those who are looking to improve credit for the sake of being able to obtain future credit on better terms i think a rewards credit card is the best way to do that i recommend that you only use as many cards as you need to gain the best rewards i have one card that gives 6 back on grocery purchases and i have another card that gives 4 back on petrol and 2 back on dining out both of those cards give only 1 back on all other purchases so i use a third card that gives 1.5 back across the board for my other purchases i pay all of the cards in full each month if there was a card that did n't give me an advantage in making my purchases i would n't own it i 'm generally frugal so i know that there is no psychological disadvantage to paying with a card you have to consider your own spending discipline when deciding whether paying with cards is an advantage for you in the end you should only use debt when you can pay low interest rates or as in the case of the cards above no interest at all in the case of the low interest debt it should be allowing you to make an investment that will pay you more by having it sooner than the cost of interest you might need a car to get to work but you probably do n't need a new car borrow as little as you can and repay your loans as quickly as you can debt can be a tool for your advantage but only if used wisely do n't be in by the temptation of something new and shiny now that you can pay for later

get an education a bachelor 's degree preferably but aa or even a certificate are fine too it will increase your earning potential significantly and over your lifetime it will earn you a lot of money   you make around $ 30,000 a year now median salary for someone with a bachelors in the is around $ 45,000 if you degree is in the stem field that goes up to $ 55,000 $ 65,000 range second best option is to start a small business of some kind that does not require substantial investment handyman comes to mind as an example or some sort of billing service maybe i would not recommend self directed investment in the stock market most people lose money and since you do n't have a lot of money to invest commissions and fees will eat up a significant portion of it i would usually recommend a cd but interest rates it 's not really worth it

your question seems to be making assumptions around investing that investing is only about stock market and bonds or similar things i would suggest that you should look much broader than that in terms of your investments investment types your should consider and include some or all of the following for your investments depending on your age your attitude towards risk the number of dependents you have your lifestyle etc i love ’s explanation of diversification into other asset classes producing a lower risk portfolio excellent all the above need to be considered in this spread of risk depending as i said earlier on your age your attitude towards risk the number of dependents you have your lifestyle etc stock market investment i ’ll focus most of the rest of my post on the stock markets as that is where my main experience lies but the comments are applicable to a greater or lesser extent to other types of investing we then come to how engaged you want to be with your investments two general management styles are passive investment management versus active investment management says   that pretty much sums up passive management the idea is to buy etfs    across asset classes and just leave them the difficulty with this idea is that profitability is very dependent upon when the stocks are purchased and when they are sold this is why active investing should be considered as a viable alternative to passive investment   i do n’t have access to a very long time frame of stock market data but i do have 30 or so years of ftse data so let ’s say that we invest £ 100,000 for 10 years by buying an etf in the index i know this is n't de risking across a number of asset classes by purchasing a number of different but the logic still applies if you will bear with me passive investing i have chosen my example dates of best 10 years and worst 10 years as specific dates that demonstrate my point that active investing will usually out perform passive investing from a passive investing point of view here is a graph of the ftse with two purchase dates chosen for maximum effect to show the best and worst return you could receive note this ignores brokerage and other fees in these time frames of data i have    these are contrived dates to illustrate the point on how ineffective passive investing can be depending if there is a bear bull market and where you buy in the cycle   one obviously would n’t buy all their stocks in one tranche but i ’m just trying to illustrate the point active investing let ’s consider now active investing i use the following rules for selling and this is obviously a very simple technical trading system and i would not recommend using it to trade with as it is overly simplistic and there are some flaws and inefficiencies in it so in my simulation   these beat the passive stock market profit for their respective dates summary passive stock market investing is dependent upon the entry and exit prices on the dates the transactions are made and will trade regardless of market cycles active stock market trading or investing engages with the market using a set of criteria which can change over time but allows one ’s investments to be in or out of the market at any point in time my time frames were arbitrary but with the logic applied which is a very simple technical trading methodology i would suggest that any 10 year time frame active investing would beat passive investing
