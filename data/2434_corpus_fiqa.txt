is this even legal how can a bank refuse to deposit legal tender in    the united states legal for all debts public or private does n't mean quite what i used to think either   per the fed this statute means that all united states money as identified above is    a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when to a    creditor there is however no federal statute mandating that a    private business a person or an organization must accept currency or    coins as payment for goods or services private businesses are free to    develop their own policies on whether to accept cash unless there is a    state law which says otherwise yes they can refuse loose change also they are n't refusing your deposit just requiring that it be rolled what do i do with my change i do not want to spend the time rolling    it and i am not going to pay a fee to cash my change there are n't many other options change is a nuisance i believe coinstar machines reduce remove their fee if you exchange coins for gift cards so that might be the best option for convenience and retaining value

they can not refuse to accept coins and demand some other payment after providing a good or service   legal tender is legal tender for all debts   but until they provide the good or service they do n't have to accept it    in this case you want the service of depositing money   but by its nature they have to accept the payment first   in that situation they can refuse it   there is no law that banks have to accept your deposits   if they do n't want you as a customer that 's their problem    consider switching banks   historically this was easier and some banks may still do things the old way   call your local banks and ask   perhaps you 'll find someone happy to do business with you on your terms    as already said some coin rolling machines will pay you with gift certificates   if you plan to buy a sufficient amount from the place that accepts the gift certificate this can get that place to play the fee   that may help you although it is obviously a limited solution   the goal is to make it so that you only make purchases that you would have anyway   the seller obviously has a different goal    it 's possible to buy coin   heck you could buy one with a gift certificate from a public machine   cheap ones require extra work to get the coins rolled and may jam a lot   more expensive ones do more of the work for you   note that a given that works better may be cheaper than another that does n't work as well   cheap is more of a qualitative judgment than a financial measure in this case    if you carry a small amount of change with you pretty much everywhere accepts small amounts of change for purchases   so if you have been always paying with dollars and dumping the change in a jar instead always give the correct change coins   they may still give you dollars in change but at least you wo n't get new coins   and you 'll use some of your existing coins   of course this does n't scale well    for small purchases say $ 1.50 you can often pay the whole thing in change without argument   or if something is $ you might give them $ 10 $ 5 two $ 1 bills and the rest in change    if you are buying something and can see that they have little change in one of the coin buckets offer to swap some change for bills   sometimes places find that easier than breaking a roll    with vending machines use change instead of dollar bills   especially use exact change so as not to convert bills to change   they usually do n't take pennies but they 're great with nickels and above    this wo n't allow you to use change as a way to force yourself to save   but it will keep your change down to a manageable level going forward   and you might be able to use up your existing store   i 'm assuming that this is n't a fifty year coin collection that you are just now starting to process   but if you have six months of change you should be able to use it up in a year or so    i tend to do this   so i rarely have more than a couple dollars in change   no one ever tells me that they do n't take change because i do n't give anyone a lot   maybe $ .99 here but more likely $ there   sometimes i give them e.g. $ so as to get $ .25 in change rather than $    it 's a little more work at every transaction but it saves the big of work of rolling the coins   and you do n't have to buy

the bank certainly does n't have to take it for a deposit that 's not a debt   there have been several cases where disgruntled debtors have attempted deliberately annoying ways to pay their debts the example being pennies   courts are not likely to support such efforts since it 's obvious that a the action is malicious and relevant to you b it 's really on you to maintain your money in a form   if you allow your money to become unwieldy nobody owes you anything    i wonder about the meta meaning of that   and whether in that light it really makes sense to worry about 5 or rolling   as far as getting rid of it when i bought out a girlfriend 's at par i just made sure to walk out of the house with $ 5 in change in my pocket and unload $ 2 3 at every retailer none ever objected and some appreciated   quarters were traded to coin laundry users when going on transit i brought a bunch the machines never   i burned through the cache much faster than expected

while there are many very good and detailed answers to this question there is one key term from finance that none of them used and that is net present value while this is a term generally associate with debt and assets it also can be applied to the valuation models of a company 's share price the price of the share of a stock in a company represents the net present value of all future cash flows of that company divided by the total number of shares outstanding this is also the reason behind why the payment of dividends will cause the share price valuation to be less than its valuation if the company did not pay a dividend that those future outflows are factored into the npv calculation actually performed or implied and results in a current valuation that is less than it would have been had that capital been retained unlike with a fixed income security or even a variable rate debenture it is difficult to predict what the future cashflows of a company will be and how investors chose to value things as intangible as brand recognition market penetration and executive competence are often far more subjective that using 10 year libor rates to plug into a present value calculation for a floating rate bond of similar tenor opinion enters into the calculus and this is why you end up having a greater degree of price variance than you see in the fixed income markets you have had situations where companies such as amazon.com google and facebook had highly valued shares before they they ever posted a profit that is because the analysis of the value of their intellectual properties or business models would overtime provide a future value that was equivalent to their stock price at that time

warren buffett pointed out that if you set 1 million monkeys to flipping coins after ten flips one monkey in about 1,000 actually would have a perfect track record of 10 heads if you can double your money every three to five years basically the outer limit of what is humanly possible you can turn $ 1,000 into $ 1 million in 30 50 years but your chances of doing this are maybe those of that one in 1,000 monkeys there are people that believe that if warren buffett were starting out today today 's version could not beat the historical version one of the believers is warren buffett himself if you read between the lines of his writings what the promoters do is to use the benefit of hindsight to show that if someone had done such and such trades on such and such days they would have turned a few thousand into a million in a few short years that 's easy in hindsight but then challenge them to do it in real time

yes he can retract the offer it was a cash only offer and if you 're financing it 's no longer cash unless of course you get the financing through your local bank credit union and they hand you a check like on a personal loan then it 's still cash however the salesman can still retract the offer unless it 's in writing because you have n't signed anything yet the price of financing will always be higher because the dealer does n't get all their money today also if you finance you are not paying just the cost of the vehicle you are paying interest so your final cost will be higher unless you were one of the lucky souls who got 0 financing employee pricing and therefore are actually saving money by having a payment

us banks are often helpless with international checks so i would recommend to do a wire transfer instead otherwise you might end up being in the us with no money and a worthless piece of paper in your hand first set up your european account to allow wire transfers to the us if that needs any action speak to someone in the bank in person to make sure you can later initiate such a transfer remotely online after travelling set up your us account and then remote trigger a wire transfer costs are relatively small for example with you pay less than 30 $ and get the bank currency exchange ratio which is much better than the exchange ratio for paper money the wire transfer cost is partly proportional to the amount and partly constant so do n't split it in many pieces make one larger transfer

no there are additional factors involved note that the shares on issue of a company can change for various reasons such as conversion redemption of convertible securities vesting of restricted employee shares conversion of employee options employee stock purchase programs share placements buybacks mergers rights issues etc so it is always worthwhile checking sec announcements for the company if you want an exact figure   there may also be multiple classes of shares and preferred securities that have different levels of dividends present for they filed a 10q on 22 april 2015 and noted they had shares outstanding of their common stock   they also noted for the three months ended march 31 2014 that dividends were paid to both common stockholders and preferred stockholders and that there were series a preferred stock 3 million and series b preferred stock 10 million plus a statement in february 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $ million of our outstanding common stock shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to equity therefore the exact amount of dividend paid out will not be known until the next quarterly report which will state the exact amount of dividend paid out to common and preferred shareholders for the quarter

full payment is always better than auto loan if you are prudent with finances i.e if you take a loan you are factoring the emi hence your savings will remain as is however if you manage well you can buy the car with cash and at the same time put aside the notional emi as savings and investments the other factor to consider is what return your cash is giving if this more than auto loan interest rate post taxes you should opt for loan for example if auto loan is 10 and you are getting a return of 15 after taxes on investment then loan is better company car lease depends on terms more often you get break on taxes on the emi component but you have to buy at the end of lease period and re register the car in your name so there is additional cost some companies give lease at very favourable rates plus if you leave the job lease has to be broken and it becomes more expensive

where are you operating your business and how is it structured dba llc how do you plan on taxing the business    you can purchase whatever hardware you want and resale at whatever price you want you may be able to contact a vendor and open a dealer account this means they 'll will give you a price break if you purchase x amount of volume but this may require more upfront capital    warranty will probably be best to be done under your name most manufacture warranties require proof of purchase from an approved vendor if you 're buying and reselling at a higher cost then the original receipt will show your profits likewise you can sale the hardware at cost and make all your money on labor this would allow you to pass the warranty responsibility to the customer depending on the customer ’s site you may have to mount your routers and access points in hard to reach places   the customer might prefer to call you and have you take care of it from there    the way i would do it structure the installations by square footage and predicted users the greater the square footage the more hardware you ’ll need    offer a remote support plan at a reasonable rate for you will provide tear 1 support which can include troubleshooting dead access points remotely changing network names and providing up to x amount of network reports offers network monitoring for free in their suite you would just be interpreting this information for issues that require you to come to site you can charge x amount of dollars per visit plus parts and labor i would offer on the spot replacement for hardware under warranty for a very small fee and then you can ship off the defective hardware and have it replaced    if you do purchase with amazon i know they offer extended plans on a lot of their electronics it would be worth considering these plans and adding the cost to the hardware you ’re reselling most of these plans simply write you a check for defective hardware after you ship them in    i would highly suggest going with a business structure that protects your personal assets such as an llc i recommend this because you will be proving a service to other people and you may be blamed for damages if you are found to be at fault they company takes the hit not you    edit also you can take advantage of amazon 's two day shipping when a customer contracts you for a job simply ask for 50 deposit and a 4 day notice when you receive the deposit place the order on amazon for the hardware this will mean less money out of your pocket

when you sell a house around between 7 10 of the sales price will go to various fees mostly to the agents but also to county fees city fees deed tax and possibly covering closing costs for the buyers so if you sell a $ 400k house for the same price you buy just in fees you 're out $ 40k mortgages are structured so that the frontend is very interest heavy while at the end you 're mostly paying towards principal so for the first two years you will pay down very little of the principal figure around $ 2500 for the mortgage and without running the numbers i bet you would pay an average for the first two years of around $ in interest $ mortgage interest is tax deductible so you 'll get some of that back that 's also $ 16,800 in equity you 'll have on the house so you 'll get that back out when you sell rough numbers i would be you lose around $ 50k buying the house and selling for the same price two years later that does n't take into account having to do any maintenance and it assumes you can sell quickly when you want to renting is not throwing away money you do n't lose any money you get a place to live in exchange you do n't build equity sure but you do n't need to worry about maintenance and other related issues when you 're looking to be somewhere short term renting is generally the best idea

it really depends on the value your financial adviser provides   does he help with your 401 k   does he help you avoid making foolish moves   does he really help you find funds that beat average market returns many people answer no to all of these questions and do their investing on their own   i personally prefer fidelity because i find their web site easier to work with but vanguard is another option    at fidelity you will have zero fee per year   you can buy fidelity and many other mutual funds with no cost   you can buy ishares etfs at no cost   some funds do have a fee to purchase but they are pretty low $ 35 and are only collected when you buy not yearly    now some people do go it alone and it is a huge mistake   the news tends to only report negative stock market events and many people were scared away from 2008 and missed wonderful gains since that time   if you pull your money out during corrections stick with a financial adviser   if you will stop contributing because of a correction stick with a financial adviser   in those cases the fee is well worth the cost   also if your guy provides education in association with investment advice the fee might also be worth it    if you are able to stomach losses able to keep on contributing like clockwork and can read a morning star mutual fund chart then you might be best to go it alone   one thing would really help is to have a friend that is also interested in investing to share ideas with

the ftb as any government agency is understaffed and underpaid even if someone took a glance and it was n't just an automated letter consider the situation you filed as a llc and then amended to file as a partnership unless someone really pays attention the obvious assumption would be that you had a limited partnership yes you 'll need to call them and work with them on fixing this they do have all the statements you 've attached however there 's a lot of automation and very little attention to details when it comes to matching errors so do n't get surprised if no one even looked at these statements next time your elected government officials talk about small government and cutting government expenses you can remind yourself how it looks in action with this experience

gt that 's not a taxi regulation that 's just a driving regulation all vehicles must be insured are you saying that uber lyft are n't even following the laws of the road   when you 're driving to a call you 're working as a cab driver or if you do n't like that label you 're operating a commercial vehicle regular car insurance does not cover operating a vehicle for the purposes of transporting people a.k.a driving a taxi there is special insurance for taxi companies because they have much higher liability and likelihood of being in an accident thus the premiums are higher uber lyft drivers do not have this type of insurance individually but uber lyft each have a $ 1 m insurance policy in case their drivers are in accidents when they are it does n't cover them between calls when an uber lyft driver gets in an accident between calls their insurance is n't going to cover it because they were operating a taxi or a vehicle that people for money their insurance will drop their policy and they will be liable for the damages which they likely wo n't be able to pay out of pocket or they would n't be driving for uber lyft in the first place   gt taxi regulations actually allow red lining by restricting service areas sorry i do n't go to x town i 'm only licensed for y town even with the regulations taxis do it anyway that 's why they ask for your destination before they give you an eta on pickup   you have no idea what red lining is   gt rate setting is n't a good thing   yes it is actually it keeps the prices stable and manageable without prices would drastically increase which seems to be a big complaint in this thread   gt yep the taxi regulations should largely be repealed they 've their usefulness   again you do n't have a fucking clue what you 're talking about many cities have tried to deregulate their cab industries and all but one in the us has returned to some form of regulation it 's been a complete shit show every time service quality went down and prices went up   see the thing people in this thread people do n't get is i actually know how cab drivers think because i personally know 200 of them they would absolutely love to have the industry deregulated because then they would n't have to take drunk assholes that call for a cab they could just take the decently sober guy offering them an extra $ 20 they would n't have to drive to the shitty parts of town where they 're most likely to get robbed they would n't even have to give rides to shady looking people who are probably going to bail on their fare got a fuck if anyone wants to lift that into the trunk you want that short ride that only goes three blocks because you 're wearing your skirt with 6 heels why bother oh it 's 2 am on new year 's eve day and you want a ride and you 're freezing your ass off ok how about $ 80 no well the guy behind you with his girlfriend crying will pay it he wo n't like it but it beats being stuck downtown all night

in canada the majority of your taxes are remitted by the employer on your behalf after the employer deducts the calculated amount from your pay then when you file your income tax return you pay or get reimbursed the difference from your particular social situation note that this is optional the employer has to pay its own part of some deductions but the employee can opt out from getting the standard amount of income tax deducted at source it is his responsibility alone to pay for his taxes so in this context it 's entirely possible to advertise an approximate net salary most of the accounting over here is done by way of accounting software and those that support payroll go through a testing and acceptance phase for each revision to the tax tables so the amount calculated is usually pretty exact i got reimbursed 120 $ last year

your employer 's matching contribution is calculated based on the dollar amounts you end up putting in the nature of your 401(k contribution whether pre tax or roth after tax doesn't matter with respect to how their match gets calculated and their match always goes into a pre tax account even if you are contributing after tax the onus is on you to choose a contribution amount that maximizes your employer match regardless of the nature of your contribution maximizing your employer match using roth after tax contributions will eat up more of your annual gross salary but as long as you are willing to do that then you wo n't leave free employer match money on the table roth after tax contributions do n't get the tax deduction inherent in a pre tax contribution the tradeoff is that you end up with less take home pay per period if you contribute the same number of dollars on a roth after tax basis to your 401(k as opposed to on a pre tax basis for instance to make a maximum $ 18,000 roth after tax contribution to a 401(k it 's going to cost you a lot more than $ 18,000 of your annual gross salary to net the same $ 18,000 number on the flip side the roth money is worth more in retirement than pre tax money because it wo n't be subject to taxes then however 401(k plan contribution amounts are almost always expressed as a percentage of gross salary i.e. in pre tax terms even when electing to make after tax contributions so when electing after tax one is implicitly accepting that the contribution will cost more than the percentage of gross salary because you 'll need to pay the tax on a gross amount that would yield the same number of dollars but as an after tax amount

the standard low risk gain very short term parking spot these days tends to be a money market account   however you have only mentioned stock for good balance your portfolio should consider the bond market too consider adding a bond index fund to diversify the basic mix taking up much of that 40 this will also help stabilize your risk since bonds tend to move opposite stocks just because everyone else is also using them as the main alternative though there are theoretical arguments why this should be so eventually you may want to add a small amount of reit fund to be mix but that 's back on the higher risk side by the way trying to guess when the next correction will occur is usually not a winning strategy guesses tend to go wrong as often as they go right even for pros rather than attempting to time the market pick a strategic mix of investments and rebalance periodically to maintain those ratios there has been debate here about dollar cost averaging see other answers but that idea may argue for investing and rebalancing in more small chunks rather than a few large ones i generally actively rebalance once a year or so and between those times let the balance suggest which fund(s new money should go into minimal effort and it has worked quite well enough

ok i think what you 're really asking is how can i benefit from a collapse in the price of gold   and that 's easy the hard part 's making that kind of call with money on the line the etf gld is entirely physical gold sitting in a bank vault in new york i believe you could simply sell it short   alternatively you could buy a put option on it even more risky you could sell a naked call option on it i.e. you receive the option premium up front and if it expires worthless you keep the money of course if gold goes up you 're on the hook do n't do this    the do n't do this was added by chris w. rea i agree that selling naked options is best avoided but i 'm not going to tell you what to do what i should have done was make clear that your potential losses are unlimited when selling naked calls for example if you sold a single gld naked call and gold went to shoot to $ you 'd be on the hook for around $ 10,000,000 an unrealistic example perhaps but one that 's worth pondering to grasp the risk you 'd be exposing yourself to with selling naked calls patches alternative etfs that work the same holding physical gold are iau and with those the gold is stored in london and switzerland respectively if i remember right   gold peaked around $ 1900 and is now back down to the $ so is the run over and it 's all downhill from here or is it a simple retracement gathering strength to push past $ 2000 i have no idea   and i make no recommendations

if you 're absolutely certain that you wo n't buy a house within a year or so i 'd still be tempted to put some of the money into short term cds ie a max of 12 months i think that at the moment cds are a bit of a mug 's game though because you 'd hardly find one that offers better interest rates than some of the few savings accounts that still offer interest a savings account is probably where i 'd put the money unless i could find a really good deal on a cd but i think you might have to check if they 've got withdrawal limits there are a couple of savings accounts out there that pay at least 1 yes i know it 's pitiful so i 'd seek out one or two of those from memory both sallie mae and amex offer those and i 'm sure there are a couple more it 's not great that your money is growing at less than inflation but if you 're saving for something like a downpayment on a house i would think that nominal capital preservation is probably more important than the potential for a higher return with the associated higher risk

first off leaving money in a 529 account is not that bad since you may always change the beneficiary to most any blood relative   so if you have leftovers you do n't have to pay the 10 penalty if you have a for instance that can use it   but if you would rather have the money out then you need a strategy to get it out that is tax efficient my prescription for managing a situation like this is not to pay directly out of the 529 account but instead calculate your cost of education up front and withdraw that money at the beginning of the school year   you can keep it in a separate account but that 's not necessary   the amount you withdraw should be equal to what the education costs which may be estimated by taking the budget that the school publishes minus grants and scholarships   you should have all of those numbers before the first day of school   this is amount $ x. during the year write all the checks out of your regular account   at the end of the school year you should expect to have no money left in the account   i presume that the budget is exactly what you will spend   if not you might need to make a few adjustments but this answer will presume you spend exactly $ x during the fall and the spring of the next year in order to get more out of the 529 without paying penalties you are allowed to remove money without penalty but having the gains taxed $ y + $ z   you have the choice of having the 529 funds directed to the educational institution the student or yourself   if you direct the funds to the student the gains portion would be taxed at the student 's rate   everyone 's tax situation is different and of course there is a between the parent 's taxes and student 's taxes but it may be efficient to have the 529 funds directed to the student   for instance if the student does n't have much income they might not even be required to file income tax   if that 's the case they may be able to remove an amount $ y from the 529 account and still not need to file   for instance let 's say the student has no unearned income and the gains in the 529 account were 50   the student could get a check for $ 2,000 $ 1,000 would be gains but that low amount may mean the student was not required to file or if it 's more important to get more money out of the account the student could remove the total amount of the grants plus scholarships $ y + $ z   no penalty would be due just the taxes on the gains   and at the student 's tax rate generally but check your own situation finally if you really want the money out of the account you could remove a check $ y + $ z + $ p   you 'd pay tax on the gains of the sum but penalty of 10 only on the $ p portion this answer does not include the math that goes along with securing some tax credits so if those credits still are around as you 're working through this consider this article which requires site sign up   in part this article says how much to withdraw     for most parents it will be 100 of the beneficiary ’s qualified higher education expenses paid this year tuition fees books supplies equipment and room and board less $ 4,000 the $ 4,000 is redirected to the american opportunity tax credit when to withdraw it     take withdrawals in the same calendar year that the qualified expenses were paid designating the     since it is usually best that the form be issued to the beneficiary and show the beneficiary ’s social security number i prefer to use either option 2 or 3 2 a check made out to the account beneficiary or 3 a check made out to the educational institution what about scholarships     the 10 percent penalty on a non qualified distribution from a 529 plan is waived when the excess distribution can be attributed to tax free scholarships while there is no direct guidance from the irs many tax experts believe the distribution and the scholarship do not have to match up in the same calendar year when applying the penalty waiver if you 're curious about timing taking non penalty grants and scholarship money out there is this link which says you probably are allowed to accumulate grants and scholarship totals for tax purposes over multiple years

i assume that you are a citizen of india and are what indian law calls a nri nonresident indian and thus entitled to operate an nre nonresident external account in india   you can deposit us dollars into the nre account but the money is converted to indian rupees inr and held as inr   you can withdraw the money and bring it back to the us as us dollars but the inr will be converted to us$ at the exchange rate applicable on the date of the transaction   with the recent decline of the indian rupee against the us dollar many nre accounts lost a lot of their value you can deposit any amount of money in your nre account some banks may limit the amount you can send in one business day but if 250 times that amount seriously limits the amount of money you want to send each year you should not be asking here there are enough expensive lawyers bankers and tax advisors who will gladly guide you to a satisfactory solution there is no limitation on the total amount that you can have in your nre account   the earnings interest paid on the sum in your nre account is not taxable income to you in india but you may still need to file an income tax return in india to get a refund of the tax withheld by the bank tds and sent to the tax authorities the bank should not withhold tax on the earnings in an nre account but it did happen to me in the past   while the interest paid on your nre account is not taxable in india it is taxable income to you on your us tax returns both federal and state and you must declare it on your tax even though the bank will not issue a 1099-int form to you be aware also about   the reporting requirements for foreign accounts fbar td 22.1 etc lots of people ignored this requirement in the past but are more diligent these days after the irs got a of information about accounts in foreign banks and went after people charging them big penalties for not filing these forms for ever so many years there was a huge   in the indian communities in the us about how the irs was unfairly targeting simple folks instead of auditing the rich but if the total value of the accounts did not exceed $ 10 k at any time of the year these forms do not need to be filed it seems though that you will not fall under this exemption since you are planning on having considerably larger sums in your nre account so be sure and follow the rules

much of what you 're asking will not be disclosed for obvious security reasons so do n't be surprised when call center people say they do n't know   they may actually not know but even if they did they 'd be fired if they were to say anything   nothing could be a subject than online security for the financial institutions i do n't know of reliable sources for the data you 're asking about and i do n't know the banks or other firms would release it   for a bank to talk about its incidence rates of fraud would be unusual because none of these institutions wants to appear less safe than their competitors   if there 's any information out there then it 's going to be pretty vague   none of these institutions wants the bad guys to know what their degree of success is against one bank versus any other   i hope that makes sense the smaller banks usually piggyback their data on the networks of the larger financial institutions so they are as secure as a general rule as the larger banks networks they 're running on   also your transactions on your credit cards are not generally handled directly by your bank anyway unless it 's one of the big like chase or bank of america   all transactions run through merchant processors who act as intermediaries between merchants and the banks and those guys are pretty damned good at security   i 've met some of the programmers and they 're impressive to me i 've been a programmer for 35 years and ca n't put a finger on these guys most banks require that you must provide proof of identity when opening an account and that id must me the standards of the usa real id act   here 's an excerpt from the department of homeland security website on what real id is passed by congress in 2005 the real id act enacted the 9/11 commission ’s recommendation that the federal government set standards for the issuance of sources of identification such as driver 's licenses the act established minimum security standards for state issued driver ’s licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies from accepting for official purposes licenses and identification cards from states that do not meet these standards states have made considerable progress in meeting this key recommendation of the 9/11 commission and every state has a more secure driver ’s license today than before the passage of the act in order for banks to qualify for fdic protection they must comply with the real id standards when opening accounts as with any business especially online the most effective way to minimize fraud is vigilant monitoring of data   banks and other online financial entities have become very adept at pattern analysis and simply knowing where and what to look for when dealing with their customers   there are certainly sophisticated measures which are kept carefully out of the public eye for doing this and obviously they 're good at it   they have to be right there 's no way to completely eliminate fraud too much incentive exists for the bad guys to not constantly search for new ways to run their schemes and the good guys will always be at the disadvantage because there 's no way to anticipate everything anyone might come up with   just look at online and malware   your antivirus software can only deal with what it knows about and the bad guys are always coming up with some new variant that gets past the filters until the antivirus maker learns of it and comes up with a way to deal with it your question 's a good one to ponder and i would n't want to be the chief of internet security for a bank or online institution because i 'd lay awake at night pondering when the call 's going to come that we finally ran out of luck grin i hope this was helpful good luck

for press releases about economic data the bureau of economic analysis press release page is helpful depending on the series you could also look at the bureau of labor statistics press release page   for time series of both historical and present data the st. louis federal reserve maintains a database such data including numerous measures of gdp called fred they list nearly 15,000 series related to gdp alone fred is extremely useful because it allows you to make graphs that indicate areas of recession like this   on the series homepage there 's a bold link on the left side to download the data if you simply need the most recent data it 's listed below the graph on that page   if you 're interested in a more in depth analysis you can use the bureau of economic analysis as well specifically the national income and product accounts which are most of the numbers that feed into the calculation of gdp fred also archives some of these data both fred and the bea compile data on numerous other economic benchmarks as well   other general sources for a wide range of announcements are the yahoo bloomberg and the wall street journal economic calendars these provide the dates of many economic announcements e.g. existing home sales durable orders crude inventories etc yahoo provides links to the raw data where available bloomberg and the wsj provide links to their article where appropriate this is a great way to learn about various announcements and how they affect the markets for example the somewhat disappointing durable orders announcement recently pushed markets down a few points   for europe look at on the left side of the page they list links to common data including gdp they list the latest releases on the home page that i previously linked to   for the sake of keeping this question short i 'm the rest of the world into this paragraph data for many other countries is maintained by their governments or central banks in a similar fashion the world bank 's also has relevant data like gross national income which is n't identical to gdp but it 's another less common macroeconomic indicator   you can also look at the economic calendar on or xe.com which list events for the us europe and some latin american countries if you 're only interested in the us the bloomberg or yahoo calendars may have a higher signal to noise ratio but if you 're interested in following how global markets like currency markets respond to new information a global economic calendar is a must also has a global economic calendar that according to them is specifically geared towards events that affect the forex market   as i said governments and central banks compile a lot of this data so to make searching easier here are a few links to statistical agencies and central banks for major countries i compiled this list a while ago on my personal machine so although i think all the links are accurate leave a comment if something is n't quite right   statistics australia brazil canada canada china france germany imf japan mexico oecd thailand uk us central banks australia brazil canada chile china ecb hungary india indonesia israel japan mexico norway russia sweden switzerland thailand uk us

consider firstly that they 're penny stocks for a reason the company just is n't worth much yes it could take off but this happenstance is rarer than you think next there is the problem of how you 'd find out what the good stocks to invest in are here in the uk reliable news about stocks outside the ftse indexes aim is hard to come by also consider than there is n't the supply and demand for these stocks in the same way as there is in the main indexes even if you were to make a tidy profit over time you might lose what you made in the delay selling the stock start ups also have the problem of poor cash reserves so new employees are often given stock options in lieu of cash which further depresses the share price i read a report once that said that only 1 in 10 penny shares yields a worthwhile return i just do n't like these odds so i tend to avoid

i would strongly advise that you do not use western union or any other wire transfer service for any money transfer unless you personally know and trust the recipient of your funds and the method by which you can communicate the details of the transaction as was mentioned wire transfers are irreversible and very difficult to trace to ensure the actual recipient got the funds in some countries and situations literally anyone can show up at any western union location correctly the details of the transaction which is proof enough they are the intended recipient and receive the cash if the vendor accepts paypal then simply set up a paypal account linked to your credit card and pay the vendor that way this can be done 100 online assuming you have a valid card

goofy are you talking about now who is buying us treasuries or what is the national debt either way in your fucked up money printing economy where you ca nt even pay off your student loans or cover your insurance what to talk of house loans and fancy financial instruments that were based on those which went into default and the fed bought up that required the fed to give the banks an unlimited credit line as a back stop   you see shit head those trillions and trillions of dollars of bad loans and bank bailouts now sits on the feds balance sheet as $ 4.5 trillion leveraged many many many many many   many times so the banks look like they are adequate on paper   that s what it means when you nationalize public debt   understand shit wit   incidentally that s what the fed is trying to unwind and some fucking moron like you will buy and then go bankrupt and ask for a bailout and get more debt from the fed   its a good thing your generation grew up sucking chinese toys the lead in the paint did its job well otherwise you might have actually learnt something

first consider the basic case of what you are asking you expect to have a future obligation to pay interest and you are concerned that the rate when you pay it will be higher than the rate today in the simplest case you could theoretically hedge that risk by buying an asset which pays the market interest rate as the interest rate rises increasing your costs your return on this asset would also increase this would minimize your exposure to interest rate fluctuations there are of course two problems with this simplified solution   1 the reason you expect to pay interest is because you need want to take on debt to purchase your house to fully offset this risk by putting all your money in an asset which bears the market interest rate would effectively be the same as just buying your house in cash 2 the timing of the future outflow is a bit unique you will be locking in a rate in 5 years which will determine the payments for the 5 years after that so unless you own this interest paying asset for that whole future duration you wo n't immediately benefit you also wo n't need want to buy that asset today because the rates from today to 2022 are largely irrelevant to you you want something that directly goes against the prevailing mortgage interest rate in 2022 precisely so in your specific case you could in theory consider the following solution you could short a coupon bond likely one with a 10 year maturity date from today as interest rates rise the value of the coupon bond for it 's remaining life of 5 years which has an implied interest rate set today will drop because you will have shorted an asset dropping in value you will have a gain you could then close your short position when you buy your house in 5 years in theory your gain at that moment in time would equal the present value of the rate differential between today 's low mortgage rates and tomorrow 's high interest rates there are different ways mechanically to achieve what i mention above such as buying forward derivative contracts based on interest rates etc but all methods will have a few important caveats 1 these will not be perfect hedges against your mortgage rates unless the product directly relates to mortgage rates general interest rates will only be a proxy for mortgage rates 2 there is additional risk in taking this type of position taking a short position trading on a margin requires you to make ongoing payments to the broker in the event that your position loses money theoretically those losses would be offset by inherent gains in the future if mortgage rates stay low go lower but that offset is n't in your plan for 5 years 3 5 years may be too long of a timeline for you to accurately time the maturity of your hedge position if you end up moving in 7 years then changes in rates between 2022 might mean you lose on both your hedge position and your mortgage rates 4 taking on a position like this will tie up your capital either because you are directly buying an asset you believe will offset growing interest rates or because you are taking on a margin account for a short position preventing you from using a margin account for other investments to the extent you max out your margin limit i doubt any of these solutions will be desirable to an individual looking to mitigate interest rate risk because of the additional risks it creates but it may help you see this idea in another light

i never understand the mindset of infrastructure being paid for through private investment on a municipal level it makes sense that development fees can help a city pay to replace a bridge that leads to the development or put in some new parks but considering that infrastructure like rail lines and dams are the big concern i do n't really see private entities taking a big interest in them it would've really helped houston if private investment was into management while developing into a major suburban centre based on the evidence shown those private investors did n't have major concerns for improving the city 's infrastructure and just did what they had to in order to be allowed to put in their development   infrastructure belongs in the public sphere things like rail highways dams and coastal protection are in the public 's best interest what does a businessman have to gain by paying to a rail line or put in new traffic signals at an intersection

if you help find a suitable next tenant and help smooth out the transition most landlord generally do n't have an issue to terminate the lease early and move the contract to the new tenant remember that the biggest concerns for landlords is that they do n't want the place to be empty leaving an apartment empty costs them money due to tax strata bills etc as well as putting in jeopardy whatever future plans they might have made under the assumption of a stable income from the rent you could also offer to pay for the listing agent and other switching fees e.g. putting bills under the new tenant 's name etc if you do n't have an early termination clause the rental agreement or sometimes even when you do these things are often negotiable if you can guarantee that your leave wo n't leave them with an empty apartment with no one paying rentals most reasonable landlords would n't have issue with terminating early   many rental agreements also have terms regarding early this usually involves paying a fee which amounts to a month or two of rent this may vary

my answer is that when confronted with the obvious the most common human reaction is to seek reasons for it because things have to be right they have to have a reason we do n't like it when things suck   so when finding out that you are being ripped off every day of your life your reaction is there must be a logical reason that perfectly explain why this is after all the world is fair governments are working in our best interest and if they do it this way they must have a very good reason for it sorry but that not the case you have the facts you are just not looking at them economics as a subject is the proper management of resources and production now forget the fancy theories the elaborate nonsense about stocks and bonds and currencies and pay attention to the actual situation on our planet most people earn $ 2,000 per year clean water is not available for a very sizable percent of the world 's population admittedly 90 of the world 's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the most wealthy 10 a chinese engineer earns a fraction of what a similarly qualified engineer earns in the states most people even in rich countries have a negative net value they have mortgages that run for a third of their lifetimes credit card debts loans do the balance most people are broke does this strike you as the logical result of a fair and balanced economic system   does this look like a random happenstance   the dominant theory is it just happened it 's nobody 's fault and nobody designed it that way and to think otherwise is very bad because it makes you a conspiracy theorist and conspiracy theorists are nuts you are not nuts are you look at the facts already in your possession it did n't just happen   the system is rigged when a suit typing a few numbers in a computer can make more money in 5 minutes than an average joe can make in 100 lifetimes of honest productive work you do n't have a fair economic system you have a scam machine   when you look at a system as broken as the one we have you should n't be asking yourself what makes this system right what you should be asking yourself is more along the lines of why is it broken who benefits why did congress turn its monetary policy over to the federal reserve a group of unelected and unaccountable individuals with strong ties in the banking industry and does not even bother to conduct audits to know how your money is actually managed this brilliant movie money as debt points to a number of outrageous bugs in our economic system now you can dream up reasons why the system should be the way it is and why it is an acceptable system or you can look at the fact and realize that there is no justification for an economic system that perform as badly as it does   back to basics money is supposed to represent production it 's in every basic textbook on the subject of economics so what should money creation be based on debt no gold no randomly printed by the government when they feel like it no although this could actually be better than the 2 previous suggestions money is supposed to represent production index money on production and you have a sound system why is n't it done that way why do you think that is

joe has explained how most mortgages work a mortgage is simply a loan backed by a property and because it 's    both very large and very common covered by some specific laws as    such the bank is n't an investor in your house it simply is lending    you money with the property as collateral so it does n't get any    share of the profit however there are some mortgages when the bank takes part of the increase in the property value e.g. ’s but to let equity loan in the uk   other products allows a old person to take money out of their property in exchange for say 60 of what the property sells for on their death islamic mortgages also work in a different way as interest is not allowed to be charged   for example unlike a conventional mortgage where the purchaser borrows money from    a lender which is then repaid with interest al bank 's sharia    compliant islamic mortgage alternatives home purchase plans or    are based upon the islamic finance principles of a co ownership    agreement diminishing with leasing

well primarily because that 's fraud and fraud prevents a debtor from receiving a discharge in bankruptcy court   fraud would be pretty easy to prove if you did n't have an income change and you have several lines of credit opened on and around the same day with almost no payments made toward them   additionally thanks to the reforms of the bankruptcy code if your income exceeds the median income of your state you 'll be forced in to a chapter 13 and committed to a repayment plan that allocates all of your disposable income to your creditors now if whoever posted that will attempt to simply not pay then negotiate repayment plans with their creditors the process will last far longer than 7 years   it takes a long time to be in default for enough time that a consumer creditor will negotiate the debt and this is assuming the creditor does n't sue you and get a judgement which could apply liens to any property you may own   the will likely cause you to pursue bankruptcy anyway only now you 're at least a few years beyond the point at which you ruined your credit

is this right the example is slightly off google would be running a cafeteria that can be subsidized employees pay an amount to buy food not every one spends the same amount or eats the same amount of food if someone does n't use cafeteria he does n't get more money for example suppose john doe makes $ 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20 for a take home pay of $ 80,000 he spends $ 10,000 on food his employer corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense costing them $ 10,000 but now they can pay john doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $ 10,000 $ the company is now spending $ employing john doe for a savings of $ if a scheme is devised specifically to evade taxes then it is invalid in this case bill may buy groceries worth only $ 5000 so keep track of which employee buys how much groceries in added cost of google plus one ca n't really call it a business expense

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

depending on the the requirements of the annuity you might be able to pull back to part time for   a semester thus reducing the bill for that semester during that semester either get a job that will allow you to save money or get an internship related to your major some of these programs alternate between work semesters and schools semesters   many colleges have an installment plan where the payments are due every month they usually spread them out over a 10 month period most only charge a nominal fee to set up the plan this would reduce the amount of money needed to bridge the gap to only a portion of the tuition payments for the spring semester you could also live off campus to save money there is no guarantee it will be cheaper but because the costs are n't fixed and due at the start of the semester you might be able to stretch your budget

short answer you 're going to end up paying taxes on it despite the home being your primary residence you do n't meet the ownership test and it is n't noted that you have had a change in employment health or other unforeseen circumstances that are forcing you to sell otherwise you could qualify for a reduced maximum exclusion that might allow you to walk away without owing taxes or with a reduced tax bill you ca n't even do a 1031 exchange to re invest into a new primary residence you should check with a tax professional to see what adjustments you can make to the cost basis of the property to minimize your reported net profits during the 5-year period prior to the sale you must have these periods do not necessarily have to coincide you do n't to live in it as your main house for 2 consecutive years just 2 years worth of time of the last 5

hi ly   it 's really great you are doing this and i hope some of the suggestions help you    when i was in wonderful angkor wat a few things struck me as very helpful    1 make your tuk tuk recognizable and write you name somewhere this way when i go out of a temple you will be easy to spot   2 you seem to speak english well this is an important aspect your customers will really appreciate   3 from what i 've seen the methods for getting customers for your tuk tuk in siem reap is as follows get them when they get off the bus and drive them to the hotel then try to tell them to invite you back the next day for taking them to angkor wat i am sure this works but since everybody are doing it i imagine it 's the hardest way for customer acquisition you can distinguish yourself from the other drivers by    a. making sure you show the customers you have excellent english and you can share you knowledge with them    b. sell western style kind of less pushy smile at a potential customer when they see you they will smile back talk to them in your normal voice volume this will make them come closer since they want to hear what a nice smiling guy like is saying   then explain their options for visiting the temples     4 make deals with hotels and people trust the receptionists at their hotel more than street tuk tuks it is highly likely they will ask the reception for the best way to get to angkor wat and you should be the one they recommend try getting on as many lists as possible and high up that list as possible    5 having cold water wet wipes and other commodities are nice ideas but i am not sure this will what get people in your tuk tuk it will only make them more satisfied once they are inside it might be to hard and expensive to keep them ice cold but you can suggest travelers to stop at a kiosk where they can but some supplies before the trip or make a deal with a kiosk and before you exit siem reap stop there and give them a fresh water bottle from the fridge   most importantly do n't spend money on stuff like and curtains before you are sure they are money makers i am pretty sure 99 of customers will not notice they extended they take fresh air for granted     i hope you found this helpful and please feel free to message me   hope to see you soon

good question your assumptions are a bit off track though i am sure you would agree that automation will occur gradually allowing a new workforce that is with relevant skills to support automation tech and operations to bubble up this workforce will drive up consumer spending offsetting your assumption of diminishing consumer spending    the extent to which this new workforce will offset diminishing consumer spending of the being laid off is a matter of debate but one thing is certain consumer spending albeit relatively weaker or stronger will exist and businesses will continue to thrive another possibility is that the workforce getting laid off might be in other sectors of the economy or better yet some companies might re train some of it    the assumption that most of the jobs will be automated does n't necessarily imply that automation leads to job loss some automation will actually drive up productivity which will increase the margin of companies in light of this logic we can assume that employees will be paid more increasing their disposable income     the bottom line is that consumer spending is unlikely to bottom out it might weaken or strengthen for one or two reasons but people will continue consuming and businesses will thrive

bottom line is this there 's no short term capital gains tax in the us there 's only long term capital gains tax which is lower than the regular aka ordinary tax rates short term capital gains are taxed using the ordinary tax rates depending on your bracket so if you 're in the 25 bracket your short term gains are taxed at 25 you 're describing two options for the case 1 you 'll pay 25 tax your marginal rate + 10 penalty flat rate total 35 for the case 2 you 'll pay 25 tax your marginal rate + 0 penalty total 25 thus by withdrawing from ira you 'll be 10 worse than by realizing capital gains in addition if you need $ 10 k taking it from ira will make the whole amount taxable while realizing capital gains from a taxable account will make only the gains taxable the original investment amount is yours and had been taxed before so not only there 's a 10 difference in the tax rate there 's also a significant difference in the amount being taxed thus withdrawing from ira is generally not a good idea and you will never be better off with withdrawing from ira than with cashing out taxable investments from tax perspective that 's by design

no thanks to the principle of corporate personhood   the legal entity company c is the owner and parent of the private company sub s   you and c are separate legal entities as are c and s. this principle helps to legally insulate the parties for purposes such as liability taxes and so forth   if company c is sued you may be financially at stake i.e. your investment in c is devalued or made worthless but you are not personally being sued   however the may attach you as an additional if the facts of the suit merit it   but without legal of corporations then potentially all owners and maybe a number of the employees would be sued any time somebody sued the business which is messy for companies and messy for   it 's also far cleaner for lenders to lend to   unified business entities rather than a variety of thousands of ever shifting shareholders note that this is a separate analysis that assumes the companies are not treated as partnerships or disregarded entities tax for tax purposes in which case an owner may for some purposes be imputed to own the assets of c.   i 've also ignored the consolidated tax return which would allow c and s to file a type of corporate joint return that for some purposes treats them similarly to common entity for the simplest variation of your question the answer is no   you do not own the assets of a corporation by virtue of owning a few of its shares edit   in light of your edit to include fb and whatsapp and the wrinkle about corporate books   if sub s is 100 owned by company c then you do not have any inspection rights to s because you are not a shareholder   you also do not have virtual corporation inspection rights through company c.   however if a person has inspection rights to company c and sub s appears on the books and financial records of c then your c rights will do the job of seeing s information however facebook is a public company so they will make regular public filings and disclosures that should at least partly cover whatsapp   so i hedge and clear my throat by that my securities training is limited but i believe that the sec filings of a public company will as a practical matter maybe a matter of law moot the inspection rights   at the very least i suspect you 'd need a proper purpose under for example to demand the inspection and they will have already made extensive disclosures that i believe will be sufficient   i defer to more experienced securities experts on that question but i do n't believe inspection rights are designed for public companies

i think we 'd need to look at actual numbers to see where you 're running into trouble i 'm also a little confused by your use of the term unexpected expenses you seem to be using that to describe expenses that are quite regular that occur every x months and so are totally expected but assuming this is just some wording here 's the thing start out by taking the amount of each expense divided by the number of months between occurrences this is the monthly cost of each expense add all these up this is the amount that you should be setting aside every month for these expenses once you get a base amount set up so to take a simple example say you have to pay property taxes of $ 1200 twice a year so that 's $ 1200 every 6 months = $ 200 per month also say you have to pay a water bill once every 3 months that 's typically $ 90 so $ 90 divided by 3 = $ 30 assuming that was it in the long term you 'd need to put aside $ 230 per month to stay even i say in the long term because when you 're just starting you need to put aside an amount sufficient that your balance wo n't fall below zero the easiest way to do this is to just set up a chart where you start from zero and add in this example $ 230 each month and then subtract the amount of the bills when they will hit do this for some reasonable time in the future say one year find the biggest negative balance if you can add this amount to get started you 'll be safe if not add this amount divided by the number of months from now until it occurs and make that a temporary addition to your deposits check if you now are safely always positive if not repeat the process for the next biggest negative for example let 's say the property tax bills are april and october and the water bills are february may august and november then your chart would look like this the biggest negative is in april so you have to add $ in the first 4 months or $ per month let 's say $ 93 that would give now you stay at least barely above water for the whole year you could extend the chart our further but odds are the exact numbers will change next year and you 'll have to recalculate anyway the more irregular the expenses the more you   will build up just before the big expense hits but that 's the whole point of saving for these right if a $ 1200 bill is coming next week and you do n't have close to $ 1200 saved up in the account where is the money coming from if you have enough spare cash that you can just take the $ 1200 out of what you would have spent on lunch tomorrow then you do n't need this sort of account

amount is the closest single word   amount in dollars would be the easiest way to specify information you are requesting   amount and currency if you in an area using multiple currencies   an accountant might be able to give you a more technical term but it would be accountancy jargon   amount due credit amount debit amount amount deposited amount credited amount withdrawn or amount included   if you 're writing instructions and want to specify that the person following the instructions needs to indicate the currency you 'll probably have to simply state that requirement    based on us centric thinking inside the us money is dollars dollars is money   for us citizens outside the country we would always tack on the currency   100 dollars or 100 euro   there is a segment of americans who do not understand geography and that other countries exist and that they use different currencies might not realize that other countries have currencies named dollars and that usd means us dollars   so for u.s. citizens be specific and clear bottom line if this is written for us residents and they need to specify the currency you need to explicitly require them to list the amount and currency

businesses are n't a charity they pay for work and exist for profit they are n't supposed to have feelings so austerity and getting the most out of your employees causes the company to become lean and efficient    a lot of companies run with a lot of fat just organizational bloat and inefficiency i do n't take issue with changing the culture of at a company and laying people off to make the company run without unnecessarily paying a bunch of people you would n't hire 3 or 4 companies to mow part of your lawn and pay them all for mowing the whole thing you would nt go out to eat every day if you were on a tight budget so why would a company carry extra employees to do the same job and why would you expect that a company should not use a zero budgeting system   you wrote everything to seemingly suggest that 3 g is a cancer to the business world that they do things in all the wrong ways but they 've owned burger king for almost a decade now they earned a 46 return over a two year period and continue to own a majority stake in burger king i think burger king has a better reputation now than it did then tim hortons was only acquired 3 years ago people have been bitching about how they no longer make fresh donuts since before 2010 in other words canadians have been becoming more skeptical of tim hortons since before the buyout from burger king and 3 g did n't significantly change the values and product they cut costs and made it a less cushy environment the ill will toward tim hortons was not caused by 3 g as you suggested

i just want to point out something that seems to be generally true if you are supposed to report something to the irs and you do n't the irs will probably send you a letter assuming the maximum possible tax liability and it 's up to you to prove that scenario is incorrect in your case you obviously owe no tax but since you did n't report it the irs simply assumed that you do owe tax until you prove otherwise you 're one form away from fixing the issue i have first hand experience that this is also true if you forget to report an hsa distribution i received a letter considering my entire distribution as if it was for non eligible medical expenses this made the amount taxable and had an additional 20 penalty to boot of course i have medical receipts for all of the distributions which makes them not taxable and had i simply put the correct number on my return to begin with i would n't have had to fill out the additional form to correct my mistake

this is an old question that has an accepted answer but it has gotten bumped due to an edit and the answers given are incorrect i am assuming this means that every other friday the company is going into the open public market buying those shares and then giving it out to the employees no companies will internally hold shares that it intends to offer employees as additional compensation there are no open market transactions so the market price of the stock does not change at least not due to buying pressure   the only net effect is an equivalent expense for the compensation but that should already be accounted for in the share price as normal operating expenses these share may come through an initial buyback from the market but more common is that when companies issue new shares they keep some internally for exactly this situation   if they issued new shares every pay period it would dilute the existing shares several times a quarter which would be difficult to account for

excellent question though any why question can be challenging to answer because it depends on the financial products in question   at least i have n't seen many target date retirement funds that include a high percent of foreign stocks so below explains the ones i 've seen which are primarily us stocks the united states before the last twenty years has been seen as a country of stability   this is not true anymore and it 's difficult for my generation to understand because we grew up in the u.s.a being challenged and tend to think that china and india have always been powers but when we read investors like benjamin graham who had significant influence with warren buffett we can see this bias the u.s.a to them is stable and other countries are risky   again with the national debt and the political game in our current time it does not feel this way   but that bias is often reflect in financial instruments the us dollar is still the reserve currency though it 's influence is declining and i would expect it to decline   contrary to my view because i could be wrong here is mish who argues that no one wants to have the reserve currency because having a reserve currency brings disadvantages see here bogus threats to us reserve currency status no country really wants it i present this to show that my view could be wrong finally there tends to be the go with what you know   many of these funds are managed by u.s. citizens so they tend to have a u.s. bias and feel more comfortable investing their money at home in fact a famous mutual fund manager peter lynch had a similar mentality buy the company behind the stock and what company do we tend to know best   the ones around us one final note i 'm not saying this mentality is correct just what the attitude is like   i think you may find that younger mutual fund managers tend to include more foreign stocks as they 've seen that different world

assuming the numbers in your comments are accurate you have $ extra after paying your expenses   i assume this includes loan payments you said you have $ 3k in savings and a $ monthly nut so only one month of living expenses in savings in my opinion your first goal should be to put 100 of your extra money towards savings each month until you have six months of living expenses saved   that 's $ 6 or $   since you have $ 3 k already that means you need $ more which is exactly six months $ next i would pay off your $ 4 k for the bedroom furniture   i do n't know the terms you got but usually if you are not completely paid off when it comes time to pay interest the rate is very high and you have to pay interest not just going forward but from the inception of the loan ymmv check your loan terms you may want to look into consolidating your high interest loans into a single loan at a lower rate   barring that i would put 100 of my extra monthly income toward your 10 loan until its paid off and then your loan until that 's paid off   i would not consider investing in any non tax advantaged vehicle until those two loans at minimum were paid off   is a very good guaranteed return on your money after that i would continue the strategy of aggressively paying the maximum per month toward your highest interest loans until they are all paid off with the possible exception of the very low rate sallie mae loans   however i 'm probably more conservative than your average investor and i have a major aversion to paying interest

interest rate swaps are used to transfer risk from one party to another they can be used to transfer many types of risk but most common are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk   there are a few key concepts that i have noticed most people have trouble with which are below   1 the notional amount this is the amount that the two legs the floating and fixed will be based on if you think about each leg as a loan the notional amount would be the principal however in a swap this amount never changes hands rather it is just an amount used to calculate what the dollar amount exchanged should be    2 the floating and fixed legs are the interest rates that will be exchanged the fixed leg will always pay out the same amount no matter the changes in the market while the floating rate will change periodically depending on market conditions as a side note it is often agreed that only the difference in the two rates will be paid rather then sending the money back and forth    3 and finally it is important to note that at the inception of the swap the notional value will always be 0 many people miss this but when you think about it no company would want to sign a deal the from inception puts them in a loosing position    i hope that helped without a more specific question all i can do is list random facts about swaps and hope they are useful to you

you are very correct rebalancing is basically selling off winners to buy losers of course the thinking is that selling a winner that has already increased 100 on the basis that it has doubled so it is likely to go down in the near future however just look at apple as an example if you bought apple in june 2009 for $ 20 adjusted price and sold it as part of rebalancing when it rose to $ 40 adjusted price in september 2010 you would have missed out on it reaching over $ 95 2 years later similarly you look to rebalance by buying assets which have been say dropped by 50 on the basis that it has dropped so much that it should start increasing in the near future but many times the price can fall even further a better method would be to sell your winners when they stop being winners i.e. their uptrend ends and replace them with assets that are just starting their winning ways i.e. their downtrend has ended and are now starting to uptrend this can be achieved by looking at price action and referring to the definitions of an uptrend and a downtrend definition of an uptrend higher highs and higher lows definition of a downtrend lower lows and lower highs

in theory yes it makes sense to sell your current bonds in pursuit of higher yields in practice there are a lot of smart people out there who own bonds and the market is very efficient so you wo n't see opportunities to trade new bonds for old bonds with better yields from the same issuer if you do find someone willing to buy your old bond for a higher amount it probably points to a change in the contract that the new bonds were issued under see argentina for an example

i do n't work in risk management in the bank i 'm in but do talk to them occasionally depending on what job you will actually do there you need a very good math background i would also consider a familiarity with programming to be needed for a lot of the jobs   if you are considering risk management outside of the financial sector i guess the bar will be lower at least the company i used to work in had a treasury risk management group largely composed of finance and economics majors

the confusion comes from ambiguity in popular belief that businesses are required to accept as payment in reality a business can state the terms of a transaction to their pleasure on the other hand debt is different no lender can refuse cash or other legal tender for repayment of debt sometimes people try to split hairs and argue well if i eat a steak and i owe the restaurant $ 100 they should have to accept my $ 100 as tender for the debt of my meal not true the restaurant is n't giving you a line of credit they 're billing you after services rendered and your payment is due on their terms

if you are arguing that we need to regulate industries to promote competition i completely agree i would even go as far to say that reducing taxes on the worlds richest people has caused money to stagnate in the hands of the few effectively reducing the multiplier effect and truly creating this mess we are in today   when rich people have more money they do n't turn around and spend it in vc they look for someone who needs to borrow it and who will give them a good return thus why debts have all increased publicly and privately throughout the world

you could use any of various financial apis e.g. yahoo finance to get prices of some reference stock and bond index funds   that would be a reasonable approximation to market performance over a given time span as for inflation data just googling monthly inflation data gave me two pages with numbers that seem to agree and go back to   if you want to double check their numbers you could go to the source at the bls as for whether any existing analysis exists i 'm not sure exactly what you mean   i do n't think you need to do much analysis to show that stock returns are different over different time periods

quick get a social security number for the child you will need it before you file your taxes early next year if you do n't have a ssn for your child you will not be able to claim them as a dependent if you applied for one already many do so at the hospital then wait for it to arrive the next step is to open a savings account with the child 's ssn then have your parent write the check in the child 's name and deposit it into the account   if it is written in the child 's name already then you do n't need a new check from them if the check is large you may run into problems if you take a check in the name of a minor and try and deposit it into your account the bank would have no idea that the person is related to you

for the period 1950 to 2009 if you adjust the s&p 500 for inflation and account for dividends the average annual return comes out to exactly source currently inflation is around 2   so your 2 apy is a 0 real return where the stock market return is 7   i.e. on average stocks have a return that is higher by 7    if you mix in bonds 70 stocks to 30 bonds your real returns will drop to around 5.5 but you are safer in individual years bonds often have good years when stocks have bad years    we 're making a bit of a false dichotomy here   we 're talking about returns on stocks in retirement accounts versus returns on cds in regular accounts   you can buy stocks in regular accounts and it is legally possible to have a cd in a retirement account   so you can get bankruptcy protection and tax advantages with a cd

bonds are valued based on all of this using the concept of the time value of money simply stated money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later case in point let 's say the par value of a bond is $ 100 and will mature 10 years from this date these are common terms for most bonds though the u.s. treasury has a variety of bonds with varying par values and maturation periods with a 0 coupon rate nothing 's paid out prior to maturity if the company or government issuing the bonds needs one million dollars and the people buying the bonds are expecting a 5 rate of return on their investment then each bond would only sell for about $ 62 and the bond issuer would have to sell a par value of $ million in bonds to get its $ 1 m now these numbers are based on equations that calculate the future value of an investment made now and conversely the present value of a future return back to that time value of money concept money now that you 're paying to buy the bond is worth more than money later that you 'll get back at maturity so you will expect to be returned more than you invested to account for this time difference the percentage of rate of return is known as the yield or the discount rate depending on what you 're calculating what else you take into consideration when defining the rate like inflation and whom you talk to now that $ m in par value may be hard for the bond issuer to swallow the issuer is effectively paying interest on interest over the lifetime of the bond instead many issuers choose to issue coupon bonds which have a coupon rate determining the amount of a coupon payment this can be equated pretty closely with you making interest only payments on a credit card balance each period in which interest is compounded you pay the amount of interest that has accrued to avoid this compounding effect   from an accounting standpoint the coupon rate lowers the amount of real monies paid the same $ 1 m in bonds maturing in 10 years with a 5 expected rate of return but with a 5 coupon rate now only requires payments totalling $ 1.5 m and that half million in interest is paid $ 50k at a time annually or $ 25k semi annually but from a finance standpoint because the payments made in the first few years are worth more than the payments made closer to and at maturity the present value of all these coupon payments plus the maturity payout is higher than if the full payout happened at maturity and so the future value of the total investment is higher   coupon rates on bonds thus allow a bond issuer to plan a bond package in less complicated terms if you as a small business need $ 1 m for a project which you will repay in 10 years and during that time you are willing to tolerate a 5 interest rate on the outstanding money then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ 1 million worth to mature in 10 years and a 5 coupon rate now whether the market is willing to accept that rate is up to the market right now they 'd be over the moon with that rate and would be willing to buy the bonds for more than their face value because the present value would then match the yield they 're willing to accept as in any market system you as the seller will sell to the highest bidder to get the best price available if however they think you are a bad bet they 'll want an even higher rate of return and so the present value of all coupon and maturity payments will be less than the par value and so will the purchase price

if you apply for a mortgage with someone other than your current savings account provider they will not have access to this level of information   they will pull your credit report which contains information about debts and credit cards repayments amount borrowed etc and overdrafts as well as anything like against you but has no information about current or savings accounts other than who your main current account provider is you can and should check your credit report yourself to make sure there 's nothing incorrect on there this only costs a few pounds and you can find out about how to do this from the 3 main agencies here if you apply for a mortgage with the same provider that you use for your current account and savings account they could theoretically look at your account usage history in this level of detail however i would be very surprised if they had a problem with the type of activity you describe they 'll be looking more at whether you have regular income into your account whether you have frequently gone overdrawn without permission etc moving money around between accounts or having a fluctuating savings account balance is not even slightly a red flag

look at a broader diversification something like for physical gold i 'd look at a mix of gold coins and bullion study the pricing model for coins you 'll probably find that the spreads on small coins make them too expensive there are a few levels of risk with storing in a vault the practical risk is that your government will close banks in the event of a panic and your money will be inaccessible you need to balance that risk with the risk to your personal security that comes with having lots of gold or cash in your home my recommendation is to avoid wasting time on the mad max scenarios if the world economy collapses into utter ruin we 're all screwed a few gold coins wo n't do much for you

first i would like to use a better chart   in my opinion a close of day line chart a lot of important information   here is a daily log chart   the initial drop from the close on oct 3 was to intraday to close at on oct 10   after this the market was still very volatile and reached a low of on nov 20 closing only slightly higher than this   it traded as high as on jan 6 2009 but the whole period of nov 24 feb 13 was somewhat of a trading range of roughly 800 900   despite this the news reports of the time were frequently saying things like this is n't going to be a v shaped recovery it is going to be u shaped   the roughly one week dip you see feb 27 mar 9 taking it to an intraday low of only about 11 below the previous low on first glance appears to be just a continuation of the previous trend    however the mar 10 uptrend started with various news articles such as this one which i recall at the time suggested things like the parts of the glass steagall act of 1933 which had been repealed by the gramm leach bliley act   although these attempts appear to have been unsuccessful the widespread of such attempts in the media seemed to have reversed a common notion which i saw widespread on forums and other places that we are going to be in this mess forever the market has nowhere to go but down and therefore shorting the market is a good idea now   i do n't find the article itself but one prominent theme was the up tick rule on short selling source from this viewpoint then that the last dip was driven not so much by a recognition that the economy was really in the toilet as this really was discounted in the first drop and at least by late november had already been figured into the price   instead it was sort of the opposite of a market top where now you started seeing individual investors jump on the band wagon and decide that now was the time for a into selling short   the fact that the up tick rule was likely to be re had a noticeable effect on the final slide

in general all income is taxable regardless of the source if you living in the u.s. i do n't think you said anywhere where you live then if you are donating this money to charity you would have to declare the income and then declare a deduction for the charitable contribution at that point the two would cancel out and the net result is that you would n't have to pay any tax on the income but you ca n't just leave it off your tax return well even if you donated all of it to charity to that you do n't have to pay income taxes on it you would still have to pay social security taxes and it would still affect your social security benefits when you retire if you 're saying that the organization receiving the money is itself a charity as opposed to donating the money to some other organization that is a charity than you usually have to be registered as a charity with the irs to avoid income taxes there are still forms to file to report the income but you would n't have to pay taxes there are some exceptions to the requirement to register basically if your organization is very small and for certain religious organizations

i would contact your loan servicing company explain the situation and see if you can renegotiate terms they may be able to drop the interest rate or the schedule to reduce the payment amount i would n't default on the loan as that would likely hinder coming to working in the us in the future not knowing your financial situation or country could you attempt to obtain financing in your own country in order to pay off the us based loan i would at least attempt to make some sort of payment while you attempt refinancing or pursue a job in the us even if it technically puts or keeps you in default of the loan making any payment at least shows the willingness to pay back the loan and you 're not intentionally defaulting on your obligation

interest means that the money on the accounts belongs to you regardless of who 's name is the account titled to for example if you give money to someone non us person say   trying to avoid fbar requirements and that person puts it in his account but will give you money whenever you ask for it you have interest in that account this is in order for people not to avoid fbar requirements by putting their money into someone 's else accounts signature authority means that although the account is not in your name and the money on it is not your money you have the right to access that account and perform operations on it this usually happens when people are employees of a company and have signature authority over the company 's accounts but it is also frequently the case for people having signature authority over the accounts that belong to their family members for example your parents are not us persons but they gave you access to their account because they do n't know how to work with the bank and you do you have signature authority over the account if you have your own account you have both interest in it and signature authority over it

i was active in prosper when it started up it was very easy to get attracted to the high risk loans with big interest rates and i lost about 14 after all my loans ran their course there 's 10 still active but it wo n't change the figure by much prosper has wider standards than lending club so more borrowers with worse credit scores could ask for loans lenders could also set interest rates far lower so they could end up having loans with rates lower than the risk implied   this was set up with the idea of a free market where anyone could ask to borrow and anyone could loan money at whatever interest rate they wanted   it turns out a lot of lenders were not as smart as they thought they were aside it 's funny how people will for a free market but when they lose money will suddenly be against the free market they said they wanted this seems to apply to both individual p2p lenders up to massive multinational banks   since then prosper has tightened their standards on who can borrow and the interest rates are now fixed so i expect going forward it will be less easy to lose a bunch of money   the key is that one bad loan will erase the return of many good ones so it 's best to examine the loans carefully and stick with the high quality   simplified example if you have 10 1 yr loans of $ 100 each paying 10 interest year you get 10 return at the end of the year so $ 100 10 of $ 1000 but if one loan goes bad at the start you have lost money so a 90 success rate in picking borrowers leads to a loss you want to diversity over quite a few loans and you want to fund quality loans   i think really enjoyed investing through prosper because it gave me an insight into lending and loss ratios that i had not had before it also caused me to look at the banks with even more when the case of the no doc loans and am loans came to light

it would seem that you are in a position where you are able to save money and you hope to have your money work for you from your statement above it is implied that you are a professional with a steady income not related to the finance field with that said it is better to diversify your portfolio and have your money work for you through passive investments rather than an active one where you actively search for companies that are below market price that research takes time and much more experience in order to properly execute   now if your overall goal is to trade actively then maybe researching individual companies might be the best way to get your feet wet but if your goal is to create a diversified portfolio and make your money work for you then passive is the way to go   two passive financial vehicles   mutual funds and etfs depending on what you are hoping to accomplish in the future an etf or a mutual fund will likely suite your situation i would encourage you to do your due diligence and find out the weakness and strength of each from there you are able to make an informed decision

as others have alluded to but have n't said due to the lack of reputation points to spare you can take advantage of oil prices by leveraging up and using as much credit and margin as the banks and brokerages respectively will lend you people assume that the correct answer on this forum has to as conservative financial advice and this is not advice nor conservative futures contracts are readily available but they are expensive to obtain like a minimum entry of $ but if this expense is no such object to you then you can then obtain this contract which is actually worth 20x that and experience the price appreciation and depreciation of the whole contract the concept is similar to a downpayment on a mortgage you assume rock bottom oil prices but fortunately for you futures contracts will allow you to quickly change your bets from future price appreciation and allow you to speculate on future price depreciation so although the union workers will be protesting full time after the drilling company lays them off you will still be getting wealthier long options these are the best the difference with options amongst other speculation products is that options require the least amount of capital risk for the greatest reward with futures or with trading shares of an etf especially on margin you have to put up a lot of capital and if the market does not go your desired direction then will lose a lot and on margin products you can lose more than you put in being long options does not come with these a long march 2015 call option on uso etf can currently be bought for less than $ 200 of actual cash ie the trading quote will be less than $ 2.00 but this will cost you less than $ 200 and will be worth $ 1000 on a very modest rebound in prices the most you can lose is the $ 200 for the contract compared to $ on the futures or $ 100,000 that you do n't have in the futures market if oil really moves against you or compared to whatever large amount of cash needed to actually buy shares of an etf needed to make any decent return these are the most lucrative and fun and and ways to take advantage of rock bottom oil prices as an individual

the problem is increased productivity is what 's eliminating jobs a lot of jobs and its not going to be something governments can change what they can change is preventing their existing jobs from going elsewhere by not giving companies tax breaks to do so and they need to stop the promotion of privatization and offshoring and outsourcing via ftas like gats and tisa   if you take the long view its pretty much a good thing for society for people to be freed to move beyond many of these jobs that as our technology improves are highly amenable to automation   people should be able to get the kind of educations they need to do them for free as part of the public education we give people and should continue to give people despite these changes so we can all remain relevant and employed in the 21st century    we need to really take advantage of those years during which time the brain is growing so rapidly   basically we need to make 12 years do the work of 18 years now meaning that people when they graduate their basic education k-12 should be able to function at a ma or ms level that s what we need to do to stop this permanent loss of employment    because people with less than a masters degree are losing their jobs now that should be the new normal

bp holdings management on taxes and thier original intents is designed to generate enough revenue to sustain essential public service such as public safety civil infrastructure for communication and transportation and basic health services when you see a government hospital you know your taxes support the upkeep of that institution and when you see soldiers fighting in you can be sure tax went into training them and keeping them fit and equipped to preserve our national security    as essential as tax is to our national existence many do not know the true value of what taxes can do other than what we have mentioned above here are some generally unknown facts about taxes and what you need to do to make full use of their benefits    1 taxes should not favour one group over another   taxes are intended to be neutral and must not cater to any one sector or group of people over another neither should it impose or interfere with individual decision making    what this signifies is that taxes as they were originally conceived had an altruistic purpose meant to benefit people equally without favoring any individual or any societal unit it is a fund to provide services and public amenities for all people alike so whether you earn only so much or make millions you walk or drive over the same road or bridge that taxes helped to build we can not discount the goodwill and welfare taxes have brought to both ancient and modern societies   pay your taxes so you can enjoy them    2 taxes must be predictable    in order for a government to function well it must have some stability in terms of its fiscal health without the necessary funds to run a government chaos would ensue and so taxes must flow into a state ’s coffers at a regular schedule and at a reasonably predictable amount or the oil will run out at a time when the engine of progress badly needs it    now we understand why the state imposes and does not merely request that taxes be paid at a particular time of the year why april for many countries it is the time of the year when people have probably paid off last year ’s debts or recovered from the expenses of the holiday season in the previous year it is also the time when most parents have extra cash because their children are on school vacation unfortunately it is also the time when many people want to spend a vacation so it is either you pay your tax or spend a nice vacation during spring for most people    3 taxes must be simple   assessment and computation of tax and determination should be easily understood by the average taxpayer but this has been forgotten by tax officials in recent years it has not only become more complex in terms of schedule as the tax calendar seems to nowadays it has also become so hard to decipher through the many pages now incorporated in the tax return the best thing to do if you have extra cash is to let an accountant do your tax    4 taxes must not be forced but enforced to encourage voluntary compliance   the key is convenience as much as possible it is the tax duty to encourage voluntary compliance among taxpayers through creative implementation without making people feel they are being harassed or unduly burdened ordinary taxpayers have to go through a lot of stress figuring out forms and lining up to pay their tax perhaps a more convenient way can be implemented using modern technology and the banking system if we can pay bills in malls or online now why can not tax be paid in the same way    5 taxes earmarked for specific purposes must result in direct benefits   certain taxes such as gasoline tax for road maintenance must be dedicated to the particular purpose they were intended based on a direct cost benefit link today much of the corruption in government circles arise from taxes or diverting them from their intended purposes thus losing sight of the original intent of the tax    what can the taxpayer do to prevent these things from happening aside from joining protest rallies or talking to your congress representative you can actually form or join small groups that could create awareness among people through the media or internet this is already being done on facebook and twitter how effective it is may be hard to measure but time will come when a critical mass of concerned people will have a force of a virtual army that can change the tide of events in a society    inevitable as taxes may be enjoying their ultimate benefits can be a much better motivation that spending our time looking for ways to avoid them

throwaway account was a good idea   i work in government sourcing and depending on what government you work for what you 're doing is illegal as shit   federal and most state statute prevent a government employee from 1 getting paid for another job while being paid by the government for working during the same period double dipping and 2 being involved in the selection process of a vendor with whom the employee has a vested interest   additionally if you work in a position that requires you to complete an ethics form and certify it you will be further breaking the law if you do n't disclose ownership by falsifying a government document    realistically you 're probably just full of it but if you 're telling the truth what you 're doing is unethical and probably illegal   and before you get too smug you should know that government auditors are n't nearly as incompetent as you might think just overworked it might take a year or two but i 'm guessing they figure it out eventually government procurement and auditors generally have to verify things like company registration documents etc before contracts and any time a contract is renewed the auditors go back and look at those documents it wo n't be hard to figure out what 's going on especially if you were the pm for the project

coming from someone who has worked a in the account servicing department of an actual bank in the us other answers are right this is probably a scam the phone number on the letter is probably ringing to a fraudulent call center these are very well managed and sound professional and you must independently locate and dial the true contact number to us bank now tell them what happened reporting is critical securing your money is critical every piece of information you provided the bank when you called needs to be changed or worked around account numbers passwords usernames card numbers get changed tax id numbers get de prioritized as an authentication mechanism even if the government wo n't change them the true bank probably wo n't transfer you to the branch if the front line call center says they will ask the person on the phone what the branch can do that they can not information is your friend they will probably transfer you to a special department that handles these reports apparently union bank 's call center transfers you to the branch then has the branch make this transfer maybe their front line call center team is empowered to handle it like i was either way plug your phone in if the call takes less than 5 minutes they did n't actually do everything 5 to 8 minutes per department is more likely plus hold time there 's a lot of forms they 're filling out what if that office is closed because of time differences go online and ask for an atm limit increase start doing cash advances at local banks if your card allows it just get that money out of that account before it 's in a fraudsters account keep receipts even if the machine declines the transaction either way get cash on hand while you wait for a new debit card and checks for the new account you 're going to open what if this was fraud you draw your us bank account down to zero $ 800 at a time and you do n't close it or change passwords is it over no then your account will get closed and you will owe everything that the fraudsters rack up these charges can put your account far in the negative from this point forward this is called participation in a scam in your depository agreement because you fell victim to it did n't report and the info used was voluntarily given you will also lose any of your money that they spend what if us bank really is closing your account then they owe you every penny you had in it minus any fees allowed in the depository agreement this closure can happen several days after the date on the warning so being able to withdraw does n't mean you 're safe banks usually ship an official check shipped to the last known address they had for you why would a bank within the united states close my account when it 's not below the minimum balance probably because your non resident alien registration from when you were in school has expired and federal law prohibits them from doing business with you now these need renewed at least every three years renewing federally is not enough the bank must be aware of the updated expiration date how do i find out why my account is being closed you ask the real us bank they might find that it 's not being closed good news follow the scam reporting procedure open a new account with us bank if you want or elsewhere and close the old one if it is being closed by the bank they 'll tell you why and they 'll tell you what your next options are ask what can be done other commenters are right that bitcoin activity may have flagged it that activity might actually be against your depository agreement or it set off a detection system or many other reasons the bank who services your account is the only place that knows for sure if i offer them $ 500 per year will they likely keep the account opened otherwise i got to go to singapore open another account legitimate financial institutions in the united states do n't work this way if there is a legal problem with your tax status in the us money to the bank wo n't solve it let 's call the folks you 've talked to and the real because until confirms we have no reason to believe that the letter is real   will ask for money do n't give it do n't give them any further information gather up as much information from them as possible instead where to send it for example then report that to wo n't have a way to charge $ 500/year to you only if they offer a type of account to everyone that costs $ 500 ask for the truth in savings act disclosures banks are legally required to provide these upon request then read them do n't put or keep your money anywhere you do n't understand

one possibility that i use i set up an llc and get paid through that entity then i set up a payroll service through bank of america and set up direct deposit so that it is free   i pay myself at 70 of my hourly rate based on the number of hours i work and the payroll service does all the calculations for me and sets up the payments to the irs   typically money is left over in my business account when tax time rolls around i have a w2 from my llc and a 1099 from the company i work for i put the w2 into my personal income and for the business   i enter the revenue on the 1099 and the payroll expenses from paying myself the left over in the business account is taxed as ordinary income maybe it 's overkill but setting up the llc makes it possible to a set up a solo 401(k and put up to $ away tax free and b i can write off business expenses more easily

equity could mean stock options if that 's the case if the company makes it big you 'll have the option to buy stocks cheap which can then be sold at a huge profit how are you going to buy those without income   5 equity is laughable i 'd be looking for 30 40 if not better without salary   or even better a salary to elaborate 5 is fine and even normal for an early employee taking a mild pay cut in exchange for a chance at return that chance of any return on the equity is only about 1/20 94 of startups fail there is no reason for an employee to work for no pay an argument could be made for a cofounder with direct control and influence in the company to work for equity only but it would be a more that 30 40 or an advisory role 5 is reasonable   i also just noticed you mentioned investing in the startup with cash as an angel investor i 'd still expect far more than 5 and preferred shares at that more like 16 20   read this for more info on how equity is usually split

as mhoran_psprep and others have already said it sounds like the sale is concluded and your son has no obligation to return the car or pay a dime more the only case in which your son should consider returning the car is if it works in his favor for example if he is able to secure a similar bargain on a different car and the current dealer buys the current car back from your son at a loss if the dealer wants to buy the car back your son should first get them to agree to cover any fees already incurred by your son after that he should negotiate that the dealer split the remaining difference with him suppose the dealership gave a $ 3000 discount and your son paid $ 1000 in title transfer registration and any other fees such as a cashier 's check or tax if applicable the remaining difference is $ 2000 your son should get half that   in this scenario the dealer only loses half as much money and your son gains $ 1000 for his trouble

in general you do n't need to keep bills around for more than a few months   the exceptions are anything that was itemized on your federal or state income taxes you want to keep these around for seven years in case of an audit by the irs brokerage statements buying selling stocks bonds mutual funds etc   you need to know how much you bought a stock for when you sell it to calculate capital gains information relating to major renovations to your house   this can be used to reduce the gain when you sell anything relating to a business again for tax and valuation purposes when selling a house the last years worth of utility bills might be useful to show potential buyers however i get almost all of my recurring bills electronically now   they get saved and backed up   in that case its easier to just keep everything than to selectively delete stuff   it takes very little space is easier to find things than in paper files and is much less hassle when moving than boxes full of paper

i 'm sorry i did n't realize you served congrats on getting your government to help you out with your degree   as for me i 've deleted my comment and am answering with a throwaway because i do n't want this to be tied to my persona in any way because of the following much like i did n't know shit about you you do n't know shit about me i was born in a shithole country you 've never heard of my grandparents were collective farmers with barely a primary school education and my parents grew up on those farms and did n't go to college my father was by the government and thrown in jail when i was four and stayed there until i was 10 thankfully my mom and i managed to move to a western country where we lived on government subsistence and with no family within 3000 km because they 're all still living in such shithole countries    we came into money once he got released and i reached high school age and hence the what you qualify as lavish jealousy inducing lifestyle but even then despite the expensive private school which sends one kid to an ivy every two years vacations and nice clothes i had to hustle entirely by myself to get into good schools in the us nobody in my entire extended family had ever gone on to education in any country let alone the most competitive one in the world despite ready access i took on no standardized prep tutors got a 35 fuck the people saying high score = expensive tutors no after school help no expensive college app packaging i did n't even use my story as a college essay in fact nobody knows not even my closest friends they just think i 'm some rich kid much like you because i do n't think the circumstances i was born with and alternatively was blessed with afterwards allow me special privileges or empathy in any way the amount of effort i can put into my life solely depends on me not my environment   and now that i 'm here it could all come crashing down any second because my shithole country could decide to take it all away again my parents ca n't even visit me in the us hence the frequent flyer status you motherfucker and who knows if i 'll be able to finish my expensive program here while on a student visa hence finance i also find the american of military service when in so many countries including mine it 's mandatory and a simple way of life but i 'm not going to argue with you on that because i realize it 's a sensitive subject for you lot and i still respect your decision

degree of operating leverage dol measures the percent change in ebit given a 1 change in revenue in other words if dol is 1.5 then increasing revenue by 1 will increase ebit by 1.5   degree of financial leverage measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in ebit   degree of total leverage cuts ebit out and measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in revenue    what all three of these numbers measure is elasticity the elasticity between two variables is always the percentage change effect on one due to a 1 change in the other    before we talk about why you would multiply let ’s first just look at absolute changes between a change of three variables x y and z. lets say x impacts y and y impacts z to make it even more concrete let ’s imagine a classroom where every student is required to have 2 books and every book has 100 pages so x = students y = of books and z = of pages if we add one student to the class we need to add 2 books if we add 1 book to the class we have added 100 pages with absolute changes like this it is obvious that we do n’t add we multiply in other words to directly see the impact of a new student on the number of pages x -&gt z we would say 1 student -&gt 2 books -&gt 200 pages to say 102 pages would obviously be silly    for percent changes this looks pretty similar to make it easy say the class has 100 students so adding 1 student is a 1 change then we go from 200 books to 202 books a 1 change so the degree of student to book leverage is 1 which make sense there are no fixed pages we go from 20,000 pages to pages also a 1 change so the degree of book to page leverage is also 1 thus the student to page leverage is also just a flat 1    let ’s add fixed amounts the teacher has a single 2,000 page book on how to teach we ’ll assume the class has 20 students so we start with 20 2 + 1 = 41 books and 40 100 + 2,000 = 6,000 pages let ’s add a student we have a -1 = 4 increase in students -1 = increase in books 1 = 3.33 increase in pages so the degree of student to book leverage is = and the degree of book to page leverage is = and the direct student to page leverage is = 1.20 again note that here it would be silly to add the degrees of leverage and when we do multiply them we get = 1.2 the right answer    from here the application to ebit = sales fixed cost variable cost = gross margin sales fixed cost and the application to eps = ebit interest taxes = 1 tax interest should be obvious i can supply the full proof mathematically however if you would like

a straddle is an options strategy in which one buys or sells options of the same maturity expiry date that allow the buyer or seller to profit based on how much the price of the underlying security moves regardless of the direction of price movement ie a long straddle would be you buy a call and a put at the same strike price and the same expiration date your profit would be if the underlying stock moves far enough down or then the premiums you paid for the put + call options in case one waits till expiry profit = expiry level strike price premium paid for bought options straddle

you need to report the interest expense assuming the loans were for your business you need to report interest expense only interest principle is not an expense just as the loan proceeds are not income the interest expense goes to the appropriate line on your schedule c or e depending on whether you used the loan for the online business or the rental people whom you borrowed from must also report the interest as income to them on their schedule b. you can not deduct the interest expense if they do n't report it as interest income if you did n't take the loans for your business then the interest is not deductible you do n't need to report anything people who lent you money still have to report the interest you paid to them as income on schedule b. if you paid no interest free loan or below above market interest to a related party family member then the imputed interest is considered income to them and gift to you they need to report it on their schedule b and depending on amounts on a gift tax return for $ 1 k to $ 10 k loans there probably will be no need in gift tax returns the exemption is for $ 14 k per year per person if the imputed interest rules may apply to you better talk to a licensed tax adviser on how to proceed

i ’m going to answer this because accounting books only reflect the dollar value of inventories which means if you look at the balance sheet of mcdonalds you will not see how many bags of french fries are remaining at their storage facility you will only see the total value at cost basis   your requirement for noting the number of shares purchased is not part of the double entry accounting system   when you transfer $ 10000 from bank to broker the entries would be   the bank ’s name and the broker ’s name will not appear on the balance sheet   when you purchase 50 shares at $ 40 per share the accounting system does not care about the number of shares or the price all it cares is the $ 2000 total cost and the commission of $ 10   you have two choices either place $ 10 to an expense account or incorporate it into the total cost making it $ 2010   the entries for the second method would be now your balance sheet would reflect what happens if the price increases from $ 40 per share to $ 50 per share tomorrow do nothing your balance sheet will show the cost of $ 2010 until the shares are sold or the accounting period ends it will not show the market value of $ 2500   instead the portfolio tracker would show $ 2500 the most basic tracker is   later if you finally sell the shares at $ 50 per share with $ 10 commission again the number of shares will not be reflected anywhere in the accounting system only the total proceeds from the sale matters

trump called it controls rather than owns   he is firmly remaining as the ceo and is the largest shareholder so that 's a moot point   that is still $ 85 billion in shares   if trump wipes off only 10 in stock price with his constant threats of taxes and breaking up a monopoly that would cost bezos $ 8.5 billion   if trump does break up amazon then bezos may lose much more   trump explained to fox news this is owned as a toy by jeff bezos who controls amazon amazon is getting away with murder tax wise he 's using the washington post for power so that the politicians in washington do n't tax amazon like they should be taxed trump said trump added that he read somewhere that bezos was worried trump would go after him for anti trust violations

i think she misses a little bit in that thee definitely needs to be some middle ground in due respect she did come from an undergrad at wharton with a background in banking by the time she entered the mba she was well averse in the financial and accounting theory this knowledge can be very useful to those however who chose to pursue the topics she discusses like design comp sci engineering etc as undergrads and are now seeking the business acumen necessary to run organizations    further i would like based on her background that she likely followed a pretty cookie cutter lifestyle throughout most of her career academically followed the path academia laid out etc    like any other experience an mba is what you chose to get out of it if she believed she would further develop accounting and finance skills having already been a wharton undergrad and banker then the fault lies with her yes the pursuit of ideas is extraordinarily valuable to mba 's and arguably they should focus on it more however you are an adult by that point and you should have the maturity and acumen to chose and understand what you want to get out of your degree even if that means sacrificing grades

first piece of advice fire your agent    a pushy agent is a bad agent   from what you 've told us he 's actually given you poor advice regarding mortgage interest rates   rates are already at historic lows   that and the state of the world economy mean that further rate cuts are more likely in the near term second piece of advice while more information on the real estate market you 're in would help   going in at asking price is rarely a good idea    sale prices from the last few years are not relevant to what you should pay because the last few years include a financial crisis caused in large part by the bursting of a housing bubble   they could be even less relevant depending on your location because of a spike in foreclosures in certain areas of the u.s.   there was already a ton of housing inventory before so an increase due to foreclosures is going to depress prices further   now that banks are finally practicing the due diligence they should have been all along your ability to be pre approved for large mortgage amount puts you in a strong position    use a tool like zillow or to see what properties in that area have sold for over the past six months   you should also be able to see a history of what prices the particular property you 're interested in has been offered and/or sold at in the past   also check and see how long the particular property you 're interested in has been on the market   if it 's been on the market more than 60 90 days it 's priced too high

it depends on what kind of pension you get and your anticipated retirement income   if you have one of those nice defined benefit plans that pays 90 of your last 5 years average salary annually you might not want to bother with a separate rrsp and put your money into other use instead while most canadians should worry about not having enough to retire on some might end up with too much and costing them in the form current purchases and entitlements to government retirement benefits figuring out how much you need for retirement is not trivial either   a lot of people talks about planning for needing 70 of what you made now as a way to preserve your lifestyle   well my opinion is that those type of generalization might work for the people in the middle of the income band and is too little for those in the low income and possibly too much for those with high income   my own approach is estimate your retirement income requirement by listing out your anticipated expenses as if you were doing budget   i would agree that 's not the best approach either back to my comment about no one size fits all but it 's one that i feel most comfortable with once you have that figure factor in what you think you will get from the government oas cpp and etc and you will have the amount of money you need for retirement   i will warn against using average life expectancy to forecast your retirement needs 50 of the people will end up with extra money not a bad problem and the other 50 will run out of money bad but very true problem if you use that approach instead of going on and write an essay on this topic i will simply say this everyone 's situation is different and just like solving any other complex problems you need to start with end in mind and work things backward with a ton of different scenario to be able to cope with whatever life might throw at you   if you spend enough time in the library bookstore looking through books on the topic of estate planning and retirement planning you will find people arguing back and fro on these topics this is a sign that this is complex and no one has the one good answer for   do a bit of reading by yourself and if still unsure or just want to be sure go spend the money and review your plan with a fee only advisor   they will be able to provide another opinion on your situation after thoroughly studying your situation

a couple options that i know of interactive brokers offers a paper trading mode to its account holders that allows you to start with a pretend stack of money and place simulated trades to test trading ideas they also provide an api that allows you to interface with their platform for retrieving quotes placing orders and the such as you noted however it 's not free you must hold a funded brokerage account in order to qualify for access to their platform in order to maintain an account there are minimums for required equity and monthly activity measured in dollars that you spend on commissions so you wo n't get access to their platform without having a decent amount of skin in the game ib 's native api is java based is an unofficial wrapper that makes the interface available in python i 've not used ib at all myself but i 've heard good things about their api and its accessibility via edit ib now supports python via their published api so using is no longer needed unless you wish to use python the officially supported api is based on python 3 td ameritrade also offers an api that is usable by its brokerage clients they do not offer any such paper trading mode so you would need to execute transactions based on quotes at the corresponding trade times and then keep track of your simulated account history yourself the api supports quote retrieval price history and trade execution among other functions tda might be more attractive than ib if you 're looking for a low cost link into market data as i believe their minimum equity levels are lower to get access you 'll need to sign up for an api developer account which i believe requires an nda i do n't believe there is an official python implementation of the api but if you 're a capable python writer you should n't have trouble up to the published interfaces some caveats as when doing any strategy backtesting you 'll want to be sure to be pessimistic when doing so so your optimism does n't make your trades look more successful than they would be in the real world at a minimum you 'll want to ensure that your simulations transact at the posted bid ask prices not necessarily the last trade 's price as well as any commissions and fees associated with the trade a more robust scheme would also take into account the depth of the order book also known as level 2 quotes which can cause additional slippage in the prices at which you buy sell your security an even more robust scheme would take into account the potential latency of trade execution looking at all prices over some time period that covers the maximum expected latency and simulating the trade at the worst possible price

your broker likely did n't close your position out because it is a covered position why interfere with a trade that has no risk to it from their perspective there 's no risk for the broker since your account holds the shares available for delivery definition of covered for if and when the options you wrote sold are exercised and buyers of those options will eventually exercise the options by expiration if they remain in the money there 's only a chance that an option buyer exercises prematurely and usually they do n't because there 's often time value left in the option that the option buyer has an ahem option to exercise is a very key point   you wrote i fully expected my position to be automatically liquidated by whoever bought my call that 's a false assumption about the way options actually work   i suggest some study of the option exercise faqs here perhaps if your position were uncovered i.e. you wrote the call without owning the stock do n't try this at home kids and you also had insufficient margin to cover such a short position then the broker might have justifiably liquidated your position whereas in a covered call situation there 's really no reason for them to want to interfere and i would consider that interference as opposed to helpful   the situation you 've described is neither risky for them nor out of the ordinary   it is and should be completely up to you to decide how to close out the position anyway your choices generally are

the risk besides the extra interest is that you might be upside down on the loan because the car loses value the moment you drive off the lot the slower you pay it off the longer it takes to get the loan balance below the resale value of course if you have a significant down payment the risk of being upside down is not as great even buying a used car does n't help because if you try to sell it back to the dealer the next week they wo nt give you the full price you paid some people try and split the difference get the longer term loan but then pay it off as quickly as the shorter term loan yes the interest rate is higher but if you need to drop the payment back to the required level you can do so

tl;dr the cnn money and yahoo finance charts are wildly inaccurate the td ameritrade chart appears to be accurate and shows returns with reinvested dividends ignoring buggy data cnn most likely shows reinvested dividends for quoted securities but not for the s&p 500 index yahoo most likely shows all returns without reinvested dividends thanks to a tip from grade eh bacon i was able to determine that td ameritrade reports returns with reinvested dividends as it claims to do the chart it appears that s&p 500 grew by over the five year period the chart covers meanwhile according to this s&p 500 return estimator the five year return of s&p 500 with reinvested dividends was between july 2012 to july 2017 vs. raw returns i have no idea what numbers cnn money is working from because it claims s&p 500 only grew about 35 over the last five years which is less than half of the raw return ditto for yahoo which claims 45 growth even stranger still the cnn chart for vfinx an s&p 500 index fund clearly shows the correct market growth without reinvesting dividends from the s&p 500 index so whatever problem exists is inconsistent   yahoo also agrees with itself for vfinx but comes in a bit low even if your assume no reinvestment of dividends 68 vs. 78 expected i 'm not sure if it 's ever right   by way of comparison td 's chart for vfinx seems to be consistent with its chart and with reality   as a final sanity check i pulled historical prices from yahoo finance it closed at $ on 27 aug 2012 and $ on 28 aug 2017 or growth overall that agrees with td and the return calculator above and disagrees with cnn money on worse yahoo 's own charts both and vfinx disagree with yahoo 's own historical data

short answer yes this is a scam i see three different possibilities how they get you i will rank them from best to worst scammer a sends 100 $ to you you then follow his instructions and send back 50 $ through wu this is he then contacts his bank and tells them he never intended to send that 100 $ to you then bank will then reverse that transaction and give him back his money leaving you 50 $ short scammer a hacks or scams innocent person b and either sends b s money to you or tricks person b to do it when person b reports this to the police it will look like you were behind the whole thing the transaction will be reversed leaving you 50 $ short and with unwanted police attention see this article for an extreme example the nice person a wants to send money to a criminal syndicate or terrorist organization but do n't want to be associated with it leaving you 50 $ up and possibly on a bunch of terrorist watch lists ouch the extra info you provide would n't be necessary for any of these scams but i guess it could be nice to have for some regular identity theft this is by no means an exhaustive list of all that the scammers could do it 's just a short list to show you how dangerous it would be to play along to state the obvious do n't walk from this person run

it 's important to distinguish between speculation and investing buying something because you hope to make money on market fluctuations is speculation buying something and expecting to make money because your money is providing actual economic value is investing   if person a buys 100 shares of a stock with the intent of selling them in a few hours and person b buys 100 shares of the same stock with the intent of holding on to it for a year then obviously at that point they both have the same risk the difference comes over the course of the year first person b is going to be making money from the economic value the company provides over the whole year while the only way person a can make money is from market fluctuation the economic value the company provides over the course of an hour is unlikely to be significant person b is exposed to the risk of buying the stock but that 's by the profit from holding the stock for a year while person a just has the risk second if person a is buying a new stock every hour then they 're going to have thousands of transactions so even though person b assumed just as much risk as person a for that one transaction person a has more total risk

the seriousness of your situation depends on whether your girlfriend was owed a refund for each tax return she failed to file or whether she owed additional money if she owed money on one or more of the tax returns she failed to file stop it is time to consult a lawyer at the very least you need to contact an accountant who specialises in this sort of thing she will owe interest and penalties and may be liable for criminal prosecution there are options available and lawyers who specialise in this sort of thing e.g. this one from a simple google search if she is in this position you need professional help and you need it soon so you can make a voluntary disclosure and head off criminal prosecution assuming the taxes are fairly simple you are likely looking at a few thousand dollars but probably less than $ 7,500 for professional help there will be substantial penalties assessed as well for any taxes owing if you wait until the cra starts proceedings you are most likely looking at $ 10,000 to $ 50,000 assuming the matter is not too complicated and would be facing the possibility of a jail term not exceeding five years if she was due a refund on every single one of the tax returns she failed to file or at least if she did not owe additional money you are probably in a situation you can deal with yourself she will want to file all of the tax returns as soon as possible but will not be assessed a penalty i have personally filed taxes several months late a number of times when i was owed a refund you may still want to consider professional help but it is probably not necessary under no circumstances should she allow her father near her finances again ever you should also be careful to trust any responses to this question including my response because we are unlikely to be professional accountants i certainly am not you are well outside the abilities of an h&r block accountant in this matter and need a real certified accountant and/or a lawyer who specialises in failure to file cases

from personal experience i can tell you that bank account numbers are not unique   someone from another branch of my bank was able to withdraw money from my account at my branch because they had the same account number   you are supposed to enter your branch number on the withdrawal slip in front of your account number   the person who got my money did not do this   because it was at my branch the teller debited my account for the transaction   i caught this on my monthly statement and immediately complained to my branch manager he was able to retrieve the withdrawal slip and saw what had happened   he credited my account and said he was going to talk to the teller who should have asked for the branch number and/or should have noticed that the name and address on the withdrawal slip did not match those on my account   i would not have thought that the bank would allow this situation considering how many numbers are available to assign but they did

one of the factors of a credit score is the length of time revolving accounts have been established having a credit card with any line of credit will help in this regard the account will age regardless of your use or utilization if you are having issues with credit limits and no credit history you may have trouble getting financing for the purchase you should be sure you 're approved for financing and not just that the financing option is available potentially with the caveat of for well qualified borrowers generally if you 've gotten approved for financing that will come in the form of another credit card account many contracting and plumbing companies will do this in hopes you will use the card for future purchases or a bank loan account more common for auto and home loans with the credit card account you might be able to perform a balance transfer but there are usually fees associated with that for bank loan accounts you probably ca n't pay that off with a credit card you 'll need to transfer money to the account via ach or send in a check in short i would n't bet on paying with your current credit card to get any benefit ianal utilizing promotional offers whether interest free for months no balance transfer fees or whatever and passing your debt around is not illegal not fraudulent and in many cases advised this is a link though that is more for people to distribute utilization across multiple cards and to minimize interest accrued many people myself included use a credit card for purchasing everything then pay it off in full every month or sometimes immediately to reap the benefit of cash back rewards and other cardholder benefits i 've also made a major payment tuition actually on a discover card and opened up a new visa card with of no interest and no balance transfer fees to let the bill sit for 12 months while i finished school and got a job

to answer your question as clarified in a comment all i wanted to know what will happen if i enter my debit card number in the sixteen digit account number they offer on the application for balance transfer that 's all almost certainly subject to the particular terms and conditions of the offer no money will move the only question is exactly when and how they will say no if you do it online and their system is clever enough to look up the the first six digits of the card number you enter their system might learn straight away that you   have entered a debit card number eg a card starting is a bank of ireland debit card otherwise you 'll have to wait until the request goes to their back office system which will eventually lead to the card issuer 's system being contacted at which point it will become clear that it 's a debit card and your transfer request will be refused at that point that said some credit card companies do offer a money transfer aka super balance transfer which is an offer to transfer money directly into a bank account putting the resulting debt on the credit card i 've never seen these offered without having to call a service centre and talk to a person though presumably so that they can check that the details they have for you about income etc are still correct

you would think so would n't you after all it 's your money in practise though it 's not as easy as you might think because anti money laundering and anti fraud laws mean you generally have to withdraw money to the same account you funded your trading from some forex trading account providers will allow you to fund from multiple sources but then insist on putting money back to those sources in some proportion or some order or other some forex trading account providers at least claim that they may at their discretion let you do it if the destination account is in the same name but i would n't be surprised if they charged you for it and actually the charges might be somewhat justified if they have to invoke identification procedures to make sure the other account is indeed actually you you would have to talk to a specific service provider and see if they agree to do what you want they all have faqs about funding and withdrawal so you can scan around online for the slightly more flexible ones and then give them a call you might find it difficult to get any guarantees out of them though

if you need to transfer a larger amount than the $ 14k person person limit one accepted workaround is to structure it as a loan then gift the payments over the duration of the loan there are intra family mortgage companies which specialize in setting up this kind of transaction note that this does n't allow you to give more without penalty it just lets you transfer the actual cash earlier in exchange for some bookkeeping overhead and some fees for the legal processing and mortgage registration

from how are indexes weighted market capitalization weighted indexes or market or cap weighted    indexes weight their securities by market value as measured by    capitalization that is current security price outstanding shares    the vast majority of equity indexes today are cap weighted including    the s&p 500 and the ftse 100 in a cap weighted index changes in the    market value of larger securities move the index ’s overall trajectory    more than those of smaller ones if the fund you are referencing is an etf then there may be some work to do to figure out what underlying securities to use when handling creation and redemption units as an etf will generally have shares created in 50,000 shares at a time through authorized participants if the fund you are referencing is an open end fund then there is still cash flows to manage in the fund as the fund has create and redeem shares in on a daily basis note in both cases that there can be updates to an index such as quarterly rebalancing of outstanding share counts changes in members because of mergers acquisitions or spin offs and possibly a few other factors how to beat the benchmark has a piece that may also be useful here for those indices with many members from 1998 as you can see its te is also persistently positive but if anything    seems to be declining over time in fact the average net te for the    whole period is + per month or an astounding + pa net    after expenses the fund expense ratio is annually for a    whopping before expense te of + 2.5 annually this is once again    highly statistically significant with p values of after    expenses and before expenses the sd of the te is higher for    than for lowering its degree of statistical    significance it is remarkable enough for any fund to beat its    benchmark by 2.5 annually over 17 years but it is downright to    see this done by an index fund to complete the picture since 1992 the vanguard extended index fund    has beaten its benchmark the wilshire 4500 by per year after    expenses net of expenses and even the vanguard index trust    500 has beaten its benchmark by a razor thin 0.08 annually before    but not after expenses in the same period so what is going on here a hint is found in 's 1996 reference    guide the 9 10 portfolio captures the return behavior of u.s. small company stocks as identified by and other academic    researchers dimensional employs a patient buyer discount block    trading strategy which has resulted in negative total trading costs    despite the poor liquidity of small company stocks beginning in 1982    ibbotson associates of chicago has used the 9 10 portfolio results to    calculate the performance of small company stocks for their stocks    bonds bills and inflation a small cap index fund can not possibly own all of the thousands of    stocks in its benchmark instead it owns a representative sample    further these stocks are usually thinly traded with wide bid ask    spreads in essence what the folks at learned was that they could    tell the market makers in these stocks look old chaps we do n't have    to own your stock and unless you let us inside your spread we 'll    pitch our elsewhere further we 're prepared to wait until a    motivated seller wishes to unload a large block in a sense this    gives the fund the luxury of picking and choosing stocks at prices    more favorable than generally available hence higher long term    returns it appears that vanguard did not tumble onto this until a    decade later but tumble they did to complete the picture this strategy works best in the    markets so the excess returns are greatest in the smallest stocks    which is why the positive te is greatest for the 9 10 fund less    in the vanguard small cap fund less still in the vanguard index    extended fund and minuscule with the s&p500 there are some who say the biggest joke in the world of finance is the    idea of value added active management if so then the punch line    seems to be this if you really want to beat the indexes then you    got ta buy an index fund

this is easy but you wo n't like it the reason you give away to large corporations is that you are communists and simply take so much tax that nobody in their right mind wants anything to do with you this means you have to buy companies to make your economy work if you can not understand the difference between the word buy and give away then you have been suckered by this local government the government has simply failed to perform efficiently and is trying to make up for it we see the advertisements across the country come here and be tax free for 10 years as if it is a retail purchase item just put a spinner on your hat that says something stupid because it the same type of attention   tldr ny is a nerd trying to buy friends
