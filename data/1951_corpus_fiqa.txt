if you read the fine print in the pricing terms section of that card you 'll see by becoming a visa business card you agree that the card is being used only for business purposes and that the card is being issued to a public or private company including a sole proprietor or employees or contractors of an organization so that card is a chase branded visa card and should be accepted anywhere other visa cards are credit cards are normally either mastercard or visa although many of them make that rather   the only major exceptions i know of are american express and discover   and store cards that are only good at one particular store

an index is just a mathematical calculation based on stock prices anyone can create such a calculation and given a little effort publish it based on publicly available data the question of open source is simply whether or not the calculator chooses to publish the calculation used given how easy an index is to create the issue is not the open source nature or otherwise but its credibility and usefulness

it is my perspective that white majority nations seem to be nicer than black majority nations   but it is n't sufficient information to conclude that either   races are distinct and important   or    racial traits are reason that the of nations divide along racial lines   your evidence can not prove that one race is better at anything it 's just confirmation bias   edit just to be clear it 's a yes answer

both states will want to tax you your tax home is where you maintain a domicile are registered to vote etc and you will probably want to keep this as ma since you state that ma is your permanent residence and you are staying in a rented place in pa but be careful about voter registration that is one of the items that can be used to determine your state of residence   ok so if you and your spouse are ma residents   you should file jointly as residents in ma and as nonresidents in pa do the calculations on the nonresident return first and then the calculations on the resident   return typically on a nonresident tax return the calculations are effectively the following report all your income usually agi from the federal return   call this $ x. compute the pa state tax due on $ x.   note that you follow the rules for nonresidents in doing this not the calculations used by pa residents call the amount of tax you computed as $ y. what part of the total income $ x is attributable to pa sources if this amount is $ z then you owe pa $ y times z x on the resident return in ma you will likely get some credit for the taxes paid to pa and this will reduce your ma tax burden usually the maximum credit is limited to the lesser of actual tax paid to pa and what you would have had to pay ma for the same income as far as withholding is concerned your employer in pa will withhold pa taxes as if you are a pa resident but you can adjust the amount via the pa equivalent of irs form w4 so as to account for any additional   tax that might be due because you will be filing as a nonresident   else you can pay estimated taxes via the pa equivalent of irs form 1040es similarly your wife can adjust her withholding to account for the ma taxes that you will owe on the joint income or you can pay estimated taxes to ma too note that it is unlikely that your employer in pennsylvania will withhold   massachusetts taxes and send them to massachusetts for you e.g. if it is a ma and pa store but there may be special deals available if   your employer does business in both states i.e. is a ma and pa store

i do n't have experience with tsp in particular but they look to be roughly the same as 401(k loans if the g fund rate is equal to the yield of government bonds then your main risk is the risk that yields increase which means the interest you 're paying is less than what you would have earned on the investments here are some other things to consider for any car loan i would borrow as little as possible with as short a term as possible   to me the interest savings and additional risks from borrowing from your retirement is n't worth it

yes you may do this at any time before signing but to make a change like this after the official loan documents have been drawn up will cost you extra fees   the typical redraw fee is around $ 200 in ca    does it make sense to do so   no it does not   if you have an extra 1 it would probably be better to use that money to purchase a lower interest rate   here 's an example let 's say you 're buying a $ 200,000 house and your offered interest rate is 4.75 just an example    with 10 down you 'd have a loan amount of $ 180,000 and a p&i payment of $ per month    with 11 down you 'd have a loan amount of $ and a p&i payment of $ per month now let 's pretend you buy your interest rate down to   with 10 down you 'd still have a loan amount of $ 180,000 but your p&i payment would be $ per month    even though the last option gives you the best payment if i were in your shoes i 'd stick with the 10 down and save that extra cash in the bank for a rainy day   buying a home comes with a lot of new expenses and many are unexpected good luck

the examples you provide in the question are completely irrelevant it does n't matter where the brokerage is or where is the company you own stocks in for a fairly standard case of an non resident alien international student living full time in the us your capital gains are us sourced let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally    has its source in the united states if the alien has a tax home in the    united states the key factor in determining if an individual is a    u.s. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether    the alien 's tax home has shifted to the united states if an alien    does not have a tax home in the united states then the alien ’s u.s.    source capital gains would be treated as foreign source and thus    nontaxable in general under the tax home rules a person who is away or who    intends to be away from his tax home for longer than 1 year has    shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new    location see chapter 1 of publication 463 travel entertainment    gift and car expenses i 'll assume you 've read this and just want an explanation on what it means what it means is that if you move to the us for a significant period of time expected length of 1 year or more your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the us and the capital gains are sourced to the us from the start of your move for example you are a foreign and your 4-year assignment started in may. year end you 're not us tax resident exempt but you 've stayed in the us for more than 183 days and since your assignment is longer than 1 year your tax home is now in the us you 'll pay the 30 flat tax another example you 're a foreign airline pilot coming to the us every other day flying the airline aircraft you end up staying in the us 184 days but your tax home has n't shifted nor you 're a us tax resident you do n't pay the flat tax keep in mind that tax treaties may alter the situation since in many cases they also cover the capital gains situation for non residents

yes you can withdraw the excess contribution or actually any amount you contributed for 2015 not necessarily an excess plus earnings from that withdrawn contribution by april 15 and not incur a penalty for the excess contribution it would count as if you did not contribute that amount at all the earnings would be taxed as regular income and the earnings may incur a penalty yes you can recharacterize all or part of your roth ira contribution as a traditional ira contribution or vice versa by april 15 recharacterization means you pretend the contribution was originally made as a traditional ira contribution and did not involve roth ira at all conversion is something very different and can only go from traditional to roth not the other way around you are likely not eligible to deduct that traditional ira contribution so you will have to report it as a non deductible traditional ira contribution on a 2015 form 8606 part 1 note that after you 've it as a traditional ira contribution you can also then convert that traditional ira money to a roth ira if you want achieving the same state as what you have now contributing to a traditional ira and then converting to a roth ira is called a backdoor roth ira contribution if you do n't have any existing pre tax money in traditional ira or other iras then this achieves the same as a regular roth ira contribution except with no income limits when you convert the earnings you have made since contributing will be taxed as income if you had done the backdoor originally to begin with convert right after contributing you would have had no earnings in between and no tax to pay but since if you do the conversion now you have waited so long you are disadvantaged by having to pay tax on the earnings in between if you convert you will have to fill out form 8606 part 2 for the year you convert 2016

just for another opinion radio host clark howard would suggest killing the private student loans as quickly as possible   the only reason is the industry around private student loans has fewer rules as to how they interact with you and they have historically been very unpleasant if you have to deal with them in bad financial times as a safety net get rid of the private student loans as your main focus while you have the money and rates are low   not for financial reasons per se but for peace of mind the other advice in this question are great but nobody mentioned the potential dark side of private student loans

what you 're describing is a non deductible traditional ira   that is what happens when your employer 401 k or your high income from using a traditional ira the normal way    yes non deductible traditional iras are stupid    now let 's be clear on the mechanism behind the difference   there 's an of tax law that the same money ca n't be taxed twice   this is baked so deep into tax law that it often is n't even specified particularly   the irs is not allowed to impose tax on money already taxed i.e. the original contribution on an nd trad ira   so this is not a new kind of ira it is simply a trad ira with an   but then some say so are deductible traditional iras when compared to the roth    the real power of an nd trad ira is that it can be converted to roth at all income levels   this is called the roth backdoor   it combines three factors contribute to an nd trad ira stick it in a money market sweep fund and a week later convert to roth pay taxes on the 17 cents of growth in the sweep fund since the rest was already taxed   the net effect is to work the same as a roth contribution not tax deductible becomes a roth and is not taxed on distribution    if you already have traditional ira money that you contributed that was n't taxed this really screws things up   because you ca n't segment or lifo your ira money the irs considers it one huge bucket and requires you draw in proportion eek suppose you contribute $ 5000 to an ira in a non deductible mode   but you also have a different ira funded with pretax money that now has $ 45,000    as far as irs is concerned you have one $ 50,000 ira and only $ 5000 10 is post tax    you convert $ 5000 to roth and irs says 90 of that money is taxable since it 's the same pool of money   you owe taxes on all of it less the $ 500 fraction that was pre taxed and $ 4500 of already taxed ira remains in the account   the math gets totally out of hand after just a couple of conversions    your best bet is to convert the whole at one time and to avoid a monstrous tax hit do this in a gap year

hi alex   i 've been alerted you 're seeking a better answer to this question   please accept my apologies for not coming back to this question sooner it got buried   no in general you can not make an early withdrawal penalty free from a 403(b account to use towards the purchase of a home withdrawals before age 59 1/2 are generally subject to the 10 early withdrawal penalty on top of ordinary income tax some 403(b plans may allow for a loan but the availability and conditions vary by plan if you 'd consider a loan you should check with your plan administrator or your plan 's summary plan description often available at one 's company intranet or hr web site   i do contract work for an hr consulting firm that assists others in building such sites and are usually something made available for download in a retirement or wealth section of such web sites note that a loan from a 403(b would need to be paid back into the plan over some period of time e.g. 5 years though i have come across examples of some plans that do permit a longer pay back period of 10 15 even 30 years if the loan is used for a home purchase   but consider this article the 403(b loan the new debtors prison finally to your last point   yes if you have an ira there are rules permitting withdrawal of up to $ 10,000 penalty free for use towards the purchase of a first home   see page 53 in irs publication 590   there 's also a good article at all about iras for first time home buyers such a withdrawal from a traditional ira remains subject to ordinary income tax   if have a roth ira you can withdraw free of income tax but you need to pay attention to the roth ira 5 year rule additional resources

everyone has made some good points that i was going to mention but to put it in terms that might make it easier to decide as stated by others paying off debt and being free is always the goal and desirable however you must also consider the efficiency of what you do as well for example there are two common types of student loans there are others but let 's focus on these and that is subsidized and unsubsidized the main difference subsidized loans do n't earn interest on your balance while you are in school it only happens when you graduate and come out of repayment grace period unsubsidized loans begin accumulating interest the moment they are disbursed but you are not required to make payments on them until you graduate all student loans are deferred until you graduate and exhaust your grace period or other means of deferring your payment say for example a or forbearance however it is often recommended that on unsubsidized loans you pay down your principle while still in school to avoid that massive interest amount that will get added to it when you are officially in repayment on the other hand it is often if not always recommended that you hold off on paying subsidized loans until you are done and go into repayment as for all intents and purposes its not costing you anything extra to wait family and parent loans are considered and treated more like personal loans so treat them as such hope that helps also do n't forget to take advantage of the income based repayment options as they will make the payments manageable enough to avoid making them a burden while you are trying to get a job and go post education further reading   income driven plans department of education income driven repayment plans

have to do a presentation for an international business and cultures class in about a month and the assigned wsj article is n't quite clicking with me and looking for a kind soul here to put it into layman 's terms i guess   if i am violating any policy or breaking a rule by posting the text from the article please delete   thank you for any reply   washington finance officials trying to avert the next global economic crisis found time at a summit here to worry about something besides brexit and european banks china 's mounting debts and its economic   the country 's surging credit growth in its steel and metals industries and its bloated housing market drew widespread complaints from finance officials and central bankers attending semiannual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank   officials china for its efforts to get the yuan included in the imf 's international basket of currencies known as special drawing rights starting oct. 1 and despite a couple of scares in the past year or so the country 's markets and economic growth have appeared to stabilize in recent months   but in a sign of how important the world 's second biggest economy is to global growth china is increasingly being called out   u.s. treasury secretary warned beijing in unusually candid language about china 's overproduction and which he suggested could become the biggest u.s. complaint about the country as their earlier disputes over the country 's exchange rate become less divisive   i 'm talking about steel i 'm talking about aluminum i 'm talking about real estate when you do n't have market forces driving investment when you do n't have bad investments allowed to fail you end up with resources allocated in a way that ultimately the future of economic growth mr. said at the institute for international economics on thursday   the imf zeroed in on a measure called current credit a widely followed international indicator of potential crises the deviation of china 's credit growth from its long term trend has surged from zero during the financial crisis to up to 27 last year banks balance sheets grew to of gross domestic product   more is needed especially to curb excess credit growth reduce the opacity of credit products and ensure sound interbank funding structures said peter deputy director of the fund 's monetary and capital markets department   china 's policy makers are caught in a trap economists say dealing with the debt problem would require the country to start deleveraging but slower credit growth is bound to hamper the overall economy that could backfire by making it harder for companies to repay existing debt   down on credit would also raise the prospect of political unrest in a country that has grown accustomed to very rapid growth faced with such prospects the country 's leaders have largely credit restraint in the hope that they will be able to deal with its economic problems over time   part of the problem is the complicated and poorly disclosed structure of the country 's banking system economists say   the increasing complexity of the shadow banking both on the asset side but even more on the funding side where a lot of the funding is short term is not stable markus the imf 's asia pacific deputy director told reporters on thursday it 's still of a size that is manageable but the trajectory is dangerous and needs to be contained   china 's appetite for steel and aluminum which abruptly in the past year or so is of vital interest to commodity exporting economies such as russia and brazil for now exporters appear to be confident that demand wo n't drop off again in the short term   china 's growth is stabilized at a lower level brazilian finance minister said in an interview i do n't see a further collapse coming   still much will depend on china 's economic transition   they are trying to alter their priority from manufacturing to services from export oriented to domestic consumption said indian finance minister in an interview in the transformational stage there will be   chinese officials in washington touted the country 's annual gdp of between 6 and 7 and said growth has remained stable as economy transitions   if that transformation is successful china will continue to have a stable share of global growth people 's bank of china deputy governor gang said on thursday   ian and bob davis contributed to this article   credit by william

i need to see the policy you are referring to give a more accurate answer however what could be happening it ’s again the way these instruments are structured for example if the insurance premium is say 11,000 of which 1000 is toward expenses and term insurance amount the balance 10,000 is invested in growth the promise is that this will grow max of 9.5 and never below zero ie say if we are talking only about a year you can get anything between 10,000 to   the s p long term average return is in the range of 12 -15 i do n't remember correctly so the company by capping it at 9.5 is on average basis making a profit of 2.5 to 5.5 ie in a good year say the s p return is around 18 the company has pocketed close to 9 more money    on a bad year say the index gave a return of say 5 the insurance company would take this loss out of the good years if say when your policy at the s p for that year has given poor returns you would automatically get less returns   typically one enters into life insurance on a long term horizon and hence the long term averages should be used as a better reference and going by that one would make more money just by investing this in an index directly as you whether you want to invest in such a scheme should be your judgment in my opinion i prefer to stay away from things that are not transparent

give him a second chance to fix it   some computer problems are hard to nail down   this   so you 're a tech   it 's common to work a problem do procedure a and b    that should 've fixed it test repeatedly to make sure it 's fixed and    hand it back to the customer and then the customer under his    operating conditions has it fail again   if it comes back to you you have the that a and b    did n't work   and you immediately try c and get it fixed    this    knowledge does not magically transfer to other shops    so the user goes into yelp mode and storms off angry to another shop they    blindly try a and b again burn in send him home it fails again    user 's even   this is how computers don't get fixed 5 discount for cash is reasonable if you want to know why that 's normal sign up for square   credit cards and checks have a significant overhead including the risk of bounces and chargebacks and that adds up to about 5   only a few businesses actively solicit it but many family owned businesses would accept it if you offered   so does the shop give you a creep factor other than your feelings about him not fixing it the first time   if so cut your losses and bolt you will definitely need to pay cash to have this fixed properly   otherwise take it back to him and give him a chance to fix it properly having dealt with a lot of customers what you say sounds an awful lot like problem so minor i was able to use it for 9 months before bothering to get it fixed which i 'm only doing because the warranty is ending and therefore i am about having to give it up for an extended period of time to have it fixed because the problem just is n't that important   if that 's true you 're in a values conflict and you might just be better off recognizing that   cheap pcs are cheap   but the vast majority of pc problems are not in fact hardware problems they are just ms windows being ms windows

there 's absolutely nothing wrong with unskilled labor   but walmart is such a large part of the us economy that an increase in their wage base would definitely have an impact on inflation so that any broad based increase they gave would likely have a marginal impact on quality of life   it would also make their items more expensive two times over one because it would cause inflation that other employers have been raising wages to keep pace with and the more direct route of increased costs     whatever you pay unskilled labor the market will simply raise prices to a level where unskilled labor still have a tough time affording a comfortable lifestyle   look at australia as an example of what happens when you raise the minimum wage too high

by that logic saying all weed smokers would disagree is almost like saying all non weed smokers are closed minded i suppose that is your freedom but you come across as really ignorant emotional and irrational in your communication after we talked for a bit i feel your not as crazy as your impulsive comments are but your perspective could be expanded upon i personally feel the risks of people choosing to be ignorant is far more dangerous to our society and our freedom than people smoking weed ultimately which freedom will you choose sure lazy people use weed as their excuse so what about successful people who use weed what s their excuse for success same thing it is for everyone valuable idea combined with effort to make it happen i get the sense you really do nt like weed which is your freedom of choice but comparing it to all other drugs is flat out ignorance i ve lost handful of family members to opiates and alcohol so i personally know how harmful some substances can be i found it interesting being able to talk about this topic so thanks for opening up if you have any questions please feel free to ask

i am a realtor for our rental business we use a service that offers a background check it costs us about $ 25 and it is passed along in the form of an application fee   i suggest you contact a local real estate agent who you know does rentals have a conversation about what you are doing and see if they will help process the application for you for a fee of course if you are truly concerned about your safety the text you wrote can either read as true concern or sarcasm maybe we are really in a wild country it 's worth even a couple hundred bucks to screen out a potential bad roommate

we generally speak of the elasticity of demand cards are expensive because they can be we buy them in a weakened state and we do not buy them by the tonne there is also the concept of market segmentation but not so much essentially the price is determined by finding the point of pain and winding it back a little so people will pay $ 5 for a card   they will not generally pay $ 5,000 unless there is a good reason vanity why sell them for $ 2 the customers who at $ 5 tend not to even have $ 2 market segmentation again   in short the price is always going to need to be set before the point where demand rolls off sharply to maximise profit

as far as the banker himself goes it 's a customer service issue   wf is not going to tell you about their internal discipline or ought n't anyway other than potentially to confirm that the banker does or does not still work there that 's the closest they should get to telling you about it   i 'm a very former retail manager and that 's absolutely the most i 'd ever do in a case like this and trust me even with good customer service reps you get requests to fire someone a lot sometimes valid sometimes not you did the correct thing from your end you brought the issue to their attention   despite the quota it 's hopefully not permitted to sign people up without their permission since that 's illegal and i can say that in my retail experience with these promotions with great incentive to cheat in this manner one of the main things our loss prevention department did was to monitor data to see if people were signing people up for cards or otherwise cheating the system   that could be a very bad thing from a customer service point of view and from a legal point of view what you should have done or possibly did but it 's not clear in your post is after you reported the issue asked for a re contact on a particular date in the future not after you 've looked into it but next friday i would like to get a call from you to discuss the resolution   again they 're not going to tell you the discipline but they should tell you at least that they 've investigated it and will make sure it does n't happen again or similar   it 's possible they will want more information from you at this point and this is a useful way to make sure that request does n't fall off of their plate   they should be able to at least tell you if there was a perceived issue on their end it might be something meaningless to you like he thought you said to sign up or something more descriptive like he pushed the button to send you a notice but our computer system screwed that up and made it an application   you never know these days how easy it is to screw these things up now they certainly should have fixed the issues on your end   hopefully they did whatever you needed them to do banking wise or else you withdrew your money and went somewhere else   if not follow up with that supervisor 's supervisor or go up a level or two to a regional director or equivalent   they may not be able to cancel the card for you but the other banking related things they certainly should fix   the card you probably just have to cancel and be done with as far as the misuse of personal information one thing i 'd consider doing is placing a freeze on your credit report   then this could never have happened you would have to lift it to have your report pulled to be given the card   this is not free though so consider this before doing this

make sure you are paid on volume not people   almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others   that 's not bad it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs   that 's what the commissions are for   the largest cost of distributing a product outside of mlm is advertising and marketing   if i remember correctly this adds up to about 66 of the cost of the product   if that 's true an mlm has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive but when all is said and done you should be paid on volume just like a sales manager position in a company   a sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff but once they are out producing the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff   if an mlm is setup the same way then this is good   if they are setup to pay on recruiting people then run away as quickly as you can the biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it   it 's whether or not the people you recruit can do it i have been involved with an mlm of sorts for 10 years   it pays a nice continual flow of income   i worked it hard for about 6 years and have ever since   the problem was attrition   it was greater than i ever imagined   it became very   i never have and never will be a high pressure person   i would show them the business and if they were interested great if not great   the problem was that people became interested but did n't have the skills to be successful   i should never have let them join the business   so they leave the business and say that mlm is bad   no it just was n't right for them or they were n't right for it regardless of what business you join make sure that you believe that everyone you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing   if they do great otherwise do n't even show it to them

yes it is common for investors to make equity investments in technology companies pre ipo   there are technology like y that exist to make angel investments which are early stage equity investments in private technology companies these investments are sometimes in notes that are convertible to equity but are very similar to a stock investment   wealthy individuals can also make angel investments e.g. peter thiel made a $ 500 k investment in facebook in 2004 for of the company   additionally venture capital firms exist to make equity investments in private companies   in the us you need to be an accredited investor to make private equity investments income greater than $ 200 k or net worth greater than $ 1 million but you probably need a lot more money than the minimum and connections to get in on these deals in reality

the american express card the black card is for extremely wealthy people who like to show off how much they spend there are no cash back benefits like you have with traditional rewards cards the benefits are all geared toward spending more money not saving money    for example the benefits include a personal travel agent personal shoppers at high end stores elite status with airlines and hotels etc   there are some benefits that you could put a dollar value on for example first class upgrades and complementary companion airline tickets if you like to fly first class and you do a lot of flying it is conceivable that you could come out ahead   however someone that does that much flying has probably already achieved elite frequent flyer status and enjoys regular upgrades without the black card in my opinion it is pretty difficult to justify the initiation and annual fees of this card as anything but a luxury

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

if they had told me that i owe them $ 10,000 from 3 years ago i    would n't have anything to fight back why first thing you have to do is ask for a proof have you received treatment have you signed the bill when you were done this should include all the information about what you got and how much you agreed to pay do they have that to show to you with your signature on it if they do n't you owe nothing if they do you can match your bank credit card insurance records those are kept for 7 years at least and see what has been paid already can a doctor 's office do that they can do whatever they want the right question is whether a doctor 's office is allowed to do that check your local laws states regulate the medical profession is there a statute of limitation i 'm just guessing that forces them    to notify me in a certain time frame statute of limitations limits their ability to sue you successfully they can always sue you but if the statute of limitations has passed the court will throw the suite away provided you bring this defense up on time of course without a judgement they can not force you to pay them they can only ask nicely as the law quoted by mrchrister mandates they can trash your credit report and send the bill to collections though but if the statute of limitations has passed i doubt they 'd do that especially if its their fault i 'm not a lawyer and you should consult with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction for definitive answers and legal advice

parenting towards was the main theme discussed during a conference held recently organised by agenzija sedqa in collaboration with the office of the children ’s commissioner ms. sina bugeja chief executive officer foundation for social welfare services during her opening address explained that parenting towards resilience was the main theme chosen by the foundation to celebrate this year ’s children ’s day moreover ms. bugeja mentioned the recent launch of the national children ’s policy that safeguards children ’s rights and ensures space for their opinions before decisions are taken she mentioned that parents need to be kept with changing parenting styles as well as with different influences which might affect children ’s development ms commissioner for children said that the inherent vulnerability of children requires not only a strong legal and institutional framework of protection but also the consolidated ability on the part primarily of parents to nurture their children in such a way as to in them the inner strength and will to overcome the challenges that come their way during their childhood this is important she said as there is a limit to how far the legal and institutional framework can go to actually protect children in the context of an increasingly complex and challenging social and cultural environment and also because the development of such inner strength and will is an integral part of children ’s gradual maturity into strong independent and responsible adults the development of this inner strength or resilience should be seen as a main goal of the child ’s upbringing ms thus urged all parents to continue helping their children develop these inner qualities during his closing address mr. operations director agenzija sedqa said that since its inception sedqa has always been at the forefront of imparting skills to parents to improve their communication with their children although the agency is best known for its work with persons experiencing drug alcohol or gambling related problems it nevertheless invests a lot of resources in prevention the main presentation of this conference was entitled l l delivered ms. sammut registered counselling psychologist and family therapist she is also a full time member of staff within the department of psychology at the university of malta her presentation focused on a clear description of what is resilience in children highlighting the kind of parenting that makes a difference in enhancing resilience in children she stressed the importance of a warm parent child relationship that is to the child ’s needs according to his or her unique development this relationship greatly affects influences every aspect of children ’s learning and development especially the growth of their inner security self worth and ability to build relationships with others ms. sammut also spoke about how harmony in the family consistent guidance especially in and adequate role models also help to promote resilience in children she also cited from her research on families with domestic violence highlighting the resilience and challenges of these family members this conference was attended by parents and various professionals in touch with children of all ages the workshops delivered were families of children with disability by ann and education amp parenting by role models by building resilience in children by the mindful parent parenting against substance use risk by anthony building attachment by parenting towards resilience with the media by john playful parents playful children playful therapists by amp daniel looking after children in foster care by john and power struggle between parents and young people by sammut r parenting

no you capitalize all that and deduct as depreciation from the royalties what it means is that you can not deduct the expense when it is incurred but only when you started receiving income that the expense was used to derive this is similar to capitalizing building improvements which can only be deducted when you start getting rent or capitalizing software development expenses which can only be deducted once you start selling licensing the developed software in the case of book writing you capitalize the expenses and deduct them once you start receiving royalties the period over which you deduct the depreciation schedule depends on the type of the expense and the type of the income so you better get a guidance from a licensed tax accountant ea or cpa licensed in your state

what do you see as the advantage of doing this when you buy a house with a mortgage the bank gets a lien on the house you are buying i.e. the house you are buying is the collateral why would you need additional or different collateral as to using the house for your down payment that would require giving the house to the seller or selling the house and giving the money to the seller if the house was 100 yours and you do n't have any use for it once you buy the second house that would be a sensible plan indeed that 's what most people do when they buy a new house sell the old one and use the money as down payment on the new one but in this case what would happen to the co owner are they going to move to the new house with you the only viable scenario i see here is that you could get a home equity loan on the first house and then use that money as the down payment on the second house and thus perhaps avoid having to pay for mortgage insurance as says the bank would probably require the signature of the co owner in such a case if you defaulted on the loan the bank could then seize the house sell it and give the co owner some share of the money i sincerely doubt the bank would be interested in an arrangement where if you default they get half interest in the house but are not allowed to sell it without the co owner 's consent what would a bank do with half a house maybe possibly they could rent it out but most banks are not in the rental business so if you defaulted the co owner would get kicked out of the house i do n't know who this co owner is sounds like you 'd be putting them in a very awkward position

i ca n't find the underlying legislation but a few online resources suggest that if you contact a lender about a payment plan they should put repayments on hold temporarily we do n’t think it ’s fair if your lender does n’t help you    get on top of things if you ask for help or breathing space to sort    things out if you 've had problems repaying the loan you can complain if your payday lender did not offer to freeze interest and charges if you are able to make payments under a reasonable repayment plan by law they must suspend recovery of the debt for a reasonable period if you ’re developing a repayment plan with a debt adviser or on your own i 'd start by making an immediate complaint to the lender make them aware that you 're unable to meet basic living expenses because of the money they took and ask for them to suspend collection temporarily and for the money to be returned i would also dispute the charge with your bank on the grounds that it should not have been taken given the circumstances and ask for them to credit your account while they investigate the dispute they may not be too keen given it 'll leave you overdrawn if they later reject the dispute but it 's worth asking in parallel with that contact citizens advice and/or the financial ombudsman details in the links and see if there 's anything they can do or suggest

there are a lot of funds that exist only to feed people 's belief that existing funds are not diversified or specialized enough   that 's why you have so many options just choose the ones with the lowest fees i 'd suggest the following i would n't mess around with funds that try and specialize in value or those target date funds if you really do n't want to think and do n't mind paying slightly higher fees just pick the target date fund that corresponds to when you will retire and put all your money there on the traditional roth question if your tax bracket will be higher when you retire than it is now unlikely choose roth   otherwise choose traditional

other individuals answered how owning an reit compares to an individual real estate investment but did not answer your second question as readily are reits a good option to generate passive income for awhile the awhile part is quite important in answering this question if your intentions are to invest for a relatively short time period say 7 years or less it may be especially advantageous to invest in a reit the foremost advantage comes from significantly lower transaction fees stock etf trades are practically potentially free today compared to purchasing real estate which involves fees taxes broker fees which in a round trip transaction purchase and sale would come to ~10 the secondary advantage to owning a reit is they are much more liquid than a property if you wanted to sell your investment at a given point in time you can easily log into your brokerage and execute your transaction while liquidating an investment property will take time on market potentially tossing tenants fixing up place etc on the other hand illiquid investments have generally yielded higher historical returns according to past research

imagine the bank loaning 100 of the sum of money you needed to buy a house if the valuation of the house decreases to 90 of the original price after 3 months would it be unfair for them to ask them for 10 of the original price from you immediately i suppose the rationale for loaning 80 is so that you will fork our 20 first and so your property is protected from fluctuations in the market that they do not need to collect additional money from you as your housing valuation rarely drops below 80 of the original price banks do need to make money too as they run as a business

sorry but i think you really do need an attorney here this is the kind of where knowing all the precedents and edge cases can make a huge difference in what you can or ca n't do and a misplaced can make or break your case note that at best you could sell your own interest in the house owning the note does not mean owning the property it only means that they issued the note on the strength of your share of the property and a half interest in a single family house has little value outside the family except to sell it to whoever owns the other half which is probably the best answer sell your half to your aunt if she can afford to buy it she then gets sole control of the house and you get the money you seem to need right now and everyone in the family is much less stressed

unfortunately economics and accounting for that matter wo n't help much with being an entrepreneur   the main thing you need to focus on is cash generation you need to maximise this there are 2 aspects revenue and costs   you need to plot these over the last 5 10 years to see trends   what is happening to revenues are they growing with inflation   if not why not   is it because people are buying online   is it because the products are not fashionable is it because people simply buy less jewelry these days   have the cost of the products gone up but the shop has n't increased prices i.e. gross margin contraction   decreasing gross margin could also be an indicator that someone is stealing from the business    what about the overhead costs of running the business   what has happened to rent salaries insurance   look for any unusual trends     in summary first you need to identify where the problem is and to do this you need to look at the trends of revenues and costs break costs down into categories

yes this extra income would be taxed at your marginal rate because it is increasing your total income this does not necessarily apply to all income however capital gains are taxed at a different rate depending on the amount of extra work you may wish to consider setting up a corporation corporations are taxed entirely differently this would also give you the opportunity to write off far more of your expenses but be aware of double taxation investopedia has a good article on double taxation the issue is that the corporation must pay taxes on the revenue and then when you take out the money either as salary or dividends you personally will pay tax it may leave you better off even with the double taxation dividends are taxed at a lower rate than your marginal tax rate generally and you can write off much more inside a corporation if considering this talk to an accountant and discuss your expected revenue from consulting the accountant should be able to quantify the costs and benefits

i have also tried mvelopes in the past and my experiences match yours i currently use the desktop version of ynab you need a budget ynab 4 and i like it much better   where we failed after a while with mvelopes we are succeeding with ynab and have been now for the last 3.5 years i do n't want this to sound like a commercial for ynab i will give important caveats about ynab later but here is why i believe we have done better now with ynab than before with mvelopes   i hope that these reasons will be useful to you when you are evaluating your next options as you said we also found mvelopes interface to be slow and   ynab 4 is a desktop app with capabilities that we found to be much quicker and easier to work with than mvelopes flash based interface   that was 4 years ago hopefully mvelopes has their interface since then    we also struggled with mvelopes connection with our banks   with ynab 4 there is no connection to the bank everything has to be entered manually   i initially thought this might be worse but for us it has been better   i can either enter transactions as they happen on the mobile app or i can hold on to receipts and enter them every day or two in the evening categorizing as i go   we always have an up to date picture of our finances and we do n't have to mess with trying to match up downloaded transactions that have been screwed up or are missing we are n't really using ynab much differently than we were using mvelopes but we have learned a few tricks that i think have contributed to our success   one of the things we do differently is that i do n't obsess about the cash accounts too much   cash accounts for us are the hardest to keep track of because most of our cash transactions do n't have a receipt we are paying a friend or family member for something or leaving a tip or something like that which we forget about when it comes time to enter into the software   as a result the cash account balances get off   i periodically enter a correcting transaction to get the balances right and have a budget category specifically for this that we have to put money in for these unknown transactions   fortunately for us our cash spending is a small percent of our total spending we usually pay with a credit card so this bit of spending is n't that big of a concern with ynab the current month 's budget is right in front of you as soon as you open up the app which makes it easy to adjust your budget during the month if necessary   with mvelopes at least how their app worked 4 years ago the budget was somewhat hidden after you funded your budget categories and it was a bit of a pain to move money around between categories   the ability to adjust your budget in the middle of the month is crucial if you do n't do that you 'll get frustrated the first time you find that you do n't have enough money in a category for something you need   ynab makes it very easy to move money around inside your budget that having been said you need to be aware that the current version of ynab is not a desktop application but a web based app   ynab 4 the old desktop version which we have been using is officially unsupported as of the end of 2016   however i see that it is still available for sale if you are interested in it the ynab4 help site is still up and the mobile app you would need to work with it on your phone called ynab classic is still in the app store    as i said the current ynab is now a web app complete with automatic downloading of transactions from your bank   i have no experience with it other than playing around with it a little and so i ca n't tell you how quick the interface is or how well the auto downloading of transactions works as an alternative another web based solution is everydollar from dave ramsey 's company   i have never tried it   the advantage of this one is that it is free if you choose not to link it to your banks the automatic downloading of transactions is a paid feature i wrote an answer a couple of years ago in which i describe two different approaches that budgeting software packages tend to take   i 'm not familiar with buxfer so i do n't know which approach it takes but perhaps that answer will help you evaluate all of your software options on the behavior side of things besides the relaxing of the cash accounting i mentioned above we also involve my wife a little less in the budgeting process than we used to   this is by her choice   i am the one who enters all the transactions into the software she hands me all her receipts i reconcile the accounts at the end of the month and i set the budget for the next month   we have been doing this long enough now that she knows what the budget is and we only need to discuss it if we want to do something different with the budget than we have been doing in the past   she has the ynab app on her phone and can see where we are at with all of our budget categories

overall since gold has value in any currency and is sort of the ultimate reserve currency why would anyone want to currency hedge it because gold is mostly priced in usd you currency hedge it to avoid currency risk and be exposed to only the price risk of gold in usd   hedging it does n't mean less speculative it just means you wo n't take currency risk edit responding to op 's questions in comment what happens if the usd drops in value versus other major currencies do you think that the gold price in usd would not be affected by this drop in dollar value use the etf $ gld as a proxy of gold price in usd the correlation between weekly returns of $ gld and us dollar index measured by major world currencies since the etf 's inception is around what this says is that gold may or may not be affected by usd movement it 's certainly not a one way movement there are times where both usd and gold rise and fall simultaneously is n't a drop in dollar value fundamentally currency risk per investopedia currency risk arises from the change in price of one currency in relation to another in this context it 's referring to the eur usd movement the bottom line is that if gold price in dollar goes up 2 this etf gives the european investor a way to bring home that 2 or as close to that as possible

yes a minor can have a checking account or a savings account they can even get a debit card the money in that bank account belongs to the minor the account can be established as soon as the are assigned their social security number if they are a newborn the account is generally set up as a joint account with a parent to facilitate transferring money into the account for us the money was birthday gifts from relatives   the irs allows minors to receive small amounts of interest or other unearned income tax free in 2015 that is up to $ if they have no earned income when bank rates were higher some parent 's wanted to put all their saving under their child 's name of course in the eyes of the law the money belonged to the child and was only to be spent for items that benefited the child credit cards are another matter because the card act in 2009 required lenders to only give credit to those under 21 who had proof of sufficient income unless there was a co signer you do have to be careful when talking about owning a house as minor they generally ca n't sign a contract you could gift the house to the minor but if it was time to sell it the courts would insist on appointing a legal guardian to represent the interest of the child that could add significant time to the transaction

if this is because he wants to avoid paying taxes will i get in trouble if i agree to have him work on my vehicle you should check your state and local sales tax laws to be certain but in my state you have no liability if he does not pay his taxes   that 's his problem not yours   the biggest risk for you is if something goes wrong you have no proof that the work was ever done so it 's possible he could deny that any transaction ever took place and refuse to correct it or refund your money   so at worst you 're out what you paid for the service plus what it would cost you to fix it if you needed to and chose to do so   if you do n't want to take that risk then insist on a receipt or take you   business elsewhere but there 's no criminal liability for you if he chooses not to report the income edit be aware though that state tax is levied at the state and local level so the laws of your individual state or city may be different

note i have no experience of attempting what is described below neither am i a lawyer nor an accountant the process may range from a small bureaucratic hurdle to a complex legal nightmare if it seems a plausible approach you would probably be well advised to reach out to others that have established for help and guidance according to this hmrc page the two ways a body can claim gift aid is if either it is a recognised charity or if it is a community amateur sports club casc so one option may be to try and establish a casc i suspect that this is unlikely to be an easy process but may be a more likely approach than trying to get the council to establish a charity the register as a community amateur sports club casc page on the hmrc site very briefly describes the steps as you can see from their eligibility criteria to register as a casc you would first have to create a sports club of some form that has a formal constitution is open to the whole community and has affordable membership fees is on an amateur basis provides facilities in the uk is managed by fit and proper persons you would probably need the co operation of the local council to allow the proposed sports club the use of the local park one of the several requirements of becoming a casc is that it must so it could in theory be possible to spend money raised through both membership fees and gift aid qualifying donations on the improving the facilities of the park tennis courts bowling green etc however note that how to register page mentions among many other requirements the need to provide accounts from the last 12 months and bank statements from the last 3 months it does n't as far as i can see explicitly state that the club must have been in existence for 12 months before applying for casc status it might be possible to send only what you have but be aware that you may need to establish the club and let it operate under its own steam for a period before applying

not necessarily you can issue credit cards without a bank involved although companies which do so may have additional legal complications such as usury regulations as an example amex is a network which also issues cards themselves the company is not a bank they sold their banking subsidiary in 2007 it 's also possible to get a bank issued credit card without banking with that same company

tldr   yes you can that is quite a steep price to pay for a trade   i 've used tradeking previously which would charge you $ 5 for that same trade   some other brokers are more or less expensive and it is normally representative of the service one receives   one option would be scottrade   while they are much more expensive than tradeking they offer a much higher level of service   even at $ 17 a trade you 'll save a lot of money over the edward jones trade a big question here is who does your investing now   most people are pretty horrible at managing their own investments   some professional advice is probably in order   for most they discover this when their investments are small mitigating any mistakes made   you do n't have that luxury   i would highly recommend making sure you have people that can help you make good decisions the more i think about it the more i like the move to scottrade no affiliation or one like that charles schwab is another option   with scottrade you can go into a local branch and talk things over   i think they offer some professional management as well   schwab will offer the latter but not the former   however you can call them up and talk on the phone   another option is to go with fidelity and have them manage at least part of your money   of course you can always just do a professional independent money manager another option is to renegotiate with edward jones   something like   sorry but this is ridiculous you need to do much better or i am moving all my money   its much cheaper to charge you $ 100 for that same trade than lose the whole account

asset = equity + income expense + liability everything could be cancelled out in double entry accounting   by your logic if the owner contributes capital as asset equity is very similar to asset   you will end up cancelling everything i.e. 0 = 0   you do not understate liability by cancelling them with asset   say you have $ 10000 debtors and $ 10000 creditors you do not say net debtors = $ 0 on the balance sheet   you are challenging the fundamental concepts of accounting   certain accounts are contra accounts for example accumulated depreciation is contra asset retained loss and unrealized revaluation loss is contra equity

you need to talk to your bank   if you 're unable to contact your bank until monday then wait until monday   do n't on the idea that the transaction may hard post on monday   if it happens it happens but it 's not the end of the world even if the transaction posts it 's not the end of the world   if the retailer is legit they will refund your money although it may take some time for things to get sorted out even if the transaction posts and the retailer is not legit it 's still not the end of the world   your bank may help you in trying to recover the funds   that 's why you need to talk to your bank as you have realized blindly calling the number in the email is not a good idea because if it 's fake you 're calling the scammers   instead what you should do is try to contact your bank through known trusted channels   that is look on your bank 's website   do they have a phone number listed for fraud reporting or related inquiries   is it the same number you see in the email   if so you can call it   if it is not the same number but the number on your bank 's website is a number you can call them at that number and tell them the situation based on what you 've described my own guess would be that the retailer is legit but that the unusual large transaction was flagged by your bank as potentially fraudulent which is why you got the email   the fact that you happened to get the email just after canceling the order could be a coincidence   this is especially true if all this happened in a short time   information about these transactions ca n't be transmitted and analyzed instantaneously nor can emails be sent instantaneously there may have been a delay in sending the email so it only arrived after the cancellation as far as your worries about how got your info it is likely a fraud detection service used by your bank   doing a bit of googling reveals that it appears to be a legit service but there have also been instances of phishing attacks using faked emails   however from what i see these worked by trying to get you to click on a link not call a phone number   also if a scammer is able to send you a scam email that includes your actual order details that 's not a it 's an outright hack   in that case the bank and/or retailer whichever was hacked would certainly want to know about it and would likely fall all over themselves trying to refund your money to avoid negative pr

i would go with the family route if i was you and i think many other people would if they were fortunate to have such a great option   this will allow you to move faster when your trying to buy a new house because you can easily get a mortage if you see a stellar deal also you can establish credit in much cheaper ways than paying the 4 or so on a mortgage finance a car that you have the money to buy because the interest rates are much lower and you build the credit while paying less interest or even better try and make most of your purchases on a 0 fee credit card and every 6 8 months get a new credit card to have multiple lines of ongoing credit   to use the mortage to establish credit is nt worth the 4 hit in wealth that it offers now mind you if your options were to buy the house with your own money outright or get a mortgage i would say get the mortgage because the added leverage would help your investments beat the market most years figure if you get 6 an average portfolio each year and you can write off the taxes on your mortgage you will be ahead by more than 2

it seems like you are asking two different questions one is how do i know if i can afford a house the other is how do i know what type of mortage to get the first question is fairly simple to answer there 's plenty of calculators out there that will tell you what you can afford but rule of thumb is 30 of income can goto housing now what type of mortgage to get can be much more confusing because the mortgage industry makes money off of these confusing products the best thing to do in my in situations like this is to keep it simple you need to be careful buying a house so much money is changing hands and there are so many parasites involved in the transaction i would be extremely wary of anybody who is going to tell you what mortgage to get i 've never heard of a fee only independent mortgage broker and if i found one that claimed to be i would n't believe him i would just ignore all the exotic non conforming products and just answer one simple question are you the type of person that buys an insurance policy or that likes to self insure if you like insurance get a 30 year fixed mortgage if you like to self insure get a 7 year arm the average someone owns a house is 7 years plus in 7 years time it might not adjust up and even if it does you can just accelerate your payments and pay it off quickly this is the self insurance part of it if you 're like me i 'm willing to pay an extra .5 for the 30 year so that my payment never changes and i 'm never forced to move which is extremely unlikely but i like the safety i do n't like 15 year term loans because rates are so low you can get way better returns in the stock market right now so why pay off sooner then you need to heck if i had a paid off house right now i 'd refi into a 30 year and invest the money in summary pick 30 year or arm then just shop around to find the lowest rate which is extremely easy

if you own 100 of the shares of a company then you own those shares personally   they are not owned by the company   if you sell 50 of you shares to a third party then you receive the proceeds of the sale not the company   in this case the company 's net equity is unchanged but you have exchanged 50 of your equity for cash if you wish the company to receive the proceeds of the sale of shares then you would have the company issue new shares in the company   in this case your company 's net equity would increase by the cash amount received and your personal equity would change accordingly edit in order to fairly sell 50 of equity by issuing new shares it would be necessary for the new investor to invest 50k.   this is because the new equity would be the original 50 k of equity plus the cash received for new shares   thus cost of 50 of equity = 50 of 50 k + cash recieved = cash received solving for cash received gives 50 k so that is the correct amount to charge the new investor

in my mind its not the same    if growth is stock value then this is incorrect because of compound interest in stock price $ 100 stock price after one year would be $ 105 and a dividend would be $ 2 next year the stock would be   $ compound interest and would the dividend really go up in lock step with the stock price well probably not but if it did then maybe you could call it the same even if the dollars are the same the growth rate is more variable than the dividends so its valuable to segregate the two i am open to criticism my answer is based on my personal experience and would love to hear contrary positions on this

assuming that blocks dark liquidity and auctions are n't available one of the biggest things that equity traders also have going for them is the availability of different execution venues as well as the aforementioned ability to strategically time execution child order placement based on the state of the order book at any given time   a security with a nyse primary listing bac or ibm for example will be traded on several exchanges ecns nasdaq nyse arca the various bats exchanges and that in itself opens up a lot of opportunity to spread out an order   as an alternative to simply going through several price levels on a single exchange you can also route out multiple orders simultaneously to different exchanges to scoop up liquidity   all of that being said i think it should be noted that you really ca n't exclude the execution methods that you mentioned in your original question   any large institutional investor looking to trade in size will only get so far with trading on lit venues especially in the us equity marketplace   taking advantage of block liquidity or floating part or all of an order in a dark pool is a good way to mask intentions and minimize market impact   if you 're part of a beta index tracking strategy you actually need to leverage auctions index rebalances like the msci russell s&amp;p all have a ton of participants executing market on close orders to account for adds     overall the buy side is becoming increasingly sophisticated when it comes to advanced execution and it has been interesting to see how fintech companies brokers and exchanges have been feeding into the innovation

i do n't think there 's a rule i ca n't comment but brick cited irs rules but imo brick missed one thing is not looking for a distribution but is looking for a rollover my best guess   that this part of the is not well defined and your and my employer have chosen to interpret any withdrawl as a distribution even if better characterized a rollover a few months ago i went so far as to explore if i could use a loophole my company had just gone through a merger i was hoping i could rollover some or maybe all of my 401k to my ira i remember now it would have been everything before starting roth 401k contributions   my company asserted this was not permitted and further asserted that the rumors i had heard were mistaken that when we went through a company spin off a few years before that nobody under 59 1/2 was permitted to roll over i did a quick search and found irs topic   as far as i can tell this topic is silent on the matter at hand topic referred me to irs publication 575 where i started looking at the section on rollovers   i read some of it then got bored note that we 're one step removed we are reading irs publications and interpretations of irs rules   i do n't know that anybody here has read the actual tax law   there may be something in there that prevents companies from rolling over before 59 1/2 that is not well codified in irs publications

you actually do n't have to open a business account with your bank you can have a personal account with the bank and have your business funds go into it whether it be from cheques or from card facilities you just have to get your customers to make the cheque out under your name the same name used for your bank account if you are trading as a sole trader and you trade under a name other than your own name then officially you are supposed to register that name with fair trading in your state however if you are trading using another name and it is not registered fair trading will only become aware of it if someone usually one of your customers makes a compliant about you and they will then ask you to either stop using that name as your trading name or have it registered if not already registered by someone else

you 've described the process fairly well   it 's tough to answer a question that ultimately is how is this fair it 's fair in that it 's part of the known risk and for the fact that it applies to all pretty equally in general this is not very common no i do n't have percents handy i 'm just suggesting from decades of trading it 's probably occurring less than 10 of the time why because there 's usually more value to the buyer in simply selling the option and using the proceeds to buy the stock the option will have 2 components   its intrinsic value in the money and the time premium it takes the odd combination of low to no time premium but desire of the buyer to own the stock that makes the exercise desirable

what you 're thinking of is more market making kind of activity hft algo 's thrive on this having information faster than anyone else this type of activity could also likely be lumped into what is considered top down analysis as opposed to bottom up which is what most mutual fund equity research involves again the more important aspect is what does the company you are applying to use   top down analysis means that you are forecasting the revenue drivers for a company using macro economic analysis for example let 's say i 'm investing in chinese cement manufacturer 's what implications does chinese interest rate policy have on infra structure expansion and how does that drive revenue for this specific company i might then look at margins etc to get an eps estimate part of this could fall into secular   investing too let 's say i like lcd panel glass because of this consortium i might take a look at 5 companies and then find the ones i think would benefit most from this the problem with top down is it tends not to be as much of a deep dive and its hard to pick individual companies because of it bottom up tends to be more analytical and is what most pitches would be based around the most important thing i 'm not saying one is right or wrong they are just different and every investor has their own style   bottom up analysis which would be closer to what an equity research analyst would be doing on the sell side is analyzing what bottom line indicators drive revenue and how are those expanding for example lets say i 'm looking at search providers i.e. google yahoo etc i 'd be looking at cost per thousand clicks and number of clicks on the website multiply the two and i get revenue very simplified version for clicks business i might then also forecast other revenue driving segments and try to understand how they are growing pricing at an individual segment level i.e. business services or mobile advertising i 'd then break down costs margins for each segment and forecast those out i could then get a forward eps get a range of multiples i believe it could trade in i.e. i think the multiple will trade up down to get a target price also i would likely do a dcf analysis on forward earnings to get a fair market value and then try to a price i would also be looking at stuff like management teams and industry trends too but bottom line i 'm pitching a company because i think it is undervalued and will outperform competitors in the long this type of work tends to be more research oriented and is what most not all mutual funds use when analyzing companies since mutual funds tend to have longer holding periods 2 10 years as opposed to short term it 's harder to justify investing in a company only because it has a short term catalyst anecdotally it 's also easier to present in a written thesis because the numbers tend to be more concrete and easier to forecast than top down which have wider target ranges   your thought process that catalyst + industry context = market beating returns is n't wrong it 's just that every company thinks about investing differently and it 's important to tailor the report to that group 's style

the stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock 's current profitability and prospects but is also based on prediction of how the stock 's prospects might change in the future in almost every case there are professional investors analysing the stock 's future prospects and considering whether it 's over or under values for its current price however even professionals can be totally wrong   if you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time then you might be if you 're right equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not if you do n't think you have a good understanding about the stock then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding otherwise you are simply taking a if you know of another stock that has better prospects then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse   but also bear in mind that in my understanding research has shown that on average people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection and more stock trades means more brokerage which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market

it is difficult to find investment banks that offer both low fees and low minimum investments if you google around for no fee low minimum mutual funds you can find various articles with recommendations such as this one   one fund they mention that looks promising is the schwab total stock market index fund which apparently has a minimum investment of only $ 100 and an expense ratio of 0.09   i 've never heard of this fund before so i 'm just repeating the info from the site   be sure to look into it more thoroughly to see if there are any hidden costs here   i 'm not recommending this fund just mentioning it as an example of what you may be able to find another possibility is to make use of funds in an existing brokerage account that you use for yourself   this could allow you to make use of craig w.

because an equity option can be constructed at essentially any price by two willing counterparties on an exchange there are not enough to represent the entire i.e. infinite option chain for even a single stock on a single expiration date   as a result are not generated for each individual possible options contract   instead the isin is used only to refer to the underlying symbol and a separate formula is used to refer to the specific option contract for that symbol so that code you pasted is not an isin but rather the standard us equity option naming scheme that you need to provide in addition to the isin when talking to your broker note that and formulas for referring to option contracts in other countries can behave quite differently   also there are many countries and markets that do n't need because the products in question only exist on a single exchange   in those cases the exchange is pretty much free to make up whatever id scheme it wants p.s. now i 'm curious how option chains are identified for strike prices above $   i looked up the only stock i can think of that trades above that price brk.a but it does n't seem to have an option chain or at least google does n't show it

who can make money if i keep talking about another word for profit    14 we ’ll go back and our = we ’ll go back and offer you the same for 20 less in hopes you ’ll buy it before the end of the quarter    15   it ’s like the book crossing the to great tipping point outliers = i ’ve never read any of these books but i sound literate if i quote from them and besides you probably never read them either to call me out on it    16 let ’s right size it = let ’s whack fire a bunch of people    17 it ’s next gen turn key plug and play = i want it to sound so technical that you ’ll just buy it without asking me any questions    18 we need to manage the optics of this = how can we lie about this in a way people will believe    19 this is creative destruction = i ’ve never read joseph but our core business is getting killed so it ’s your responsibility to come up with a new product the market will buy    20 we do n’t have enough boots on the ground = i do n’t want to be fired for this disastrous product country launch so i ’m going to sound tough referring to the military and say i do n’t have enough resources    21 deal with it = tough cookies    22 by way of housekeeping = this

to be me    28 we ’re eating our own dog food = it sounds gross but we seem like honest folks if we do this    29 we need to monetize analyze incentivize = when in doubt stick on the end of a word and say we ’ve got to do this and 9 out of 10 times it will sound action oriented    30 we did a five forces analysis value chain analysis = we did n’t really do any of that but none of you probably even remember michael porter so what the heck    31 it was a perfect storm = we really screwed up but we ’re going to blame a bunch of factors that are out of our hands especially weather    32 at the end of the day = ok enough talking back and forth we ’re going to do what i want to do    33 who ’s got the i.e. responsibility to do what we just spent 20 minutes talking about = if i ask the question it wo n’t be assigned to me    34 let ’s put on this pig = plug your nose    35 i ’m putting a stake in the ground here = i ’m a leader simply because i ’m using this cliche    36 we ’re customer focused proactive results oriented = that ca n’t be bad right   this is and apple pie stuff    37 our visibility into the quarter is a little fuzzy = sales just fell off a cliff    38 that ’s not our core competency sticking to our = we ’re just glad we ’re making money in one business because we ’d have no clue how to get into any other business    39 well we ’re facing some headwinds there = you put your finger on the area we ’re panicking over    40 it ’s a one off = do whatever they want to close the sale    41 it = that ’s not a verb but i just made it into one because i ’m a man woman of action    42 i ’m an agent of change = this makes it sound like i know how to handle the chaos that our business is constantly going through    43 we ’ve got to do a little more due diligence there = do n’t have a clue but does that legal term make me sound detail oriented    44 do n’t leave money on the table = be as greedy with them as possible    45 we take a ready fire aim approach here = we totally operate on a seat of the pants basis    46 hope is not a strategy = i do n’t have a strategy but this makes it sound like i ’m above people who also do n’t have a strategy    47 we have to tear down the silos internally = our organizational structure is such a mess that i ’m going to be under mined by other departments at every turn    48 i do n’t think it will move the needle = this wo n’t get my boss excited    49 good to put a face to the name = i ’d really rather talk to that person behind you    50 let ’s take the 30,000 foot view = i like to think i see the big picture   51 it ’s the old 80 20 rule = i really have no idea what the rule was but i just want to focus on the things that will make us successful    52 we need to manage expectations = get ready to start sucking up to people    53 it ’s not actionable enough what ’s the deliverable = you guys do the work on refining the idea i ’m too tired    54 my 2 cents is = this opinion is worth a heck of a lot more than 2 cents    55 i ’m going to sound like a broken record here = i want to clearly point out to you idiots that i ’ve made this point several times before    56 we ’ve got too many chiefs and not enough indians = i want to be the chief    57 going forward = do n’t screw up like this again    58 my people know i ’ve got an open door policy = i ’ve told my direct reports to come to me if they have a problem so why should i feel bad if they complain i ’m too busy to talk to them    59 it ’s gone viral = someone sent a tweet about this    60 i know you ’ve been burning the candle on both ends = get ready to do some more

it 's very straightforward for an honest vendor to refund the charge and the transaction only costs him a few pennies at most   if you initiate a chargeback the merchant is immediately charged an irreversible fee of about $ 20 simply as an administrative fee   he 'll also have to refund the charge if it 's reversed   to an honest merchant who would've happily refunded you it 's unfair and   in any case now that he 's out of pocket on the administrative fee his best bet is to fight the chargeback since he 's already paid for the privilege to fight also a chargeback is a strike against the merchant   if his chargeback rate is higher than the norm in his industry they may raise his fees or ban him entirely from taking visa mc   for a small merchant doing a small volume a single chargeback can have an impact on his overall chargeback rate   the threshold of proof for a chargeback varies by patterns of fraud and the merchant 's ability to recover   if you bought something readily fungible to cash like a gift card casino chips concert tickets etc forget it   likewise if   you already extracted the value last month 's netflix bill   credit card chargeback only withdraws a payment method   your bill is still due and payable the merchant is within his rights to dun you for payment and send you to collections or court   most merchants do n't bother because they know it 'll be a fight an unpleasant distraction and bad for business   but they 'd be within their rights   working with the merchant to settle the matter is a final resolution

actually calculating taxes is n't that difficult   you will pay a percentage of your gross sales to state and local sales tax and as a single owner llc your profits after sales taxes should pass through to your individual tax tax return according to this irs article they are not cumulative since they have different bases gross sales versus net profit that said when determining if your future business is profitable you need to ask what aspects of the business can i control can you control how much each item sells for increasing your prices will increase your gross margins which should be higher than your fixed and variable costs   if your margins do not exceed your costs then you will note be profitable note that as a vendor you are at a slight disadvantage to a retailer since tax has to be baked in to your prices   a retailer can advertise the pre tax price and pass through sales tax at the point of sale   however people expect to pay more at a vending machine so the disadvantage is very small you are n't directly competing with retailers anyways

as others have said if you do n't have dependents there 's little need for life insurance if you ca n't think of any obvious beneficiary for an insurance policy than you probably do n't need one dependents here should be understood broadly it would n't necessarily be limited to wife and children if you 're the only support for your handicapped cousin for example you might want to provide for him but i take it from your question that you have no such special case of course even if you have no dependents now you might pick some up in the future and if and when that does happen your medical situation may have changed making it difficult to get life insurance but if you have no immediate plans so that any such even is likely to be far away a serious alternative to consider would be to invest the money you would have paid in insurance premiums then if someday you do acquire dependents you have a pot of money set aside to provide for them in case something happens to you if it 's not enough and you can get insurance at that time then great but if you ca n't get insurance at least there 's something if you never do acquire dependents you can consider that pot of money part of your retirement fund

typically you can use credit card balance transfers to consolidate some or all of your other loan balances in one place   the interest rate might be lower   some prefer to make one payment rather than multiple payments   there is typically a fee that is imposed by the card that is originating or creating the loan   this would be the credit card you are transferring the balances   that fee is typically in the 3 to 5 range    while tempting and attractive on the surface this plan typically leads to a worse situation then you are now    it 's a tough pill to swallow but your problem is that you spend too much money   transferring money will not change this problem it is your behavior that has to change in order to not accumulate more debt   it has to change further if you want to get rid of the debt in a timely fashion    you would be far better served to forget about this transfer and get your life into control   spend a lot less earn more   pay off the cards you have now and cut them up   make a goal to be done in a year and figure out how to earn enough money to make that happen btw i am a reformed over spender that now owes nothing   yep my house cars and rental property are all paid for   you can get there too

the avalanche method does not work because most people do n't have enough money to make an avalanche   if you somehow had a windfall that was greater or equal to your highest credit card balance then by all means pay that one off    however most people do not have that kind of situation   instead they should use the debt snow ball method   they only have regular income that is typically much smaller then the balances another part of your plan that is especially troubling is that you are continuing to utilize credit cards   you need to cut them up and stop using them   first of course save $ 1000 for a small emergency fund the pay them off smallest to largest   do a budget each and every month   work an extra job or three   any extra money that hubby brings in goes towards one of the credit cards btw you do n't have a math problem you have a behavior problem

firstly it is completely legal for a company to buy its own shares i do n't believe it would be legal to do so secretly it would also be very difficult to do that secretly    so hypothetically we have a company inc. it does n't have any assets other than $ 100 in a bank account and there are 100 shares each owned by a different person each share would be worth $ 1 so the company decides to buy one share now there is $ 99 in the account and 99 shares each share is still worth $ 1 so the company continues to buy shares until there is only one share left and $ 1 in the account if the company buys that last share it will no longer have any assets and will cease to exist effectively dissolving the company   tl dr it is called dissolving the company or dissolution and it happens fairly often with limited liability corporations

you can you can take out a conventional mortgage and keep the cash   a mortgage is nothing but a secured loan against your home you can open a heloc and treat it as a negative equity bank account note that both a mortgage and a heloc tend to have significant up front or administrative costs attached to them   it costs the loaning institution some money to ensure they are in a safe position and they will want to pass it on to you they do n't want you taking out such a loan and not using it on the other hand the interest rates on such a loan are often much lower than interest rates on other loans if you have a reliable source of significant income getting a completely unsecured line of credit may be possible with a rate only a few percentage points higher than a heloc without having to pay a cent in fees   the bank does n't have to appraise your home or ensure ownership before such a loan just assess income which is easy especially if you have a regular paycheck auto deposited into an account at the same branch toss in some signatures from your employer and good to go if that is feasible you could end up with a lower rate   withdraw from the line of credit pay off your other loans then work to repay the line of credit if an unsecured line of credit has a rate 1 3 higher than a secured one and you are borrowing 5000 $ against it and pay it off over 2 years the total interest you would save from a secured line is about note that in some jurisdictions your home is protected against loss from bankruptcy unless you have used it as collateral for a loan or it is easier to claim the home if you are insolvent if you have used it as collateral   determining what the consequences of securing your loan against the house could itself be expensive

you should be careful about mingling your personal money and that of the business even if it is a sole prop right now   it is a good habit to keep separate business and personal bank credit accounts just so that when you change to an llc it is simpler for you to separate what belongs to the company and what is yours personally   what you 're doing makes it more difficult although only marginally so to itemize business deductions that were paid with an ostensibly personal credit account   the better habit to get into now is keeping that distinct separation between personal and business that being said there 's nothing illegal in what you 're doing but it would make an accountant cringe that 's for sure chuckle hope this helps good luck

i 'm another programmer i guess we all just like complicated things or got here via obligatory tedious but accurate point investing is not personal finance in fact it 's maybe one of the less important parts of it see this answer where to start with personal finance   obligatory warning for software developer type minds getting into investing because it 's complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective   or see behavioral finance research on how analytical professional creative type people are often terrible at investing while even tempered practical people are better the thing with investing is that inaction is better than action tried and true is better than creative and simple is better than complicated so if you 're like me and many programmers and like creative complicated action not good for the wallet you 've been warned that said stuff i read in general i hate reading too much financial information because i think it makes me take ill advised actions the actions i most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns so i try to focus on reading about software development for example or i answer questions on this site which at least might help someone out and i enjoy writing for basic financial news and research i prefer especially if you get the premium version the writing has more depth it 's often from qualified financial analysts and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks instead of a small number as with motley fool newsletters i do n't follow morningstar regularly anymore instead i use it for research when i need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever another caveat on morningstar is that the star ratings on funds are dumb look at the analyst picks and the analyst instead i just flipped through my rss reader and i have 20 30 finance related blogs in there collecting posts it looks like the only one i regularly read is which is sort of random but i find david very thoughtful and interesting he 's also a conservative without being a partisan hack and posts frequently i read the weekly market comment at as well most weeks it says the market is overvalued so that 's predictable but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about i read a lot of software related blogs and there 's some bleed into finance especially from the vc world blogs like or or whatever anyway i spend most of my reading time on career related stuff and i think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective if you were a doctor you 'd be better off reading about too i read finance related books fairly often i guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front i prefer books about principles rather than a of daily financial news and questionable ideas other than that i keep up with headlines just reading the paper every day including business related topics is good enough if there 's some big event in the financial markets it 'll show up in the regular paper take a class i initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the cfp course and the first cfa course both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus you can just do the class and take the exam if you like without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications i did n't go on to do that this sounds like a crazy thing to do and it kind of is but i think it 's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material if you 're a normal person and do n't have time to take finance courses you 're likely better off either keeping it super simple or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money   when it 's inevitably complex e.g. as you approach retirement then an advisor is best my mom is retiring soon and i found her a professional for example i like having a lot of knowledge myself because it 's just the only way i could feel comfortable so for sure i understand other people wanting to have it too but what i 'd share from the other side is that once you have it the conclusion is that you do n't have enough knowledge or time to do anything fancy anyway and that the simple answers are fine check out investing for fun is n't investing for profit many people recommend motley fool i see two on this question already the site is n't evil but the problem in my opinion is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that is n't objectively justifiable for practical reasons essentially i do n't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun very well if investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or then motley fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money wise see behavioral finance research again talking to others is n't compatible with ice in your decision making also motley fool tends to make it sound like active investing is easier than it is there 's a reason the chartered financial analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience rather than reading blogs practical investing just buy the target date fund can be super easy but once you go beyond that it 's not i do n't really agree with the anyone can do it and it 's not work premise any more than i think that about or or computer programming after 15 years i 'm a programming expert after some courses and a lot of reading i 'm not someone who could professionally run an actively managed portfolio i think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages or just do something else for fun besides investing morningstar has this problem too and and bloomberg i mean they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to they all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference when they do n't bottom line i do n't think personal finance changes very quickly the details of specific mutual funds change and there 's always some new twist in the tax code but the big picture is pretty stable i think going in depth say read the chartered financial analyst curriculum materials would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently the most important things to work on are income career and spending to maximize income minus spending that 's where time investment will pay off i know it 's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering but i did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there

the mental approach should be that you always knew the risk of gambling and it was extra money that you had or should have had now think that the horse race is not over and in the near future it will pick up pace against the others and be back on track

check how long you have to hold the stock after buying it if you can sell reasonably soon and your company is reasonably stable you 're unlikely to lose and/or be taxed and/or pay enough in fees to lose more than the 30 free money they 're giving you   whether you hold it longer than the minimum time depends partly on whether you think you can better invest the money elsewhere and partly on how you feel about having both your salary and part of your investments tied to the company 's success the company would like you to double down that way in the theory that it may make you motivated but some investment would advise keeping that a relatively small part of your total investments basically for the same reasons you are always advised to diversify

your question is rather direct but i think there is some underlying issues that are worth addressing   one how to save and purchase ~$500 worth items this one is the easy one since we confront it often enough   never ever ever buy anything on credit the only exception might be your first house but that 's it simply redirect the money you would spend in non necessities pleasure and entertainment to your big purchase fund the ps4 in this case when you get the target amount simply purchase it   when you get your salary use it to pay for the monthly actual necessities rent groceries etc and go through the list the money flow should be like this two how to evaluate if a purchase is appropriate it seems that you may be reluctant to spend a rather amount of money on a single item let me try to you expensive is not defined by price alone but by utility to compare the price of items you should take into account their utility let 's compare your prized ps4 to a soda can   is a soda can expensive it your thirst and fills you with sugar tap water will take your thirst away without damaging your health and for a fraction of the price so yes soda is ridiculously expensive whenever water is available is a game console expensive sure but it all boils down to how much do you end up using it if you are sure you will end up playing for years to come then it 's probably good value for your money   an example of   wrongly spent money on entertainment my friends and i went to the cinema to see a movie without checking the reviews beforehand   it was so awful that it hurt even with the discount price we got ultimately we all ended up remembering that time and laughing about how wrong it went so it was somehow well spent since i got a nice memory from that evening   a purchase is appropriate if you get your money 's worth of utility pleasure three console and computer gaming and of the latter there are few arguments for buying a console instead of upgrading your current computer if needed except for playing console it seems unlikely that a handful of exclusive games can justify purchasing a non platform unless you can actually get many hours from said games   previous arguments to prefer consoles instead of computers are that they work out of the box capability to easily connect to the tv controller support have been superseded by now besides pc games can usually be acquired for a lower price through frequent sales more about personal finance and investment

some thoughts 1 do you have a significant emergency fund 3 6 months of after tax living expenses if not you stand to take a significant loss if you have an unexpected need for cash that is tied up in investments what if you lose hate your job or your car breaks down what if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk 2 has a good suggestion given that if you 'd reinvested your dividends the s&p 500 has returned about 3.5 over the last 5 years you may be able to get a very nice risk free return   3 do you have access to employer matching funds such as in a 401(k at work if you get a dollar for dollar match that is a risk free pre tax 100 return and should be a high priority 4 what do you mean by medium volatility given that you are considering a 2/3 equity allocation it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15 or more in any given year and take several years to recover if that would you you may want to consider lowering your equity weights a high quality bond fund may be a good fit 5 personally i would avoid putting money into stocks that i did n't need back for 10 years if you only want to tie your money up for 2 5 years you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall you wo n't have time to recover before you need your money back the portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement however if your goals are to invest for 2 5 years only your situation would be significantly different   6 you can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees unless you plan to liquidate assets if you plan to buy a house saving enough to avoid pmi is a good risk free return on your money 7 in general and etf or index fund is a good idea the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term there are many good choices a la vanguard here to choose from 8) do n't worry about buy low sell high do n't be a speculator be an investor that 's my version of anthony 's do n't be a tourist be a traveler a speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at an investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part owner if you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions good for you you can move to wall street and make millions however almost no one can do this consistently and it does n't seem worth it to me to try i do n't mean to discourage you from investing just make sure you have your bases covered so that you do n't have to cash out at a bad time best of luck edit response to additional questions below 1 emergency fund i would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents money market short term cds etc until you 've built up an emergency fund it makes sense to want to make the best use of your money but you also have to account for risk my concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events that you could lose a lot of money or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt and it would be prudent to self insure against some of those risks i would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions taxes fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns ideally you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns there are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility even if they are less common using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this 2 invest at all i would recommend starting an emergency fund and then beginning to invest for retirement once your retirement savings are on track you can begin saving for whatever other goals you may have

the book value is total assets minus total liabilities and so if you increase the total assets without changing the total liabilities the difference gets bigger and thus higher consider if a company had total assets of $ 4 and total liabilities of $ 3 so the book value is $ 1 now if the company adds $ 2 to the assets then the difference would be 4 + 2 and last time i checked 3 is greater than 1 on definitions here are a couple of links to clarify that side of things from investopedia equity = assets liabilities from ready ratios shareholders equity = total assets total liabilities or shareholders equity = share capital + retained earnings treasury    shares depending on what the reinvestment bought there could be several possible outcomes if the company bought assets that appreciated in value then that would increase the equity if the company used that money to increase sales by expanding the marketing department then the future calculations could be a bit trickier and depend on what assumptions one wants to make really if you need an example of the latter imagine playing a game where i get to make up the rules and change them at will do you think you 'd win at some point it would depend on how i want the game to go and thus is n't something that you could definitively say one way or the other

this article was garbage   i do n't disagree with the overall premise that kids from elite colleges may not be better candidates for a job but the article 's delivery and proof was shit   my argument would be that not all kids are equally mature in high school to the point where they can accumulate the resume necessary to get into a harvard or yale   but in general if you hire from harvard or yale you know your getting someone of likely high intelligence and good work ethic   the difficulty of getting into harvard excludes most deadbeats   the deadbeats who do get in have connections that would be beneficial to your company   so yeah all else equal i 'm hiring the harvard kid over the kid   but i would n't exclude a kid because they went to

you could do that once maybe if the lender negotiates rather than going to court and taking you for everything you have plus having you wages garnished for the next several decades and in the process you would destroy your credit rating making it impossible to borrow again any time soon doing this deliberately is fraud but worse than that it 's stupid you are likely to lose far more than you could gain

banks are currently a lot less open to creative financing than they were a few years ago but you may still be able to take advantage of the tactic of splitting the loan into two parts a smaller second mortgage sometimes called a purchase money second at a slightly higher interest rate for around 15 20 of the value and the remaining in a conventional mortgage   since this tactic has been around for a long time it 's not quite in the category of the they were pulling a few years back so has a lot more potential to still be an option   i did this in for my first house in 93 and again in 99 when i moved to a larger home after getting married   it allowed me to get into both houses with less than 20 down and not pay pmi this way neither loan is above 80 so you do n't have to pay pmi   the interest on the second loan will be higher but usually only a few percent and is thus usually a fraction of what you were paying for the pmi and it 's deductible from your taxes if you 've been making your payments on time and have a good credit rating then you might be able to find someone who would offer you such a deal   you might even be able to get a rate for your primary that is down in the low 4 's depending on where rates are today and what your credit rating is like    if you can get the main loan low enough even if the other is like say 7 your blended rate may still be right around 5 if you can find a deal like this it 's also great material to use to negotiate with your current lender either help me get the pmi off this loan or i 'm going to refinance   then you can compare what they will offer you with what you can get in a refinance and decide what makes the most sense for you   on word of warning when refinancing do not get sucked into an adjustable rate mortgage   if you are finding life tight right now with house payments and all the an arm could be highly since they often offer a very low initial rate however then invariably adjust upwards and you could suddenly find yourself with a monster payment far larger than what you have now   with low rates where they are getting a conventional fixed rate loan or loans in the case of the tactic being discussed here is the way to go

i agree for the most part i thought about them i even thought about money supply and some others but the point was mainly that businesses as a whole have been doing bad for not just this year or since 2008 but over a decade not enough to account for inflation this is grounds that the economy is in a recession and will be bond 's are n't really an investment in business as they are loaning money to the government on interest so they do n't portray whether the economy is in recession or not   the premise was that a recession is has occurred not that money can not be made in a good portfolio   perhaps you did n't fully understand my last point i do n't believe gold and silver are the bubble i believe the dollar is the bubble and it has been bursting since 2000 commodity prices are merely a sign of the bursting bubble given that we 're in recession the only way to pull out as it is apparent people have been doing for the past 10 years is to buy real assets and that this creates a positive feedback loop into devaluing the dollar not everyone will pull out but most will for a long while the assets have had little exposure to the inflation of the dollar and now it 's catching up to the assets ergo assets are undervalued they are not the bubble

yes you will need an emergency fund for the rental besides appliances or a roof that might need to be replaced you will also have to protect against being unable to rent the unit   another risk is that you may have a tenant damage the unit while you can get the money through the courts it may take months or longer you ca n't wait for the money before you repair the unit keeping the rental unit funds separate from the rest of your funds will allow you to make sure you are adequately protecting yourself

i have n't read the book and have no intention of reading it this definitely looks like a forced savings plan with whole life insurance as the theme which is pretty bad for someone who is able to take care of his finances it would be good for someone who is not very good with his finances and wants to be forced into savings but then even for those people it would only help a little there are enough clauses that would make things more bad for him i.e. one can choose to take a loan pay only interest etc no book is going to help you build a savings habit one has to realize and spend what is essential it means not buying or doing tons of things and putting quite a bit away for a rainy day after this comes investing wisely

why do you keep going on about test results you do realise that the drug does n't last very long in the system and as explained by the testimonies there were techniques to delay blood testing until it was clear from the system such as ringing each other up telling them that testers are here and to say out on the track for longer or to dope more often at night when testers were n't around or to simply not answer your door when testers came around   and yes there were was a test result i do n't remember which year exactly that when tested at the time was found to have no drugs but that s because the drug he used was n't by any method the blood was later on when they did have a method to test for it and they did find it in his system   let 's say i have a gun which disappears into thin air after firing i use it to kill a person in a room full of people nobody sees me directly firing the gun but i do manage to use it to kill someone and the gun disappears police search everyone including me for a gun but find no gun they find that i had motive but again no gun now a week later 26 of my one of them who was the person who manufactured this magical gun own up to the police and confess how i was able to do what i did would n't it be stupid of me to argue you never found a gun on me after the murder therefore i 'm innocent   the gun is like the drug it disappears after use with the drug it 's not so instant but still disappears fairly quickly with regards to the blood testing frequency therefore do you not see how it is stupid to say no positive test results therefore it 's evidence he never used drugs again i 'll reiterate it incase you still do n't understand it of the drug disappears quickly from the blood

insurance is bought for peace of mind and to divert disaster    diverting disaster is a good great thing   if your house burned down if someone hit your car or some other devastating event think medical happened that required a more allocation than you could afford the series of issues may snowball and cause you to lose a far greater amount of money than the initial incident   this could be in the form of losing work time losing a job having to buy transportation quickly paying a premium having to incur high rate debt and so on    for the middle income and lower classes medical house and medical insurance certainly falls into these categories   also why a lot of states have buyout options on auto insurance some will let you drive without insurance by proving bonding up to 250k.    now the other insurance as i have alluded to is for peace of mind mainly   this is your laptop insurance vacation insurance and so on   the premise of these insurances is that no matter what happens you can get back to even by paying just a little extra    however what other answers have failed to clarify is the idea of insurance   it is an agreement that you will pay a company money right now   and then if a certain set of events happen you follow their guidelines they are still in business they still have the same protocols and so on that you will get some benefit when something happens to you   we buy insurance because we think we can snap our fingers and life will be back to normal   for bigger things like medical home and auto there are more regulations but i could get 1000 comments on people getting screwed over by their insurance companies   for smaller things almost all insurance is outsourced to a 3rd party not affiliated legally with a business   therefore if the costs are too high they can simply go under and if the costs are low they continue helping the consumer that does n't need help    so we buy insurance divert catastrophe or because we have fallen for the insurance sales pitch   and an easy way to get around the sales pitch as the person selling you the insurance if you can have their name and info and they will be personally liable if the insurance company fails their end of the bargain

here in the uk the rule of thumb is to keep a lot of equity in your home if you can i assume here that you have a lot of savings you 're considering using if you only have say 10 of the house price you would n't actually have a lot of choice in the matter the mortgage lender will penalise you heavily for low deposits the practical minimum is 5 but for most people a 95 mortgage is just silly albeit not as silly as the 100 or greater mortgages you could get and you should take serious individual advice before considering it according to which the average in the uk for first time buyers is 20 not the best source for that data i confess but a convenient one above 20 is not at all unusual you 'll do an affordability calculation to figure out how much you can borrow which is n't at all the same as how much you should borrow but does get you started basically you decide how much a month you can spend on mortgage payments the calculation will let you put every penny into this if you choose to but in practice you 'll want some discretionary income so do n't do that decide the term of the mortgage for a young first time buyer in the uk i think you 'd typically take a 25-year term and consider early repayment options rather than committing to a shorter term but you do n't have to mortgage lenders will offer shorter terms as long as you can afford the payments decide how much you 're putting into a deposit make for cost of moving stamp duty if applicable fees aka people to your stuff receive back a number which is the house price you can pay under these constraints and of course a breakdown of what the mortgage principle would be and the interest rate you 'll pay this step requires access to lender information since their rates depend on personal details deposit percentage phase of the moon etc our mortgage advisor did multiple runs of the calculation for us for different scenarios since we had n't made up our minds entirely since you have not yet decided how much deposit to make you can use multiple calculations to see the effect of different deposits you might make up to a limit of your total savings putting up more deposit both increases the amount you can borrow for a given monthly payment since mortgage rates are lower when the loan is a lower proportion of house value and of course increases the house price you can afford so unless you 're getting a very high return on your savings £ 1 of deposit gets you somewhat more than £ 1 of house and the calculation will tell you how much more once you 've chosen the house you want the matter is even simpler do you prefer to put your savings in the house and borrow less and make lower payments or prefer to put your savings elsewhere and borrow more and make higher payments but perhaps have some additional income from the savings assuming you maintain a contingency fund a lower mortgage is generally considered a good investment in the uk but you need to check what 's right for you and compare it to other investments you could make the issue is complicated by the fact that residential property prices are rising quite quickly in most areas of the uk and have been for a long time meaning that highly leveraged property investment appears to be a really good idea this leads to the imprudent but tempting conclusion that you should buy the biggest house you can possibly afford and watch its value rises i do not endorse this advice personally but it 's certainly true that in a sharply rising house market it 's easier to get away with buying a bigger house than you need than it is to get away with it in a flat or falling market as stephen says an offset mortgage is a no brainer good idea if the rate is the same unfortunately in the uk the rate is n't the same or anyway it was n't a couple of years ago offset mortgages are especially good for those who make a lot of savings from income and for any reason do n't want to commit all of those savings to a traditional mortgage payment good reasons for not wanting to do that include uncertainty about your future income and a desire to have the flexibility to actually spend some of it if you fancy

some builders if given the first chance to deal with the problem instead of being presented with a bill after the fact will fix the problem at no charge to the homeowner   good faith matters my house was built by such a builder   if i have a problem that i am competent enough to diagnose and fix i fix it myself at my cost   if i have a problem that that i can not diagnose and fix myself but that i think the builder or his subcontractor is competent enough to diagnose and/or fix i contact the builder or subcontractor directly   i am willing to pay for the diagnosis and/or fix especially if it is an aging or wear and tear issue or the logical consequence of a cost saving measure that i voluntarily chose when the house was being designed if the problem is a plumbing problem i contact my preferred plumber for a diagnosis and/or repair   i pay for my preferred plumber 's work   on two occasions my preferred plumber was unable to fix the problem   both problems turned out to be installation or testing errors related to work done specifically for building inspections   in both cases i paid for my preferred plumber 's diagnosis and the builder and/or his subcontractor fixed the problem at no additional cost to me the diagnosis and repair work that you describe seems like a similar situation to me   in fact i had my builder 's subcontractor replace a few prematurely damaged shingles on my roof   this repair prevented a roof leak   i noticed the problem while trimming a tree back from the roof   the shingles were damaged because the building permit implied that the tree could not be trimmed back   i 'm spotting a pattern with these problems in my opinion the alleged problem with the roof pitch seems like a design flaw that should have been obvious at the time you chose the house design   i expect that any corrections of this design flaw will need to come out of your budget   in the absence of further details i doubt that either the builder or the homeowners insurance company is responsible for it some builders make a point of minimizing the warranty work they pay for regardless of its effect on the builder 's reputation   i do not know which kind of builder you have the lawyer has probably told you whether the relevant statutes of limitations have lapsed   the statutes of limitations vary from state to state and vary depending on the alleged tort   starting a lawsuit is likely to further damage your relationship with your builder homeowners insurance companies now share the number of claims that have been made historically at each property address   most insurance companies now use this cumulative number of claims when setting rates even if the were made against a different insurance company or by a different homeowner   i do not know whether any insurance companies ignore claims older than a certain number of years or ignore the first claim

saving for college you have a couple of options   529 plans are probably the best bet for most people wanting to save for their kids college education you can put a lot of money away and you may get a state tax deduction the downside is if you 're kid does n't go to college you may end up eating the 10 penalty state specific prepaid tuition plans the upside is you know roughly the return you are going to get on your money the downside is your kid has to go to a state school in the state you prepaid or there are likely withdrawal penalties for the most part these really are n't that great of a deal any more   are also an option but they only allow you to contribute $ 2k year but you have more investment options than with the 529 plans traditional and roth ira accounts can also be used to pay for higher education i would n't recommend this route in general but if you maxed out your 401k and were n't using your ira contribution limits you could put extra money here and get more or really different flexibility than you can with a 529 account i doubt ira 's will ever be asked for on a fafsa which might be helpful another option is to save the money in a regular brokerage account you would have more flexibility but lower returns after taxes one advantage to this route is if you think your kid might be borderline for financial aid a year or two before he starts college you could move this money into another investment that does n't matter for financial aid purposes a few words of caution make sure you save for retirement before saving for your kids college he can always get loans to pay for school but no one is going to give you a loan to pay for your retirement also be cautious with the amount of money you give your adult child studies have shown that the more money that parents give their adult children the less successful they are compared to their peers

as joe mentioned you can carry a balance on your credit card for some grace period typically 1 month you will not be charged any interest if you pay your balance at the end of the grace period i think of it as a way to get liquid for making purchases for example you want to make a large purchase but your funds are in some investment account which might take ~1 week to get to you you can use the credit card to make the purchase and use that grace period to move your money from investments to checking account and pay for your purchase without paying anything extra this helps you keep your money invested and not having to keep large amounts in checking savings account which does not generate any returns

for a parent deciding on contributing to a 529 plan the first consideration is the plan run by the state government that will trigger a state income tax deduction you do have to at least look at the annual fees for the program before jumping into the state program but for many people the state program offers the best deal because of the state tax deduction unfortunately for you california does not offer a state tax deduction for 529 plan contributions which means that you can pick another states program if the fees are more reasonable or if the investing options are better you can even select a nationwide plan with a state is run by tiaa cref tiaa cref is a large company that runs pension and 403(b funds for many state and local governments many teacher unions use them   they are legitimately authorized by the state of california the investment board sets investment policies and    oversees all activities of the state ’s 529 college    investment plan the program enables californians to save for college    by putting money in tax advantaged investments after tax    contributions allow earnings to grow tax deferred and disbursements    when used for tuition and other qualified expenses are federal and    state tax free the plan is managed by tiaa cref tuition    financing inc. the investment board also oversees the governor ’s    scholarship programs and california memorial scholarship program note before picking a plan from another state make sure that they allow outside contributions

1 when it says an investment or mutual fund is a mutual fund not    an investment if no what is the definition of an investment a mutual fund is indeed an investment the article probably mentions   mutual funds separately from other investments because it is not uncommon for mutual funds to give you the option to automatically reinvest dividends and capital gains     2 when it says in terms of stocks why does it only mention    distribution of dividends but not distribution of capital gains since distributions are received as cash deposits they can be used to buy more of the stock capital gains on the other hand occur when an asset increases in value these gains are realized when the asset is sold in the case of stocks reinvestment of capital gains does n't make much sense since buying more stock after selling it to realize capital gains results in you owning as much stock as you had before you realized the gains 3 when it says in terms of mutual funds it says about the    reinvestment of distributions and dividends does distributions not    include distributions of dividends why does it mention    distributions parallel to dividends used in this setting dividend and distribution are synonymous which is highlighted by the way they are used in parallel 4 does reinvestment only apply to interest or dividends but not to    capital gain reinvestment only applies to dividends in the case of stocks mutual funds must distribute capital gains to shareholders making these distributions essentially cash dividends usually as a special end of year distribution if you 've requested automatic reinvestment the fund will buy more shares with these capital gain distributions as well

yes that 's right in the end tax is charged on the total of your income in a tax year paye on employment income is just a way of making incremental payments throughout the year note that tax rates are marginal rates applying to bands of salary not the entire salary but as your employment salary would be already over the 40 threshold £ 45,000 for the entire extra from self employment would indeed be taxed at 40 note that you 'll also owe national insurance contributions in general if your employed income is over the higher rate tax threshold it should be 2 class 4 on the self employment income however due to various complications in the way the system works you might be initially charged more than that and and explicitly claim the excess back from hmrc it might also be less if your earnings are below or only slightly above the lower profits limit   you still get to keep 58 only you can decide whether that is worth your time or not

there is a strategy called merger arbitrage where you buy the stock of the acquired company when it sells for less than the final acquisition price usually the price will rise to about the acquisition price fairly rapidly after the merge is announced so you have to move fast the danger is that the merger gets called off regulatory reasons the acquired company board votes no and you get left holding shares bought at a price higher than the price after the merger collapses this is kind of an advanced strategy and a tough one to back test since each deal is unique

i agree we should be efficient with the food we produce especially meats but i do n't like using food production efficiency overall as an encompassing statistic    it comes with all sorts of problems largely due to artificial fertilizer productions extremely demanding gmo plants and of course overall pesticides   pushing for extreme yields out of fields using artificial fertilizer can result in disastrous circumstances down the road over utilization of a field gives better returns now but we ca n't do that indefinitely and depletes the top soil of many and healthy bacteria over time yields will decrease and if it ever gets taken that far you end it with more problems even if you stop before it gets that bad you then have to suffer years of less than average yield to build the back up to health just so you can get average yield again and then there is the problem of how artificial fertilizer is made which while currently necessary to produce enough food currently 50 of the world 's food is produced directly due due to use of artificial fertilizer it utilizes fossil fuels both as and to burn for power to fuel the process of turning fossil fuels into fertilizer   if we really want to be sustainable we should be utilizing more farm land to make up for reduced yields from avoiding as much artificial fertilizer as we can

there is some merit to it in that federal gross receipts are largely uncorrelated with tax wp content federal personal income tax rates tax    there are two somewhat perverse consequences of that fact first raising taxes does n't raise revenues meaning we ca n't actually pay for free stuff from uncle sam merely by adding an offsetting tax increase   and second raising taxes on group x ie the rich to make them pay their fair share flat out does n't work it 's effectively just kicking them in the balls because we grudge them for having more money than we do   now as to whether or not lowering taxes really encourages companies to hire more and pay better that 's an entirely separate issue from whether or not it 's revenue neutral from the perspective of the federal government   fortunately we have a recent historical example reagan did exactly that which in a period of corporate greed and erosion of workers rights not seen since the end of the days of the robber barons   so on the front end trump 's not wrong on the back end he 's trying to sell us unicorn

you also may want to consider how this interacts with the stepped up basis of estates   if you never sell the stock and it passes to your heirs with your estate under current tax law the basis will increase from the purchase price to the market price at the time of transfer    in a comment you proposed    thinking more deeply though i am a little skeptical that it 's a free lunch say i buy stock a a computer manufacturer at $ 100 which i intend to hold long term it ends up falling to $ 80 and the robo advisor sells it for tax loss harvesting buying stock b a similar computer manufacturer as a replacement so i benefit from realizing those losses however say both stocks then rise by 50 over 3 years at this point selling b gives me more capital gains tax than if i had held a through the losses since a 's rise from 80 back to 100 would have been free for me since i purchased at 100 and then later thought   although thinking even more sorry thinking out loud here i guess i still come out ahead on taxes since i was able to deduct the $ 20 loss on a against ordinary income and while i pay extra capital gains on b that 's a lower tax rate so the free lunch is $ of tax bracket capital gains rates that 's true   and in addition to that if you never sell b which continues to rise to $ 200 was last at $ 120 after a 50 increase from $ 80 the basis steps up to $ 200 on transfer to your heirs    of course your estate may have to pay a 40 tax on the $ 200 before transferring the shares to your heirs   so this is n't exactly a free lunch either   but you have to pay that 40 tax regardless of the form in which the money is held   cash real estate stocks whatever   whether you have a large or small capital gain on the stock is irrelevant to the estate tax    this type of planning may not matter to you personally but it is another aspect of what wealth management can impact

according to the book of hull american and european calls on non dividend paying stocks should have the same value american puts however should be equals to or more valuable than european puts the reason for this is the time value of money in a put you get the option to sell a stock at a given strike price if you exercise this option at t=0 you receive the strike price at t=0 and can invest it at the risk free rate lets imagine the rf rate is 10 and the strike price is this means at you would get if on the other hand you exercise the option early at you would simply receive the strike price 10 $ basically the strike price which is your payoff for a put option does n't earn interest another way to look at this is that an option is composed of two elements the insurance element and the time value of the option the insurance element is what you pay in order to have the option to buy a stock at a certain price for put options it is equals to the s 0 where k = strike price and stock price   the time value of the option can be thought of as a risk premium it 's difference between the value of the option and the insurance element if the benefits of exercising a put option early earning the risk free rate on the proceeds outweighs the time value of the put option it should be exercised early yet another way to look at this is by looking at the upper bounds of put options for a european put today 's value of the option can never be worth more than the present value of the strike price discounted at the risk free rate if this rule is n't respected there would be an arbitrage opportunity by simply investing at the risk free rate for an american put since it can be exercised at any time the maximum value it can take today is simply equals to the strike price therefore since the pv of the strike price is smaller than the strike price the american put can have a bigger value bear in mind this is for a non dividend paying stock as previously mentioned if a stock pays a dividend it might also be optimal to exercise just before these are paid

as long as your total does n't exceed the per year limit you should be able to deposit after tax money into your health savings account contact the hsa administrator for details note that unless your employer sets this up you 'd be sending them after tax money which goes in the same category as other non reimbursed health expenses so you may not get any immediate tax savings by doing this vs. just spending the money out of pocket however once there us enough reserve money in your hsa for you to invest it in the same way a 401k can be invested it will grow tax free so if you 're putting in significantly more than you expect to withdraw any time soon this may still be a worthwhile thing to do definitely talk to hr about whether you can still get it set up pre tax though most employers do n't allow changes unless there has been a significant change in your family new wife new kids that sort of thing

yeah so in other words democracy is a sham because voters are stupid enough that the amount spent on a campaign actually can change voter opinion sufficient to sway elections   the alternative is to end political democracy and replace it with an entirely voluntary funded democracy where you vote with your money this system already exists the arch to politics and its leaders are elected by their ability to provide customers with better value leaders like bill gates sam walton steve jobs warren buffet elon musk tesla brin and larry page google jeff bezos amazon   in political democracy everyone can be forced to fund the choices that only 25 of adults actually supported obama for instance won just 25 of adult votes in most elections it 's similar low of actual support in the economic democracy you buy what you want and that does n't hamper someone else 's ability to buy what they want multiple service providers can exist together all we need to do is privatize and distribute ownership of roads to property owners who have paid for them all of this time privatize schools so kids learn actual skills that others will pay them for private police and let each property owner establish their own rules to be enforced on their own property let others then and avoid those with stupid rules   the move to a completely voluntary society is a worthwhile goal though nothing can possibly end wealth inequality since every time something new is invented the inventor becomes wealthy through voluntary trade at no loss to others

the key with analyzing financial statements is that you need to look at all angles of a particular item ie sales has gone up but has the cost of sales increased by even more implying narrower margins or interest expense has gone up but is that because new debt was taken on to pay for expansion   in the specific case you mentioned buying assets that will create depreciation expense over time there is a grouping on the cash flow statement called investing which will state the amount of cash used during the year to invest in the business this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on other factors and your personal preference regarding dividends being paid to shareholders in addition you can see the amount of depreciation expense separately listed on the cash flow statement this tells you many things consider a company with $ 10 m in assets on the balance sheet but $ 2 m in depreciation expense this tells you that in a very loose sense every 5 years the assets owned by the company will all need to be replaced compare that with the investing section of the cash flow statement if they are buying $ 4 m of new assets this year this tells you that on an overall basis they are likely expanding the business because the new investments outpace the depreciation   but is your concern of under reported earnings a common issue typically keep in mind that the most common bias of a company is to over report earnings this is because management compensation in the form of performance bonuses and stock option valuation is increased by profitable years however in a year where a loss poor performance is likely a reverse bias occurs to take as much of a loss as possible in that year this is because if a manager 's bonus is already 0 due to poor company performance having a worse year will not turn the bonus negative so by taking all expenses possible today on the financial statements next year might have less allocated expenses and therefore the manager might get a bigger bonus impact next year this is called taking a big bath   note that public companies must meet certain reporting standards and they are audited by external accounting firms to show that they meet those standards of course there is no guarantee that the auditors will catch all cases of accounting manipulation see enron etc etc

the main difference between an etf and a mutual fund is management an etf will track a specific index with no manager input a mutual fund has a manager that is trying to choose securities for its fund based on the mandate of the fund liquidity etfs trade like a stock so you can buy at 10 am and sell at 11 if you wish mutual funds most are valued at the end of each business day so no intraday trading   also etfs are similar to stocks in that you need a buyer seller for the etf that you want have whereas a mutual fund 's units are sold back to itself i do not know of many if any issues with an etf but you could be stuck holding it if you can not find a buyer usually the market maker mutual funds can be closed to trading however it is rare tax treatment both come down to the underlying holdings in the fund or etf however more often in mutual funds you could be stuck paying someone else 's taxes not true with an etf   for example you buy an equity mutual fund 5 years ago you sell the fund yourself today for little to no gain i buy the fund a month ago and the fund manager sells a bunch of the stocks they bought for it 10 years ago for a hefty gain i have a tax liability you do not even though it is possible that neither of us have any gains in our pocket it can even go one step further and 6 months from now i could be down money on paper and still have a tax liability expenses a mutual fund has an mer or management expense ratio you pay it no matter what if the fund has a positive return of 12.5 in any given year and it has an mer of 2.5 then you are up 10 however if the fund loses 7.5 with the same mer you are down 10 an etf has a much smaller management fee typically 0.10 0.95 but you will have trading costs associated with any trades risks involved in these as well as any investment are many and likely too long to go into here however in general if you have a canadian stock etf it will have similar risks to a canadian equity mutual fund i hope this helps

lets sat if i buy a house on company 's name it will declared as expense and will deduct from profit but i am not sure if i can rent it out as a it ltd company that 's my questions buying a house is not an expense it is a transfer of assets   the house itself is an asset   so if you have $ 100,000 in cash buy a house for $ 35,000 your total assets will remain the same $ 100,000 but your asset mix will be different instead of $ 100,000 in cash you now have $ 65,000 in cash and $ 35,000 in property you can expense the costs associated with buying the house e.g. taxes interest legal fees but the house itself stays on the asset side of your balance sheet   to refine the example above if you buy the house for $ 35,000 and pay $ 5,000 in misc fees related to purchasing the house your assets are now $ 95,000 $ 60,000 in cash $ 35,000 in house the $ 5,000 reduction is from the actual fees associated with the purchase   it is these fees that lower your profit being not familiar with uk rules in canada and the us and likely the uk you would then depreciate the house over its useful life   the depreciation expense is deducted from your annual net income if you rent out the house what you can do is expense any maintenance fees taxes etc on the house itself   this expense will count as a negative towards the rental income lowering your effective taxable income from the rental   e.g. rent out a flat at $ 1,000/month but your property taxes are $ so your net income for tax purposes i.e. your taxable income in this case is $

there are banks that will do 5-year fixed alternatively if you pay off a 15-year mortgage as if it were a five year fixed with the extra money going to pay down principal the cost is n't very different and you have more safety buffer talk to banks about options or find a mortgage broker who 'd be willing to research this for you just to point out an alternative refinancing at lower rate but without shortening the duration would lower your payments investing the difference even quite conservatively is likely to produce more income than the loan would be costing you at today 's rates this is arguably the safest leveraged investment you 'll ever have the opportunity to make i compromised i cut my term from 20 years to lowered the interest rate to and am continuing to let the loaned money sit in my investments and grow

gt they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate   that 's not true is it i 'm fairly sure they 're taxed at the same rate now buybacks are still better for shareholders though because those who do n't want to sell have the option of just holding the stock with dividends everyone gets a dividend and the associated tax hit whether they want it or not   edit oh right ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income qualified dividends are not but are n't qualified dividends the modal type

if you are from any university in nyc other than for profits you have so much access to networking that you actually have a shot slim but still a shot of breaking into the industry   you should be reaching out and trying to connect with as many people in ibd as you can at the gym through friends family through school career center when you contact them your goal is to meet them face to face that is the advantage you have over the kids from schools outside of the city and that is what will get your foot in the door

let me explain this for you    massive decrease in sales from 2009 bad government obama bernanke   even bigger increase in sales from 2010 substantive economic growth due to a well run company   later downturn in 2013 bad government obama bernanke   basically when a company is increasing overall revenue and profits that 's because economics and free markets when a company is losing sales and revenues that 's because obama if their stock price goes up when it should n't that 's also because obama    stock prices that are high right now are only high because obama bernanke except when they are high because of something else when stock prices go down it will also be because of obama bernanke    hopefully that clarifies things for you

i would recommend that you establish a landlord tenant relationship instead of joint ownership ie 100 ownership stake for one of you vs 0 for the other it is much cleaner and simpler   basically one of you can propose a monthly rent amount and the other one can chose to be either renter or landlord alternatively you can both write down a secret rental price offer assuming you are the landlord then pick the landlord who wrote down the smaller rental price   if neither of you can afford the down payment then you can consider the renter 's contribution an unsecured loan at an agreed interest rate and payment schedule if you must have both names on the financing then i would recommend you sell the property or refinance under a single name as quickly as possible when the relationship ends if not before pay the renter back any remaining balance on the loan and leave the landlord with the resulting equity or debt   in any case if you expect the unsecured loan to outlive your relationship then you are either buying a house you ca n't afford or partnering on it with someone you should n't

businesses are free to decide what payment methods they accept for their goods and services businesses sometimes advertise what credit cards they accept by posting some stickers at their door when your credit card is n't among them and you do n't have enough cash with you ask about your card before you order if a business does n't accept your credit card your best recourse is to take your business elsewhere when you already ate there and got into an awkward situation because you assumed that they would accept your card you might also want to write an online review of the place and warn others to bring cash for their visit but please be fair in the review when the food and service are decent a restaurant does n't deserve a one star rating just because they do n't take credit cards note that businesses have good reasons to not accept credit cards it often means additional cost for them in form of but there is also a more shady reason taking payment in cash means that there is no electronic trail of the transaction that makes it far easier for an establishment to their income they might under report it to evade taxes or over report it to launder money both are illegal of course

haha i 'm also very cynical amp jaded think we all are to differing degrees i do n't get why our free market economy relies on constant and continuous growth in producing goods services does n't this   contradict the entire point of economics in that there are scarce resources how can we keep increasing our production of goods from a limited amount of resources i ca n't see it ending any other way than mass destruction i mean war and famine will wipe out a massive proportion of the human race from earth amp financial systems will collapse as this unrestrained economic growth will get so out of control we 'll pass a tipping point where there 's just are not enough resources to sustain it the real value then is in resources not money money is just something we made up

inflation is theft   it is caused when banks lend money that someone deposited but still has claim to called fractional reserve banking    on top of that the federal reserve bank in the us or the central bank of the currency i.e. bank of japan european central bank etc can increase the monetary base by writing checks out of thin air to purchase debt such as us treasury bonds inflation is not a natural phenomenon it is completely man made and is caused solely by the two methods above inflation causes the business cycle   lower interest rates caused by inflation cause long term investment even while savings is actually low and consumption is high   this causes prices to rise rapidly the boom and eventually when the realization is made that the savings is not there to consume the products of the investment you get the bust i would encourage you to read or listen to the case against the fed by murray n. great book free online or via itunes

full payment is always better than auto loan if you are prudent with finances i.e if you take a loan you are factoring the emi hence your savings will remain as is however if you manage well you can buy the car with cash and at the same time put aside the notional emi as savings and investments the other factor to consider is what return your cash is giving if this more than auto loan interest rate post taxes you should opt for loan for example if auto loan is 10 and you are getting a return of 15 after taxes on investment then loan is better company car lease depends on terms more often you get break on taxes on the emi component but you have to buy at the end of lease period and re register the car in your name so there is additional cost some companies give lease at very favourable rates plus if you leave the job lease has to be broken and it becomes more expensive

in 2001 argentina defaulted on it 's debt and started negotiating a haircut with it 's debtors as a result a lot of the debtors sold the bonds they had a fire sale prices thinking better get some back than nothing   one of the guys that bought those cheap bonds was paul singer aka mr. vulture hedge fund i 'll speculate here saying that mr. singer saw that the bond conditions gave him a way to force argentina to pay the full value of the bonds notwithstanding it 's default or negotiated haircut argentina did negotiate a haircut with about 97 of it 's bond holders this meant that although they would lose out on some of the money they would still get some back and argentina could work its way back to its feet eventually    mr. singer and friends were the 3 that did not accept the haircut and took the country to court to get 100 of the bond value back   now the plot i do n't understand if mr. singer knew this or not but the bonds also had a condition that said that no bond holder would be worst off than the highest bond deal argentina offered anyone which basically means if they pay mr. singer 100 they have to pay everybody else 100 now it was well established that argentina could not pay 100 and is not able to pay 100 of the debt hence the 2001 default    meanwhile argentina was paying out the hair cut bonds but holding out on mr. singer and friends as they still did n't agree to pay 100 the courts ruled that they could not do this and had to pay everybody since argentina can not pay everybody 100 it is defaulting on the debt

as your main concern seems to be that you are not sure whether you can ever get a house and actually support the expenses it incurs when you have one here is a very simple answer   you say you are currently decreasing your creditcard debt by 2k per month at that rate it will be finished within 2 years try to pay it off completely if this succeeds in the next 2 years you can be confident that you can afford a 500k house paying back 50k high interest debt in 2 years is very roughly equivalent to back 500k low interest debt over 20 years a reasonable time period in my environment so just pay back the creditcard as fast as you can if two years sounds like a long time there is nothing stopping you to pay it back a little bit faster even   note this is written under the assumption that your student loan burden will not increase over time

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had n’t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece
