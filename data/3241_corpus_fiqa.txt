you will often receive a lower bill if you simply wait for a second or third billing statement i was once given the advice to never pay a medical bill until after they had sent three notices because they will almost certainly reduce the amount due sounds crazy right i have excellent credit so the idea of risking it by ignoring bills disturbed me greatly and i at the advice   i then had a similar experience to you and decided to take the advice by the third statement the bill was reduced to less than half of the original with zero intervention on my part i then paid it without any impact to my credit whatsoever i 've since done that every time i receive healthcare services and the bill is always reduced on subsequent statements generally to less than half of the original bill sometimes it 's because insurance finally got around to paying sometimes a credit is mysteriously added sometimes line items disappear without explanation line items sometimes appear over time too but the overall balance generally goes down i do n't know the reason for it but it works this has happened with a variety of providers so it 's not just one company that does it granted i never called to negotiate the price so i ca n't say if i would've gotten a better deal by doing that i like it because it requires no time or effort on my part and it has greatly reduced my medical bills with zero impact to my credit i only have personal anecdotes to back it up but it 's worked for me

some doctors will give folks who are not covered by insurance a price break if that describes you you could ask but if you did n't discuss the price in advance that is n't the doctor 's fault any more than it would be the mechanic 's fault if you asked for auto service without getting an estimate first consider it a cheap lesson in not making assumptions

to answer the specific question of whether you can get the bill reduced without hurting your credit yes as long as the bill never goes to collections there 's no reason it should ever show up on your credit report will they reduce your bill without sending it to collections first maybe all you can do is ask

if you are disputing the size of the charge for specific services like you think that they overcharged for lab work you can try disputing it with the business office staff at the doctor 's office if on the other hand you just think that the overall bill is too expensive then you really only have one option you can ask if they will reduce the bill for you most hospitals and clinics i 've dealt with have programs set up for this but you usually access them by filling out paperwork demonstrating financial hardship along with supporting documents it never hurts to ask but with the services already rendered the only person with an interest in reducing the bill is you the reduction if any will probably depend on what the clinic thinks your ability to pay is compared with the cost to them of pursuing you for payment as well as the amount of funding they have for bill reduction when i worked in the financial services office of a hospital a $ 400 bill would not even have been reviewed for the balance would be too low to devote staff time to reviewing it 's frustrating and even asking in advance might not have given you accurate or any information on what the cost of the visit would be so your ability to shop around is limited unfortunately that does n't give you any additional options in this case

you should start by calling the clinic and asking them to tell you how the visit was coded some clinics have different billing codes based on the complexity of the visit if you have one thing you are seeing the doctor about that could be coded differently than if you have 4 things you are seeing the doctor about in fact even if you are there just for one but while you are there you happen to ask a few quick questions about other possible ailments the doctor could decide to use the billing code for the higher complexity if when speaking to the billing department it is determined that the visit is using a higher complexity billing code and a higher charge as a result you could then request that it be re coded with the lower complexity visit realize if you request that they will probably have to first get approval from the doctor that saw you note i am basing this answer on first hand experience about 6 months ago in illinois where the situation i described happened to me because i asked some unrelated questions about other possible ailments at the end of a visit to an after hours clinic the billing department explained that my visit was coded for 4 issues 3 of them were quick questions i asked about at the end of the visit one of which she referred me to another doctor my additional questions probably extended the visit by 3 4 minutes in my case i never got the bill reduced mainly due to my own laziness and my knowing that i would hit my deductible anyway this year of course i ca n't say for sure if this is what happened in your case or even if this practice is widespread this was the first and only time in my life that i encountered it as a side note your primary doctor would likely rarely ever bill you for a more complex visit as it likely would n't lead to much repeat business as for your last question regarding your credit if the provider decides to lower the price and you pay the lower price this in no way can affect your credit surprising update when i called the billing office months ago i had asked if they could confirm the code with the doctor and i was told they would look into it i never heard back never followed up and assumed that was the end of it well today i got a call back months later and was informed that they had re coded the visit which will result in a lower charge it 's still pending the insurance adjustment but at some point in the future i expect to receive either a credit on my next statement or a check in the mail the price difference pre insurance in my case has gone from $ to $ 235 update i did receive a check for the difference the check was dated july 20 2016 which is just over 2 months after the phone call informing me i would receive it

i think to some extent you may be confusing the terms margin and leverage from investopedia two concepts that are important to traders are margin and leverage margin is a loan extended by your broker that allows you to leverage the funds and securities in your account to enter larger trades in order to use margin you must open and be approved for a margin account the loan is collateralized by the securities and cash in your margin account the borrowed money does n't come free however it has to be paid back with interest if you are a day trader or this may not be a concern but if you are a swing trader you can expect to pay between 5 and 10 interest on the borrowed money or margin going hand in hand with margin is leverage you use margin to create leverage leverage is the increased buying power that is available to margin account holders   essentially leverage allows you to pay less than full price for a trade giving you the ability to enter larger positions than would be possible with your account funds alone leverage is expressed as a ratio a 2:1 leverage for example means that you would be able to hold a position that is twice the value of your trading account if you had $ 25,000 in your trading account with 2:1 leverage you would be able to purchase $ 50,000 worth of stock margin refers to essentially buying with borrowed money   this must be paid back with interest   you also may have a margin call forcing you to liquidate assets if you go beyond your margin limits leverage can be achieved in a number of ways when investing one of which is investing with a margin account

this was all luck that amount of leverage will destroy your account in a single bad trade you profit is way less than it should be because you are getting killed on fees   take a look at the bitcoin trade you should have in profit but you only have and your currency trades were consistently positions that were worth $ 400,000 dollars where you were pulling out in profits even though they should have been profits you are consistently getting 30 less than you should be and consistently betting bigger amounts than you account can really handle bad trades will probably have 30 greater losses than actual and when the market moves the wrong direction then a single position will wipe out your account yes you could have just bought bitcoin and gotten great profits you totally nailed the directions of the markets it is just a matter of time before you blow up the trailing profits wo n't always help you when the market starts going down first

first off the basics on hst gst    you do n't need to collect hst if you do n't want to until you hit 30k in a particular three month period assuming you 're not regularly passing $ 30k   you then need to collect on the sale that takes you over $ 30k plus all sales after that   see the h&r block page on gst hst for example goes through the roof generating more than $ 30,000 in one particular three month period in this case the day the sale goes through that took you over that $ 30,000 threshold becomes the day you cease to be a small supplier you must charge gst hst on the sale that put you over the $ 30,000 limit and on all sales after that even if you are not yet registered you now have 29 days to register with the government alternately if you hit 30k over four three month periods i.e. a year then you are exempt until the end of that fourth three month period after which you must register and collect hst the month after in excess of $ 30,000 during four or fewer previous consecutive three month periods you will be considered to be a small supplier for those four calendar three month periods plus the next month your first sale after that additional month and all sales thereafter will have to include gst hst you will have 29 days from the first day of the second month to register however many businesses do collect hst gst even under that limit in particular as it means you can collect tax refunds for your input hst gst paid   if you do so then you simply register from the start and then you do n't need to worry about it   you do need to remit those taxes collected though   if you do n't remit you wo n't be able to collect tax rebates for your input hst gst you decide to become a gst hst when you start your business you expect to exceed the $ 30,000 threshold at some time in the near future you also want to receive any gst hst paid back from the government on all expenditures especially those high startup costs and as grant recommends in most cases it ’s generally a good idea to register for gst hst as soon as your business is established provided that your business makes or will make taxable or zero rated supplies early registration ensures that gst hst paid on costs incurred is recoverable since tax paid prior to registration is generally not recoverable except on the purchase of inventory capital property and prepaid services still on hand at the time of registration be sure to register early because in many situations registering late can result in the loss of recoverable gst paid before registration

the last column in the source data is volume the number of stocks that was exchanged during the day and it also has a value of zero for that day meaning that nobody bought or sold the stocks on that day and since the prices are prices of transactions the first and the last one on a particular day and the ones with the highest lowest price the prices can not be established and are irrelevant as there was not a single transaction on that day only the close price is assumed equal to its previous day counterpart because this is the most important value serving as a basis to determine the daily price change and we assume no change in this case continuous line charts also use this single value bar and candle charts usually display a blank space for a day where no trade occurred

average rent rates will typically rise and fall and are market dependent just like real estate in the short term a collapse in housing like the one we saw in 2008 can induce a spike in rental costs as people walk away or get foreclosed on and move back into apartments that then tends to self adjust as the people who had been in the apartments find a deal on a foreclosed house and move out however one thing i 've seen to be near constant in the apartment business is that a landlord will offer you a deal to get in then increase the rent on you from year to year until you get fed up and move this is a big reason i did n't have the same address for two years in a row until i bought my house the landlord is basically betting that you wo n't want to deal with the hassle of moving and so will pay the higher rent rate even if when you do the math it makes more sense to move even to maintain the same rent rate eventually though you do get fed up look around find the next good deal and move resetting your rent rate i have never not once in my life seen or heard of any landlord offering a drop in rent as a loyalty move to keep you from going somewhere else it 's considered part of the game retailers will price match but most service providers landlords but also utility providers expect a large amount of churn in their customer base as people shop around it averages out

i maintain a strong bias against taking on any debt of any sort and i feel it serves me well   this is not to say i would never take on a debt like a car loan mortgage or educational loan   it 's just that there is a built in bias against it    the reason that bias is good is that in my view taking on debt presents the following problems therefore the standing no debt bias that said if there is a very compelling reason to take on debt it could override the bias   the best example i know is that my mother bought a house with a mortgage when she had the cash because cds at that time were paying far more than the mortgage interest rate this was back around the 80s when cds hit an absurd 18   to not take on that debt would be refusing free money   but that 's a rare case   today cds and other guaranteed interest streams are at historical lows so this factor is really not in play

the entire time you 've talked about cost changing incomes matters little if the cost scales with it me thinks you do n't understand how a market works even a semi planned one if more people make more money the price of most goods goes up this is n't due to real actual demand its due to something called inflation when the amount of money in circulation increases we have inflation lets say i make 35k a year as a store clerk is my labor being undervalued compared to the income of a store clerk in the past or is the price of goods scaling faster than my income has scaled   simply adding more money does n't fix anything the price of the good or service is what matters the most while everyone having more money is good you ca n't just magically give everyone more money without the cost of goods and services rising i imagine that if everyone suddenly were at least a millionaire the price of a laptop would sky rocket the cost of the laptop in parts would n't be that much more but since most people would have disposable income beyond their needs some goods would then get more expensive once that happens the inflation of prices starts to spread until its effects are seen across the market   i do n't think the fruit of my labor is being stolen by the upper class if anything the fruit of my labor gets taken more and more by my own government and transferred to the lower classes more and more i 'm not rich not even close but i know i 've had at least 15k of my income in the last 5 years taken and distributed through taxes on my income to people that are generally unable to earn enough on their own   if these people are the upper class then i must be

ah i got ya i partially agree with you but it 's far more complex i think that is simplifying the debate a bit too much when people go passive you are making the assumption that they are able to stay fully invested the full time period say 30 40 years until retirement when you might change the asset allocation this is not a fair assumption because many studies on behavioral finance have shown that people 90 plus are not able to sit tight through a full market cycle and often sell out during a bear market i 'm not debating you 're point that passive often outperforms due to the fees although there are many managers that do outperform but the main issue with self managing and passive investing is people usually make emotional decisions which then hurts their long term performance this would be the reason to hire an adviser assuming that people are able to stay passive the entire time and not make a single active decision is a very unfair assumption there was a good study on this referenced in forbes article below   another issue is that there are a lot active managers that really just replicate their benchmarks and do n't actually actively manage if you look at active managers who really do have huge under weights and over weights relative to their benchmarks they actually tend to outperform them look at the study below by martin he 's one of the most highly respected researchers when it comes to investment performance research and the active vs passive debate     i guess what i 'm trying to say is that for most people having an adviser and paying them a 1 fee is usually better than going it alone where they are going to a. chase heat i bet they always choose the hottest benchmark from the past few years and b. make poor emotional decisions relating their finances

the contract should address this issue it will specify the types of remedies and damages that would result if either side tries to back out of the deal there can be monetary penalties and the courts can force the seller to complete the deal where i have experienced this it generally takes only a gentle reminder from the agent regarding the consequences there is also limited indirect protection via the contract between the seller and their real estate agent many times that contract will require the seller to pay the agent their commission if there is n't a valid reason to cancel the deal the contract was to find a fully qualified buyer the threat of having to pay 6 of list price to the agent and not selling the house can be enough to get them to complete the deal all this assumes there was fraud which could bring in criminal penalties

my experience is in the united states only in the past american express marketed its products as more exclusive and prestigious than other cards   there was an attempt to give the impression that cardholders were more qualified financially   in return fees were higher both to merchants and to cardholders   at the time early 1990 's it was not common to use credit cards for small purchases such as groceries or fast food   credit cards were used for larger purchases such as jewelry or electronics or dinner in a nicer restaurant once it became popular to use credit cards for everyday purchases the demand for customers using credit cards changed to the highest number of people instead of people of higher status   at that point visa and to a lesser extent mastercard transaction volume increased dramatically   merchants needed the largest number of customers with cards not the most financially stable   as visa volume grew and people started using visa for small purchases the use of american express decreased as their habits changed once someone got used to pulling out visa they did it in every situation   merchants are less willing to go through the extra hassle of accepting cards that are used by fewer people   over time i suspect this process led to the gap between visa and american express as a merchant in order to accept credit cards you have to set up a bank account and maintain a merchant account   accepting visa mc and discover can all be done through one account but american express has traditionally required a separate relationship as well as its own set of rules and fees that were generally higher   since there are relatively few american express cardholders compared to visa there is doubt about whether it is worth it accept the card   it depends upon the customer base   fine restaurants still generally accept american express

you read it right todd 's warning is well taken i do n't know the numbers involved but have a brilliant suggestion that may help a solo 401(k is simple to qualify for any bit of declared side income will do once the account is set up a transfer from iras is simple the solo 401(k can offer a loan provision as any other 401(k and you can borrow up to 50 max of $ 50 k for any reason with a 5 year payback the standard rate is the fee is minimal usually $ 50-$100   all the warnings of ira loans apply but the risk of job loss the largest objection to 401 loans is n't there the fact that you have 6 months to set this up is part of what prompts this suggestion   note any strategies like this are n't for everyone there are folk who need to access quick cash and this solves the issue in two ways both low rate and simple access phil already stated he is confident to return the money the only thing that prompted my answer is there 's real risk the 60 days a bit too short for any business deal

on the face of it it does n't look like a very good deal neither pension not annuity company are in it for the fun of it so they 'll take their cut from your money and then invest it anyway the rest depends on what they promise you if they just promise you market returns then i do n't see much sense to do it you can do it yourself if they promise you some pre defined average return not depending on market conditions and hope to get ahead by actually getting better return and pocket the difference then it might make sense if you are not a very proficient investor this will get you a known benefit you can count on at least if you get a company with good rating insurance etc without worrying about markets volatility and having to keep the discipline and calm when markets jump around it may be hard especially for somebody of advanced age   also there 's the part of government adding money it depends on how much of it is added is it enough to cover the extra fees

things are generally fine   a credit balance is not a horrible thing    the argument against maintaining a credit balance is that you are essentially loaning the credit card issuer money at 0 interest   you probably have alternative investments that would pay better interest so it 's usually better to park your money there   all that said it 's unlikely that the interest on whatever balance you have is enough to be more than pennies    the way that a credit card works you run up a balance in one period   then there is a grace period   if you do n't pay off the balance during the grace period they start charging you interest   you also may have a minimum payment to make   if you do n't make that payment they 'll charge you a late fee    the typical period to rack up charges is from the first to the last day of a month   the typical grace period is through the 20th or 25th of the next month   your card may be different   so check the documentation user agreement for your card if you want the real data    it sounds like you paid off some purchases while you were still in the period where you rack up charges   while those purchases were posted to the account they may not be counted in the balance calculation   if your credit balance exactly matches the payment you made that 's probably what happened   it 's also possible that you overpaid the balance   if your credit balance is just a small amount that 's probably what happened    if you really want to be sure you should call the credit card issuer and ask them   at best we can tell you how it normally works   since this is your first month you could just wait for your first bill and respond to that   so long as you pay off the entire balance shown there by the deadline everything should be fine    do n't wait until the last day to pay   it 's usually best to pay a week or so early so as to leave time for the mail to deliver the check and for them to process it   you can wait longer for an online payment but a few business days early to give you a chance to handle potential problems is still good

if the check is made out to him he will have to endorse it which means that at some point he will have to physically have the check in his hands at which point he could probably just deposit it himself if there 's some problem getting the check to him for him to sign it you could call the bank and ask if they 'll accept it for deposit to his account without a signature i understand some banks will do this i would be very surprised if they would let you deposit a check made out to your son to your account they 'd have no way of knowing if your son was agreeable to this or if you were stealing his money traditionally the person the check was made out to could endorse it give the check to someone else and then the second person could endorse it and deposit it to their the second person 's account that is the endorsement would have your son 's signature and below that your signature but i understand some banks wo n't accept this any more so you 'd be best to check before trying it

in the short term this question is pretty simple are occasional use grid scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators   home solar is an amazingly good deal now economically the question is n't whether it 'll take over most home power generation it 's how fast that will happen   currently at least where i live the grid is still a good deal for backup power if that changes then people will stop using it   you can get a gas generator to cover a normal sized home installed for in places with gas the price for running the generator looks comparable to grid power per kwh   so no i would n't pay triple the price for grid power or buy a ton of extra storage i 'd get a natural gas generator and handle solar downtime locally

as noted in 's comment buried in the comments debate on the other answer and all credit for this answer should be due to him a significant issue with the scheme as originally in the question up to £ 11 k pa is that there is actually a cap on the maintenance part for over 60s on page 28 of this student finance how you 're assessed and paid document it says if you 're 60 or over on the first day of the first academic year of    your course you can apply for a maintenance loan of up to £    depending on your household income your loan will be reduced by £ 1    for every £ of household income over £ 25,000 up to £ if    your household income is more than this you wo n't get any maintenance    loan i 'd consider that to make this route considerably less attractive and maybe that 's the intention of the rule   although i might not think that was so true if i was actually on the uk 's state pension of £ 6 k a year and desperate   however i was originally thinking more in terms of comparing the accumulated free money over the three years with the uk 's average and woefully inadequate pension pot of £ 50 k rather than with income i 'll leave those who found the idea of exploiting government incentives so outrageous to ponder the at least as troubling ethics of discriminating against people based on their age especially when that government apparently likes the idea of older people retraining just to complicate things i note that one of the possible criteria for applying for a special support grant an alternative to a maintenance loan is being over 60   that 's a grant not a loan and does n't have to be repaid but abusing that would seem even to me to be on a par with faking disability to get benefits or similar

my doubt is whether bank of india gives any explicit incentives to banks to offer cheaper home loans currently no in the past loan against gold was considered priority sector lending loans to poor and agriculture etc every bank need to lead around 25 to priority sector hence quite a few banks gave loans relatively cheaper to todays rate rather than giving it as farm loan that almost never get recovered it is no longer the case now as loan against gold is not considered priority lending if it were just demand supply i feel that gold loans should have been cheaper   it is demand and supply there are quite a few reasons for this

you ca nt there is the risk that between the time you get the check and the time you get to the bank that you will be murdered have a heart attack stroke or too   and they are probably more likely than the bank going out of business between the time you deposit the money and get access to it prior to accepting the check i would do the following get a lawyer that specializes in finance and tax law   there are some steps you can take to minimize your tax exposure   there is little you can do about the immediate tax on the winnings but there are things you can do to maximize the return of your money     you will want to do what you can to protect that money for yourself and your family   also create or revise your will   this is a lot of money and if something happens to you people from your family and friends will come out of the woodwork trying to claim your money   make sure your money goes where you want it to in the event something happens to you get a financial planner   this money can either make you or break you   if you plan for success you will succeed   if you trust yourself to make good decisions with out a plan in a few years you will be broke and wondering what happened to your money even at 1 at dollars that is 200k a year in interest a pretty good income by itself   you do not have to save every penny but you can plan for a nice lifestyle that will last if you plan and stick to your plan do research and know what bank you are going to deposit the money in   talk to the bank let them know of your plans so they can be ready for it   it is not every day that they get a 20 million dollar deposit   they will need to make plans to handle it   if you are going to spread the money out among several banks they can prepare for that too when choosing that bank i would look for one where their holdings are significantly more than you are depositing   i would not really go with one of the banks that was rescued   they have already shown that they can not handle large sums of money and assuming they will not screw it up with my money is not something i would be comfortable with   there were some nice sized banks that did not need a bail out   i would choose one of them

value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time not the amount of contributions   so you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets shares etc and some cash you start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow   perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8 growth rate is reasonable   or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that if in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path you would put more money into it possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account   on the other hand if the share component is growing too fast you would put all your additional savings into cash   so if your investments are doing well you 're not supposed to spend the excess money but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall in theory this has the auto benefit of dollar cost averaging but even better when prices are high you 'll automatically buy fewer shares or even sell some conversely when prices are low you 'll buy extra shares from your reserve account if it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3 you 'll end up with an entirely share portfolio and a ride than you might have liked   if you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash which has happened though not yet in the usa then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio the original book value averaging by has a pretty good explanation of various cases though i would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail i have not implemented this myself one reason being that the amount i 'm able to save from year to year varies as it probably does for you and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes   you could still do it i suppose i think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market 's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average

when you refinance there is cost guess around $ to cover lawyers paperwork surveys deed insurance etc etc etc someone has to pay that cost and in the end it will be you even if you get a no points no cost loan the cost is going to be hidden in the interest rate that 's the way transactions with knowledgeable companies works they do business because they benefit profit from it the expectation is that what they need is different from what you need so that each of you benefits but when it 's a primarily cash transaction you ca n't both end up with more money so unless value will be created somewhere else from the process and do n't include the + cash because that ends up tacked onto the principle this seems like paying for financial entertainment and there are better ways to do that

first i do n't think your parents are ripping you off but you should get your agreement in writing the fact that you never own more than 25 does n't matter if the condo 's value is increasing you are in fact building equity your share of the equity just does n't increase but it does n't decrease either for example if the condo is worth $ 300,000 now you have $ 75,000 in equity of course if the value is decreasing so is your equity if you are paying $ 500/month in interest as op clarified above and you do n't have a written agreement you are probably unable to claim that payment as mortgage interest if you itemize your deductions on u.s. federal or state tax returns thus you may be losing out on a legal tax deduction assuming you earn enough to itemize they will need to give you each year the proper irs form for mortgage interest form 1098 and they have to claim the $ 500/month as interest income on their tax returns having a written and signed contract eliminates confusion and potential for misunderstanding the future and it sounds like you are already experiencing some doubt and confusion now your rate seems within market rates for an interest only loan let 's say you wanted to buy out your parents share of the condo right now would you pay $ 115,000 or would you have to get an appraisal to find out what the condo is worth now if you ca n't answer that question you need to get that in writing so that you wo n't have an argument over it someday if the condo has appreciated significantly and all you have to pay is the $ 115,000 then that 's a sweet deal for you because you 'd be buying out a much more valuable property for much less than it 's worth if that is the agreement and the property is appreciating no guarantee especially with condos then you are essentially building equity if the property is declining in value and you do wish to sell it then you wo n't have to pay $ 115,000 they 'll just end up with their 75 share which will be less than the $ 115 k they invested both of you would lose some of your investment but you would have had all the benefits of living in a nice condo all those years and they would n't they are definitely taking more risk than you are second if you had $ 40,000 cash saved up your parents probably raised you with some good financial sense and work ethic so i 'm optimistic they have good intentions for your future operate from that frame of mind when you go to ask for a written agreement next read up about equity share agreements there are many models that will help inform your decisions but you should engage a real estate lawyer to help you draw up a fair agreement for both parties   i was in an equity share agreement for my first townhouse it 's a common practice and it wo n't cost all that much to get one created it 's worth the money to get it done properly

keep in mind the ex dividend date is different from the payable date the day the dividend is paid that means the market price will already have adjusted lower due to the dividend short answer you get the lower price when reinvesting so here 's vanguard 's policy it should be similar to most brokers when reinvesting dividends vanguard brokerage services combines the    cash distributions from the accounts of all clients who have requested    reinvestment in the same security and then uses that combined total    to purchase additional shares of the security in the open market    vanguard brokerage will attempt to purchase the reinvestment shares by    entering a market order at the market opening on the payable date the    new shares are divided proportionately among the clients accounts in    whole and fractional shares rounded to three decimal places if the    total purchase ca n't be completed in one trade clients will receive    shares purchased at the weighted average price paid by vanguard    brokerage services

a market maker is someone that is contractually bound by the exchange to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume e.g. 5000 shares a single market maker usually covers many stocks and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers the nyse has specialists that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock and usually a single issue on the nyse is covered by only one market maker   market makers are often middlemen between brokers ignoring stuff like dark pools and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange   historically the market makers gave up buy sell discretion in exchange for being the go to guys for anyone wanting to trade in that stock when you told your broker to buy a stock for you he did n't hook you up with another retail investor he went to the market maker market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security they were like other floor traders they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialist 's issues there was no public order book just ticker tape and a quote it was up to the market maker to maintain that order book   since they are effectively forbidden from being one sided traders in a security their profit comes from the bid ask spread being the counter party to almost every trade they 'd make profit from always selling above where they were buying except when the price moved quickly the downside to this arrangement the spread goes to the market maker is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker with the switch to ecns the role of the market maker has changed for example forex trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers on ecns the invisible anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker still performing his traditional role yet brokers can interact directly with each other now rather than relying on the market maker 's book with modern online investing and public order books retail investors might even be trading directly with each other market makers are still out there in part they perform a service sold by an exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange that service has changed to helping volatility during normal high volatility periods such as at open and close

i do n't have a reference but i think it depends on when you entered the workforce if you finished school at age 24 your primary goals are to pay down expensive debt and to save up enough for a down payment   so essentially not much   maybe $ 5k to $ 10k at the most on the other hand if you entered the workforce at age 20 with no debts and no significant expenses it should have been easy to sock away 20 of your income for 6 years so $ 40k to $ 50k would be reasonable the difference is that the first person 's income earning potential should be higher so eventually they 'd be able to make up the difference and pass them

if by being a millionaire you mean dollar millionaire then i doubt that it is really that easy in pakistani context at present the exchange rate is 107 pakistani rupees per us dollar so even with this exchange rate to have a million us dollars means having 107 million rupees of wealth now with this maths in mind you can very well calculate how much possible it is for an average 25 years old pakistani to have that much wealth and by the time you have 107 million pakistani rupees of wealth the exchange rate against the us dollar would have only gone up against pakistani currency that article which you have mentioned makes calculations in us context and dollar terms however if you talk only in terms of your country 's context then being a millionaire means having 1 million rupees of wealth and that is something which is quite achievable with your salary and within very short span of time

if you 're truly ready to pay an extra $ 1000 every month and are confident you 'll likely always be able to you should refinance to a 15 year mortgage 15 year mortgages are typically sold at around a half a point lower interest rates meaning that instead of your apr you 'll get something like apr   that 's a lot of money over the course of the mortgage   you 'll end up paying around a thousand a month more so exactly what you 're thinking of doing and not only save money from that earlier payment but also have a lower interest rate   that 0.5 means something like $ 25k less over the life of the mortgage   it 's also the difference in about $ 130 or so a month in your required payment now of course you 'll be locked into making that larger payment so the difference between what you 're suggesting and this is that you 're paying an extra $ 25k in exchange for the ability to pay it off more slowly in which case you 'd also pay more interest obviously but in the best case scenario   in the 15 year scenario you must make those payments   in the 30 year scenario you can pay for a while if you lose your job or want to go on vacation or whatever of course the reverse is also true you 'll have to make the payments so you will   many people find enforced savings to be a good strategy myself among them i have a 15 year mortgage and am happy that i have to make the higher payment because it means i ca n't spend that extra money frivolously so what i 'd do if i were you is shop around for a 15 year refi   it 'll cost a few grand so do n't take one unless you can save at least half a point but if you can do

the appropriate structure for an organization depends largely on the size of the firm smaller firms can employ some non traditional more easily i.e. flat design whereas the same structures are more difficult to use in mid size and large companies the most important pieces of any corporate structure are 1 clarity of roles 2 accountability and 3 ease of communication   firstly everyone in the organization must have clarity of their own role and how it fits into the bigger picture that means a structure that is easy to understand and a comprehension of how all the roles tie in to each other    secondly a good structure will enable and empower leadership to hold the team accountable and be held accountable in turn what is often misunderstood about accountability is that people often assume that it simply means punishing poor behavior when something breaks down in reality that 's holding people responsible not accountable accountability is something that is self driven and is a product of sound relationships and transparency as an example one of the most common breakdowns in accountability is found in passive non this is when you may reach out to a business partner for help or an update but they simply do not reply as in email text or    thirdly the structure should be such that it is easy for individuals to communicate across and up down the chain this does n't mean that if you send an email communication is easy rather who do i reach out to for this problem what are the best practices or agreed upon methodologies for a certain practice and how does the team know this some of this should be codified in the form of standard operating procedures which can be referenced at any time many companies use a playbook which is a high level reference guide on how to operate the business an example is found here a playbook can be anything from a pdf to an interactive website like the aforementioned link it should always have the most up to date information   most companies will change their structure over time as their environment both internal and external change and they need to adapt for example a small firm may not need an hr department but as it employs more and more people a need to have someone or an entire team focused on human capital management rises quickly an owner operator can handle only so much before it is time to scale up   the most important thing to consider is who you hire people are the largest expense to an organization and having the right people in the right roles is the best way to avoid unnecessary incremental costs resulting from inefficiency fraud or risky behavior always look for the personality traits that make a good employee relative to the role i.e. customer service finance integrity operations teamwork   one of the most obvious parts of a business as it scales up is specialization you want to find a balance though for example hr handles all human relations issues while legal handles all internal claims suits and patents there is an overlap that occurs here as internal claims often start as human relations issues which means you must have healthy communication and clear accountability for an appropriate hand off so legal takes a claim at the right point in time while this example may be a little obvious many times the edges are blurred and clarity of role can be difficult   i hope that helps reach out with any follow up questions

you might convert all your money in local currency but you need take care of following tips while studying abroad here are some money tips that can be useful during a trip abroad know about fees when you use a debit card or credit card in a foreign country there are generally two types of transaction fees that may apply understand exchange rates the exchange rate lets you know the amount of nearby money you can get for each u.s. dollar missing any expenses there are sell rates for individuals who are trading u.s. dollars for foreign currency and the other way around purchase rates it 's a smart thought to recognize what the neighborhood money is worth in dollars so you can comprehend the estimation of your buys abroad   sites like x rates offer a currency converter that gives the current exchange rate so you can make speedy comparisons you can utilize it to get a feel for how much certain amount say $ 1 $ 10 $ 25 $ 50 $ 100 are worth in local currency remember that rates fluctuate so you will be unable to suspect precisely the amount of a buy made in a foreign currency will cost you in u.s. dollars to get cash check for buddy banks if you already have an account with a large bank or credit union in the u.s. you may have an advantage   being a client of a big financial institution with a large atm system may make it easier to find a subsidiary cash machine and stay away from an out of system charge   bank of america for example is a part of the global atm alliance which lets clients of taking an interest banks use their debit cards to withdraw money at any alliance atm without paying the machine 's operator an access fee in spite of the fact that you may at present be charged for converting dollars into local currency used for purchases   citibank is another well known bank for travelers because it has 45,000 atms in more than 30 countries including popular study abroad destinations such as the u.k. italy and spain atms in a foreign country may allow withdrawals just from a financial records and not from savings so make sure to keep an adequate checking balance also atm withdrawal limits will apply just as they do in the u.s. but the amount may vary based on the local currency and exchange rates weigh the benefits of other banks for general needs online banks and even foreign banks can also be good options   with online banks you do n’t have to visit physical branches and these institutions typically have lower fees use our checking account tool to find one that ’s a good fit foreign many american debit cards may not work in europe asia and latin america especially those that do n’t have an emv chip that help prevent fraud or some cards may work at one atm but not another one option for students who expect a more extended stay in a foreign country is to open a new account at a local bank this will let you have better access to atms and to make purchases more easily and without as many fees see our chart below for the names of the largest banks in several countries guard against fraud and identity one of the most important things you can do as you plan your trip is to let your bank know that you ’ll be abroad include exact countries and dates when possible to avoid having your card flagged for fraud unfortunately incidents may still arise despite providing ample warning to your bank bring a backup credit card or debit card so you can still access some sort of money in case one is canceled are also critical not just for traveling from place to place but also as identification to open a bank account and for everyday purposes you ’ll want to make two and give one to a friend or family member to keep at home and put the other in a separate secure location just in case your actual passport is lost or stolen

you 're probably not going to be able to get a loan from any kind of bank if your credit is bad on top of bad credit if you do n't own a home or car that only decreases your chances of getting a loan on top of all this you do n't have a job i do n't mean to be blunt but i do n't see any way you could get a loan from a bank of any kind also what makes this business a good investment have you read over the business plan have you looked over financials to see what your investment would be helping with are you familiar with the legality of the business and make sure they have proper documentation there 's no guarantees in business and you saying there 's all this free money out there is honestly not true do your homework do n't just throw your money into something because there is free money also money and friends is not kosher at all i would not suggest borrowing that kind of money from anyone close to you one last question will you be a part owner in this business if you invest this kind of money

inflation is theft   it is caused when banks lend money that someone deposited but still has claim to called fractional reserve banking    on top of that the federal reserve bank in the us or the central bank of the currency i.e. bank of japan european central bank etc can increase the monetary base by writing checks out of thin air to purchase debt such as us treasury bonds inflation is not a natural phenomenon it is completely man made and is caused solely by the two methods above inflation causes the business cycle   lower interest rates caused by inflation cause long term investment even while savings is actually low and consumption is high   this causes prices to rise rapidly the boom and eventually when the realization is made that the savings is not there to consume the products of the investment you get the bust i would encourage you to read or listen to the case against the fed by murray n. great book free online or via itunes

it 's not possible to determine whether you can expect a refund or whether you are claiming the right number of exemptions from the information given    if your wife were not working and you did not do independent contracting then the answer would be much simpler   however in this case we must also factor in how much your contracting brings in since you must pay income tax on that as well as medicare and probably social security whether you are filing jointly or separately and your wife 's income from her business    there are also other factors such as whether you 'll be claiming certain child care expenses and certain tax credits which may phase out depending on your income    if you can accurately estimate your total household income for the year and separate that into income from wages contracting and your wife 's business as well as your expenses for things like state and local income and property taxes then you can make a very reasonable estimate about your total tax burden including the self employment taxes on your non wage income and then determine whether you are having enough tax withheld from your paycheck   some people may find that they should have additional tax withheld to compensate for these expenses see irs w-4 line 6

do mutual funds edit underperforming investments to make their    returns look better and if so is there any way one can figure out if    they are doing it no that 's not what the quote says what the quote says is that the funds routinely drop investments that do not bring the expected return which is true that 's their job that is what is called active management obviously if you 're measuring the fund by their success failure to beat the market to beat the market the funds must consistently select over performers no one claims that they only select over performers but they select enough of them or not for the average returns to be appealing or not for the investors

first thing to note is that contributions i.e. the total of all the amounts that you directly contributed into roth ira at any point in time to a roth ira can be withdrawn at any time without needing any reason without any tax or penalty early withdrawal early because you are under 59.5 of earnings on the other hand will incur tax and penalty i did n't go into withdrawal of conversions as those are a little more complex when you withdraw contributions come out first so as long as you do n't withdraw more than the amount of past contributions you wo n't have any tax or penalty and if it 's not going to have tax it does n't really matter if you do it this year or next year if you need to dip into the earnings however then maybe it would be better to do this year so it will be taxed at lower rates

securities clearing and settlement is a complex topic you can start by browsing relevant wikipedia articles and given sufficient quantities of and strong coffee progress to entire technical books you 're correct modern trade settlement systems are electronic and heavily streamlined   however you 're never going to see people hand over assets until they 're sure that payment has cleared given current payment systems that means the fastest settlement time is going to be the next business day so called t+1 settlement which is what 's seen for heavily standardized instruments like standard options and government debt securities stocks present bigger obstacles   first the seller has to locate the asset being sold make sure they have clear title to it which is tougher than it might seem given the layers of abstraction virtualization involved in the chain of ownership custody complicated in particular by involved in stock borrowing lending for short sales especially since stock borrow lending record keeping tends to be somewhat cf periodic about naked shorting and failure to deliver second the seller has to determine what exactly it is that they have sold which again can be tougher than it might seem   you see stocks are subject to all kinds of corporate actions e.g. cash distributions spin offs splits liquidations   a particular topic of keen interest is who exactly is entitled to large cash distributions the buyer or the seller   depending on the cutoff date the ex dividend date the seller may need to deliver to the buyer just the shares of stock or the shares plus a big chunk of cash a significant difference in settlement   determining the precise ex dividend date and so what exactly are the assets to be settled can sometimes be very difficult it 's usually except in the case of large distributions which are usually t+1 unless the regulatory authority has neglected to declare an ex dividend date in which case it defaults to standard dtc payment policy i.e. i 've been involved in a few situations where the brokers involved were clueless and full settlement of due bills for cash distributions to the buyer took several months of hard arguing so yeah the brokers want a little time to get their records in order and settle the trade correctly

i have researched this question extensively in previous years as we have notoriously high taxes in california while neighboring a state that has zero corporate income tax and personal income tax many have attempted pull a fast one on the california taxation authorities the franchise tax board by incorporating in nevada or attempting to declare full year residence in the silver state this is basically just asking for an audit however   california religiously examines taxpayers with any evidence of having presence in california if they deem you to be a resident in california and they likely will based on the fact that you live in california physical presence you will be subject to taxation on   your worldwide income you could incorporate in nevada or bangladesh and california will still levy its taxation on any business income single member llcs are disregarded as separate corporate entities but still taxed at ordinary income rates on the personal income tax basis to make things worse if california examines your single member llc and finds that it is doing business in california based on the fact that its sole owner is based in california all year long you could feasibly end up with additional penalties for having neglected to file your llc in california california llcs are considered domestic and only file in california unless they wish to do business in other states nevada llcs are considered foreign to california requiring the owner to file a domestic llc organization in nevada and then a foreign llc organization in california which still gets hit with the minimum $ 800 franchise fee because it is a foreign llc doing business in california   evading any filing responsibility in california is not advisable ftb consistently researches llcs s corporations and the like to determine whether they 've been organized out of state but still principally operated in california thus having a tax nexus with california and the subsequent requirement to be filed in california and taxed by california no one likes paying taxes and no one wants to get hit with franchise fees especially when one is starting a new venture and that minimum $ 800 assessment seems excessive in other words you could have a company that earns nothing zero zip nada and still has to pay the $ 800 minimum fee but the consequences of tax laws and filing requirements will make the franchise fee seem trivial in comparison   if you 're committed to living in california and desire to organize an llc or s corp you must file with the state of california either as a domestic corporation llc or foreign corporation llc doing business in california the only alternatives are being a sole proprietor unincorporated or leaving the state of california altogether not what you wanted to hear i 'm sure but that 's the law

once wealth accumulates in the hands of a few they 're less likely to spend it as opposed to when there 's smaller amounts of wealth in the hands of many that 's one of the primary arguments for more economic equality   you then also have the case of that wealth being used to generate more wealth without really adding anything of value employing hedge fund managers bankers lawyers and accountants to manage large amounts of that wealth in order to use it to generate more wealth sometimes in ways that does n't benefit society at all and sometimes even to its detriment toxic assets tax evasion etc    overall this has the effect of weakening the economy at the very least inhibiting its growth and i do n't possibly see how you could argue that a weaker economy benefits anyone especially those in the best position to take advantage of the goods produced by a stronger economy the wealthy a stronger economy means more and better goods on the market that the rich can then benefit from i do n't think the luxury goods market would go anywhere either and may even allow it to grow because of the people who are just under the wealthiest would get richer with more equality remember it 's only the top 10 who benefit from the current massive inequality

you 're right things can get a little out of hand on reddit the prior post is gone now so i ca n't really remember but the gist of what i meant earlier was that your logic did n't line up in that the price of a stock is indicative of it 's value but does n't equate to it 's value the price is a combination of the perceived intrinsic valuation of the company as well as sentiment the price can go up if people are buying but it does n't necessarily mean the company 's value or financial conditions are improving though it can it 's a common trap to fall into and can lead one to ignore for example revenues falling or other metrics deteriorating merely because the stock price continues up so it must be getting better and better   sorry not a very coherent response if you 're unsure feel free to pm me

are you talking about a country besides the us   and you 're talking about a commercial bank right   in the us banks do n't buy gold from consumers   the last time they sort of did in the early 1900s they were trading gold coins for gold certificates and then they later stopped allowing consumers to trade them back   this is known by a well known financial term gotcha suckers if someone were naive enough to deposit a $ 50 gold american eagle today in a bank the depositor will get a credit of $ 50 on their account and later some clever person will ask the teller if they have any strange money lying around and that lucky person will be able to withdraw a $ coin for $ 50 if it lasted for even a second in the teller 's drawer but let 's say you 're going to a place that does indeed still buy gold coins the discount depends on the type of coin and the type of damage   an old collectible coin has a part of its value set by the gold value and part by the collector 's premium   better command better collector 's premiums so a damaged coin as long as it is n't a chunk of the coin missing wo n't be worth less than the melt value   you may not get that much from a dealer but it should be fairly close   if part of the coin is missing then the person buying it should weigh the coin and adjust the price proportionately   it 's likely though that if you have the items in a safe you may have a or of gold but it should still all be there unless someone takes it   gold at about 1850 degrees but it would take half the surface temperature of the sun for it to boil away   if it 's it may need to be again

with the information you have given i would say never remember the banker is a salesman and the line of credit is the product if you do n't need to borrow the money for something specific then you do n't need the line of credit in the first place even if you did need something i would tell you to save up and pay cash for it on the tax advantage there is none in the us you can deduct your mortgage interest on your taxes but it 's not a tax credit it 's a tax deductions let me explain further you spend $ 10,000 on mortgage interest and you 're in the 25 tax bracket you send the bank $ 10,000 in return you get at tax savings of $ 2500 you are still in the hole $ 7500 you would have been better off not taking out the loan in the first place on the emergency fund you should have 3 6 months of expenses in cash like a money market account   this money is n't for investing it 's like insurance and you do n't make money on insurance the last thing you want to do is have to go into debt right in the middle of an emergency say you lost your job the last thing you would want to do is borrow money right at the time you have no income to pay it back the bank is under no obligation to maintain you credit limit and can without notice reduce it they can in most cases call the loan balance due in full with little or no notice as well both of those are likely scenarios if the bank were to become aware of the fact that you were unemployed

wikipedia says the canadian securities course csc offered by the canadian securities institute csi is the initial course required for becoming licensed to work within the canadian securities industry outside quebec as a securities dealer or securities agent securities course canada adds you require it and further courses for other jobs in the investment industry generally some work experience is also required all of this is governed by various self regulatory agencies the material in the course is strong on money making products and fairly weak on material that would actually protect a consumer from harm passing the course is very little indication that you understand what 's important about investing for example you wo n't be taught much of anything about the theory of investment or the markets or things like the efficient market hypothesis on the csc so it appears that the csc is necessary to work as certain types of financial agencies that being said i doubt it will be enough to get your foot in the door this seems more like a prerequisite rather than a true qualification so you 'll be competing with mbas finance students and other people who either have experience or training in the financial industry i 'd recommend you look into the chartered financial analyst cfa certification as that will provide you with a rigorous knowledge of financial theory as well as asset management which seems more appropriate for what you 'd like to do from there you 'll have to network like crazy and leverage your experience to get in at a canadian financial firm and eventually wealth management so yes i suppose a csc is a good first step but more will certainly be required and i doubt it will be enough to land you a full time position   another important factor is age nobody expects undergrads to have extensive certifications or experience but it 's harder for a 35 year old to enter a new industry especially finance

probably a big fat no update re this edit note i 'm not suggesting that i melt the coins i 'm just suggesting that i hold onto the nickels and sell them later when they are worth more than 5 cents for example you can sell coins with silver in them for far above their face value this is silly as an investment   right up there with stockpiling cars    the increase in value will likely never be enough to make the cost hassle of storage worth it   as mrchrister states it is a fine idea as a collection but not as a stockpile edit from the comments i am surprised i did not onto this in the previous update   silver is considered a previous metal nickel and copper are not   btw the u.s. nickel is 25 nickel and 75 copper also how in the world do you plan on actually selling a stockpile of nickels

tl dr version of my answer in view of your age and the fact that you have just opened a roth ira account with vanguard choose the reinvest dividend and capital gains distributions option if vanguard is offering an option of having earnings put into a money market settlement account it might be that you have opened your roth ira account with vanguard 's brokerage firm are you doing things like investing your roth money into cds or bonds including zero coupon or strip bonds or individual stocks if so then the money market settlement account might be the vanguard prime money market fund within the roth ira account is where all the money earned as interest on the cds or bonds dividends from the stocks and the proceeds including any resulting capital gains from the sales of any of these will go you can then decide where to invest that money all within the roth ira leaving the money in the settlement account for a long time is not a good idea even if you are just accumulating the money so as to be able to buy 100 shares of appl or goog at some time in the future put it into a cd in your roth ira brokerage account while you wait if your roth ira is invested only in vanguard 's mutual funds and is likely to remain so in the foreseeable future then you do n't really need an account with their brokerage you can still use a money market settlement fund to transfer money between various mutual fund investments within the roth ira account but it really is adding an extra layer of money movement where it is not really necessary you can sell one vanguard mutual fund and invest the proceeds into another vanguard mutual fund or even into several vanguard funds without needing to have the funds transit through a money market account   vanguard calls such a transaction an exchange on their site and of course you can just choose to reinvest all the dividends and capital gains distributions made by a mutual fund into the fund itself mutual funds allow purchases of fractional shares down to three or even four decimal places instead of insisting on integer numbers of shares let alone round lots of 100 shares all this of course within the roth ira

i 'm hopeful that opinion based answers are acceptable in this context i 've been using ynab classic for some years i 've tried to keep all possible options open in the manner of individual items for budget allocation there does seem to be a number of emergency situations for which one would prefer to not dig into regular scheduled expenses having a large number of smaller funds give you flexibility in terms of categorizing your past emergencies this gives you a better view of future allocation of your funds perhaps freeing up money you might not have otherwise identified if you are using a program such as ynab classic i 'm not familiar with the current version you can easily transfer funds from one category to another as needed after all it 's merely numbers in a file not real money that would be otherwise inaccessible to summarize i think the smaller fund concept provides a better picture the big picture of the small stuff means greater flexibility and forecasting prior to the world of personal computers i had a piece of paper in my wallet it had every category i could devise representing every penny in my checking account and eventually grew into ynab but the concept remained the same all these decades

i 'm going to give a simpler answer than some of the others although somewhat more limited the complicated loan parameters you describe benefit the lender   i 'll focus on this part of your question you should be able to pay back whenever what 's the point of an arbitrary timeline here you refers to the borrower   sure yes it would be great for the borrower to be able to do whatever they want whenever they want increasing or decreasing the loan balance by paying or not paying arbitrary amounts at their whim   but it does n't benefit the lender to let the borrower do this   adding various kinds of restrictions and extra conditions to the loan reduces the lender 's uncertainty about when they 'll be receiving money and also gives them a greater range of legal recourse to get it sooner since they can pursue the borrower right away if they violate any of the conditions rather than having the wait until they die without having paid their debt then you say and if you want you can set a legal deadline but the mere deadline in the contract does n't affect how much interest is paid the interest is only affected by how much money is borrowed and how long has passed i think in many cases that is in fact how it works or at least it is more how it works than you seem to think   for instance you can take out a 30-year loan but pay it off in less than 30 years and the amount you pay will be less if you pay it off sooner   however in some cases the lender will charge you a penalty for doing so   the reason is the same as above if you pay off the loan sooner you are paying less interest which is worse for the lender   again it would be nice for the borrower if they could just pay it off sooner with no penalty but the lender has no reason to let them do so i think there are in fact other explanations for these more complicated loan terms that do benefit the borrower   for instance an amortization schedule with clearly defined monthly payments and proportions going to interest and principal also reduces the borrower 's uncertainty and makes them less likely to do risky things like skip lots of payments intending to make it up later   it gives them a clear number to budget from   but even aside from all that i think the clearest answer to your question is what i said above in general it benefits the lender to attach conditions and parameters to loans in order to have many opportunities to penalize the borrower for making it hard for the lender to predict their cash flow

i will use 10 of this 20 k to pay the loan back on an annual basis agreement an annual payment of 0.8 $ 2,000 $ 250,000 is nowhere near large enough   the interest alone is going to be well over $ 10,000 and probably closer to $ 20,000 on an unsecured loan so you need to plan for at least a $ 20,000 $ 30,000 annual payment depending on the terms length and interest rate on the loan    but in general is this sustainable safe   essentially what you are doing is using leverage to increase the amount you can invest   while this is fantastic when the market rises it can go horribly wrong when the market goes down   generally it is unwise to fund a risky meaning there are large swings in return investment with a risk free meaning you 'll always make a payment loan if you want to see what could happen forecast a 20 market drop and see what you are left with obviously you 'll need to make the loan payment out of your balance since you wo n't have any gains to pull from   an average of 10 12 over a long period of time is reasonable but the variance can cause the return to be anywhere from to + 40 in one year   can you afford those losses    here 's an actual example if you were to invest $ 250,000 in the s&p 500 in january 2000 with an 8 interest only loan your next three years returns would be after three years assuming an interest only payment of $ 20,000 your balance would be just over $ 100,000 you 'd still owe $ 250,000 and you 'd still be making $ 20,000 in interest payments   if your loan interest rate was 25 which is not unreasonable for an unsecured loan you 'd be bankrupt after 3 years you 'd still owe $ 250 k but could not make the interest payment no this is not a good idea   the only time you should borrow money to invest in when you have control over the returns   so if you wanted to start your own business had a stable business plan and had much more certainty over the returns the borrowing money might be plausible    but borrowing money to do passive investment is a huge mistake

as someone who works in tech and has seen a thing or two the fallacy of moving to college towns to foster innovation is a farce the whole reason businesses do this is to get an endless supply of cheap labor from new graduates who do n't have families thus will work nights and weekends for free to make a name for themselves once those kids wise up and maybe want to start a family they move to suburbs away from these college towns and leave those companies which leads to high attrition rates for mid level employees this also leads to inferior products from a high technology standpoint because of lack of senior mentors and you end up with shit projects just slapped together that just barely work would you want your ge jet engines designed on the cheap by recent graduates or disciplined engineers i 'm not saying it 's a bad business decision it is totally valid and smart for some markets but it seems like ge has their hands in important technology that should n't be designed like this if they want to reinvent themselves why not make a boston technology center for innovation not move their whole business it just did n't make sense

# 224062
this depends in part on the bank holding your loan and the loan agreement   some loans will accept partial payments and apply them immediately some will not accept partial payments at all and some will accept the payment but hold the funds until the payment is at least your complete payment   you should check your loan agreement to find out how the payment will be processed as well as how it will be applied it also is relevant how interest is calculated and accrued if your interest is a daily rate then you may save some money this way but if it 's a monthly rate then you would n't necessarily   either way you would n't really save very much money in your particular case you 'd be saving $ 0.15 per month = .001 interest rate $ 150 paid halfway through the month means you pay .001 150 less interest   is that $ 0.15 worth it   up to you i guess   if you 're paying that for 5 year loan you 'll end up ahead $ 9 at the end of it finally there is a kind of program often offered to new mortgage holders where you pay every two weeks like your paycheck and thus pay down your mortgage faster by saving on interest which is true but it 's because you make 26 half payments per year instead of 12 full or 24 half payments not primarily because of particular savings on interest due to timing and of course the program has to make money somewhere   paying an extra each year is certainly a good way to pay off your loan faster but it 's not primarily due to the frequency of those payments

excellent observation the short answer is that you do n't own the firm you own the right to your share of the profits or losses for the period that you worked there   technically you also have the right to vote to sell or the company known as    the workers at equal exchange voted in a clause to our bylaws to prevent this basically a poison pill it says that if we ever sold the company we have to pay off any debts return any investments at the price paid and give away any remaining assets to another company dedicated to fair trade the effect is that there is no incentive for us to sell the company so we do n't worry about all the kinds of things you would if you were focused on an exit strategy but in this sense ownership is even more compromised right    back to your question i think the answer is it depends on what you mean by ownership it is certainly not ownership in the conventional sense i think of it more like a we are of the enterprise while we have the benefits given to active workers but we have a responsibility not just to maximize our own well being but that of the other stakeholders our suppliers consumers investors our communities the environment etc including the people who worked there before and left part of the profits in the company as retained earnings and those that will come after us

there will be no police involved the police do not care only the feds care and they only care about large amounts over $ 100,000 what will happen is that the teller will deposit the money like nothing is unusual but the amount will trigger a suspicious transaction report to be filed by the bank this information goes to the us treasury and is then circulated by the treasury to basically every agency in the government the department of defense the fbi the nsa the cia the the irs etc what happens next depends on your relationship with your bank and the personality of the bank in my case i have made large cash transactions at two different banks one that i had a long relationship with and another that i had a long standing but dormant account the long term one was a high end savings bank in a city the dormant one was one of those retail banks think citizens or bank of america in a suburb the long term bank ignored my first deposit but after i made some more including one over $ 50,000 in cash they me via a letter i went in talked to the branch manager and explained why i was making the deposits he said that sounds plausible and that was the end of the interview it is unlikely that they transferred the information they probably just wrote it down they did this because they have know your customer regulations and they wanted to be able to prove that they did due diligence in case anybody asked about it later the suburban bank never asked any questions but they did file the in general there is no way to know if the bank will interview you or not it depends on a lot of different factors the basic factors are how much money is it are you doing a lot of business normally and how well does the bank know you if you refuse to answer the bank 's questions to their satisfaction it is a 100 chance that they will close your account they can also file higher level reports that flag your activity as highly suspicious as opposed to just the normal suspicious as long as it is a bank employee you should have no serious concerns unless the guy seems strange and asks really pointed questions if you have any question whether the employee is legitimate just verify that he she is a bank employee obviously if the feds visit you you should say nothing the chance of this happening is 1 in a million

cd laddering is funding a few cds in succession for instance for 6 months each month you open up a 6 month cd rather than   opening up one big one doing this will give you monthly interest payments as each month a cd will reach maturity after 6 months at that time you can choose to roll over the principal in a new cd and keep the interest reinvest all etc etc etc you still get the benefits higher rates that cds offer but with greater flexibility and more frequent interest payouts the only downside that i 'm aware off is that you may end up with a slightly lower overall interest rate

gt;because something is legal does n't make it the ethical choice   you fail to demonstrate what is unethical about minimizing tax burdens    making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region   did the corporations have an option to refuse using that infrastructure and instead provide their own or work with others to develop a competing infrastructure    in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind   you have failed to support any argument that there is anything wrong with minimizing tax burden   gt;if i 'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $ 100 bill without noticing i can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally but its hardly the moral thing to do   a more relevant example is if i order a pizza have it sent to your house then show up later with a bill for the pizza and my costs to send it to you demanding you pay it you never asked for the pizza maybe you did n't want the pizza maybe you did n't eat the pizza maybe you do n't like pizza or do n't like that kind of pizza that i choose to send you a pizza does not you to pay for that pizza

i strongly doubt that being executor will make the assets of the estate vulnerable to a suit against him personally the estate is it 's own separate legal entity with its own tin only creditors against the estate itself can make claims against it and after all creditors are paid then the balance is distributed in accordance with the terms of the will unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own the legal separation should be quite strong   whether his personal assets are at risk remember that the opposition will likely overstate their case to try to scare him into settling if the business was organized as an llp or llc his personal assets should be pretty safe if it was a sole proprietorship he has occasion to worry

you have a sequence of questions here so a sequence of answers if you stopped at the point where you had multiple wins with a net profit of $ 72 then you would pay regular income tax on that $ 72 it 's a short term capital gain which does not get special tax treatment and the fact that you made it on multiple transactions does not matter when you enter your next transaction that takes the hypothetical loss the question gets more complicated in either case you are paying a percentage on net gains   if you took a two year view in the second case and you do n't have anything to offset your loss in the second year then i guess you could say that you paid more tax than you won in the total sequence of trades over the two years although you picked a sequence of trades where it does not appear to play if you 're going to pursue this type of strategy then you are likely at some point to run into a case where the wash sale rules apply so you should be aware of that   you can find information on this elsewhere on this site and also for example here   basically these rules require you to defer recording a loss under some circumstances where you have rapid wins and losses on substantially identical securities edit a slight correction you can take part of your losses in the second year even if you have no off setting gain   from the irs if your capital losses exceed your capital gains the amount of the excess loss that you can claim on line 13 of form 1040 to lower your income is the lesser of $ 3,000 $ 1,500 if you are married filing separately

just an fyi this can be a risky move unless you have been in the industry for a while or are extremely well averse in investment management research keep it pretty short in a lot of ways you might want to think about tailoring it more like a sell side report also make sure you understand the style of investing the pm company you are applying to likes    the reason i say this is because every buy side shop is different some do 1 2 page write ups with models and walk through 's others will expect 60 page decks i.e. the longer the deck the more you have that can go wrong if one tiny thing is wrong or you have a typo anywhere it hurts you more than it helps that you wrote something long i once had the wrong rating on one issuance of a bond ladder i was pitching it 's all the pm 's focused on   the more important aspect is that you understand the shop you are applying to and then tailoring the pitch to them for example do n't do a growth tech company with an forward p e if you 're applying to a fundamental value shop it shows you did n't do research on the firm you 're applying to and that you wo n't fit the culture this is part of why i was saying that this can be a risky move if the firm is large enough to have an hr department they likely have a lot of different investment styles in house   finally try to keep it to a small mid cap company analysts pms follow stocks all day long and will most likely have an opinion on 99 of large caps no matter the sector   in summary i 'd recommend a 1 2 page sell side style write up with a backup model printed excel file kiss keep it simple stupid have a summary couple years worth of historical 's 2 years forward and a few main bullet points of why you like them in your case this pitch should be something to the interest so that you can nail a real pitch in the interview if you get an interview know everything about everything in the industry as well as that specific company for example lets say you do a smartphone secular theme investment do you know what outstanding aapl android cases there are and more importantly how would each ruling likely affect the marketplace this is because i can guarantee if you 're pitching to another tech guy he knows and has an educated opinion on it also in many cases having a great model can mean more than a long write up it shows that you 're good with numbers and can think about future earnings which are all that matter   last point imo you 'd be better off trying to get your foot in the door through networking than hr hr does n't really do much on the buy side with recruiting and wo n't really understand what to look for in a good pitch they 're hr after all not an analyst try to meet someone over coffee and then have a pitch ready to bring out discuss the buy side is selective enough that usually when positions open up it 's either because they are creating one for you or they already have an idea of who is going to fill it this mean hr has little to no say in helping you get in you 'll have a lot more success this way than to a bunch of hr emails

gt;my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather could all sustain their families on a single middle class income   well depends on what you define as middle class income   some of it is a rising expected standard of living   what size house did they have   how many automobiles did they have   if you go back to your great grandfather 's time he probably had far fewer sets of clothing   they probably did n't have the television telephone and air conditioning services that i expect most middle class people expect   my dad ate fruits and vegetables only in season you did n't get to have in the middle of winter or shipped in from chile   i expect to be able to travel via air to visit relatives go back to the 1960s or even into the 1970s and it was considered something that only the well to do would expect to be doing   my father did n't have video game consoles available to him   some of these are driven purely by technology of course and someone can manage to pay no larger a chunk of change than they did before   we eat more meat if i remember a lecture on this correctly   my parents had a lot more and inexpensive foods than i do   but some of it is also adjusting norms   reading about the sort of house that a farmer lived in a few hundred years back would make me think of horrible poverty by modern standards   most women seem not to have wanted to remain when women started going out and doing men 's historical work   so if they go out into the workforce then keeping up with the doing what 's considered middle class requires doubling income and downwards pressure on some fixed costs like say utility costs or gas costs is lessened that makes things tough on the few families who want to have a single income standard   sure maybe a small percentage of people out there want less expensive beef but its the bulk of people who get catered to   automation has greatly decreased demand for some types of jobs performing a repetitive pre defined task on an assembly line has fallen dramatically in value as the need for more people to do this sort of work has fallen off   wages for a particular job are a function of how many people are available to do them relative to how many are needed   every atm is one less bank teller every e commerce website fewer retail workers   that increases the productive capacity of society but whereas before there might be tremendous demand for someone to perform a repeated task on an assembly line which it was easy to train people to do many of the types of labor that are currently under supplied are things that take longer to train people to do and require more specialization   debt   any debt that someone has that does n't have a positive return on investment an engineering degree would probably have a positive roi a large television probably a negative winds up making them poorer in the long run   any debt at all barring investors making bad pricing decisions and hitting default or unexpectedly low returns means transfer of wealth from people without money to people with money   the more non defaulted upon debt the more people with more wealth make more wealth from lending   people have vastly more personal debt than they once did    compare the amount of debt that someone has today with the amount of debt that they typically had in your great grandfather 's time in the 1930s   there 's a constant drain of wealth towards the lenders   this is one of elizabeth warren 's favorite points people take out a lot more debt particularly on housing than they ever did in the past and so a lot of their income is eaten year by year on debt service   there are lots of factors that make it easier to take out more debt   the biggest source of personal debt is by far pdfs and this is where the largest increases have taken place policies to try to encourage people to go into debt to take out larger and larger mortgages have been steadily ramped up over this time with the government subsidizing and taking on risk for insurance liability on mortgages to keep encouraging ever larger amounts of debt   lenders have computers and much more information and sophisticated systems for evaluating risk of default which permits lending out more wealth   so there are technological changes driving this   the government has more public debt which means more such payments even if they do n't show up on your personal checkbook and are only seen by an increasing disparity between what you pay in taxes and the services you get back    here 's a chart of inflation adjusted debt per business of the day americans income and the us in the united states   that means that there 's a constant increasing in the siphoning off of taxes as well to pay for the government having purchased a good or service without having actually paid for it at the time it was ordered   that decreasing green line means not that personal debt is falling well most of the time but that the government is taking out debt on your behalf even faster than private debt has been going up   the rest of the world catching up and breaking a temporary limited monopoly on certain   china and india were not industrialized and the former stuck under and not trading much with the rest of the world so there were fewer people available to do this sort of work   europe rebuilt from world war ii so it did n't have to purchase from the overseas us manufacturing industry   what could change   well standard of living is a cultural thing that seems hard to manipulate   i 'm sure that it 's possible to change that but i have a hard time suggesting how   automation would be an across the board good thing if workers could be efficiently shifted into fields which currently have more demand it 's only an issue for workers if they stay in a field that has falling demand   i 'm sure that our mechanisms for re educating workers are not terribly good   today our education system still involves having a person stand up in front of a lot of other people and talk at them then have those other people go and repeat some rote tasks to try and hammer something into their brain it 's the same mechanism that the wealthy used hundreds of years ago to tutor their children but ramped up on a larger scale   if it were cheaper and easier to learn a new trade it 'd be easier to enter lucrative fields   college costs in particular are ridiculous   when you take college classes you 're basically getting a reading list a very few limited slots to ask questions and a set of predefined tasks plus some grading   that can be done far less than it is provided today   i personally have high hopes for online courses as a start here though i 'm sure that there will be blocks   ditto for things like wikipedia using means that i can skip over things i already know and focus on what i do n't understand and electronic automatic distribution means that it can be done far less than having some guy with a phd stand up in front of a room and read some lecture notes   instead of answering questions generation after generation those people should be polishing databases of answers to questions so that every subsequent human being can quickly and easily refer to their answer and so that we can direct people to the best explanation easily   it 's possible to adopt some measures that would reduce debt service by reducing public debt but the public debt has been growing for a long time and it seems very clear that people are much more willing to take out debt than to cut into their favorite concern low taxes or lots of services in the immediate future   as for reducing debt service via reducing private debt most of the policy and technological factors that drive private debt seem unlikely to change to me   maybe if we see some sort of cultural change an aversion to taking out debt with a negative roi but all of the information i 'm giving here has been public for a long time and people have n't changed so i doubt that we 'll see any kind of a reversal or social movement against taking out lots of debt   you 'd have to have the equivalent of a great wiki with respect to debt and given that attempts to excite interest in the matter have generally not gone anywhere thus far i suspect that this is human nature and doubt that things will change   you can always change your personal debt decisions but society as a whole   as for the temporary monopoly well i think that it 's pretty much inevitable that the rest of the world catches up to a great degree   asia will catch up even africa will eventually get there   i think that that would be a pretty difficult thing to stop and i think that most of the world would object to someone attempting to stop it

why do people talk about stock that pay high dividends   traditionally people who buy dividend stocks are looking for income from their investments most dividend stock companies pay out dividends every quarter every 90 days if set up properly an investor can receive a dividend check every month every week or as often as they have enough money to the ex dates there is a difference in high $ $ amount of the dividend and the yield   a $ 1/share dividend payout may sound good up front but how much is that stock costing you if the stock cost you $ 100/share then you are getting 1 yield if the stock cost you $ 10/share you are getting 10 yield   there are a lot of factors that come into play when investing in dividend stocks for cash flow keep in mind why are you investing in the first place growth or cash flow arrange your investing around your major investment goals do n't chase big dollar dividend checks do your research and follow a proven investment plan to reach your goals safely

i think of these things in terms of risk   investing in individual stocks is risky and investing in brand new individual stocks is riskier still however the payoff can be quite high   the fact that you work at the company increases your exposure if the company goes under then not only have you lost your investment but you 've lost your job and income as well   it really depends on how much of your total portfolio this investment represents consider the following if you can say yes to all or most of these then a small investment in your company is fine if you end up losing your investment you 'll still be okay   i think it can help a company when the employees have a little skin in the game i hope it pays out big for you

you should probably call the travel agency and complain not that they will care but if by any chance they do they can ask paypal to remove the block this is what is called authorization pending usually a credit card transaction has two stages the merchant requests its payment processor to authorize the transaction the processor will contact the card issuer with the transaction details and will get the authorization code which will be passed to the merchant at that stage the transaction enters the pending stage on your account the merchant submits the transaction and gets the money from its payment processor who forwards the transaction to the card issuer and gets the money from there the card issuer charges the card owner the transaction should have the same authorization code received in step 1 and by matching it to the pending transaction the card issuer removes the pending transaction and posts the actual transaction however if the transaction in step 2 does n't include the code from step 1 the match does n't occur and you see the situation you have now both the actual transaction and the pending are active in this case the merchant should contact its merchant processor and request the of the authorization code the processor will then forward the request to the card issuer who will then remove the pending transaction as you can see multiple parties have to actually care for that to happen and many times they do n't because they do n't have to as to the period it 's up to the card issuer paypal in your case but 1 month is a very long time usually it 's about a week or two unless it 's a hotel car rental in any case once it expires it will go away on its own and if you do n't mind for the amounts to be blocked until then just let it expire the fact that you used a debit card for this transaction is irrelevant unless it was a pin transaction debit card transactions are processed as credit card transactions by processors for pin transactions there process is different and you should n't see doubles if it was a pin transaction contact paypal and check with them what 's going on generally paypal is not to be used as a bank account it is merely a payment processor and it is advised to remove the money from there as soon as possible

inflation as defined in the general has many impacts at a personal level for example you say that the reduction in the price of oil has no impact on you   that 's absolutely not true unless you 're a living off of the land   every box or can or jar of food you buy off the shelf of the grocery store has the price of oil baked into it because it had to get there somehow   high fuel costs for trucks mean increased costs to put food on shelves which mean increased prices for that food even tobacco prices can affect you because they affect what other people are spending   demand is always a significant factor in prices particularly retail prices and if people are spending more money on tobacco they 're probably spending less on other things either buying less snacks for example or buying cheaper brands of those snacks   so the price of may drop a bit or not rise for example general inflation also tends to drive raises particularly in industries with relatively small performance ties to raises   if inflation is 3 wages need to raise 3 or so in order to keep up on average even if your personal cost of living went up 0 or 5 or 10 the default wage inflation will be closer to that of the national average   any raise less than national average is effectively a pay cut which is one reason why inflation is needed in a healthy economy   so your company probably has a cost of living raise everyone gets that 's a bit less than inflation and then good performers get a bump up to a bit more than inflation   you can read more on this topic for a more in depth explanation finally inflation rates tend to be major factors in stock market movement   inflation that is too high or too low can lead to higher volatility inflation that is right can lead to higher stability   an economy that has consistently right inflation around 2 3 typically will tend to have more stable stock market in general and thus more reliable returns from that market   there are many other factors that lead to stock markets rising and falling but inflation is one very relevant one particularly if it 's not in the right zone

no it is not normal the normal process is that the money is transferred to your account with out issue   this would be an exception   that does not mean that there is anything to worry about   it could be that the transaction met some criteria that triggered closer examination or it could be that yours is just one randomly being reviewed   and it could just be that your husbands partner misunderstood or lied    step 1 would be contact the bank and find out what is going on and if there is any action you need to take   assuming that the bank confirms the status and the amount is significant enough i would probably give my lawyer a heads up of what is going on   if homeland security is involved there is a reasonable chance that you will need that representation anyway so getting the lawyer involved early might save you a headache in the end   the lawyer is probably the only person that will be able to get any answers for your anyway from comments my husband is a consultant that works for another company as a    consultant that company received a contract from a government south    of the us free trade approved that government first wired the    overall government contract to the company account in that originating    country then the funds were wired to the us counterpart company    then then consultants gets paid it sounds like the contract is not your normal business to business international contract   so normal goes out the window there   when you start getting foreign governments involved things get lets use the word interesting   if the contract involves anything with military or restricted technology applications even if they are not directly military then hsa wants to make sure that no one is circumventing export restrictions   with out knowing more specifics it is difficult to guess whether or not there is anything for your husband to worry about   the bottom line for him is that he does not have his money so he should keep that in mind when delivering services to the prime contractor

well it 's directly depositing money in your account but direct deposit is something completely different direct deposits are most commonly made by businesses in the payment of salaries and wages and for the payment of suppliers accounts but the facility can be used for payments for any purpose such as payment of bills taxes and other government charges direct deposits are most commonly made by means of electronic funds transfers effected using online mobile and telephone banking systems but can also be effected by the physical deposit of money into the payee 's bank account thus since the purpose of dd is to eliminate checks i 'd say no depositing cash directly into your account does not count as the requirement for one direct deposit within 90 days

i had an hsa for two or three years i found very routinely that my insurance company had negotiated rates with in network providers so as i never hit the deductible i always had to pay 100 of the negotiated rate but it was still much less than the providers general rate sometimes dramatically so like i had some blood and urine tests done and the general rate was $ 450 but the negotiated rate was only $ 40 i had laser eye surgery and the general rate was something like $ 1500 but the negotiated rate was more like $ 500 et cetera other times it was the same or trivially different like routine office visits it made no difference i found that i could call the insurance company and ask for the negotiated rate and they would tell me when i asked the doctor or the hospital they either could n't tell me or they would n't it 's possible that the doctor 's office does n't really know what rates they 've agreed to they might have just signed some contract with the insurance company that says yes we 'll accept whatever you give us but either way i had to go to the insurance company to find out you 'd think they 'd just publish the list on a web site or something after all it 's to the insurance company 's advantage if you go to the cheapest provider with a regular non hsa plan they 're share of the total is less even with an hsa plan if you go to a cheaper provider you are less likely to hit the deductible yes medical care in the u.s. is rather bizarre in that providers routinely expect you to commit to paying for their services before they will tell you the price can you imagine any other industry working this way can you imagine buying a car and the dealer saying i have no idea what this car costs if you like it great take it and drive it home and in a few weeks we 'll send you a bill and of course whatever amount we put on that bill you are legally obligated to pay but we refuse to tell you what that amount will be the american medical association used to have a policy that they considered it unethical for doctors to tell patients the price of treatment in advance i do n't know if they still do

start with the list of mortgage companies approved to work in your area there are 80 within 10 miles of my house and more than 100 in my county pick ones you know because they are established businesses in your area region or even nationally    a good place to start might be with your current lender the risk you seem to be worried about is a scam or a trick in the recent past the scams were ones where the home owner did n't understand teaser rates and the risk of interest only and pick your payment loans the simpler the bells and the less likely you are to be on a risky transaction it ca n't hurt to ask an organization like the bbb or neighbors but realize that many people loved their exotic mortgage until the moment it blew up in their face so for 5 years your neighbor would have about their new mortgage until they discovered how underwater they were   regarding how the transaction is accomplished is hard to predict there is great variation in the quality of the loan officers so a great company can have employees unless you can get a recommendation for a specific employee it is hard know if your loan officer is going to give great service    when getting a mortgage for a purchase the biggest risk is getting a mortgage that results in a payment you ca n't afford this is less of a risk with a refinance because you already have a mortgage and monthly payment but keep in mind some of the monthly savings is due to stretching out the payments for another 30 years know what you are trying to do with the refinance because the streamlined ones ca nt be used for cash out

i 'll be happy to edit when you provide answers to the question i posed in the comments   given the choice and i assume there is no other i 'd take a loan from the 401(k vs a withdrawal   you withdraw $ i 'll assume 25 bracket as you 're planning at least a $ 200 k house hopefully your taxable income is above $ 38 k the 25 line for singles the tax and penalty is 35 total federal you net $ and you have $ 40 k less in the retirement account in 40 years at 10 average growth that 's $ 1.8 m you wo n't have in your 401(k and as littleadv stated no deposits for 6 months meaning no matching there 's a few more thousand you 'll lose   you borrow $ 20k. your 401(k will see a return on the $ 20k that 's better than the short bond account 4 5 vs less than 1 you are short $ 6 k but in return have paid no tax no penalty etc i respect those who are strongly anti loan but even they would agree this is the far lesser of 2 evils    the above is pretty generic there are better choices but your cpa friend 's advice is nearly as bad as it gets by the way the tax you 'll save once you have the mortgage has nothing to do with that 10 penalty say you bought the house with cash as many would be happy to do you 'd pay the penalty for the 401(k withdrawal but have no mortgage deduction if you had the 20 you still have a loan and the deduction but no penalty for taking his bad advice   my advice is to take that refund and use it to pay the loan faster

someone is paid a certain sum each month and wants to spend only a certain amount each month can he spend more and then take it out of next month 's payment using the example 100 month 1 60 first month save 40 second month 100 salary spend 70 save 30 overall savings 70 third month 100 salary spend 50 save 50 overall savings 120 so in short term or once a while doing this is fine however if and this depends on individuals it goes beyond control i.e. you keep spending say 90 every month you would have to save for quite a few months to get back to normal a better way would be to reverse this using the example 100 month 1 60 first month save 40 second month 100 salary spend 50 save 50 overall savings 90 third month 100 salary spend 70 save 30 overall savings 120 i.e. save more first and then spend rather than spending now and saying you will save in future generally this is the trap quite a few fall into specially when saving for retirement they keep putting it to future and very soon realize that they ca n't get back to the goal

as far as the specific price it depends so much on the area and the house and other things   70k could be a perfectly reasonable offer or it could be an insulting lowball   if they just lowered it from 95 to 85 for example 70 is pretty low to start off   but who knows to answer the closing costs side of things though the reason those are sometimes paid by seller rather than just dropping the sales price some is that it makes it easier for the buyer if the buyer does n't have much cash on hand   from the seller 's point of view it 's all the same money giving you a discount on the sale price vs. covering closing costs except for the small difference of the realtor 's commission which would be slightly lower in the lower sales price example but usually that 's not a significant factor in total cost   ie vs how much having the 3k less on hand and instead in your mortgage is worth to you as a buyer is of course up to you   if you have plenty of cash on hand for the down payment and closing costs then paying closing costs yourself is probably in your best interest as the seller typically assumes buyers value reduced zero closing costs at more than 100 face value

as far as i understand op seems to be literally asking why regarding the various contracts on various exchanges etc is it that in some cases they are cash settled and in some physically settled the answer is only that the exchange in question happens to offer it that way note that it 's utterly commonplace for contracts to be settled out physically and happens in the billions as a daily matter   conversely in cash settled contracts play out each day   both are totally commonplace different businesses or entities or traders would use the two varieties for reasons the different exchanges offer the different varieties ultimately i guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable   there 's no council or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering recall that a given futures contracts market is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company just like burger king sells different products i believe in another aspect of the question op is asking basically   why is there not a futures contract of the mini or micro variety for extremely small amounts of currency futures which is physically settled rather than cash settled if that 's the question the answer is just whatever nobody 's done it yet   or it may well exist   but it seems extremely unlikely   physically settled currencies futures are for entities operating in the sorry if the question was misunderstood

below is just a little information on this topic from my small unique book the small stock trader   the most significant non company specific factor affecting stock price is the market sentiment while the most significant company specific factor is the earning power of the company perhaps it would be safe to say that technical analysis is more related to psychology emotions while fundamental analysis is more related to reason that is why it is said that fundamental analysis tells you what to trade and technical analysis tells you when to trade thus many stock traders use technical analysis as a timing tool for their entry and exit points technical analysis is more suitable for short term trading and works best with large caps for stock prices of large caps are more correlated with the general market while small caps are more affected by company specific news and speculation perhaps small stock traders should not waste a lot of time on fundamental analysis avoid the financial position market position and management of the focus companies it is difficult to make wise trading decisions based only on fundamental analysis company specific news accounts for only about 25 percent of stock price fluctuations there are only a few important figures and ratios to look at such as perhaps also furthermore single ratios and figures do not tell much so it is wise to use a few ratios and figures in combination you should look at their trends and also compare them with the company ’s main competitors and the industry average preferably you want to see trend improvements in these above mentioned figures and ratios or at least some stability when the times are tough despite all the exotic names found in technical analysis simply put it is the study of supply and demand for the stock in order to predict and follow the trend many stock traders claim stock price just represents the current supply and demand for that stock and moves to the greater side of the forces of supply and demand   if you focus on a few simple small caps perhaps you should just use the basic principles of technical analysis such as   i have no doubt that there are different ways to make money in the stock market some may succeed purely on the basis of technical analysis some purely due to fundamental analysis and others from a combination of these two like most of the great stock traders have done jesse livermore baruch nicolas william and steven cohen it is just a matter of finding out what best fits your personality   i hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful author of the small stock trader

whether you can establish an hsa has nothing to do with your employment status or your retirement plan it has to do with the type of medical insurance you have   the insurance company should be able to tell you if your plan is hsa compatible to be hsa compatible a plan must have a high deductible in 2014 $ 1250 for an individual plan or $ 2500 for a family plan it must not cover any expenses before the deductible that is you can not have any first dollar coverage for doctor 's visits prescription drug coverage etc there are some exceptions for services considered preventive care there are also limits on the out of pocket max i think that 's it but the insurance company should know if their plans qualify or not if you have a plan that is hsa compatible but also have another plan that is not hsa compatible then you do n't qualify and all that said if you are covered under your husband 's medical insurance and your husband already has an hsa why do you want to open a second one there 's no gain there is a family limit on contributions to an hsa $ in 2014 you do n't get double the limit by each opening your own hsa if you have two hsa 's the combined total of your contributions to both accounts must be within the limit if you have some administrative reason for wanting to keep separate accounts yes you can open your own and in that case you and your husband are each allowed to contribute half the limit or you can agree to some other division   i suppose you might want to have an account in your own name so that you control it especially if you and your husband have different ideas about managing finances though how to resolve such problems would be an entirely different question personally i do n't think the solution is to get into power struggles over who controls what but whatever maybe there 's some advantage to having assets in your own name if you and your husband were to divorce probably not though i think a divorce court pretty much ignores whose name assets are in when dividing up property   see irs publication 969 for lots and lots of details

the breakdown between how much of your payment is going toward principal and interest is very important    the principal balance remaining on your loan is the payoff amount   once the principal is paid off your loan is finished   each month some of your payment goes to pay off the principal and some goes to pay interest profit for the bank using your example image let 's say that you 've just taken out a $ 300k mortgage at 5 interest for 30 years   you can click here to see the amortization schedule on that loan   the monthly payment is $ on your first payment only $ 360 went to pay off your principal   the rest $ 1250 went to interest   that money is lost   if you were to pay off your $ 300k mortgage after making one payment it would cost you $ even though you had just made a payment of $ 1250   interest accrues on the principal balance so as time goes on and more of the principal has been paid the interest payment is less meaning that more of your monthly payment can go toward the principal    15 years into your 30-year mortgage your monthly payment is paying $ of your principal and only $ is going toward interest   your principal balance at that time would be about $   even though you are halfway done with your mortgage in terms of time you 've only paid off about a third of your house toward the end of your mortgage when your principal balance is very low almost all of your payment goes toward principal   in the last year only $ of your payments goes toward interest for the whole year you can think of your monthly loan payment as a minimum payment   if you continue to make the regular monthly payments your mortgage will be paid off in 30 years   however if you pay more than that your mortgage will be paid off much sooner   the extra that you pay above your regular monthly payment all goes toward principal even if you have no plans to pay your mortgage ahead of schedule there are other situations where the principal balance matters   the principal balance of your mortgage affects the amount of equity that you have in your home which is important if you sell the house   if you decide to refinance your mortgage the principal balance is the amount that will need to be paid off by the new loan to close the old loan

in finance we make a distinction between investments that tend to grow in value and assets that hold value   investments that grow in value are generally related to investing in well thought out businesses   investments can be done in retirement accounts through stocks and bonds but also owning part of a business directly   good investments make more and more money off the money you put in common examples of assets include gold and other non productive property like real estate you do n't rent or cars   you can even have some assets in your retirement account as many would argue government bonds behave like assets   all of these things tend to more or less go up in value as the cost of everything goes up in value but do n't tend to make you any excess money in the long run there is certainly a place for both investments and assets   especially as a young person it is good to lean toward investments as you likely have a lot of time for the money to grow as you get older   as suggests in the united states this is fairly easy as retirement accounts are common there is a long history of stable financial law even in crises   pakistan 's institutions are fairly stable and improving but still assets and investments of all types can be riskier so i recommend taking your father 's advice partially having some assets are good in riskier situations but good investments are generally the way to grow comfortably wealthy   a good mix of the two is the way to grow wealthy slowly while protecting yourself from risk   you your father and your neighbors know you local situation better than i who has only visited a number of pakistan 's neighboring countries so i ca n't really give more detailed advice but hopefully this gets you started

i am just a c student with no hope for grad school so you are going to have to walk me through this the ecb until recently japan and the swiss have been running qe programs equal to that of the fed 's in 2009 for the last couple of years   that 's an extraordinary amount of money being created what 's more is that the swiss are even buying shitloads of american equities with it     perhaps my understanding of m2 is flawed but how would the swiss national bank buying $ in equities change m2   it 's not like the fed is printing the money specifically for the transaction   the amount of qe being pumped into a healthy economy over the last couple years should be concerning if only because it 's unprecedented especially since some of it is being directly invested into equities   i do n't think there is a viable argument that can truthfully say that it is n't a pretty large variable in the market today but i could be wrong   also i 've read enough and heard enough on how the inflation rate is measured to cultivate a healthy skepticism for the entire metric the way they choose baskets while obviously the best possible is not something that lends itself to precision     please be kind to my grammar

my own personal point of view i earn about twice what my wife to be earns we are planning on getting married next year   i ultimately do all the finances basically because she hates that kind of thing not because i 'm in charge or whatever to work out how we do this i wrote a spreadsheet   at the top it has my monthly pay in one column and her 's in another i add all our bills against me at the bottom i have a total of both of our spending money spending money is wage bills savings i then move money out of my column into her column my goal is that we pay all the bills and save a decent amount and have roughly the same amount to spend each month so each persons spending money should be roughly equal i then fine tune this as things change if we get a pay rise we alter it if a bill goes up or down we alter it to manage this we have 4 accounts a joint account to pay bills both give a set amount to each a savings acount both give a set amount to each month and our own accounts where we get paid and where our spending money lives like everyone else says this seems fair to me i do n't earn more we both earn an amount and this should be split equally

unless a study accounts for whether the users are following a budget or not it is irrelevant to those who are trying to take their personal finances seriously i can certainly believe that those who have no budget will spend more on a credit card than they will on a debit card or with cash under the right circumstances spending with cards can actually be a tool to track and reduce spending if you can see on a monthly and yearly basis where all of your money was spent you have the information to make decisions about the small expenses that add up as well as the obvious large expenses   debit cards and credit cards offer the same advantage of giving you an electronic record of all of your transactions but debit cards do not come with the same fraud protection that credit cards have so i and many people like me prefer to use credit cards for security reasons alone cash back and other rewards points bolster the case for credit cards over debit cards it is very possible to track all of your spending with cash but it is also more work the frustration of accounting for bad and every transaction multiple times is worth discussing too as a reason that people get discouraged and give up on budgeting my point is simply that credit cards and the electronic records that they generate can greatly simplify the process of tracking your spending i doubt any study out there accounts for the people who are specifically using those benefits and what effect it has on their spending

when the vc is asking what your pre money valuation is he 's asking what percentage of shares his $ 200,000 will buy if you say your company is worth $ 800 k then after he puts the money in it will be worth $ 1 m and he will own 20 of all shares you 'll still own the remainder so when the vc is asking for a valuation what he really wants to know is how much of your company he 's going to own after he funds you   determining your pre money valuation then is a question of negotiation how much money will you need how likely are you to require more money later and thus dilute the vc 's shares or give up more of your own shares how likely is your business to survive and how much money will it make if it does survive it is n't about the actual value of your business right now as much as it is how much work has gone into this and how successful can it be the value is going to be a bit higher than you expect because the work is already done and you can get to market faster than someone else who has n't started yet vcs are often looking for long shots they 'll invest in 10 companies and expect 7 to fail 2 to be barely profitable and the last one to make hilarious amounts of money a vc does n't necessarily want 51 of your company you 'll probably lose motivation if you 're not in charge but they 'll want as much as they can get otherwise

a good reference to what encompasses securities are detailed in the securities act of 1933 which was enacted by the united states federal government one main exception which i would still consider securities for your purposes would be commercial paper these are exempt from the securities act because they mature in 270 days of less but they function much like bonds or promissory notes therefore though it would not encompass currencies and commodities it really comes down to the structure of the agreement for transferring or holding the particular kind of underlying asset

the biggest problem with penny stocks is that they are easily manipulated and they frequently are   many of the companies trading as penny stocks have poor track histories of accurate financials and what information that is available is not very reliable or verifiable i recall a few years ago when there were articles out there in financial circles talking about how more than a few penny stocks were being manipulated by organized crime another big issue with penny stocks is liquidity   since they 're so thinly traded not a great deal of daily volume anyone who puts enough money into a penny stock to make it worth the effort almost certainly becomes the biggest trader in the stock which can make it tough to liquidate positions   there are not enough market makers in the stock to be competitive so you have to accept the bid ask prices of whoever is willing to execute the trades so the margins evaporate quickly penny stocks are something you can trade if you 're bored have money to burn and just want to toy around with something just for the heck of it that you 'll ultimately lose out on

yes theoretically you can flip the shares you agreed to buy and make a profit but you 're banking on the market behaving in some very precise and potentially unlikely ways   in practice it 's very tricky for you to successfully navigate paying arbitrarily more for a stock than it 's currently listed for and selling it back again for enough to cover the difference   yes the price could drop to $ 28 but it could just as easily drop to $ or further and now you 're hurting before even taking into account the potentially hefty commissions involved another way to think about it is to recognize that an option transaction is a bet the buyer is betting a small amount of money that a stock will move in the direction they expect the seller is betting a large amount of money that the same stock will not   one of you has to lose   and unless you 've some reason to be solidly confident in your predictive powers the loser long term is quite likely to be you now that said it is possible particularly when selling puts to create win win scenarios for yourself where you 're betting one direction but you 'd be perfectly happy with the    here 's an example   suppose unrelated to the option chain you 've come to the conclusion that you 'd be happy paying $ 28 for bby   it 's currently june 2011 at so you ca n't buy it on the open market for a price you 'd be happy with   but you could sell a $ 28 put promising to buy it at that price should someone want to sell it presumably because the price is now below $ 28 either the put expires worthless and you pocket a few bucks and you 're basically no worse off because the stock is still overpriced by your estimates or the option is executed and you receive 100 shares of bby at a price you previously decided you were willing to pay   even if the list price is now lower long term you expect the stock to be worth more than $ 28   conceptually this makes selling a put very similar to being paid to place a limit order to buy the stock itself of course you could be wrong in your estimate too low and you now have a position that might not become profitable too high and you never get in and instead just watch the stock gain in value but that is not unique to options if you 're bad at estimating value which is not to be confused with predicting price movement you 're doomed just about whatever you do

tl;dr please please please do the conversion first joetaxpayer 's answer is correct but i am of the opposite opinion first there 's just about no reason to have post tax dollars in a traditional ira   you 'll eventually have to pay tax on the earnings those dollars generate so it 's essentially the same as having that money in a regular taxable account   meanwhile if you roll those dollars into a roth ira you get to earn tax free money on them for the rest of your life and even after your death second even if you did have some reason for keeping those post tax dollars where they are the last thing you ever want to do is mix them with pre tax dollars from say your 401k   as soon as you mix them all the dollars become subject to pro rata taxation as joe mentioned so any future decision you were planning to make about what to do with just your post tax dollars is moot you have given away your right to think separately about your pre- and post tax dollars as an example let 's say the accounts you want to combine look like this in the future you decide you want to move $ 2,000 from the above account into a roth   because you mixed the money the irs insists that your rollover consists of so now you owe tax and it 's regular income tax i believe not even capital gains tax on $ 1,500   that was money that you away specifically to avoid taxes and now you 've gone and paid taxes on it   now there are valid arguments for intentionally moving pre tax dollars from a traditional to a roth like this but the point is that you should n't even have to be having that argument you have post tax dollars in your traditional ira that almost certainly belong in a roth   by mixing your 401k into your traditional ira you can no longer do anything with just the post tax dollars   the irs will forever insist that you do these pro rated calculations say in the future you suddenly realize that a roth is much better for your financial situation than a traditional ira   or you might still prefer a traditional ira but as explained in the next sentence it 's not available to you   unfortunately because you 're covered by a new 401k or maybe because you earn too much money to contribute pre tax dollars to either a traditional or roth ira you 're out of luck   you 're simply not allowed to contribute to a roth most people in this situation can make use of what 's called a back door roth   they contribute up to the maximum amount per year $ 5,500 or whatever it is now post tax to a traditional ira and then immediately roll it over to their roth   you can still try this but guess what   yep because you 're mixing these new post tax dollars with pre tax money in your traditional ira every year your rollover will be tainted with that pre tax money diluting the whole point of the back door roth   you 'll be paying taxes on money you never wanted to pay taxes on and you 'll be leaving post tax money behind in your traditional ira if it sounds like i 'm annoyed about this situation from personal experience it 's because i am by doing the conversion first you never mix pre- and post tax money and your money goes where you want it of course assuming you eventually do roll over your 401(k into a traditional ira the really annoying consequence above will still plague you but at least you 'll have cleanly converted that first post tax amount

if anyone could reliably pick winners they could make more money by investing in those winners than by selling their advice generally when someone sends you unsolicited hype about stocks that 's because they 're trying to pump the price up so they can dump their own shares before it collapses again also note that these days it 's remarkably easy to run the scam where you sell half your customers buy advice and the other half sell advice on the same stock each time some of the customers drop out in disgust half minus whoever decides to give you another chance and the rest pay you for the next iteration you can make a lot of money before you run out of suckers that all by itself is good reason to be skeptical about anyone who does n't publish their full history so it can be audited for such shenanigans

the strategy looks good on paper but in reality the 150 call will have some time value particularly if it has got some time to mature let us say this time value is 0.50 so the call costs 3.50    if the stock stays above 150 actually above by the expiration of the call you will lose this 0.50 then you need to keep buying calls over and over and hope one day a big down move will more than make up for all this lost premium it is possible but not entirely predictable you may get lucky but it may take many months to produce a significant move to make up for all the lost premium if a big down move were to happen and the market had any indication of that in advance that would be priced into the call already so the 150 call may cost 4 $ or 4.50 $ if the market had wind of a big move a.k.a high implied volatility

you should only invest in individual stocks if you truly understand the company 's business model and follow its financial reports closely   even then individual stocks should represent only the tiniest most adventurous part of your portfolio as they are a huge risk a basic investing principle is diversification   if you invest in a variety of financial instruments then a when some components of your portfolio are doing poorly others will be doing well   even in the case of significant economic downturns when it seems like everything is doing poorly there will be some investment sectors that are doing relatively better such as bonds physical real estate precious metals b over time some components of your portfolio will gain more money than others so every 6 or 12 months you can rebalance such that all components once again have the same of money invested in them as when you began   you can do this either by selling off some of your well performing assets to purchase more of your poorly performing assets or if you do n't want to incur a taxable event by introducing additional money from outside your portfolio   this essentially forces you to buy relatively low sell relatively high now if you accept the above argument for diversification then you should recognize that owning a handful or even several of individual stocks will not help you achieve diversification   even if you buy one stock in the energy sector one in consumer discretionary one in financials etc then you 're still massively exposed to the day to day fates of those individual companies   and if you invest solely in the us stock market then when the us has a decline your whole portfolio will decline   and if you do n't buy any bonds then again when the world has a downturn your portfolio will decline   and so on that 's why index mutual funds are so helpful   someone else has already gone to the trouble of grouping together all the stocks or bonds of a certain type small cap large cap domestic foreign value growth so all you have to do is pick the types you want until you feel you have the diversity you need   no more worrying about whether you 've picked the right company to represent a particular sector   the fewer knobs there are to turn in your portfolio the less chance there is for mistakes

first you need to see if you actually qualify as a dependent under irs rules in short while there may be exceptions to the rule i am not sure what those could be   the takeaway is that if your parent is wishing to claim you as a dependent they must be responsible for supporting the majority of your living expenses e.g. food and shelter if this is the case then the next question is to look at how the impact of the exemptions play out   in your situation i would guess that your mother is correct   your taxable income is likely to be so low that if you do not take an exemption for yourself you probably would still have zero or minimal tax liability but if you mother claims you as a dependent she will be able to take a deduction in the case of your grants and loans the loans should not be taxable income since these need to be repaid presumably with future earnings   federal grants may be taxable basically the portion of the grant that is used solely for paying educational expenses toward a specific degree tuition and books is non taxable but the remainder may be subject to tax as for tax credits you would need to see how much you would get and how they would apply to you   the bottom line is there are too many variables to say for certain what the best approach would be so both your and your mother 's returns must be prepared under each scenario you as her dependent versus you claiming a personal exemption

i would not be concerned about the impact to your credit rating   you already have an excellent credit score and the temporary change to your utilization will have minimal impact to your score if you really need to make this $ 2500 purchase and you have the money in the bank to pay for it i would not recommend borrowing this money   only put it on the credit card if you plan on paying it off in full without paying interest let me ask you this why do you want to keep this $ 2500 in the bank   it certainly is n't earning you anything significant   my guess is that you 'd like to keep it there for an emergency   well is this $ 2500 purchase an emergency   if it is necessary then spend the money   if not then save up the money until you have enough to make the purchase   it does n't make sense to keep money for an emergency in the bank but then when one comes up to leave the money in the bank and pay interest on your emergency purchase if you make this emergency purchase and another emergency comes up you can always if necessary borrow the money at that time   it does n't make sense to borrow money before you need it that having been said i would encourage you to build up your emergency fund so that you have enough money in there to handle things like this without completely depleting your savings account   3 to 6 months of expenses is the general recommendation for your emergency fund   then if something unplanned comes up you 'll have the money in the bank without having to borrow and pay interest

by process i assume you mean the financial process financially this does n't look any different to me than buying an empty lot to build a rental unit with the added expense potentially significant of doing the tear down given your lack of experience and capital i would be very hesitant to jump in like this you are going to have to spend a lot of time managing the build process or pay someone else to do it for you and expect everything to take twice as long and cost twice as much as you expect if you really want to get into the landlord business i would suggest starting with a structurally sound building that needs some renovation work and start there one you have that up and running you can use the cash flow and equity to finance something more aggressive if you still think you want to do this the first thing to do is figure out if the financials make sense how much will it cost to do the tear down and rebuild plus the typical rental expenses ongoing maintenance taxes insurance vacancy rates and compare that to the expected rental rates in the area to see how long it will take to 1 achieve a positive cash flow and 2 break even there are a lot of good questions on this site related to rentals that go into much more detail about how to approach this

here would be the general steps to my mind for creating such a plan write out the final desired outcome is it $ x in y years to fund your retirement is it $ a in b years to put as a house down payment this is the first step in defining how much money you want at what point in time consider what is your risk tolerance and how much time do you plan on spending in this plan is it rebalancing once a quarter and that 's it or do you plan on doing monthly research and making tweaks all the time this is slightly different from the first where one has to be mindful of how much volatility would one handle and what time commitment does one have for an investing strategy also how much money would you be adding to the investments on what kind of time table would also be worth noting here construct the asset allocation based on the previous two steps along with historical returns averaged out to be a first draft of what you are buying in general is it us stocks is it a short term bond fund there are more than a few choices here that may make sense and it is worth considering based on the first couple of responses that determine what this will look like retirement in 40 years may be quite different than a house down payment in 2 years for example determine what brokerages or fund companies would offer such funds along with what types of accounts you 'd want to have as in some countries there may be tax advantaged accounts that may be useful to use here this is where you 're almost ready to start by doing the homework of figuring out how will things work this may vary depending on one 's jurisdiction get the applications from whatever institutions you 'll be using and run with the desired asset allocation across various funds and accounts note that in the first few steps there were points of being aware of how much would you have how aggressive are you investing and so forth this is where you actually send in the money and get things rolling run with the plan and make tweaks as needed to achieve result hopefully desired or better

you 're talking about money in a savings account and avoiding the risks posed by an ongoing crisis and avoiding risk if you are risk averse and likely to need your money in the short term you should not put your money in the stock market even in safe stocks like coca cola etc even these safe stocks are at risk of wild price swings in the short- to intermediate term especially in the event of international crises such as major european debt defaults and the like these stocks are suitable for long term growth objectives but they are not as a replacement for a savings account coca cola lost a third of its value between 2007 and 2009 it 's recovered and is currently doing better than ever went from $ to $ it 's partially recovered and back at $ 63 on the other hand these stocks may indeed be suitable as long term investments to protect you against local currency inflation and yes they even pay dividends if you 're after this investment a good option is probably a sector specific exchange traded fund such as a consumer staples etf it will likely be more diversified and safer than anything you could come up with using a list of individual stocks you can also investigate recommendations that show up when you search for a defensive etf if you do not wish to buy the etf directly you can also look at listings of the etf 's holdings read the prospectus for an idea of the risks associated with these funds you can buy these funds with any brokerage that gives you access to us stock exchanges

i have been a landlord in texas for just over 3 years now i still feel like a novice but i will give you the benefit of my experience if you are relying on rental properties for current income versus a long term return you are going to have to do a good job at shopping for bargains to get monthly cash flow versus equity growth that is locked up in the property until you sell it   if you want to pull a lot of cash out of a property on a regular basis you probably are going to have to get into flipping them which is decidedly not passive investing also it is easy to underestimate the expenses associated with rental properties texas is pretty landlord friendly legally however it does have higher than usual property taxes which will eat into your return also you need to factor in maintenance vacancy tenant turnover costs etc it can add up to a lot more than you would expect if you are handy and can do a lot of repairs yourself you can increase your return but that makes it less of a passive investment the two most common rules i have heard for initially evaluating whether an investment property is likely to be cash flow positive are the 1 and 50 rules the 1 rule says the expected monthly rent needs to be 1 or greater of the purchase price of the house so your hypothetical $ k scenario does n't pass that test some people say this rule is 2 for new landlords but in my experience you 'd have to get lucky in texas to find a house priced that competitively that did n't need a lot of work to get rents that high the 50 rule says that the rent needs to be double your mortgage payment to account for expenses you also have to factor in the hassle of dealing with tenants the following are not going to happen when you own a mutual fund but are almost inevitable if you are a landlord long enough for whatever reason you have to go to court and evict a tenant a tenant that probably lost their job or had major medical issues the tenant you ever met with the kids in the world that you are threatening to make homeless every fiber of your being wants to cut them some slack but you have a mortgage to pay and ca n't set an expectation that paying the rent on time is a suggestion not a rule or the tenant who seemed nice at first but now considers you the man decides to fight the eviction and wo n't move out you have to go through a court process then eventually get the sheriff to come out and forcibly remove them from the property which they are treating like crap because they are mad at you all the while not paying rent or letting you re let the place the tenant is n't maintaining the lawn and the hoa is getting on your butt about it do you pay someone to mow the grass for them and then try to squeeze the money out of the tenant who never agreed to pay for that   you rent to a college kid who has never lived on their own and has adopted you as their new parent figure the light in the closet went out can you come replace the bulb tenants flat out lying to your face of course i do n't have any pets that i did n't pay the deposit for pics all over facebook of their kids playing with a dog in the pet free house

use one journal entry and split the expenses into the appropriate accounts this can happen even if you never mix business and personal on the same receipt say you order office supplies which where i live are immediately deductible as an expense and software or hardware which must be depreciated because they are assets on the same order we have an account called proprietors loan which represents money the company is lending to the humans who own it or that the humans are lending to the company were i to pay for my personal lunch on a business credit card it would go through that account increasing the amount the company has lent me or decreasing the amount i have lent it similarly if i made a business purchase with a personal card it would go through that account in the other direction where i live i can lend my company all the money i want any time but if the company lends me money there ca n't be an outstanding balance over the corporate year end if you make two credit card entries of 5 and 10 when you go to reconcile your accounts it will be harder because you 'll have to realize they together match the single 15 line on your statement making a single entry your a option will make reconciling your statement much easier and that way you 'll probably reconcile your statements which is vital to knowing you actually recorded everything

i think the consensus is that you ca n't afford a home now and need to build more of a down payment 20 is benchmark you may also need to pay mortgage insurance if you are below that and all considered it takes up too much of your monthly budget you did n't do anything wrong but as mentioned by ben you are missing some monthly and yearly costs with home ownership   i suggest visiting a bank or somewhere like banker to discuss accurate costs and regulations in your area i know the feeling of considering paying more now for the very attractive thought of owning a home in 30 years after interest you need to consider that you are paying almost double the initial principle so do n't rush for something you can do a year or two down the line as a major commitment   one major point that is n't emphasized in the current answers you have a large family two children a dog and a cat   i do n't know the kid 's ages but given you are in your early twenties and your estimated monthly costs they are probably very young before the point they really put any stress financially but you need to budget them in exponentially some quick figures from experience closing costs including inspections mortgage origination fee lawyer fees checking the history of the home for liens etc which will set you back minimum 5 depending on the type of purchase short sales foreclosures are more expensive because they take longer insurance home and flood will depend on your zoning but you can expect anywhere between $ 100 300 a month for many zones it is mandatory   also depending on if it 's a coop $ 800 + + or a townhouse type you will need to pay different levels of monthly maintenance for the as a cooperative fee   at an estimate of a 250 k home all your savings will not be able to cover your closing costs and all 250k will need to be part of your base mortgage so your base monthly mortgage payment at around 4 will be $ 1,200 a month it 's too tight   if it was a friend i would highly suggest against buying in this case to preserve financial flexibility and sanity at such a young age

i ’m not an expert on the visa us tax or insurance but you 're making enough mistakes in terms of all the associated costs involved in owning and renting houses apartments that this already looks potentially unwise at this stage of your investment career renting cheap properties to students involves the property constantly being trashed often being empty and requiring extremely close management which you either have to pay someone a lot to do or do yourself and lose other potential earning time if doing yourself you will also make lots of mistakes in the vetting managing marketing process etc at first as this is a complex art in itself   costs on this type of rental can often get as high as 25 a year depending exactly how lucky you get even if you do it all yourself and will typically be in the 5 15 range every year once everything you have to constantly maintain replace and is up that 's all pre what you could be earning in a job etc so if you could earn a decent clip elsewhere in the same time also have to deduct that lost potential send it all to third parties so all upkeep by hired contractors all renting by an agency you will be lucky to even break even off a year per property rents to students you ’re not seeming to price in any transaction costs which usually run at ~5 a time for both entrance and exit that s between half and one years rent gone from the ten per property on these numbers sell before ten is up its even more on point three rounding projections in house price rises to one decimal place is total gibberish no one who actually has experience investing their own money well ever makes or relies on claims like this no idea on pittsburgh market but sound projections of likely asset changes is always a ranged and figure that can not and should n’t be counted on for much even if it was it ’s also completely unattainable in property because you have to spend so much money on upkeep post costs and changes in size standard house values generally roughly track inflation have a look at this chart and play around with some reasonable yearly upkeep numbers and you will see what i mean renting property is an absolute for inexperienced investors and if you do n't know the stuff above already and it 's less than 10 of what you need to know to do this profitably vs other uses of your time you will nearly always be better off investing the money in more passive investments like diversified bonds reits and stock

in almost all cases gifts from employers are considered taxable compensation based on the employer employee nature of the relationship furthermore cash gifts are always considered to be intended as wages regardless of how you receive the money furthermore regardless of whether you expect to receive anything in return such as contractual consideration or whether the amounts are large enough to be declared as taxable personal gifts it is likely that the irs would consider these payments to be disguised wages as these payments would fail several tests that the irs uses to determine whether benefits provided by the employer are non taxable including i 'd recommend reviewing irs publication 535 here as well as publication here for more on what constitutes taxable wages benefits it seems very unlikely to me that you could make a persuasive legal defense in which you claimed to be working full time for $ 60.00 per year and just happened to be receiving large personal gifts of $ in my opinion it seems much more likely that these payments would be found to be taxable wages for services rendered

suppose that i work from home but do not qualify for a business use    of home deduction as i understand it this means i can not deduct    trips from home to another work location e.g. going to a client 's    home or office to do work there i do not think this is true you can not deduct trips to your main business location i.e. you can not deduct trips to your office or client 's location if this is your main client and you routinely work on site however if you only visit your clients on occasion for specific events while doing your routine work at home you can definitely deduct those trips the deduction of the home usage itself has nothing to do with it however there 's a different reason they refer to pub your home must qualify as principal place of business even if it does n't qualify for deduction the qualifications of principal place of business are described in pub if for some personal reason you do not go directly from one location to the other you can not deduct more than the amount it would have cost you to go directly from the first location to the second what is not clear to me is what exactly is deductible if there are    significant time gaps within a single day between trips to different    clients you got it right what this quote means is that if you have client a and client b and you drive from a to b you can only deduct the travel between a and b nothing else i.e. if you have 2 hours to kill and you take a trip to the mall you can not deduct the mileage attributable to that trip you only deduct the actual distance between a and b as it would be had you driven from a to b directly the example you cite re first client being considered as the place of business is for the case where your home does n't qualify as principal place of business in this case you start counting miles from your first client and only for direct trips from client to client if you only have 1 client in that day tough luck nothing to deduct also it 's not clear whether between clients would really be    personal reasons since the appointment times are often set by the    client so it 's not as if the delay between a and b was just because i    felt like it there was never the option of going directly from a to    b. that 's what is called facts and circumstances you can argue that you had enough time between meetings to go back to your home office to continue working the irs agent auditing you and you 're likely to get audited will consider that maybe will accept it maybe not if i had a gap like that described above i could save on my taxes by    going to the park or a hamburger stand instead of going home between a    and b but then you would n't be at home so why would it be principal place of business if you 're not there boom lost deduction for the trip to the first client i suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state you 're dealing with deductions that are considered red flags for the irs i.e. many people believe that these deductions business use of your home car trigger audits to substantiate business use of your car you need to keep very good track of your travels literally travel log they sell them at staples and make sure to distinguish between personal travel and business travel keep proofs that the meetings took place although keeping a log is a requirement it can be faked so if audited the irs will want to see more than your own documentation a good tax adviser will educate you on all these rules and also clarify the complexities you were asking about here i 'm not a tax adviser so do n't rely on this answer when you 're preparing your tax return or responding to the irs audit in your edit you ask this specifically what i 'm wondering is whether it is possible for a home    to qualify as a principal place of business for purposes of    deducting car expenses but not for the home office deduction the answer is yes deductibility is determined by exclusivity of use among other things but the fact that you manage your business from your kitchen does n't make your kitchen any less of a principal place of business it is non deductible because you also cook your dinners there but it is still nonetheless your principal place of business the pub which i linked to has these qualifications your home office will qualify as your principal place of business if    you meet the following requirements you use it exclusively and regularly for administrative or management activities of your trade or business you have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities of your trade or business as you see exclusivity of the usage of your home area is not a requirement here the exclusively and regularly in the quote refers to your business not using any other location and managing it from home regularly i.e. if you manage your business a day in a year that 's not enough for it to be considered principal if you manage your business from your office and your home you can not consider home as principal

that is absolute rubbish   warren buffet follows simple value and tenants that literally anyone could follow if they had the discipline to do so   i have never once heard of an investment made by warren buffet that was n't rooted in fundamentals and easy to understand   the concept is fairly simple as is the math buying great companies trading at discounts to what they are worth due to market fluctuations or to key sectors etc   if i buy abc corp at $ 10 knowing it is worth $ 20 it could go down or trade sideways for five years doing seemingly nothing and then one day catch up with its worth due to any number of factors   in that case my 100 return which took five years to accounts for an average 20 return per year   also and this should be obvious but diversification is a double edged sword   every year hundreds of stocks individually beat the market return   owning any one of these stocks as your only holding would mean that you beat the market   as you buy more stocks and diversify your return will get closer and closer to that of an index or mutual fund   my advice is to stick to fundamentals like value and investing learn to separate when the market is being silly from when it is responding to a genuine concern do your own homework and analysis on the stocks you buy be patient after buying stock that your analysis gives you confidence in and do n't over diversify   if you do these things congrats   you are warren buffet

mathematically it seems like the expected rate of return whatever that might be is the same for both an aggressive strategy is higher risk and higher reward a conservative strategy is lower risk and lower reward that is not true   roughly the mathematical of higher risk and higher reward is higher standard deviation and higher mean   in other words the aggressive strategy does have a higher expected rate of return higher mean   its disadvantage is that it has a higher likelihood of incurring intermediate losses and/or higher magnitude of intermediate losses on the way this is illustrated with the following chart   from vanguard you can see that the average return is greater the riskier the portfolio i.e. the more allocated to stocks relative to bonds but this higher average return comes at the price of a greater range of possible returns   with an aggressive portfolio you take a greater risk of losses at any given moment for a greater chance of gains over a long period given this it should be obvious why the advice is to be aggressive early on   early in life you do n't care about whether your current position is up or down because you 're not taking the money out   if your portfolio is down you just leave the money in there until it goes back up again   later in life you need to spend the money you now care about whether your current position is up or down because you ca n't afford to wait out a down market and may have to realize a loss by selling it 's important to note that the expected return is always greater for a higher risk portfolio as is the expected risk the expected rate of return does n't magically change as you age   what changes is your ability to absorb losses to hold out for later gains

ebitda is in my opinion not a useful measure for an investor looking to buy shares on the stock market it is more useful for private businesses open to changing their structuring or looking to sell significant parts of their business one of the main benefits of reporting earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization is that it presents the company as it would look to a potential buyer consider that net income as a metric includes interest costs taxes and depreciation   interest costs are to put it simply a result of multiplying a business 's debt by its interest rate if you own a business and personally guarantee the loan that the company has with the bank your interest rates might be artificially low if you have a policy of reaching high debt levels relative to your equity in order to achieve high financial leveraging your interest cost might be artificially high either way if i bought your business my debt structure could be completely different and therefore your interest costs are not particularly relevant to me a potential buyer instead i should attempt to anticipate what my own interest costs would be under my plans for your business taxes are a result of many factors including the corporate structure of the business if you run your business as a sole proprietorship ie no corporation but i want to buy it under my corporation then my tax rates could look nothing like yours or if we operated in multiple jurisdictions etc etc instead of using your taxes as an estimate for mine i should anticipate my taxes based on my plans for your business depreciation amortization is a measure that estimates how much of a business 's fixed assets were used up during the year ie how much wear and tear occurred on your fleet of trucks it is generally calculated as a of your overall asset value it is a very loose proxy for the cash costs which will ultimately be incurred to make repairs replacements is also something which could significantly change if a business changes hands if the value of your building is much higher now than when you bought it i will have higher costs than you because i will be recording a of total costs higher than yours and therefore i should forecast my own removing these costs from net income is not particularly relevant for a casual stock investor because these costs will not change when you buy shares whatever ibm 's interest cost is reflects the debt structuring policy that the company currently has therefore when you buy a share in ibm you should consider the impact that interest has on net income similarly for taxes and they reflect costs to the business that impact the company 's ability to pay you a dividend and therefore you should look at net income which includes those costs why would a business with good net income and good ebitda report ebitda because ebitda will always be higher than net income why say $ 10 m net income when you could say $ 50 m ebitda the fact is it 's easy to report and is generally well understood so why not report it when it also makes you look better from a purely big number = good perspective i 'm not sure that reporting ebitda implies any sort of manipulative reporting but it would seem that warren buffet feels this is a risk
