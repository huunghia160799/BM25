if you 're worried about the account number just take a statement and black out the account number with a or the like   that is if the account number even appears on it these days it often does n't

giving out your bank account number is not generally a security problem   the first time you write your landlord a security deposit or rent check he 'll have your account number   it 's printed on the check that having been said in my experience banks do not generally give out balance information to just anyone who calls them up and gives them an account number   have you asked the landlord what he needs   perhaps showing him a printout of a recent bank statement is enough

have you been rejected from a rental for a specific reason leading to this question   landlords are in the business of exchanging space for regular payments with no drama   anything they ask in an application should be something to minimize the risk of drama    the happy path optimistic goal is that you pay your rent by the due date every month   if your income is not sufficient for this demonstrating you have assets and would be able to pay for the full term of the lease is part of the decision to enter into the lease with you    in the non happy path say you fall off the face of the earth before ending the lease   the landlord could be owed several months of rent and could pursue a legal judgment on your assets   with a court order they can make the bank pay out what is owed having bank information reduces the landlord 's cost and research efforts in the event the story has to this point in the jargon of landlording this means the tenant is collectable   while of course you could have zeroed out your accounts or moved money to a bank you did n't tell the landlord in the meantime if you are not the bad actor in this story you probably would n't have    if you get any kind of sense about a landlord or property at all there is probably a better rental situation in your city   you also want to minimize drama   if the landlord is operating like a business they 're not in this to perform identity theft   if the landlord is sloppy or has sloppy office workers that would be different    in the event sharing your asset information truly bothers you and the money is for rental expense anyway you could offer to negotiate a 1 year prepaid rental of course knock another off for time value of money and lower risk to landlord if you 're sure you would n't want to leave early

i think you would be better asking about what things could increase in value even the given example houses are not certain to increase in value in fact one of the key causal factors of this recession imho is that no one realized that partly because there have been few recent housing busts and also the illusory effect of inflation that made it seem like houses always increase in value   i once heard it described that rich people tend to get richer because they spend more of their money on things that are more likely to hold their value or appreciate houses art etc as opposed to poor people who spend the majority of their money on consumables like rent utilities food cars etc

you could certainly look at the holdings of index funds and choose index funds that meet your qualifications   funds allow you to see their holdings and in most cases you can tell from the description whether certain companies would qualify for their fund or not based on that description particularly if you have a small set of companies that would be problems you could also pick a fund category that is industry specific i invest in part in a healthcare focused fund for example   pick a few industries that are relatively diverse from each other in terms of topics but are still specific in terms of industry a healthcare fund a commodities fund an reit fund   then you could be confident that they were n't investing in defense contractors or big banks or whatever you object to however if you do n't feel like you know enough to filter on your own and want the diversity from non industry specific funds your best option is likely a socially screened fund like is likely your best option given there are many similar funds in that area you might simply pick the one that is most similar to you in philosophy

the w4 specifies withholding for income taxes fica taxes are not impacted the tax withholding is do that you do not need to make estimated tax payments failing to make sufficient quarterly estimated tax payments or withholding a sufficient amount could result in you being hit with under payment penalties but nothing more the under payment penalties will be figured out as part of you income tax return   what you should have done when you discovered this was use the extra withholding line on the w4 to further increase your withholding the nice thing about withholding is that you back load it and the irs does not care   the company has no liability here it is your responsibility to update them when your personal circumstances change you will be fully responsible for the tax bill   there is no company paid portion of your income tax so they are not impacted the company only pays an employer share of fica and that is not impacted by how you fill out the w4 first thing to do is figure out how much you owe the irs then determine if you can pay it or if you need to investigate an installment option in any case make sure to file your return on time

i 'll answer this question why do intraday traders close their position at then end of day while most gains can be done overnight buy just before the market close and sell just after it opens is this observation true for other companies or is it specific to apple intraday traders often trade shares of a company using intraday leverage provided by their firm for every $ 5000 dollars they actually have they may be trading with $ 100,000 leverage as an example since a stock can also decrease in value substantially while the markets are closed intraday traders are not allowed to keep their highly leveraged positions opened probabilities fail in a random walk scenario and only one failure can bankrupt you and the firm

i 'm not an expert on hft but order cancellation is not an indicator of front running   let 's say you are willing to post 1000 shares at 25.00 someone jumps in and takes 500 from past trading analysis you know that this is indicative of a larger order say because of the speed of the execution you expect another 10000 shares to follow this will push up the price because the demand curve has changed if you leave your remaining 500 shares listed at 25 they will be lifted and the price will move up to say this is not shady order this is rational response to new information about demand for the stock and not wanting to get screwed for selling at a lower price than equilibrium    or i think this is a valid example but again not an expert here say you are willing to sell 100 shares you do n't know where the buys will be routed so you post your 100 on multiple platforms when one gets lifted you cancel the others   frankly the best argument against hft is the billions of dollars being poured into infrastructure of questionable economic utility   or at the very least diminishing marginal utility but all this front running nonsense is just that

i 'll use similar logic to dave ramsey to answer this question because this is a popular question when we 're talking about paying off any debt early   also consider this tweet and what it means for student loans to you they 're debt to the government they 're assets if you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost would you borrow money at interest rate to obtain a degree   put it in the housing way if you paid off your home would you pull out an equity loan line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings   i ca n't answer the question for you or anyone else as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either i can tell you two observations i 've made about this question it comes a lot with housing over time   first it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0 interest rate credit cards to buy stocks or float bills for a while   how quickly people forget what it feels and looks like when you see your financial assets drop 50 60   it 's not wall street that 's greedy it 's most average investors   second people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action as carnegie said concentration is the key to wealth and concentrating your financial energy on something instead of throwing it all over the place can simplify your life   this is one reason why lottery winners do n't keep their winnings their financial behavior was rotten before winning and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior   even if you get paid a lot or little that 's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else like money happiness peace of mind etc follows

is a student loan a type of loan or just a generic name used to refer to a loan for someone who is going back to school a student loan from the federal government is a specific type of loan used for education purposes i.e. attending college they have guidelines associated with them that are very flexible as compared to a student loan from a private bank   if a student loan is a different type of loan does it only cover the costs of going to the school every student at a university has a budget or the cost of attendance that includes direct and indirect costs direct costs are ones billed directly to you i.e. tuition room and board should you choose to live on campus and associated fees indirect costs are such things like books travel expenses if you live out of state and personal things direct costs are controlled by the school indirect costs are estimated the school will usually conduct market research to determine the costs for indirect items some students go above that and some go below for example transportation is an indirect cost a school could set that at $ 500 there are students who will be above that and some below that if you choose not to live on campus then rent and food will become an indirect cost student loans can cover up to 100 of your budget direct and indirect added together if your total budget is $ 60,000 tuition room and board transportation books supplies etc then you are able to borrow up to that amount $ 60,000 however because your budget is both direct and indirect costs you will only be billed for your direct costs tuition etc so if your direct costs equal $ 50,000 and your student loan was certified for $ 60,000 then you will get that $ 10,000 back in the form of a refund from the school that does not mean you do n't have to pay it back you still do but that money is meant for indirect costs i.e. books rent if you 're not staying on campus etc if your school is on semesters vs quarters then that amount is divided between the terms summer term is not factored in that 's another process also with student loans there are origination costs the money associated with processing a loan   a good rule of thumb is to never borrow more than you need   source i used to work in financial aid at my college

the failure of the facebook ipo has everything to do with public access to markets it certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many armchair analysts in on it less investors got in on facebook at $ 38 + because they liked facebook and everyone they knew liked facebook by and large they could n't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money as such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss very few if any professionals actually it at launch and more than one pro shorted the position and cleaned up i find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice say what you want about the finance industry but for the vast majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option

i have my own top 10 list coming straight from the management of   1 values    i write a lot on this blog about the importance of values and i feel there is no exception here   fundamentally believes in human equality and the importance of each individual otherwise there is no way he could commit to such a mission   these values originated from him but they 've now throughout the organization and every individual believes in them   2 consistency   this is an extension of values because when your values are solid and clear your behaviors and actions will flow from that   there are no contradictory policies that would confuse employees   everyone is equal and all aspects of the organization from salary profit sharing job titles power working hours leadership and vacations reflect that   3 peer pressure   there is nothing more effective for keeping order than peer pressure   all the rules in the world ca n’t replace the power of your friends and colleagues holding you accountable   it ’s much more meaningful than a top down approach   the pressure is real it has teeth since peers can come together and fire employees that are n’t doing their job   4 profit sharing   touchy open management is nothing without something real to back it up and 23 pre tax profit sharing is as real as it gets   everyone is motivated because they know they will get rewarded for their hard work and it also ensures that peer pressure is working well   they also get creative with this giving employees the option of deferring 25 of their salary until the end of the year at which time they might get a bonus resulting in a 150 of their original salary depending on the business unit ’s performance   5   giving people freedom and responsibility without the tools to get things done is a recipe for disaster   all opinions are heard and there is value in the work of every employee nobody has an excuse for why they ca n’t get things done   6 small business units   each business unit is small enough so that everyone involved understands everything that is going on and the outcomes no way people can self organize if a unit is hundreds of people large the magic number for the maximum effective size for a group is 150 and will not allow a business unit to go beyond that   7 total transparency   goes to great lengths to ensure everyone knows how their financials are even to the extent of displaying them in an easy to understand cartoon there are no secrets and this demonstrates trust and respect   8 no symbols of inequality   there are no offices with huge windows reserved parking spaces or other symbols that clearly show differences between employees everyone plays by the same rules and everyone feels valued   9 purpose   purpose is the cheapest way to align an organization   when everybody feels their works is valuable they know why they are doing it and take pride in it things naturally align themselves everyone feels like they are part of something important   10 long term thinking private company   can you change corporate culture in a few days months even not particularly if it is deeply ingrained   also how quickly do managers resort to short term solutions such as layoffs budget cuts or other forms of control to try and reduce expenses the moment things go badly even under deep pressure the company must stay the course and believe in the value of the open system   you can bend but you ca n’t break and revert to old school management with private companies this is probably a lot easier than with public companies that are measured on quarterly performance   full post here

after reading their full guarantee page it seems that they really do n't understand the definition of the word they do n't seem to offer any guarantee but rather just a list of reasons that they believe their plan is foolproof mostly they argue that their lawyers have covered every angle and a lot of big players use them so naturally everyone will respect the value of their online currency nowhere do they address what happens if their company goes belly up which is the primary thing i 'd be worried about with this type of thing ironically they specifically state on their guarantee page many first rate payment systems tried to guarantee their stability but    unfortunately failed to fulfill their obligations given to the users    and contractors myopic investment policy and court claims of tax    agencies have frequently adversely affected the work of electronic    payment systems which personally would make me even more nervous to use their system their guarantee amounts to other systems have crashed and burned but we are smarter than those guys and even hired lawyers to confirm it

one issue which i do n't see addressed in the answers so far is how to structure bank accounts to get the highest return possible what you 're describing sounds like a certificate of deposit cd ranging from 1 for 9 months to 2.3 for 5 years there is a concept which was once more common called a cd ladder which still allows you to access your money while also giving you the highest interest rate offered by the bank    to set one up you divide your account into 5 equal parts then open 5 cds with different periods 1 5 years   each time a new cd matures once a year you purchase another 5 year cd with those funds plus any new money you want to save    thus you 're getting a higher and higher rate until all of your accounts are earning the 5 year cd rate and you 're never more than a year away from getting money out of the account if a need comes up

when you start investing makes a very large difference to the outcome but that is on the time scale of what generation you were born into not what week you choose to open your 401(k   as you note in your last sentence there is nothing that you can do about this so there is no point in worrying about it if you could successfully market time successfully then that would make a difference even at smaller time scales   but you probably ca n't so there is no point in worrying about that either as points out your statement about not their net worth until 2013 applies to someone who invested a lump sum at the 2007 peak not to someone who invested continuously throughout    by my calculation if you started continuously investing in a broad market index at the peak around jun 4 2007 you would have recovered your net worth relative to investing in a safe instrument that merely kept up with inflation a hard thing to find these days around april 12 2010   i 've done the computation on each business day because that is easier so it might be slightly worse if do the periodic investment on each payday which is much more realist for a 401(k and of course if you need to preserve recover you net worth in 3 years you should n't be in stocks in the first place

i 've considered simply moving my funds to an australian bank to lock in the current rate but i worry that this will put me at risk of a substantial loss due to exchange rates transfer fees etc when i move my funds back into the us in 6 months   why move funds back   if you want to lock in current exchange rates figure out how much money you are likely to spend in australia for the next six months   move just enough funds to cover that to an australian bank   leave the remainder in the united states us as your future expenses will be in us dollars    so long as you do n't find some major unanticipated purchase this covers you   you have enough money for the next six months with no exchange rate worries    at the end of the six months if you fall slightly short cover with your credit card as you are doing now   you 'll take a loss but on a small amount of money   if you have a slight excess and you were right about the exchange rate you 'll make a little profit at the end   if you were wrong you 'll take a small loss    the key here is that you should be able to budget for your six months   you can lock in current exchange rates just for that amount of money    moving all your funds to australia is a gamble   you can certainly do that if you want but rather than gambling it may be better to take the sure thing   you know you need six months expenses so just move that   you will definitely be spending six months money in australia so you are immune to exchange rate fluctuations for that period   the remainder of your money can stay in the us as that 's where you plan to spend it    however recent political events back in the states have me and i 'm sure every currency speculator and foreign investor worried that this advantage will not last for much longer   if currency speculators expect exchange rates to fall then they 'd have already bid down the rates   i.e. they 'd keep speculating until the rates did fall   so the speculators expect the current rates are correct otherwise they 'd move them    donald trump 's state goal is to increase exports relative to imports   if he 's successful this could cause the us dollar to fall to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive   however if his policies fail then the opposite is likely to happen   most of his announced trade policies are more likely to increase the value of the dollar than to decrease it   in particular that is the likely result of increased tariffs    if you are worried about trump failing then you should worry about a strong dollar   that 's more in line with actual speculation since the election    i do n't know that i 'd make a strong bet in either direction   hedging makes more sense to me as it simply locks in the current situation which you apparently find favorable   not hedging at all might produce some profit if the dollar goes up   gambling all your funds might produce some profit if the dollar goes down   the middle path of hedging just what you 're spending is the safest if least likely to produce profit    my recommendation is to hedge the six months expenses and enjoy your time abroad   why worry about political events that you ca n't control   enjoy your working studying vacation

unless you have a good handle on what niches the startups of were entering i think it is hard to get a handle on why there is a decline   is this a decline in the number of restaurants being started or is this a decline in the number of internet startups   the reasons will depend on the character of the startups   one trend i think is pretty common is the decline of the local market   the internet and free shipping makes the internet the growth area for specialized commerce   so many commerce niches are threatened it would take a real to consider a start up in a niche that is essentially being the local distributor for something people can get more cheaply on line     then there is the idea that   local does n't mean the same thing as it did   even 30 years ago as people drive further to get the essentials at big box stores   a declining main street of a small town or a declining mall in the suburbs is n't an attractive place to be an entrepreneur   on the other hand competing in the big box strip on the edge of town has its own challenge   people are shopping at hr and you need a huge storefront   and/or a huge advertising budget even to get noticed     if the decline is in the number of restaurant startups   it might be that this is related to a decline in disposable income    if it is a decline in internet startups   perhaps it is just showing a maturing of the industry from a fast growth phase where all sorts of unfilled niches were open for the quick entrepreneur to a more mature market where the internet is consolidating with a few behemoths taking up all the oxygen

yeah the biggest problem with this is that it far more heavily taxes the poor than the rich   poor people spend all of their income   month to month living paycheck to paycheck poor people have no choice but to spend their entire incomes on basic necessities utilities etc   rich people on the other hand spend very little of their incomes   most of it gets stashed in and overseas holdings and does n't really change hands in a way that allows it to be taxed under this style of tax structure   so your tax continuously hits 100 of the wealth of the bottom of households while largely bypassing the rich folks who have more money than they can   in short this kind of tax structure is really bad for anyone who does n't make $ a year and store most of their wealth in stocks and so forth   if you want to help the general public households making less than $ 300k year you need to generate more tax revenue from investments and capital   a 2 tax say on stock trades valued over $ 10,000 obviously would n't hurt poor people at all and also would n't really hurt the rich   cuz if you 've got 10 grand or a hundred or thousand or whatever to stash in shares of amazon or whatever you 're really not gon na miss the $ 200 that comes off the top of your trade   but this would generate huge tax revenue as there are thousands of such transfers a day

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

which option will save you the most money in the long run that is tough assuming you stay healthy do n't lose your job do n't experience a pay cut or any major emergency that drains your savings then applying the $ 6000 to the higher interest loan will save you more money in the long run however the difference in savings is a few hundred dollars not much really so in this case i 'd put the $ 6k towards the smaller loan why because then you 'd pay it off faster once that 's done you open up your cash flow by the minimum monthly payment you would have had on that loan   assuming they both have the same or similar number of months left by paying the smaller loan off sooner you 'd open up $ x month where $ x is your minimum monthly payment this could be useful to you if you want to take on some other debt like buying a house because it lowers your debt to income ratio if you put that money towards the higher loan your dti wo n't change until the normal time you would have paid off the smaller loan even if you are not looking to purchase anything that requires you to have a lower dti paying the smaller loan off sooner increases your cash flow sooner because your monthly payment on the higher loan does n't change just because you lowered the balance by $ 6k so you 'd be more robust to emergencies if your current income does n't allow for much savings a major emergency could wipe out all savings from paying down the bigger balance so i 'd suggest edit asked a question pretty much requesting more details for why i was biased towards paying off the smaller loan first what follows is my response with a bit of reorganization typically people asking these questions do n't have so much wealth that which loan to pay first is an academic question they need to make smart financial decisions while paying the highest interest loan saves the most money in interest that only occurs under the assumption that nothing bad will ever happen to you until the loans are paid off in reality other things happen tires blow out children get sick you get laid off and so the best thing to do is the one that maximizes your long term financial health even if it comes at the expense of a few $ k more interest each loan has a minimum monthly payment let 's assume barring any windfalls of additional cash you will just make the minimum payments each month towards a loan if you pay off the smaller loan first that increases your available monthly cash flow at that point you can put extra towards the other loan however if an emergency should come up or you need to save for a vacation you can do that without negatively impacting the second loan because you 'd just drop back to its minimum payment putting the money towards the higher balance loan would mean it takes you longer to reach this point as the time to reach payoff on the first loan will not change $ 6k only reduces the $ loan to $ so you never gain the flexibility of additional cash flow until the time you would have paid off the $ originally i 'd rather have a few hundred dollars each month that i can choose to use to make additional loan payments eat out pay for car repairs pay for emergencies than be forced to dip into credit or worse pay day loans should an emergency happen

ianal but i had heard and would appreciate someone more qualified commenting on this that one reason these things were often found unenforceable is that there is no consideration   the contract is to bind you for your work each day but once you stop working they you have a continued obligation that your time at the company   claiming that your day to day compensation covers this is as if to say some part of that compensation is not for your work but to pay you for not going elsewhere   it would be nice to see at minimum a requirement to separate these two concepts into separate contracts as bundling them creates a blur and most importantly does n't allow you to negotiate or walk away from the terms of one part without the other   at the heart of any market which the job market purports to be is a sense that a fair price is reached when both parties can walk away from a bad deal this is not so in the case of employment because as said a hungry man is not a free man so someone who needs to eat or feed a family has a need to take an offer that is already their acceptance of work and this quasi duress is compounded when a company can attach additional pressures that work that person 's ability to fairly negotiate possible improvements of what may already have been a bad situation   i 'm of the impression that duress itself has been argued to be a reason to hold a contract invalid   but more and generally any time two parties are bargaining i 'm not sure the legal definition but intuitively i 'd say where one party has the ability to force a contract change and the other party is not then those terms have to be suspect   also for the special case the pay is anything near minimum wage i would suggest asking the question of whether the part of the compensation that is salary not keeping you from working for the competition is the wage paid consistent with minimum wage or does it have to draw from the pool of money that is not about wage but is about incentivizing you to not move   and finally if they stop paying you and each day you 've been paid a little to work and a little to incentivize you to leave then are you getting a continued revenue stream to continue to incentivize you not to work for the competition if not there would seem again not to be consideration   as i said i 'm not an expert in this i just follow such matters sometimes in the news but i do n't see these issues getting discussed here and i hope we 'll see some useful responses from the crowd here and also the smart folks at reddit can help through their discussions to form some useful political and legal to help individuals overcome what is really a moral outrage on this matter   capitalism is an often cruel engine   i worked at a company where one of the bosses said to me after contributing really great things that added structurally in fundamental ways to the company do n't tell me what you 've done tell me what you 've done lately capitalism makes people scrap every day to prove their worth so it 's morally an outrage to see it also trying even as it beats down the price of someone and tells them they are n't entitled to better to tell them that they may not go somewhere else that thinks they are better that is not competition and it is not fair     indentured servitude not slavery is more technically correct and yet it is a push to treat people like capital so slavery is not inappropriate   the topic is non competes but really it 's about businesses not wanting to have to compete for employees that is about businesses not wanting capitalism to prevail in hiring   sorry for the length

assuming that no one else has hit the ask and the asks are still there yes you will fill $ as long as you did n't exhaust that ask actually there is no current price at which the stock is exchanging hands in reality it is the last price traded the somebody who negotiated prices between buyers sellers is the exchange through their handling of bids asks   the real negotiation comes between bids asks and if they meet or cross a trade occurs it 's not that both bid ask should be $ it 's that they were to answer the title the reasons why the bid and ask even their midpoint move away from the last price are largely unknown but at least for the market makers if their sell inventory is going away people are buying heavily and they 're running out of inventory they will start to hike up their asks a lot and their bids a little because market makers try to stay market neutral having no opinion on whether an asset will rise or fall so with stocks that means having a balanced inventory of longs shorts   they want to sometimes have to depending on the exchange accommodate the buying pressure but they do n't want to lose money so they simply raise the ask and then raise the bid as people hit their asks since their average cost basis has risen in fact yahoo finance is great about showing this there 's rarely 1 bid and 1 ask   take a look at bac 's limit book you can see that there are many bids and many asks   if one ask is exhausted the next in line is now the highest   the market maker who just sold at x will certainly step over the highest bid to bid at to get an 11 return on investment

first read the fine print if you have to pay it pay it and switch company if you do n't have to pay it and there is no proof that you abused the component beyond normal usage you do n't have to sue them just return the invoice with legal not so layman text like i hereby reject paying invoice number xxxx dated xxx because the black box was used under normal conditions and it stopped working in this case you wait for them and answer every other letter with the same text until the decide to either sue you or drop the whole thing if you choose this path remember to save all invoice copies of your all written email phone calls of the broken item serial contract etc if they sue you and they loose ca n't prove the item was by you they have to pay you up to one hour of legal advice cost and drop the invoice if you loose you do the same 100 pounds plus the invoice amount according to swedish law do n't know about your country before you follow any advice here consult your local consumer protection agency they usually comes up with smart options they know a bad company with history and give you the right advice

because it 's not cheaper it 's virtually free to run a private chain no transaction fees no competition for mining it does n't require even a of a fraction of the maintenance resources and you maintain total operational control over it bitcoin could crash it 's encryption could be broken 100 's of things could change which would totally your internal infrastructure lastly if you want you can destroy the chain say if you are sharing private documents with another legal firm you can destroy the chain when the case is done the documents wo nt be floating in a public chain for perpetuity   the mega chain is a very stupid idea because it forces everything to be hosted by everyone which very quickly loses feasibility instead you will likely see an increase in very specific use case chains

is it any different than if i decide to put similar amount of money in 401(k at some other time of the year   not from a tax standpoint but if can affect a few other things since the earnings difference is likely negligible you miss out on returns for only a few months i would look at other conditions   in the long run it probably wo n't make much difference but knocking out obstacles to wealth building can give you a sense of accomplishment that will encourage smart money decisions going forward

immediately move your roth ira out of edward jones and into a discount broker like scottrade ameritrade fidelity vanguard schwab or e trade   edward jones will be charging you a large fraction of your money probably at least 1 explicitly and maybe another 1 in hidden ish fees like the 12b-1   do n't give away several percent of your savings every year when you can have an account for free   places like edward jones are appropriate only for people who are unwilling to learn about personal finance and happy to pay dearly as a result   move your money by contacting the new broker then requesting that they get your money out of edward jones   they will be happy to do so the right way   do n't try and get the money out yourself continue to contribute to your roth as long as your tax bracket is low   saving on taxes is a critically important part of being financially wise   you can spend your contributions not gains out of your roth for any reason without penalty if you want need to   when your tax bracket is higher look at traditional ira 's instead to minimize your current tax burden   for more accessible ways of saving open a regular non tax advantaged brokerage account invest in diversified and low cost funds   look at the expense ratios and minimize your portfolio 's total expense   higher fee funds generally do not earn the money they take from you avoid all funds that have a nonzero 12b-1 fee generally speaking your best bet is buying index funds from fidelity vanguard schwab or their close competitors   or buying cheap etf 's    any discount brokerage will allow you to do this in both your roth and regular accounts   remember the reason you buy funds is to get instant diversification not because you are willing to gamble that your mutual funds will outperform the market   head to the bogleheads forum for more specific advice about 3 fund portfolios and similar suggested investment strategies like the lazy portfolios   the folks in the forums there like to give specific advice that 's not appropriate here if you use a non tax advantaged account for investing buy and sell in a tax smart way   at the end of the year sell your poor performing stocks or funds and use the loss as a tax write off   then rebalance back to a good portfolio   or if your tax bracket is very low sell the winners and lock in the gains at low tax rates   try to hold things more than a year so you are taxed at the long term capital gains rate rather than the short term only when you have several million dollars then look at making individual investments rather than funds   in a non tax advantaged account owning the assets directly will help you write off losses against your taxes   but either way it takes several million dollars to make the transactions costs of maintaining a portfolio lower than the fees a cheap mutual index fund will charge

just to argue the other side 1.49 is pretty low for a loan let 's say you have the $ 15k cash but decide to get the car loan at 1.49 then you take the rest of the money and invest it in something that pays a ~4 dividend a utility stock etc you 're making money on the difference of course there 's no guarantee that the underlying stock wo n't drop in value but it might go up too and you 'll likely pay income tax on the dividends still you have a good chance of making money by taking the loan so i will argue that there are scenarios where taking advantage of a low interest rate loan can be good as an investment opportunity when the risk reward is acceptable be careful though there 's nothing wrong with paying cash for a car

this is an opinion but i think it has more to do with the market 's uncertainty about the long term future of the company without steve jobs   apple has n't released anything more than incremental upgrades to its existing product lines since jobs passed and while some people would argue about the apple watch jobs played a significant role in its development prior to his death so that does n't really count whether you like or hate apple you had to admire jobs passion and creativity and there 's real question as to whether the company can sustain its dominance in the market without the jobs vision over the long haul   my guess is that the market is leaning slightly toward the no column but only ever so slightly   the company continues to deliver fantastic results but how long will that last of their next products do n't wow consumers the way previous ones have   this skepticism manifests itself in a stock that trades at a lower p e than it deserves to but this is just my opinion    i hope this helps good luck

typically businesses always charge their home currency so if the shop is in canada you will pay canadian dollars normally you do n't have any choices either your credit card company will convert it to your currency using the current international currency exchange rate pretty good plus a potential fee between 0 and 5 depending on your credit card not so good if it is a significant amount or you plan to do that more than once and if you have multiple credit cards check first to see which one has the lowest international fee 0 is not uncommon but neither is 3 or 4 if it 's a 10 $ it 's probably not worth the time but 4 of 1000 is already 40 $ as of right now the currency exchange rate is 1.33 so you would pay usd plus the potential fee 0 $ understand that this exchange rate is floating continuously it probably wo n't change much but it will change

yes eligibility for contributing to a roth ira is determined by your modified adjusted gross income magi which is based on your adjusted gross income agi now agi includes the net capital gains from your transactions and magi adds back in things that were subtracted off e.g. tuition deductions foreign earned income exclusion in arriving at the agi there is a worksheet in publication 590 that has the details you are always entitled to contribute to a traditional ira the magi affects how much of your contribution is tax deductible on that year 's tax return but not your eligibility to contribute   both the above paragraphs assume that you have enough compensation wages salary self employment income to contribute to an ira the contribution limit is $ 5500 or total compensation whichever is smaller if you earned only $ 2 k as wages you can contribute all of it not just your take home pay which is what is left after social security and medicare taxes federal taxes etc have been withheld from that $ 2 k if your entire income is from capital gains and stock dividends you can not contribute to any kind of ira at all

in the united states if the person insures an article and then claims a loss of that article the insurance replaces the missing destroyed article if later on the item is found the original is owned by the insurance company the person who purchased the policy does n't get to keep both   of course if the item was so valuable to be priceless the insurance company would be open to an exchange of items or money   but if they suspect fraud then it becomes a legal matter even when a life is n't involved it can be a source of dispute insured v. insurer when stolen art is recovered who owns it kenneth s. levine   this essay is about the word which frequently appears    in insurance policies an insured painting is stolen and the insurance    company pays the owner ’s claim for the value of the painting many    years later when the painting is recovered its value is many times    what it was when the insurance claim was paid the insurance company    takes the position that it owns the painting while the owner says i    own the painting less the value of the insurance proceeds received    the resolution of this dispute depends on the meaning of the word    in the insurance policy when life insurance is involved the item being replace is the lost stream of income the question of returning money and how much would be a legal issue they would also want to know if there was fraud and who was involved

the short answer to all of this is that it depends on the loan and on the collections agency it 's an interesting time to be a collections agency right now on the one hand people are defaulting on debts and those creditors want to be paid and are beating down the agencies doors on the other hand if you ca n't pay you ca n't pay and the threat of collections action is not much of a motivation when you 're already 90 days out and so collections agencies are having to consult crystal balls and tea leaves to try to determine which debts they 're likely to collect if they buy many collections agencies have begun subscribing to the you catch more flies with honey than vinegar philosophy we know it may be very difficult for you right now so we 'll make you a deal to settle the debt for 80 of face value and you 'll never hear from us again other agencies continue to live by the threat model we 're heartless and cruel and we do n't care that it 's tough we own you and you will pay us everything we ask for or we will make your life hell every way we can   there are advantages and a certain synergy to both approaches you really do get more success by making a deal so the agency that is willing to work with the debtor and offer them a good deal is going to be more likely to collect however that quickly becomes an incentive to not pay yeah they sent me this outrageous bill for my ankle so i just ignored it and let 'em sweat and ended up paying half what they billed me in just a few cases of yeah i could n't pay my cell phone bill so i just let them cut it off but the collections agency started calling and mailing me every day and i had to pay twice what i owed in the first place to make it stop which filters through the collective psyche of the masses and all of a sudden if and when they do offer a deal on a debt you fell behind on you jump on it now to the question at the end of your post it 's always better for your credit to pay than to not pay an open collections account on your credit score will always be a bigger ding than a closed one but open or closed that collections activity remains part of your history unless the collections agency agrees to retract it even then you may have to go around to the big three credit bureaus and get the account removed using documentation which the agency must provide stating something to the effect of we agree that this never happened if the agency refuses to remove this black mark how black it will be depends on the terms by which the account was settled the reporting agencies will be told the face value of the debt that was sent to collections and they will be told the amount paid to settle it if the debt was settled for face value that tells people reading your report that well you were very late and only paid under duress but at least you did make good on the debt in full if you settle for less than the face value that says something different entirely not only could you not pay the original creditor you had to negotiate to reduce the amount to pay the debt collector that makes extending you credit very risky not only are you a proven risk for being late to pay not only are you a proven risk for them having to write off the debt but if and when they sell it to a collections agency the agency will see that a past debt was settled for less than face value and assume they 'll get the same treatment and so will offer less to buy the debt both of those cases are still better than an open collection that says to someone considering loaning you money that not only will you default not only will they have to write it off not only will the collections agency make less profit the collections agency is unlikely to see anything from this bad debt and may not even agree to buy it

this is a fascinating question   i am posting here only a partial answer because i have n't found official sources   the upshot appears to be that a puerto rico ira is a wholly different thing from a us ira and different rules apply   this is said most succinctly in this post on the boglehead forums us federal tax code and puerto rican tax codes are separate by contributing to a u.s. ira you defer us taxes you need to pay these deferred us taxes and take an early withdrawal penalty too if you want to move the asset to pr other web pages give similar information for instance this post from accountant forums the puerto rico pr internal revenue code irc defines a puerto    rico ira i am assuming that this taxpayer has a pr ira it is    unfortunate that they chose to use the same name as the us irc    uses a pr ira is not a us ira it has different tax rules in    addition the us irc defines an ira as being a trust created or    organized in the united states the us irc sec defines    the united states as being the 50 states and the district of    columbia the bogleheads thread also contains a link to a document from a puerto rican cpa school which appears to be a faq and says translated here from spanish thus any distribution from an ira established in puerto rico does not qualify to be transferred to an ira established outside puerto rico without the of penalty and/or payment of corresponding income tax   in the same way the transfer of an ira established outside puerto rico to one established in puerto rico also does not qualify as a transfer it is not clear whether the exact meaning of transfer given as either or in the document corresponds to the us usage of ira transfers i.e. nontaxable events some information i found indicates that the end of the quote above might be translated as does not qualify as a rollover   in any case it seems that moving an ira to or from puerto rico at least potentially has tax consequences   there is also a previous question on this site which likewise says you can not transfer or rollover an ira that was established in pr to usa and vice versa these are not exactly authoritative sources but they all seem to point towards the same conclusion namely that you wo n't be able to avoid taxation on your ira by moving to puerto rico   of course i am no expert   to be sure you would have to talk to an accountant versed in the tax laws of both puerto rico and the incorporated us and probably also whatever state you 'd be moving from to be on the safe side

lower fees are always better everything else equal a lower fee makes your transaction overall a better deal all else equal   other transactions costs like the sec fee on sales are mostly the same across brokers and there is unlikely to be any difference in execution quality either   when comparing brokers be sure to consider the other issues to me most of these are minor issues   for that reason i 'd say let transaction cost be your guide i hear a lot of talk about the quality of the interface   if you just want to buy or sell a stock they are all pretty easy   some brokers have better tools for monitoring the market or looking at technical indicators if you are into that

another way to look at this is that pure insider trading is an activity with the aim to use secret information to make personal profit or let others make personal profit at the expense of the company shareholders or investors in buybacks it is not company managers to get personal gain in this would be insider trading the end winners in this case are the shareholders so there is nothing inherently bad in buying back stock moreover it is a general practice to buy shares back as opposed to paying dividends when the company sees its shares being undervalued of course provided that it has the cash borrowing ability to implement this since it creates shareholders value thereby maximising shareholder wealth which is one of the primary tasks of the company managers

in truth there is no such thing as a risk free asset   that is why your textbook feels the need to add the qualifier for practical purposes meaning that the risk of a money market account is so much lower than virtually any other asset class that it can reasonably be as risk free the main risk of any bond short term or long term is that its price may change before the maturity date   this could happen for one of many reasons such as interest rate changes creditworthiness market risk tolerance and so on   thus you may lose money if you need to redeem your investment ahead of the scheduled maturity

i feel like this has nothing to do with income and as such rmds will not really help or harm you after a person passes credit card companies are unlikely to collect any outstanding balance   debts can not be inherited however assets can be made to stand for debts   many assets pass to heirs without the probate process and in some cases all of them pass this way   this leaves creditors with nothing and having to write off the balance even if assets do pass through probate heirs may dispute the creditors   in that case credit card balances may not be high enough justify hiring a lawyer to fight for payment or if they do the judge may be and offer nothing or pennies on the dollar     the bottom line is that they probably see you or your demographic as a poor credit risk and reduced their exposure by lowering your limit   while that is not what they told you they probably have to carefully structure what they say to avoid any discrimination claims

no you do n't have to be super rich   but the companies do not have to sell you shares and as others mention the government actively restricts and regulates the advertising and sales of shares so how do you invest   the easiest way to obtain a stake is to work at a pre ipo company preferably at a high level e.g. director vp of under water basket weaving or whatever     you might be offered shares or options as part of a compensation package   there are exemptions to the accredited investor rule for employees and a general exemption for a small number of unsolicited investors   also the accredited investor rule is enforced against companies not investors and the trend is for investors to self certify the crime being defined is not investing in things the government thinks are too risky for you   instead the crime being defined is offering shares to the public in a small business that is probably going to fail and might even be a scam from the beginning    to invest your money in pre ipo shares is on average a losing adventure and it is easy to become irrationally optimistic   the problem with these shares is that you ca n't sell them and may not be able to sell them immediately when the company does have an ipo on nasdaq or another market   even the executive options can have lock up clauses and it may be that only the founders and a few early investors make money

if it were possible for every person in the world to run their own business at the same time maybe you 'd have a point but that 's not how things work as it stands now there inherently must be more employees than business owners and the nature of that relationship inherently favours the owner a few laws in place to somewhat balance the scales is not a bad thing at the end of the day the employer was breaking the law and now they have to suffer the consequences

i 've been highly compensated for a while now and i have never used a tax professional   my past complications include the year that my company was bought by a vc firm and my stock options and stock held were bought out to the tune of 5x my salary   and now i have two kids in college with scholarships and paying the remainder out of 529 accounts usually i do n't even use tax software   my typical method is to use the online software like turbotax online and let it figure out where i am   then i use the free file forms online to actually complete the process   search for free file forms it 's not the same as using turbotax or taxact for free    my suggestion to you   download the pdf form of 1040ez and 1040a from the irs   print the ez and fill it out   this will give you a better feel for what exactly is going on   with your income i do n't think you can file the ez but it 's a good way to get your feet wet the way income taxes work here in the us according to the irs the personal exemption this year is worth $ 4,050 and the standard deduction $ 6,300 assuming you 're single    lets assume that your salary will be in fact 75,000 and you do n't pay for any benefits but you do make a 401k contribution of 15 of your salary   then your w-2 at the end of the year should tell you to put in a particular box on your 1040 form   is 85 of 75,000   lets then assume is your agi after other additions and   4,050 6,300 = = the federal tax system is graduated meaning there are different ranges brackets with different percentages   the term tax people use for taxable income of is marginal tax so the last dollar they tax at 25   other dollars less   according to the irs if you 're single then on you pay $ plus 25 of the amount over $   or + 750 or note this is only federal income tax   you will also be paying social security and medicare payroll tax   and i 'm guessing you 'll also be paying colorado state income tax   each state has its own forms and methods for figuring out the taxes and stuff by the way when you start you 'll fill out a w-4 form to help you figure out how much to withhold from every paycheck   i find the w-4 is not helpful at all   your company will withhold from your paycheck some mysterious amount and the process of filling out your 1040a or 1040ez or whatever will be likely to get the over withheld amount back

this is not a problem swift does not need the beneficiary account currency the settlement account or the instruction amount is of interest to the banks as i understand your agreement with client is they pay you x eur that is what would be specified on the swift along with your details as beneficiary account number etc once the funds are received by your bank in turkey they will get eur when they apply these funds to your account in usd they will convert using the standard rates unless you are a large customer and have special instructions like do not credit if funds are received in non usd or give me a special rate or call me and ask me what i want to do etc it typically takes 3 5 days for an international wire depending on the countries and currencies involved wait for few more days and then if not received you have to ask your client to mention to his bank that beneficiary is claiming non receipt of funds the bank that initiated the transfer can track the wire not the your bank which is supposed to receive the funds

if the answer were no you still found the black swan type exception that proves the answer to be yes right my experience is this again just my experience my bank when by balance goes below $ 10 i have the account trigger an email i wrote a check i forgot to register and subtract so the email was sent and the account balance in fact showed negative i transferred to cover the check and the next day there was a history that did n't go negative the evening deposit was credited prior to check clearing   i set up my bills on line i set a transfer in advance for the same dollar amount as a bill that was due e.g. $ 1000 transfer for a $ 1000 bill i woke up to an email and the account showed the bill was paid prior to the transfer so one line showed going and the next line + $ 100 after transfer even though it 's the same online process again the next day the history re ordered to look like i was never negative but even on a day i know i 'm having payments issued i can never just ignore that email   the first time this happened i asked the bank and they said if the negative went until the next day i 'd get an overdraft short balance notice   this is a situation to ask your bank how they handle this

re specifically am i right in that everything i put on these is deducted from tax or are there other rules and   am i correctly understanding this as anything above £ 3,600 per year will not be deducted from your tax neither interpretation seems quite right unless what you mean is this the contributions to a pension or to the share save scheme are deducted from your pay before it is taxed that 's how it works for employer run pension schemes in other words you are paying the gross amount you earn into the pension not the amount after tax it 's a tax efficient way to save because compared to other forms of saving the bit about the £ 3,600 you can ignore this assuming you 're earning more than £ 3,600 a year what happens to the pension if you decide to move back to france or another country in some cases you can transfer tax free worst case you 'd pay some tax on the transfer but not more than 25 see here for the current rules re the share scheme if by salary exchange you mean salary sacrifice where your gross pay is officially reduced by that amount e.g. £ 150 a month that 's even more tax efficient because it saves you paying the national insurance contribution too approx 9 of the pay packet conclusion saving into pension and company share save schemes is supremely tax efficient and provided you 're ok with your money being locked away until you 're 57 pension or tied up in company shares it 's understandably many people 's priority to make use of these schemes before considering other forms of saving where you pay into them from your salary after tax now about this i am trying to understand how much i should put into it should i put money into these or should look for another way to save how will this work out if i go back to france or another country nobody here can advise you what to do since individuals goals and circumstances are different and we do n't know enough of the picture that said fwiw i 'll tell you what i might do based solely on what you 've told us in the question first i 'd definitely contribute 6 to the company pension this gets you the full employer match that 's free money plus remember the tax relief = more free money if you 're 27 a total of 12 salary into a pension a year is a decent rate to start saving for retirement actually 14 would be generally advisable and maybe more still it 's generally a case of the more the better especially while young as you have time for growth and you do n't know what later priorities might change financial needs might arise nevertheless you said you might move overseas so in your position i would then

i do n't think you 've mentioned which state you 're in here in ontario a person who is financially incapable can have their financial responsibility and authority removed and assigned to a trustee the trustee might be a responsible next of kin as her ex you would appear unsuitable that being a potential conflict of interest otherwise it can be the public guardian and trustee it that happens then the trustee handles the money and handles makes any contracts on behalf of in the name of the incapable person the incapable person might have income e.g. spousal support payments and money e.g. bank accounts which the trustee can document in order to demonstrate credit worthiness or at least solvency for the time being the kids see it as an adventure but i suspect it will get old very fast i hope you have a counsellor to talk with about your personal relationships i 've had or tried several and at least one has been extraordinarily helpful you 're not actually expressing a worry about the children being abused or neglected is your motive for asking that you want her to have a place so that the children will like it being there better as long as your kids see it as an adventure perhaps you can be happy for them perhaps i do n't know depending on the people too it 's a good or at least a better thing that they are visiting with friends and relatives and a better topic with those people might be how they show your children a good time instead of your ex 's money one possible way i thought of co signing is if a portion of child spousal support goes directly to the landlord i asked the child support services who deduct money from my paycheck monthly to pay support to my ex and they told me that they are not authorized to do this perhaps i do n't know there is some way to do that if you have your ex 's cooperation and a lawyer and perhaps a judge you have n't said what portions of your payments are for child support versus spousal support nor who has custody etc if a large part of the support is for the children then perhaps the children can rent the place idea note that in ontario there are two decisions to make 1 financial and 2 personal care which includes housing and medical someone can retain their own self care authority even if they 're judged financially incapable or vice versa if there 's a personal care or medical decision which they can not understand the technical language is mentally incapable of managing property this term applies to a person who is unable to understand information that is relevant to     making a decision or is unable to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a     decision or lack of decision about his or her property processes for certifying an     individual as being mentally incapable of managing property are prescribed in the substitute decisions act and in the mental health act the mental heath act is for medical emergencies only but ontario has a substitute decisions act as well an intent of the law is to protect vulnerable people people may also acquire and/or name their own trustee and/or guardian voluntarily via a power of attorney a living will etc i do n't know how about offering the landlord a year 's rent in advance or in trust i guess that 1 a court order can determine override guarantee the way in which the child support payments are directed 2 it 's easier to get that order agreement if you and your ex cooperate 3 there are housing specialists in your neighborhood they can buy housing instead of renting it or be given gifted housing to live in

to point 1 we are moving but i do n't know if i can afford the rent as the family grows i would start by looking at your debt to income ratio in the us most banks look at this for mortgage purposes but it also gives you a general idea of what monthly mortgage payments will be comfortable given your particular financial situation think of it this way if a bank is unwilling to lend you money because of a high debt to income level this indicates that you have very little leeway with regard to your budget so a lower number indicates that you will have more flexibility and comfort with meeting your rent mortgage obligations when unforeseen bills pop up the article below indicates having < 43 dti is ideal in the us here 's a link to a debt to income calculator and some extra info i suggest finding one aimed at the uk market debt to income calculator why is the 43 debt to income ratio important point 2 how can a person measure how much to spend on food car bills or rent from his salary is there a formula to keep in check other answers have addressed how to make a budget so i will not repeat that however here 's another angle with regards to spending saving this article recommends according to the popular   rule you should reserve 50 percent of your budget for essentials like rent   and food 30 percent for discretionary spending and at   least   20 percent for savings read more at in the real world these goals may not be realistic and different people have different ideas about how aggressive to be with regards to savings however you can get a general idea and adapt for your particular needs point 3 i find myself looking at my account every single day and get and sad because almost whenever the money pay comes in i freak out that after everything there is nothing for us to enjoy or save

if you want the cheapest online broker in australia you ca n't go past cmc markets they charge $ 9.90 upto a $ 10,000 trade and 0.1 above that there is no ongoing fees unless you choose to have dynamic data stock prices get updated automatically as they change however the dynamic data fee does get waived if you have about 10 or more trades per month you do n't really need the dynamic data unless you are a regular trader anyway they also provide some good research tools and some basic charting your funds with them are kept in a account so are safe they do n't provide the best interest on funds kept in the account so it is best to just deposit the funds when you are looking to buy and move your funds earning higher interest when selling hopes this helps regards victor update they have now increased their basic brokerage to a minimum of $ 11 per trade unless you are a frequent trader

if you have multiple accounts you have to empty them all before you can deduct any losses your loss is not a capital loss its a deduction it is calculated based on the total amount you have withdrawn from all your roth ira 's minus the total basis it will be subject to the 2 agi i.e. if your agi is > 100 k none of it is deductible and you have to itemize to get it bottom line think twice summarizing the discussion in comments if you have a very low agi i would guess that your tax liability is pretty low as well even if you deduct the whole $ 2 k and all of it is above the other deductions you have which in turn is above the standard deduction of almost $ 6 k you save say $ 300 if you 're in 15 tax bracket that 's the most savings you have however i 'm assuming something here i 'm assuming that you 're itemizing your deductions already and they 're above the standard deduction this is very unlikely with such a low income you do n't have state taxes to deduct you probably do n't spend a lot to deduct sales taxes and i would argue that with the low agi you probably do n't own property and if you do you do n't have a mortgage with a significant interest on it you can be in 15 bracket with agi between roughly $ 8 k and $ 35 k i.e. you can not deduct between $ 160 and $ 750 of the $ 2 k so it 's already less than the maximum $ 300 if your agi is $ 8 k the deduction does n't matter might cover all of your taxes anyway if your agi is $ 30 k you can deduct only $ 1400 so if you 're in the 15 bracket you saved $ 210 that again assuming it 's above your other deductions which in turn are already above the standard deduction highly unlikely as i said in the comments i do not think you can realistically save on taxes because of this loss in such a manner

if s&p crashes these currencies will appreciate note that the above is speculation not fact there is definitely no guarantee that say the chf cad currency pair is inversely linked to the performance of the us stock market when measured in usd let alone to the performance of the us stock market as measured in cad how can a canadian get exposure to a safe haven currency like chf and jpy i do n't want a u.s. dollar denominated etf three simple options come to mind if you still want to pursue that have money in your bank account go to your bank tell them that you want to buy some swiss francs or japanese yen walk out with a physical wad of cash put said wad of cash somewhere safe until needed it is possible that the bank will tell you to come back later as they might not have the physical cash available at the branch office but this is n't anything really unusual it is often highly recommended for people who travel abroad to have some local cash on hand contact your bank and tell them that you want to open an account denominated in the foreign currency of your choice they might ask some questions about why there might be additional fees associated with it and you 'll probably have to pay an exchange fee when transferring money between it and your local currency denominated accounts but lots of banks offer this service as a service for those of their customers that have lots of foreign currency transactions if yours does n't then shop around shop around for money market funds that focus heavily or exclusively on the currency area you are interested in look for funds that have a native currency value appreciation as close as possible to 0 any value change that you see will then be tied directly to the exchange rate development of the relevant currency pair for example chf cad 1 and 3 are accessible to virtually anyone no large sums of money needed in principle fees involved in 2 may or may not make it a practical option for someone handling small amounts of money but i can see no reason why it should n't be a possibility again in principle

it looks like your visa being refused is entirely irrelevant what happens in bankruptcy is that all the assets of the bankrupt entity are taken over liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors you 're one of the creditors and as you 've been told the proceeds are not enough to pay all the creditors in full this is quite common in bankruptcies what you can do is sue in court and demand priority over other creditors but a. you 're exactly the same as many other creditors rest of the students so why would you get a priority b. suing costs money and even if you get more you 'll pay way more for legal fees and expenses what else can you do if you paid with a credit card your credit card company may be able to reverse charges sometimes that works depending on how fast you move if you paid with a check your bank may similarly be able to stop payment on the check this provided it has n't been settled yet

parenting towards was the main theme discussed during a conference held recently organised by agenzija sedqa in collaboration with the office of the children ’s commissioner ms. sina bugeja chief executive officer foundation for social welfare services during her opening address explained that parenting towards resilience was the main theme chosen by the foundation to celebrate this year ’s children ’s day moreover ms. bugeja mentioned the recent launch of the national children ’s policy that safeguards children ’s rights and ensures space for their opinions before decisions are taken she mentioned that parents need to be kept with changing parenting styles as well as with different influences which might affect children ’s development ms commissioner for children said that the inherent vulnerability of children requires not only a strong legal and institutional framework of protection but also the consolidated ability on the part primarily of parents to nurture their children in such a way as to in them the inner strength and will to overcome the challenges that come their way during their childhood this is important she said as there is a limit to how far the legal and institutional framework can go to actually protect children in the context of an increasingly complex and challenging social and cultural environment and also because the development of such inner strength and will is an integral part of children ’s gradual maturity into strong independent and responsible adults the development of this inner strength or resilience should be seen as a main goal of the child ’s upbringing ms thus urged all parents to continue helping their children develop these inner qualities during his closing address mr. operations director agenzija sedqa said that since its inception sedqa has always been at the forefront of imparting skills to parents to improve their communication with their children although the agency is best known for its work with persons experiencing drug alcohol or gambling related problems it nevertheless invests a lot of resources in prevention the main presentation of this conference was entitled l l delivered ms. sammut registered counselling psychologist and family therapist she is also a full time member of staff within the department of psychology at the university of malta her presentation focused on a clear description of what is resilience in children highlighting the kind of parenting that makes a difference in enhancing resilience in children she stressed the importance of a warm parent child relationship that is to the child ’s needs according to his or her unique development this relationship greatly affects influences every aspect of children ’s learning and development especially the growth of their inner security self worth and ability to build relationships with others ms. sammut also spoke about how harmony in the family consistent guidance especially in and adequate role models also help to promote resilience in children she also cited from her research on families with domestic violence highlighting the resilience and challenges of these family members this conference was attended by parents and various professionals in touch with children of all ages the workshops delivered were families of children with disability by ann and education amp parenting by role models by building resilience in children by the mindful parent parenting against substance use risk by anthony building attachment by parenting towards resilience with the media by john playful parents playful children playful therapists by amp daniel looking after children in foster care by john and power struggle between parents and young people by sammut on achieving better parenting

below i will try to explain two most common binomial option pricing models used first of all splits time to expiry into n equal sub periods and assumes that in each period the underlying security price may rise or fall by a known proportion so the value of an option in any sub period is a function of its possible values in the following sub period therefore the current value of an option is found by working backwards from expiry date through sub periods to current time there is not enough information in the question from your textbook so we may assume that what you are asked to do is to find a value of a call option using just a single period here are two ways of doing this first of all let 's summarize your information current share price vs = $ 70 strike or exercise price x = $ 60 risk free rate r = 5.5 or time to maturity t = 12 months downward movement in share price for the period d = $ 65 $ 70 = upward movement in share price for the period u = = = u can be translated to $ multiplying by vs = > $ 70 = $ which is the maximum probable share price in 12 months time if you need more clarification here the minimum and maximum future share prices are calculated from stocks past volatility which is a measure of risk but because your textbook question does not seem to be asking this you probably do n't have to bother too much about it yet intrinsic value just in case someone reading this is unclear the value of an option on maturity is the difference between the exercise strike price and the value of a share at the time of the option maturity this is also called an intrinsic value   note that american option can be exercised prior to it 's maturity in this case the intrinsic value it simply the between strike price and the underlying share price at the time of an exercise but the value of an option at period 0 also called option price is a price you would normally pay in order to buy it so say with a strike of $ 60 and share price of $ 70 the intrinsic value is $ 10 whereas if share price was $ 50 the intrinsic value would be $ 0 the option price or the value of a call option in both cases would be fixed   so we also need to find intrinsic option values when price falls to the lowest probable and rises to the maximum probable and respectively = $ = $ 5 remember if strike was $ 70 then would be $ 0 because nobody would exercise an option that is out of the money = $ = $ 1 setting up a hedge ratio   h = h = 5 = 1 that means we have to write sell 1 option for each share purchased in order to hedge the risks you can make a simple calculation to check this but i 'm not going to go into too much detail here as the is not about hedging because this position is risk free in equilibrium it should pay a risk free rate 5.5 then the formula to price an option vc using the hedging approach is vs where vc is the value of the call option h is the hedge ratio vs current share price highest probable share price r risk free rate t time in years value of a call option on maturity at the highest probable share price therefore solving for vc 70 = 1 = > = 60 = > = = > vc = 70   which is similar to the formula given in your textbook so i must assume that using would be simply a very close approximation of the formula above then it is easy to find that vc = ~ $ 2 risk neutral valuation another way to calculate vc is using a risk neutral approach we first introduce a variable p which is a risk neutral probability of an increase in share price p = d so in your case p = = therefore using p the vc would be equal vc = = > vc = = > vc = ~ $ as you can see it is very close to the hedging approach i hope this answers your questions also bear in mind that there is much more to the option pricing than this the most important topics to cover are multi period accounting for dividends black scholes merton option pricing model

first what 's your risk tolerance how long is your investment going to last if it 's a short term investment a few years and you expect to break even or better then your risk tolerance is low you should not invest much money in stocks even index funds and defensive stocks if however you 're looking for a long term investment which you will put money into continually over the next 30 years the amount of stock you purchase at any given time is pretty small so the money you might lose by timing the market wrong will also be rather small also you probably do a remarkably poor job of knowing when to buy stocks if you actually knew how to time the market to materially improve your risk adjusted returns you 've missed your calling you should be making six figures or more on wall street

the government wants money and is n't particularly interested in you getting your deductions right doing the worksheet on the back of the w-4 will give you a much better idea of how many deductions you can take while many people are excited to get a tax refund a refund means you loaned the government money all year long without getting paid interest for your generosity the irs will penalize you for underpaying your taxes in amounts larger than $ 1000 or 10 of your income but a good ballpark estimate aiming for about ~$100 in payment at tax time is a relatively safe way to get all your money sooner than later

there has been an abundance of articles in recent years which make it fairly clear that many participants in the social security especially those who have started contributing recently and going forward from will experience negative rates of return in other words they will put in more than they will get out some examples of such articles time magazine but it is now official social security is a lousy investment for the    average worker people retiring today will be among the first    generation of workers to pay more in social security taxes than they    receive in benefits over the course of their lives according to a new    analysis by the associated press that ap piece referenced by time people retiring today are part of the first generation of workers who    have paid more in social security taxes during their careers than they    will receive in benefits after they retire it 's a historic shift that    will only get worse for future retirees according to an analysis by    the associated press a piece which appeared in includes a helpful graphic summary   10 myths about social security myth 4 social security is a good deal for today ’s if    there were no reduction in benefits or increase in taxes an    impossibility given social security ’s looming financing    shortfalls social security is an extremely bad investment for most    young workers in fact according to a study by the nonpartisan tax    foundation most young workers will actually receive a negative return    on their social security they will get less in benefits than    they paid in taxes some studies indicate that a year old    two earner couple with average income will lose as much as $    that actual loss does not even consider the opportunity cost what    workers might have earned if they had been able to invest their taxes    in real assets that yield a positive return in fact a study by    financial analyst william demonstrates that if a 25-year old    worker were able to privately invest the money he or she currently    pays in social security taxes the worker would receive retirement    benefits three to six times higher than under social security has that answered your question

typically labor is a company 's largest expense so when a company receives tax cuts that does n't translate to more hiring long term if the company expands it might but it could also choose to invest in a better or different products maybe more efficient business processes or invest in overseas operations additionally labor has a diminishing value just because we could hire more people to make more things does n't mean we should    side note in many states the largest employers are the state local governments schools public services etc and healthcare providers   this tax cut is great for people that are already invested or high income earners because it lowers the overall tax brackets and aligns capital gains to those so say i had a million dollars invested and earned a yearly 10 dividend return i 'd earn 100k in dividends and pay 25 as income tax source   however something like 50 of all americans are invested in the stock market only the top 10 average investments close to a million in investments example above and 38 of all investments are owned by the 1 source   tax cuts while popular would n't ever help stimulate consumer spending esp considering the amount of consumer debt that exists ~1 trillion what these tax cuts would do create more debt for tax payers

i was in a similar situation about a year ago and the thing to do would be to remove your grandfather from the title   he would probably have to agree with this but i think he will if you approach it correctly in my case i was the cosigner for my son 's car loan and was told by the dealer that i had to be on the title   this is not true as far as virginia is concerned illinois may be different   i know this because when my son dropped his auto insurance i got the fine for having an uninsured vehicle and was told during the hearing that the dealer was mistaken it all worked out in the end but all we had to do was go down to the dmv and get my name taken off of the title i 'm sure if you approach it this way you do not want him to be responsible for things that you do who would get sued if you caused an accident he would agree to have his name removed from the title

i 've seen a lot of long and complicated answers here so here is my simple and short answer let 's say the economy consists of 10 apples and then an apple costs if you print 10 $ more you have 10 apples and then an apple costs that is it it 's not what said   over time prices go up however i would like to add something more on the topic inflation is theft if i hack the bank and steal 10 from each account it 's obvious that it is theft it 's a bit less obvious when the government prints out money and people loose 10 of the value in their bank accounts but the end result is the same final note some may disagree but i do not consider inflation when 5 of the apples rot and you have 5 apples and 10 $ and an apple now costs this is a drop in supply and if the demand stays the same prices will rise

think about the implications if the world worked as your question implies that it should   a $ 15 share of stock would return you at least $ 15 after 3 months plus another $ 15 after 6 months plus another after 9 and 12 months   this would have returned to you $ 60 over the year that you owned it plus you still own the share   only then would the stock be worth buying   anything less than $ 60 would be too little to be worth bothering about for $ 15 such a thing would indeed be worth buying but you wo n't find golden egg laying stocks like that on the stock market   why   because other people would outbid your measly $ 15 in order to get this $ year producing stock in fact they would bid many hundreds of dollars   since other people bid more you ca n't find such a deal available of course there are the points others have brought up the earnings per share are yearly not quarterly unless otherwise noted   the earnings may not be sent to you at all or only a small part but you would gain much of their value because the company should be worth about that much more by keeping the earnings

congratulations on seeing your situation clearly that 's half the battle to prevent yourself from going back into debt you should get rid of any credit cards you have and close the accounts just use your debit card your post indicates you 're not the type to splurge and get stuff just because you want it so saving for a larger purchase and paying cash for it is probably something you 're willing to do contrary to popular belief you can live just fine without a credit card and without a credit score if you 're never going back into debt you do n't need a credit score buying a house is possible without one but is admittedly more work for you and for the underwriters because they ca n't just ask the fico god to bless you they have to actually see your finances and you have to actually have some i realize many folks will hate this advice but i am actually living it and life is pretty good if you 're in school look at how much you spend on food while on campus $ for lunch adds up to $ over a month m f four weeks buy groceries and pack a lunch if you can if your expenses can not be reduced anymore you 're going to have to get a job there is nothing wrong with slowing down your studies and working a job to get your income up above your expenses it stinks being a poor student but it stinks even more to be a poor student with a mountain of debt you 'll find that working a job does n't slow you down all that much tons of students work their way through school and graduate in plenty of time to get a good job   good luck to you you can do it

not everyone pays their balance in full every month they may not make interest off of you or me but they do make interest off of a lot of cardholders in many cases the interest is variable and the larger your running balance the higher your rate if you 're close to your limit and making minimum payments you can literally take decades to pay off $ 2,000 or so   some people do n't pay at all every month and end up paying late fees some people use their cards overseas and pay foreign transaction fees ever take a cash advance me neither but they charge you interest right away for that instead of waiting until your statement the list of fees and charges is as long as my arm and in tiny print that 's how they make money the points bonus cash back and other rewards programs are to get you in the door it 's like when you see a luxury car advertised for a too good to be true price and you get to the lot and find out that the one they are selling for that price is a manual transmission without ac or a radio they only had one and they sold it an hour before you got there it got you on the lot though the rewards programs function in much the same way minus the disappearing part they get you interested in their offering among a sea of virtually identical products but rest assured if the card issuers were losing money because of them they would n't exist for very long

as a beginner to cryptocurrencies i would recommend that you sign up for an account at once you get verified and understand that getting verified will take multiple weeks unfortunately considering the large amount of traffic that these web apps still have to scale for you will be able to make daily deposits of $ 500 to buy either bitcoin btc or ethereum eth any other currencies usually built on another network or entirely separate networks will require you to sign up for an altcoin exchange like or   speaking of which another user that commented on this post mentioned but the issue with is that it only allows you to buy currencies using other currency which is why i recommend gemini you could even use coinbase but coinbase is extremely popular and it takes forever to get verified after purchasing crypto you can transfer to other accounts on other exchanges to speculate on altcoin   please be secure when using these exchanges consider also using a wallet i personally recommend as many exchanges suffer from occasional attacks   as for /u questioning your motives i totally agree with that sentiment as no one really knows what 's going to happen tomorrow which is why i you to evaluate your financial situation and only speculate with what you 're entirely comfortable with losing you 're entering casino doors and yeah i 'm a personal believer that at this casino you 'll win big but it 's still a gamble just keep that in mind

i would not suggest closing out your roth ira couple of reasons for that 1 since you 've been contributing to it for 15 years your investments have probably grown seen dividends etc   if you close it out you will owe taxes and be slapped with a 10 penalty on the growth money you did n't contribute   that 's quite a waste of hard earned money    2 while your income may exceed the contribution limit of a roth you could do what 's called a backdoor roth which is really just converting your after tax contributions into an ira into a roth ira 3 given the length of your contributions your roth ira is seasoned 5 years this allows you to use up to 10k for your house if you chose   usually not an option people use other than that consider paying off the student loans with the highest interest first

your question is n't great but i will attempt to answer this piece as it seems really the root of your personal finance question i want to convince my wife to make this move because it will save us    at least 800 month but she fails to see how buying a second home is    financially sound because we have to lose our savings and we have to    pay interest on our second home and her logic is it will take almost 5 years to get back our down payment    and we have to pay interest as well so how can this move help our    family financially in the long run is she right she is mostly wrong first consider that there is no roi really on your down payment assuming you are paying what your home would sell for the next day then your rio is already yours minus realtor fees she is talking about cash on hand not roi i will use an example without taking into account risk of home markets going down or other risks to ownership example let 's say you pay $ 2800 a month in mortgage at 5.5 apr and $ 200 a month in on a $ loan $ 400k house in this example let 's say the same house if you were to rent it is $ 3800 a month understand the opportunity cost of renting the marginal amount it costs you to not buy so far your opportunity cost is $ 800 a month the principle of your house will be increasing with each payment in our example it 's about $ 400 for the first payment and will increase with each payment made while decreasing the interest payment suggest you look at an amortization table for your specific mortgage example so you 're real number is now $ 1200 a month opportunity cost consider also the fact that the $ 400 a month is sitting in a savings account of sorts while most savings accounts give you less than 1 in returns and then charge taxes on that gain your home may or may not be much higher than that and wo n't charge you taxes on the gains when you sell it if you live in it for a period of time as defined by the irs let 's assume a conservative long term appreciation rate of 3 that 's $ 12k a year on a $ 400k house so now you 're at $ 2200 a month opportunity cost in this example i did n't touch on your tax savings of ownership i also did n't touch on the maintenance cost of ownership or the maintenance cost of renting your deposit + other fees which all should be considered you may have other costs involved in renting for instance the cost of not being able to fully utilize your rental as your own house this may be an even simpler and more convincing way to explain it on the $ 2800 mortgage example you will be paying around $ 19k in interest and $ 2400 on taxes insurance = $ 23k per year number could be way different in your example that is basically throw away money you 're never getting back on the rental 100 of your rent at $ 3800 a month is throw away money you 're never getting back that 's $ a year

you can take a shortcut and make a few cumulative transactions maybe just estimate how much of your spending landed in each of your budget categories but you will lose a lot of the value that you were building for yourself by tracking your spending during the earlier months i reconcile my budget and categorize my spending on a monthly basis it 's always a chore to pull out the big stack of receipts and plow through them but i 've learned the value of having an accurate picture of where all my money went there is no clean way to fake it you can either take the time and reconcile your spending or you can take a short cut it probably renders your efforts to track everything from the beginning of the year invalid though if you want to start over this month as you did at the beginning of the year that would probably be a cleaner way to reconcile things

you do n't necessarily change your calculated profit margins and posted prices but you advertise and offer price matching   two out of three consumers may still pay the posted best buy price while the knowledgeable third consumer that did their research will receive the matched price   their profit on that third customer will be lower than it was for the other two but currently they do n't get anything from that third customer at all since they just order online   meanwhile now that they 're in the store they may buy a few movies or a power strip

i would not want to be sprint or t mobile right now you ca n't merge you ca n't get funding to buy spectrum it is a whole host of pain    look at the spectrum gawker media image upload between these guys   lower level spectrum 700 is around 3 4 times more useful than the higher frequency for coverage making the signal go far and through walls this is a big deal for 2 reasons   1 the less towers you have to build the cheaper it is less capex and for sites + decreased operational complexity and the quicker you can roll out the network first mover adv edit this only applies to coverage situations i.e. along highways and in rural regions coverage is important because even those who do n't travel that much consider it highly as a key purchasing factor   2 the less accurate you have to be with the network planning imagine you have a big circle that you can place on a town vs having to use 3 equivalent circles the planners can get the number of towers wrong and/or the location of the towers   in the long term sprint and t mobile are going to be pushed into being high city only telcos less profitable in general imo

basically the idea of an ira is that the money is earned by you and would normally be taxed at the individual rate but the government is allowing you to avoid paying the taxes on it now by instead putting it in the account this tax deferral encourages retirement savings by reducing your current taxable income providing a short term carrot   however the government will want their cut specifically when you begin withdrawing from that account the principal which was n't taxed when you put it in will be taxed at the current individual rate when you take it out when you think about it that 's only fair you did n't pay taxes on it when it came out of your paycheck so you should pay that tax once you 're withdrawing it to live on here 's the rub the interest is also taxed at the individual rate at the time that was a good thing the capital gains rate in 1976 when the regular ira was established was 35 the highest it 's ever been now that 's not looking so good because the current cap gains rate is only 15 however these rates rise and fall cap gains more than individual rates and so by contributing to a traditional ira you simplify your tax bill the principal and interest is taxed at the individual rate as if you were still making a paycheck a roth ira is basically the government trying to get money now by giving up money later you pay the marginal individual rate on the contributions as you earn them it becomes a post tax deduction but then that money is completely yours and the kicker is that the government wo n't tax the interest on it if you do n't withdraw it before retirement age this makes roths very attractive to retirement investors as a hedge against higher overall tax rates later in life if you think that for any reason you 'll be paying more taxes in 30 years than you would be paying for the same money now you should be investing in a roth a normal non ira investment account at first seems to be the worst of both worlds you pay individual tax on all earned wages that you invest then capital gains on the money your investment earns stock gains and dividends bond interest etc whenever you cash out however a traditional account has the most flexibility you can keep your money in and take your money out on a timeline you choose this means you can react both to market moves and to tax changes when a conservative administration tax rates on capital gains you can cash out pay that low rate on the money you made from your account and then the money 's yours to spend or to reinvest you can if you 're and tax savvy use all three of these instruments to your overall advantage when tax rates are high now contribute to a traditional ira and then withdraw the money during your retirement in times where individual tax rates are low when tax rates are low like right now max out your roth contributions and use that money after retirement when tax rates are high use a regular investment account as an overage to roth contributions when taxes are low contribute when the individual rate is low then capitalize and reinvest during times when capital gains taxes are low perhaps replacing a paycheck deduction in annual contributions to a roth or you can simply fold it back into the investment account this is n't as good as a roth but is better than a traditional by capitalizing at an advantageous time you turn interest earned into principal invested and pay a low tax on it at that time to avoid a higher tax later however the market and the tax structure have to coincide to make ordinary investing pay off you may have bought in in the early 90s taking advantage of the lowest individual rates since the great depression while now capital gains taxes are the lowest they 've ever been if you cash out you may not be realizing much of a gain in the first place

another option would be to not refinance but also not pay any extra each month but to continue as you are making the existing payments and just put the extra you would have paid aside in an investment of some type something you are comfortable with   this as the added benefit of not tying up this extra money in your house should you need it in the next few years for something else you would then have the option in 2 or 3 years of continuing on this path or closing the investment and paying off the remaining principal in one lump sum    if nothing else that big payment would be a really fun check to write

yes it 's a risk to put it in perspective if we look at the data for s&p returns since 1871 we get a cagr of but that comes with a standard deviation of this results in 53 of the 146 years returning less than 4   now if we repeat the exercise over rolling 8 year periods the cagr drops to but the drops to this results in just 31 of the periods returning less than 4 on the flip side 26 periods had an 8 year return of over 15 cagr   from the anti ds article you linked i see that you like a good analogy for me the returns of the s&p over the long term are like going to vegas and finding that after you run the math of their craps dice rolling game you find the expected return is 10 you can still lose on a given roll but over a series of a larger number of rolls you 're far ahead   to d stanley i agree that returns are not quite normal but they are not so far off of the rolling returns we 'd expect about 68 or 95 results to be 1 away we get 88 returns + 2 we 'd expect only 5 to lie outside this range and in fact i only get one result on the low side and 4 on the high side 5 results vs the 7 total we 'd expect the results are a bit better more profitable than the normal bell curve fit would suggest

i 'll address one part of your question there are other taxes that companies pay as well such as income tax but do n't charge to the customer as a fee so why are gross receipts taxes charged to the customer things like income tax ca n't be passed on to the consumer in a direct way because there 's no fixed relationship between the amount of the tax and the price of an individual product   income tax is paid on taxable income which will incorporate deductions for the costs the company incurred to do business   so the final amount of corporate income tax can depend on things unrelated to the price of goods sold like whether the business decided to their parking lot gross receipts taxes by definition are charged on the total amount of money taken in so every dollar you spend on an item at the store will be subject to the gross receipts tax and hence will cost the business 7 cents or x% where x is the tax rate   this means there is a direct link between the price you pay for an individual item and the tax they pay on that transaction   the same is true for sales taxes which are also often added at the time of sale of course businesses could roll all of these into the posted price as well   the reason they do n't is to get their foot in the door and make the price seem lower you 're more likely to buy something if you see it for the low low one time only price of $ 99.99 act now save big and then find out you owe an extra $ 7 at the register than if you saw $ 107 on the price tag

your question is unclear about whether you are moving from bi weekly payments or to bi weekly payments let 's calculate each case bi weekly pay means you will be paid every two weeks the amount for each payment will be your annual salary divided by 26 possibly with a small decrease around 0.3 to account for the fact that years are slightly longer than 52 weeks i.e. there are slightly more than 26 two week periods in a year and possibly an even smaller adjustment to take account of the fact that some years are a day longer than that you will be paid literally every 14 days with some adjustments if a payday falls on a holiday if you are going to be paid twice a month then each payment will be your annual salary divided by 24 typically you are paid on the same days of each month for example the 1st and the or the last business day before those

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

what i do not get is why does the author choose to buy an itm put if    the goal was to not lose more than 5.6 he could have chosen a out of    money put where the strike is ~6 otm the reason why he is buying a itm put instead of a put 5 6 below the atm price is because he wants to only lose 5 6 after all fee 's   a put at 5 6 below atm is not free so it will not actually provide a 6 cushion more likely maximum loss after it 's cost is accounted for you can not rely on the strike alone to determine the level of protection you are buying   real world example   spy dec 2017 strike put costs $ it 's about 6 otm but it costs roughly 10 of spy $ at best it would protect 85 of your net worth    strike costs = protection   did he choose an itm put because he does not want to pay any time    premium does he not lose in wide bid ask spreads what he gains by not    paying time premium nope you were just misunderstanding how he calculated his protection he wanted to protect 5 6 after the cost of the hedge he needed to select an itm put because time premiums are so high that an otm put would n't suffice

if you are trading cfds which are usually traded on margin you will usually be charged an overnight financing fee for long positions held overnight and you will receive an overnight financing credit for short positions held overnight most cfd brokers will have their overnight financing rates set at + or 2.5 or 3 from the country 's official interest rates so if your country 's official interest rate is 5 and your broker uses + or 2.5 you will get a 2.5 credit for any short positions held overnight and pay 7.5 fee for any long positions held overnight in australia the official interest rate is 2.5 so i get 0 for short positions and pay 5 for long positions held overnight if you are looking to hold positions open long term especially long positions you might think twice before using cfds to trade as you may end up paying quite a bit in interest over a long period of time these financing fees are charged because you are borrowing the funds to open your positions if you buy shares directly you would not be charged such overnight financing fees

money has to come from somewhere   it ca n't just appear   so if there is really an aunt at an agency and she is sending checks then she is writing checks from that company and stealing from that company   if that is the case then the person with whom you are in contact would be using you to launder money hide its illegal origin and when the aunt was caught you would be also if it is really being done between countries then it might be more difficult for them to find you but it is still illegal however it is also likely that your contact may be using a common scam as described by another answerer that of asking for money in return for a cashier 's check   although cashier 's checks were designed to be safer than regular checks in that they wo n't bounce if it is a fake cashier 's check it was never worth anything in the first place   when the bank tries to claim the cash from the other bank and finds it does n't exist or there is no record of that check then the effect is similar to that of a personal check bouncing the bank will want the money back if you have already given a portion of that money to your contact chances are when your find this out he will be long gone   i would not have anything further to do with this person good luck

first a couple of quick points many people have an ira of any type and a 401k. over your professional career the retirement packages for every employer will be different   for this year you do n't need to decide on the roth or not until april 15th you will be able to put 2014 money into the account as late as april 15th 2015 you will have a better understanding of your job situation at that time it is possible that your post graduation employer does n't offer 401 k matching or has high expense funds only or has no 401k do n't worry about retirement funds and dividend season yes if you invest right before the mutual fund issues the end of year dividend the price per share will go down but in the retirement account you should just allow it to repurchase shares in a non retirement account the dividend would be a taxable event which means you will end up sending money to the irs the retirement account avoids this issue

is this legal why not but you might have trouble deducting losses on your taxes especially if you sell to someone related to you in some way which is indeed what you 're doing see the added portion below regarding dealing with related person which a sibling is the state of maryland has a transfer tax of 1.5 for each the buyer and seller would this be computed on the appraised or sale value you should check with the state in california property taxes are assessed based on sale value but if the sale value is bogus the assessors have the right to recalculate since you 're selling to family the assessors will likely to intervene and set a more close to fair market value on the transaction but again check the local law will this pose any problem if the buyer needs financing likely banks will be suspicious since you 're giving a discount to your sibling it will likely not cause a problem for financing if it was an unrelated person getting such a discount it would likely to have raised some questions would i be able to deduct a capital loss on my tax return as i said it may be a problem if the transaction is between related people likely not otherwise not sure check with a professional tax adviser ea or cpa licensed in maryland you mentioned in the comment that the buyer is a sibling irs publication has a list of what is considered related person and that includes siblings so the short answer is no you will not be able to deduct the loss the tax treatment is not trivial in this case and i suggest to have a professional tax adviser guide you on how to proceed here 's the definition of related person from the irs pub members of a family including only brothers sisters half brothers half sisters spouse ancestors parents grandparents    etc and lineal descendants children grandchildren etc an individual and a corporation if the individual directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the    corporation two corporations that are members of the same controlled group as defined in section of the internal revenue code a trust fiduciary and a corporation if the trust or the grantor of the trust directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the    outstanding stock of the corporation a grantor and fiduciary and the fiduciary and beneficiary of any trust fiduciaries of two different trusts and the fiduciary and beneficiary of two different trusts if the same person is the grantor    of both trusts a tax exempt educational or charitable organization and a person who directly or indirectly controls the organization or a member of    that person 's family a corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and more than    50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the partnership two s corporations if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation two corporations one of which is an s corporation if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each    corporation an executor and a beneficiary of an estate unless the sale or exchange is in satisfaction of a bequest two partnerships if the same persons directly or indirectly own more than 50 of the capital interests or profits interests in both    partnerships a person and a partnership if the person directly or indirectly owns more than 50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the    partnership

inflation is an attempt to measure how much less money is worth it is a weighted average of some bundle of goods and services price 's increase   money 's value is in what you can exchange it for so higher prices means money is worth less monthly inflation is quoted either as a year ending on that month or since the previous month   as the values differ by more than a factor of 10 you can usually tell which one is being referred to when they say inflation in august was 0.4 a record high or inflation in august was 3.6   you do need some context of the state of the economy and how surprised the people talking about the numbers are   sometimes they refer to inflation since the last month and then annualize it which adds to the confusion consumer inflation 's value depends on what the basket of goods is and what you define as the same good   is a computer this year the same as the last   if the computer is 10x faster do you ignore that or factor it in what basket do you use   the typical monthly consumables purchased by a middle class citizen   by a poor citizen   by a rich citizen   a mixture and if so which mixture more detailed inflation figures can focus on inflation facing each of the population by household income split durable goods from non durable goods from services split wage from non wage inflation ignore volatile things like food and energy etc inflation does n't directly cause prices to raise instead it is a measure of how much raise in prices happened   it can easily be a self as inflation expectations can lead to everyone automatically increasing the price they charge for everything wages goods etc inflation can be viewed as a measurement of the cost of holding cash   at 10 inflation per year holding a million dollars in cash for a year costs you 100,000 $ in buying power   at 1 inflation it costs   at 0.1 inflation inflation of 10 in one year followed by 10 the next adds up to 1.1 1.1 1 = 21 inflation over the two years   for low inflation numbers this acts a lot like adding the further from 0 you get the more the lower order terms make the result larger   1 inflation for two years adds up to 10 over two years 21 100 over two years 300 1000 over two years 12000 etc   and yes some places suffer 1000 inflation

individual product prices do not necessarily rise at inflation rates   what inflation means is that the purchasing power of one unit of currency decreases by x% in a year which is typically measured by looking at a broad spectrum of products in an economy and to all products   so for all products across an economy the aggregate price of all goods will on average be x% higher that they were this time last year   some products will be cheaper some will be more expensive but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates for the other part of your question inflation is an annualized percentage so an inflation rate of 12 means prices are 12 higher than they were a year ago so if you extrapolate that linear trend prices will rise again on average 1 in a month

basically in any financial system that features fractional reserve banking the monetary supply expands during times of prosperity stable low inflation of 2 4 keeps capital available while keeping the value of money stable it also discourages hoarding of wealth banks are n't vaults they take deposits and make an explicit promise to repay the depositor on demand since most depositors do n't need to withdraw money regularly the lend out the money you deposited and maintain a reserve sufficient to meet daily cash needs when times are good banks lend to people and businesses who need capital who in turn do things that add value to the overall economy when times are bad people and businesses either can not get capital or pay more for it which reduces the number of times that money changes hands and has a negative impact on the wider economy people who are trying to sell you commodities or who have a naive view of how the economy actually works decry the current monetary system and throw around scary words like fiat currency and inflation is theft what these people do n't realize is that before the present system where the value of money is based on promises to repay the gold and silver backed systems also experienced inflation with gold silver based money inflation was driven by discoveries of gold and silver deposits

question 1 how do i start or the broker problem get an online broker   you can do a wire transfer to fund the account from your bank question 2 what criticism do you have for my plan dividend investing is smart   the only problem is that everyone 's currently doing it   there is an demand for yield not just individual investors but investment firms and pension funds that need to generate income to fund retirements for their clients   as more investors purchase the shares of dividend paying securities the share price goes up   as the share price goes up the dividend yield goes down   same for bonds   for example if a stock pays $ 1 per year in dividends and you purchase the shares at $ then your yearly return not including share price fluctuations would be 1/20 = 5   but if you end up having to pay $ 30 per share then your yearly return would be or 3.3 yield   the more money you invest the bigger this difference becomes with $ 100 k invested you 'd make about $ 1.6 k more at 5   btw do n't put all your money in any small group of stocks you want to diversify   etfs work the same way where new investors buying the shares cause the custodian to purchase more shares of the underlying securities thus driving up the price up and yield down   instead of etfs i 'd have a look at something called closed end funds or cefs which also hold an underlying basket of securities but often trade at a discount to their net asset value unlike etfs   cefs usually have higher yields than their etf counterparts   i ca n't fully describe the ins and outs here in this space but you 'll definately want to do some research on them to better understand what you 're buying and how to successfully buy ie make sure you 're buying at a historically steep discount to nav and where to screen regardless of whether you decide to buy stocks bonds etfs cefs sell puts or some mix the best advice i can give is to a diversify personally with a single rare exception i never let any one holding account for more than 2 of my total portfolio value and b space out your purchases over time   b is important because we 've been in a low interest rate environment since about 2009 and when the risk free rate of return is very low investors purchase stocks and bonds which results in lower yields   as the risk free rate of return is expected to finally start slowly rising in 2017 and gradually over time there should be gradual downward pressure ie selling on the prices of dividend stocks and especially bonds meaning you 'll get better yields if you wait   then again we could hit a recession and the central banks actually lower rates which is why i say you want to space your purchases out

gt is your time frame any longer than intraday i imagine you would n't want to carry that risk overnight if you 're a broker or selling a route   most brokers these days are executing in an agent capacity so they 're never holding the risk they execute what they can the customer keeps what they ca n't    gt so say for instance you join a bid a few levels down you are n't really get filled you start hitting the offer and eventually you realize you 're competing with someone for the shares offered so you take out the price level and bid on all the exchanges so that you 're first on the bid at that level then repeat until someone that can match your appetite starts to fill you on the bid   lifting the offer hit bids lift offers and i suppose that 's a albeit a somewhat simple one passive routing strategies differ from firm to firm and algo to algo what is your customer going to think if you bid up a new price level only for the stock to rally completely away from it   gt right so say you need 100k shares there are 10k offered at 9.98 25k offered at 9.99 and 65k at 10.00 you might just enter an sweep order of 100k 10 limit and hope that you can get most of the shares off before everyone can cancel i imagine there has to be a lot of bidding it up to attract sellers and then letting people take out your bids all day   bidding it up to attract sellers sounds an awful lot like wiki just a heads up sure though if you want to tighten a spread or create new levels with aggressive passive liquidity that is a strategy the same caveats as i mentioned above apply   anyway if market impact is n't an issue for the customer sure take liquidity until you 're filled do n't forget about getting good size done in the opening and closing auctions moc if you 're too passive you risk the market moving away from you and pissing off the customer if you 're too aggressive you risk moving the market too much and pissing off the customer

you become a teacher generally k-12 but i have heard from the doe    that teachers at state schools qualify as well this is not 100 correct teaching in certain disciplines and areas stem special education title 1 schools can qualify for student loan debt forgiveness depending on the type of debt for instance i believe the federal loan forgiveness program only covers debt remaining after 10 years of teaching in a qualified discipline   do verify this as it 's been several years since i looked into the matter the doe has a student loan forgiveness program but the scope of it is somewhat narrow   i would encourage anyone considering this approach to investigate it in detail before committing to a career in teaching some states have similar programs but they typically have limitations as well

depending on the details of your solar panel setup the monthly savings may change depending on changes in the law or utility company policy   this could change how long it will take for the solar panels to pay for themselves   so your bullet point about the payback even point is not fixed at the moment you buy the solar panels it depends on costs you will incur over many years and those costs could turn out to be different from what you originally thought at least in the us home solar installations typically work by selling excess power back to the power company   the power company can change the amount that it pays you for that power   there is also typically a minimum charge for being connected to the grid and the power company can raise that charge   this article mentions one such possible change   the power companies want to keep making money and as more people start adding solar panels the power companies may change their rate structure to make that less financially feasible you can avoid many of these issues if your solar panels are not connected to the public electricity grid and you for instance store power with your own battery   however at least in the us this is very uncommon because it is more complex and expensive

let me add a few thoughts that have not been mentioned so far in the other answers   note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use not for renting out there 's a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 year 's cold rents it is considered rather expensive i do n't know how localized this rule of thumb is but i know it for germany which is apparently the op 's country too there are obviously differences between buying a house flat for yourself and in order to rent it out as others have said maintenance is a major factor for house owners and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs which is closely related to financial risk exposure e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your day time job   this plays a crucial role for landlords i know they 're all small scale landlords and most of them do put in substantial work themselves i know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case i also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that nice kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants do n't move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance    my personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment i.e. not for immediate or future personal use i 'd say that the exact circumstances are very important if you are based in a region where the buying to rental price ratio is favorable you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house then why not if this is not the case some other form of investing in real estate may be better on the other hand investing in further real estate where you live in your own house means increased lump risk you miss diversification into regions where the value of real estate may develop very differently   there is one important psychological point that may play a role with the observed relation between being rich and being landlord first of all remember that the median wealth without pensions for germany is about 51 k€ and someone owning a morgage free 150 k€ flat and nothing else is somewhere in the 7th of wealth to put it the other way round the question whether to invest 150 k€ into becoming a landlord is of practical relevance only for rich in terms of wealth people also asking this question is typically only relevant for people who already own the home they live in as buying for personal use will typically have a better return than buying in order to rent but already people who buy for personal use are on average wealthier or at least on the track to become more wealthy in case of fresh home owners than people who rent this is attributed to personal characteristics and the fact that the downpayment of the mortgage enforces saving behaviour which is typically kept up once the house is paid and is anyways found to be more pronounced than for non house owners in contrast many people who decide never to buy a home fall short of their initial savings investment plans e.g. putting the 150 k€ into an etf for the next 21 years and in the end spend considerably more money and this group of people rarely invests into directly becoming a landlord   assuming that you can read german here 's a relevant newspaper article and a related press release

you could get a discover card and then just freeze it   you might need to unfreeze it for a few minutes when you sign up for a new service but it is unlikely an ongoing subscription would process a charge in that window i believe merchants are charged a small fee for a transaction even if it is declined so they wo n't try constantly forever discover account freeze faq capitalone offers this freeze feature on their 360 debit cards you can even freeze and unfreeze your card from their mobile app this feature is becoming more common at small banks and credit unions too i know of 2 small local banks that offer it in fact almost any bank can give you a debit card then set the daily pos limit to 0 $ effectively making it an atm only card but you may need to call the bank to get that limit temporarily lifted whenever you want to sign up for a new service alternatively 's suggestion of virtual account numbers is a good idea several banks including discover have discontinued that feature but i believe citi and boa still offer them side notes

no it is n't generally believed that inflation is caused by individual banks printing money   governments manage money supply through central banks which may or may not be independent of the state there are a number of theories about money supply and inflation from monetarist to keynesian and so on the quantity theory of inflation says that long term inflation is the result of money supply but short term inflation is related to events local conditions short term inflation is a symptom of economic change   it 's like a cough for a doctor   it simply indicates an underlying event when prices go up it encourages new producers to enter the market create new supply which will then act to lower prices   in this way inflation is managed by ensuring that information travels throughout the economy   if prices go up for specific goods then all things being equal supply should go up since the increase implies increasing demand   if prices go down then this implies demand has gone down and so producers will reduce supply obviously this is n't a perfect relationship   there is which can be caused by a whole bunch of market conditions from banning of short selling to of demand supply your question is n't about quantitative easing which is a state led way of increasing money supply and which could increase inflation but is hoped to increase expenditure and investment so i wo n't cover that here the important take away is that inflation is an essential price signal to investors and business people so that they can assess market cycles   without it we would end up with vast or under supply and much greater economic disruption

ditto nate in many ways but let me add some other thoughts btw there are not four types of account but five you 're forgetting equity also called capital would it be possible to design an accounting system that does not have 5 types of accounts maybe is simpler in other ways and is internally consistent and logical i 'm sure it is but what 's the advantage   as nate points out the existing system has been in use for hundreds of years lots of people know how it works and understand it   i 'd add people have long since worked out how to deal with all the common situations and 99 of the odd cases you 're likely to hit if you invent your own system you 're starting from scratch you 'd have to come up with conventions to handle all sorts of situations how do i record buying a consumable with cash how do i record buying a capital asset with credit how do i record paying off debts how do i record depreciation etc etc if you worked at it long and hard enough and you 're a reasonably bright guy maybe you could come up with solutions to all the problems but why   if you were approaching this saying i see these flaws in the way accounting is done today i have an idea for a new better way to do accounting i 'd say good luck you have a lot of work ahead of you working out all the details to make a fully functioning system and then others to use it but if you really do have a better idea maybe you can revolutionize the world of accounting but the present system is too much trouble and i do n't want to bother to learn it i think that 's a mistake the work involved in inventing your own system is going to end up being way more than what it would take to learn the existing system as to are n't liabilities a lot like assets well in a sense i suppose a credit card is like a checking account in that you can use it to pay for things but they 're very different too from an accounting point of view with a checking account you buy something and then the money is gone so there 's one transaction reduce cash and increase office supplies or whatever but with a credit card there has to be a second transaction when you pay off the charge so step 1 increase debt and increase office supplies step 2 decrease debt and decrease cash credit cards charge interest well you do n't pay interest to use your own cash etc one of the of double entry book keeping is that every transaction involves a debit and a credit of equal amounts or a set of debits and credits where the total of the debits equals the total of the credits if you combine assets and liabilities into whatever you call it balance accounts say then some transactions would involve a matching debit and credit while others would involve a positive debit and a matching negative debit and no credit i 'm sure you could make such a system work but one of the neat built in protections against error is lost there 's a very logical distinction between things that you have or that others owe you and things that you owe to others it makes a lot of sense to want to list them separately and manage them separately i think you 'd pretty quickly find yourself saying well we have two types of balance accounts those that represent things we have and which normally have positive balances which we list on chart a and those that represent things we owe and which normally have negative balances which we list on chart b and before you know it you 've just assets and liabilities

it could be simple as far as who gets what accounts after the initial assignments go so for this example let 's look at   employee a 5 accounts worth 15 million flagged for full   employee b 1 account worth 75 million    employee c 3 accounts worth 50 million   employees have the ability to decide if they do not want anymore accounts or if they can take on more that 's pretty much what happens now hey can you handle one more account actually my accounts are pretty chaotic right now and look that way for the foreseeable future can i pass on this one    so when a new account comes available if i 've flagged myself as full i simply do n't participate in what would be a random handing out of the alpha account the only problem i could see is if employees are stretching themselves out a bit too much for extra money and not necessarily because they can rightfully handle the workload now they 're just not themselves because they want more money but that sounds like a problem that can be easily handled by looking at their performance can you handle the load no then i 'm you again this is what happens now if some people for more alpha accounts they 'd be told no there have been times now when a support has too many accounts and they pull it away and give to someone else   as far as losing money based on accounts there could simply be a baseline salary from baseline x apply the for the account values quantities and years worked there but if you were to lose all but 1 account all to no fault of you the support you 'd be at the baseline x salary right now if that happened they 'd lay you off and hand your accounts to someone else so what 's worse is how i see it   i do n't disagree with the office politics innovation being kept to the support personnel and not shared and i could see but i only see it if the numbers of employees do n't decrease which they inevitably would turnover i think is key in the beginning the crew would be dwindled down to half the numbers and the requirements for the position should inevitably increase thus an environment that 's no more toxic than an internal sales department who work side by side for commission

joke warning these days it seems that rogue trading programs are the big market makers this concludes the joke historically exchange members were market makers one or more members guaranteed a market in a particular stock and would buy whatever you wanted to sell or vice versa in a balanced market one where there were an equal number of buyers and sellers the spread was indeed profit for them to make this work market makers need an enormous amount of liquidity ability to hold an inventory of stocks to deal with temporary imbalances and a day like october 29 1929 can make that liquidity evaporate i say historically because i do n't think that any stock market works this way today i was discussing this very topic with a colleague last week went to wikipedia to look at the structure of the nyse and saw no mention of exchange members as market makers in fact it appears that the nyse is no longer a member based exchange instead today most all trading happens on electronic crossing networks where the spread is simply the difference between the highest bid and lowest ask in a liquid stock there will be hundreds if not thousands of orders clustered around the current price usually diverging by fractions of a cent in an illiquid stock there may be a spread but eventually one bid will move up or one ask will move down or new bids will come in you could claim that an entity with a large block of stock to move takes the role of market maker but it does n't have the same meaning as an exchange market maker since there 's no entity between the bidder and asker there 's no profit in the spread just a fee taken   by the ecn edit i think you have a misconception of what the spread is it 's simply the difference between the highest bid and the lowest offer at the instant a trade takes place the spread is 0 the highest bid equals the lowest offer and the bidder and seller exchange shares for money as soon as that trade is completed the spread re appears the only way that a trade happens is if buyer and seller agree on price the traditional market maker is simply an entity that has the ability to buy or sell an effectively unlimited number of shares however if the market maker sets a price and there are no buyers then no trade takes place and if there 's another entity willing to sell shares below the market maker 's price then the buyers will go to that entity unless the market 's rules forbid it

as weird as it seems 5 years is not a long term investment   furthermore investing is about accepting risk   based on your criteria for the alternative to a down payment i think your only choice is to make the larger down payment if however you were willing to invest that money for the long term in a retirement account or an educational account for example then i would definitely encourage you to invest   i think the chance that a long term investment in a diversified investment account will exceed 3.25 is pretty high   however that is only my opinion and i am not so your let your personal tolerance to risk be your guide but again based on the way you asked it down payment all the way   your time frame means you are not an investor   therefore your only option for risk free storage of money is an fdic insured account which might pay a little less than 1 for the next 5 years   a bigger down payment will have a 3.25 return in this case in that order   4 and 5 could be swapped if the interest rate on the loans is really low

this creates incentive for the employee to contribute more and increases the funds under management of the 401(k plan the size of the plan influences the fees that are charged in each of the funds offered the more assets under management the better for those in the plan more importantly 401(k plans are not allowed to discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees that discrimination is determined by calculating the average deferrals by your lower compensated employees and comparing them to the average deferrals of your highly compensated employees if highly compensated employees are saving too much compared to the rest of the pack they will have some of their contributions returned the next year with all the tax implications of that forcing everyone to contribute 6 to get the full match helps the plan to not fail the discrimination test and protects the highly compensated employees from losing some of their tax deferrals

when evaluating a refinance it all comes down to the payback refinancing costs money in closing costs there are different reasons for refinancing and they all have different methods for calculating payback   one reason to finance is to get a lower interest rate when determining the payback time you calculate how long it would take to recover your closing costs with the amount you save in interest for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one the longer you hold the mortgage after you refinance the more money you save in interest with the new rate generally it does n't pay to refinance to a lower rate right before you sell because you are n't holding the mortgage long enough to see the interest savings you seem to be 3 years away from selling so you might be able to see some savings here in the next three years   a second reason people refinance is to lower their monthly payment if they are having trouble paying it i see you are considering switching from a 15 year to a 30 year is one of your goals to reduce your monthly payment by refinancing to a 30 year you 'll be paying a lot of interest in your first few years of payments extending the payback time of your lower interest rate   a third reason people refinance is to pull cash out of their equity this applies to you as well since you are planning on using it to remodel the home you are trying to sell you have to ask yourself if the renovations you are planning will payoff in the increased sale price of your home often renovations do n't increase the value of their home as much as they cost you do renovations because you will enjoy living in the renovated home and you get some of your money back when you sell but sometimes you can increase the value of your home by enough to cover the cost of the renovation talk to a real estate agent in your area to get their advice on how much the renovations you are talking about will increase the value of your home

i was a school board member and district negotiator for the teacher contract   i came off the board in the last couple years   in this case it does n't seem like tenure is the issue   this is a seniority issue   teacher unions like most unions are strict seniority shops   that is basically the only thing that matters   tenured teachers can be let go without cause essentially only for budget reasons   districts schools will identify which grade level for elementary or what program subject the reduction in staffing will occur   the lowest senior person is let go first regardless of skill or past performance   interestingly if a teacher is certified to teach in more than 1 subject area this can also cause chaos   if that same teacher is the one who is reduced from a given department and they have higher seniority than the department where they also have certification they will bump that other teacher thus taking their job   let 's say you have a teacher who is certified in science and math in the high school setting   they are number 90 out of 200 on the seniority list   this teacher may have been teaching science for 10 years but the other teachers in that department are all higher on the seniority list   the lowest senior teacher in the math department is number 100 out of 200   if the district identifies that a reduction of 1 science teacher is necessary that teacher gets to bump the math teacher out of the job thus getting laid off so that they can fill the math slot even though they have n't taught math in over 10 years     while not in all cases often the teachers union negotiators set the stage for these type of layoffs   usually districts have only so many resources to go around   their funding is set for them by the state and any local operating levy needs to be voted into place which can be difficult   also recognize that the teachers at the table in the negotiating session are the more senior teachers in the district since they have been around longer and are much less likely to lose their jobs due to staff reductions   if the teachers union negotiates a raise that is higher than the district can support with the same number of teachers the number of teachers must be reduced   if you think the negotiators are there for all the teachers you are wrong   one of the teachers i negotiated with once said the following we would rather a higher compensation package at the expense of teacher reductions   the system is designed to defend teacher compensation and provide job security as the first priority not to provide the best education for our kids   as with this teacher they are losing a great asset because an outdated and terrible system was being upheld

you keep claiming higher taxes will do x when history shows you that 's not entirely true        we need to both rein in spending and change where the remaining money is spent in the budget we also need to take the wealthy at a higher rate so that the burden is equal to the proportion of wealth in this country that they own framing it as an either or is a logical fallacy

every company has capital even if you have a one man company you probably stated something like 100 shares of $ 1 each which means you had to take that $ 100 out of your own private pocket and pay it into the company   when the company loses money and runs out of cash they have the possibilities of 1 borrowing some money from the bank or from a loan shark 2 borrowing some money from the company owners or 3 increase the share capital for example by increasing the number of shares to 10,000 and each share holder pays his part of the $ 9,900 that 's the case that you have here   however it is only a liability in the sense that it is n't money the company earned it is money that the owners paid in they have no right to get the money back the paid in capital is actually what the owners lose if a limited company goes bankrupt

when i was younger i had a problem with washington mutual   someone had deposited a check in to my account then ran my account negative with a dupe of my debit card   tied up my account for three months while they investigated because it was n't simply a debit card fraud issue this was check fraud so they claimed   at the time all the money i had in the world was in that account and the ordeal was extremely disruptive to my life   since the i never spend on my debit card(s and i keep more than one checking account to disperse the risk and avoid disruption in the event anything ever happens again now one of the accounts contains just enough money plus a small buffer to pay my general monthly expenses and the other is my actual checking account    there 's no harm in having more than one checking account and if you think it will enhance your finances do it though there 's no reason to get a business account unless you 've actually formed a business

in addition to the other answers consultants and contractors face a real risk though admittedly small of not getting paid the more short term the gigs are the higher the risk of not getting paid for a particular job as an employee there are laws to ensure that you get your paycheck as a contractor you 're just another creditor i know a couple of contractors software engineers who have had difficulty collecting after a job i 'm not even sure one ever got paid the full amount i also personally witnessed a contractor show up for a job who was then told by the company that they unilaterally decided that they would pay half of their pre arranged rate

if you find a particular stock to be overvalued at $ 200 for example and a reasonable value at $ 175 you can place a limit order at the price you want to pay if when the stock price falls to your desired purchase price the transaction takes place your broker can explain how long a limit order can stay open this method allows you to take advantage of flash crashes when some savvy stock trader decides to game the market this tactic works better with more volatile or low volume stocks if it works for an s&p500 tracking etf you have bigger problems another tactic is to put money into your brokerage cash account on a regular basis and buy those expensive stocks funds when you have accumulated enough money to do so this money wo n't earn you any interest while it sits in the cash account but it 's there ready to be deployed at a moment 's notice when you have enough to purchase those expensive assets

yeah not anymore also i urge anybody who has been in their career for a while to try out an inflation calculator on the internet it can be a bit eye opening   i remember around 2002 when i was getting close to the end of school and talking to people ahead in my career the figure 80k was mentioned a lot for people who worked hard and stuck it out etc   i was excited about that it sounded magical and i thought it would be cool to achieve that by my 30s    80k is now like 112 buying power conversion      edit btw in my industry career the 75 90 range is still talked about like the 80 was back then   though a lot of senior pros are easily 6 figures

your best bet is to pay for title insurance if you do the same search as the title company you 'll probably find and miss the same things they would by letting a title company do the search and paying for their title insurance you 're covered in case something else surfaces in a case like this you should be getting a good enough discount do n't take the risk of doing the search yourself

sure but as a retail client you 'd be incurring transaction fees on entry and exit do you have the necessary tools to manage all the corporate actions too and index rebalances    etf managers add value by taking away the monstrous web of clerical work associated with managing a portfolio of at times hundreds of different names with this comes the value of institutional brokerage commissions data licenses etc i think if you were to work out the actual brokerage cost as well as the time you 'd have to spend doing it yourself you 'd find that just buying the etf is far cheaper   also a bit of a rabbit hole but how would you with traditional retail client tools even coordinate the simultaneous purchase of all 500 components of something like spy i would guess that on average you 're going to have significantly worse slippage to the index than a typical etf provider add that into your calculation too

read again what i said in my original post   enterprise value is the sort of bare bones total firm value it does n't include any cash because you 'd basically be paying cash for cash also this makes analysis of transaction multiples more streamlined as some firms may have a ton of excess cash on their balance sheet skewing multiples   i said that that is why we use enterprise value because if you did n't it would skew multiples

gt productivity can increase but it does n't have to productivity can remain the same but if you 've got two people competing for one job they bid wages lower since even a lower wage is better up to a point in welfare state to no wage at all   but regardless of decreases in wages productivity should still increase since there are more people working on a fundamental level labor and capital combine to create products if you add more potential labor and keep capital constant you 'll only have the same number of products being produced if increase in potential labor is n't used since unemployment has n't increased to compensate for women entering the work force there should be more goods produced

do n't worry once we get those for profit prisons up and running americans will have no problem finding jobs just expand what counts as illegal crack down on illegal activity and millions upon millions of americans will be employed at $   and the added bonus is that we 'll be able to compete with third world labor   who says there is n't a plan to make america competitive on the world labor market   now if you 'll excuse me i 'm going to go bury   my tinfoil hat it 's scaring me

i understand the question i think the tough thing is that trades over the next brief time are random or appear so so just as when a stock is $ 10.00 bid $ ask if you place an order below the ask a tick down in price may get you a fill or if the next trades are flat to higher you might see the close at $ 10.50 and no fill as it never went down to your limit   this process is no different for options than for stocks   when i want to trade options i make sure the strike has decent volume and enter a market order edit i a bit to clarify the black scholes is a model not a rigid equation say i discover an option that 's underpriced but it trades under right until it expires it 's not like there 's a reversion to the mean that will occur there are some very sophisticated traders who use these tools to trade in some very high volumes for them it may produce results for the small trader you need to know why you want to buy a stock or its option and not worry about the last $ 0.25 of its price

this is several questions wrapped together how can i see the company 's financial information how strong a claim does a stockholder or have to see the company 's financials what information do i need to know about the company financials before deciding to buy in i 'll start with the easier second question which is quasi implicit   stockholders typically have inspection rights   for example delaware general corporate law 220 gives stockholders the right to inspect and copy company financial information subject to certain restrictions check the laws and corporate code of your company 's state of incorporation to find the specific inspection right   if it is an llc or partnership then the operating agreement usually controls and there may be no inspection rights   if you have no corporate stock then of course you have no statutory inspection rights   my admittedly incomplete understanding is that generally have no inspection rights unless somehow contracted for   so if you vest as a corporate stockholder it 'll be your right to see the financials which may make even a small purchase valuable to you as a continuing employee with the right to see the financials   until then this is probably a courtesy and not their obligation the first question is not easy to answer except to say that it 's variable and highly personal for small companies   some people interpret it as or the implication being that the founders are either hiding something or that you need to examine really closely the mouth of their beautiful gift horse   other people may be much cooler about the question understanding that small companies are risky and you 're being   and in some smaller companies they may believe giving you the expenses could make office life awkward if you approach it professionally directly and briefly do not over explain yourself with the responsible accountant or hr person if any then i imagine it should not be a problem for them to give some information   conversely you may feel comfortable enough to review a high level summary sheet with a founder or to find some other way of reviewing the right information in any case i would keep the request vague simple and direct and see what information they show you   if your request is too specific then you risk pushing them to show information a which they refuse to do but a vague request would've prompted them to show you information b.   a too specific request might get you information x when a vague request could have garnered xyz   vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections the third question is difficult to say   my personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity you did n't say how new this startup is or what series stage they are on so i 'll try to stay vague the actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change   most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent usually at a monthly rate   a high burn rate relative to of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of i.e. failing before exit   burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup   of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you   high burn rate might not be bad if the company is booming along towards a successful exit you might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet rather than financials alone   you want to gauge the size of the market most startups like to claim or markets so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the   you 'll also have to have a sense for the business plan and model and whether it 's a good investment or a ridiculous rehash it 's twitter for dogs meets for russian orthodox singles   in other words appraise it like an investor or vc and figure out whether it 's a prospect for decent return   typical things like competition customer acquisition costs manufacturing costs are relevant depending on the type of business activity of course i would n't ignore psychology note that economists and finance people do n't generally condone the following sort of emotional thinking   if you do n't invest in the company and it goes big you 'll kick yourself   if it goes really big other people will either assume you are rich or feel sad for you if you say you did n't get rich   if you invest but lose money it may not be so painful as not investing and losing out the opportunity   so if you consider the emotional aspect of personal finance it may be wise to invest at least a little and hedge against syndrome   that 's more like emotional advice than hard financial advice so much of the answer really depends on your particular circumstances   obviously you have other considerations like whether you can afford the investment which will be on you to decide   and of course the 83(b election is almost always recommended in these situations which seems to be what you are saying to convert ordinary income into capital gain   you may also need cash to pay any up front taxes on the 83(b equity depending on your circumstances

hahaha that sounds good but in real life pensions are almost never fully funded and almost never fully funded when starting off that is why the post office is almost always losing money they 're required by law to pre pay some crazy number like 70 of pension and retiree obligations up front which sucks up all resources   when a employee opens a pension plan their employer starts contributing a target amount dependent on the stated benefits and the actuarial projections the market does n't always go up and the actuaries are not always correct with either   you take the risk of losing that pension if you work for a bad company same as if you invest in an employee stock option plan you can usually take a lump sum payout but who would do that when you can get guaranteed money

i am touched that you think i can start a civil war on reddit    you are a presumptuous fool and completely missed the point    i did not blame my employers for this country 's oppressive monetary system    they did not design it and they also struggle under it    your for empathy of people who were not born lucky and have to struggle to make ends meet and live every day with financial worries is the asshole attitude of the rich fuckers of whom i speak    i am sure you enjoyed over your about who you think i am    you must be one of privileged brats who has never applied for a job and has no idea what it takes to start or succeed in business if you think it is so easy    or maybe you have stockholm syndrome and learned to enjoy taking it in the ass
