credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

would you consider the owner of a company to be supporting the company if you buy stock in the company you own a small part of that company your purchase also increases the share price and thus the value of the company increased value allows the company to borrow more money to say expand operations the affect that most individuals might have on share price is very very small that does n't mean it is n't the right thing for you to do if it is something you believe in after all if enough people followed those same convictions it could have an impact on the company

i too am a full monthly statement balance payer and i received a balance transfer offer from my credit card company this one was quite different from many others that i have read about on this forum i could do a balance transfer for any amount up to $ x from another credit card or use the checks to pay   some other non credit card bills and i would not have to pay any interest for 12 months on the amount thus borrowed   but there would be a 2 service charge on the amount i was borrowing this amount would be billed on the next monthly statement and it would have to be paid in full by the due date of that month 's payment that is within the grace period allowed for payment of monthly statements else interest would start being charged on the unpaid part of the service charge at the usual rate of per month if i had not paid the previous month 's balance in full i would be charged interest at per month on the service charge starting from day one no free ride till the due date of the next month 's statement of course the balance carried over from last month would also be charged interest at if i had paid last month 's bill in full but there were any other charges purchases during the current month then   unless the entire amount due this month 's purchases plus service charge and that interest free for twelve months loan   balance was paid off within the grace period my purchases would be deemed unpaid and would start being charged interest in short the only way to avoid paying interest on the amount borrowed was to start with a card showing a $ 0 balance due on the previous month 's statement not make any charges on that card for a whole year and pay off that 2 service charge within the grace period it might also have required that one of that interest free loan be repaid each month but   i had stopped reading the offer at this point and filed it in the round circular file in short while @joetaxpayer 's tale of how as a pay in full user i 've used the zero rate to throw $ 20 k at the 5.25 mortgage is undoubtedly how things worked once it is not at all clear that they still work that way at least they do n't work that way for me   heck once upon a time for a period of about 3 months you could earn 1.5 interest per month from the credit card company by overpaying your credit card bill considerably their computers then just added on 1.5 interest by multiplying your credit balance by and so you got 1.5 per month interest from the credit card company the credit card agreements and the software got changed in a hurry and all credit card agreements state in the fine print that if you overpay your bill you do n't earn any interest on the overpayment

there is no need for micropayments monthly payments or harassment   a loan agreement can be drafted that your mom makes one payment annually to you instead of monthly payments depending on what she and you might be comfortable   with this payment could be interest only or partly interest and part repayment   of principal   or you can set it up so that there is a balloon payment due when   the loan say in five years time and she pays back the entire   principal and accumulated interest if you trust her to pay back the money   you do n't need to ask for collateral or security and you do n't need to turn the debt over to a collection agency or send large men with baseball bats to call on mom if you just want mom to return the principal when she is ready to so so and do n't really want to charge her interest then set up the loan to require annual payment of interest only and the entire principal at   the end of the agreement then each year a few days before the   interest payment is due send her a check for the interest due as a gift   mom deposits the check in her account and sends back the interest payment to you so no harm no foul you have   made her a gift presumably less than the $ 13 k exemption she has paid you interest but there is no net transfer of money and as far as the irs are concerned this is a legitimate loan do keep copies of the paperwork though and be sure to report the interest payment on your income tax returns as income to you by extension if you do n't really want the money back set up the loan so that the annual payment is $ 13 k and is part the annual interest due and part the principal until the loan is paid off

gt a trucking company making millions of dollars a year on us highways derives more value from the roads than i do    trucking companies run on very slim margins typical for a commoditized business and the vast majority of benefit is captured by other players employees and the government in the form of taxes    moreover you appear to be confusing revenue and profits   gt honestly anyone who says that they do n't need to pay for roads because of their level of benefit from them is limited and i will call you a liar unless you are living in a box in the woods 100s of miles away from civilization you absolutely rely on the road system even if you never set foot on it    nobody ever said this you are inventing an argument in order to counter it silly   gt though at the same time a national highway system was something no business would ever make as it derives too little value for an individual business for the scale required to reach enough of the market this is a perfect example of a project that is good for society but wo n't see the tab picked up by business voluntarily    sure again you are way off on a tangent though nobody here has argued against infrastructure nor taxes required to fund them    gt it is foolish to assume your market value increases do not rely on infrastructure to happen as much as paper trading inflates value for the most part it is still tied to some kind of real work or rather the expectation of being done somewhere that assumption of ability for a corporation to serve it 's shareholders is based on the fact that companies have infrastructure needs handled and that expanding delivery to three new markets wo n't be hampered because the company must first complete the highway to serve these markets   again you seem confused about the argument we are not arguing about the basis of stock valuations and appreciation which you happen to be wrong on btw we are talking about the relative value of infrastructure gained by the wealthy vs. non wealthy replace stock market with 30 year us bonds actually do n't the next thing i 'll see from you is some kind of comment about how infrastructure forms the basis for interest rates   gt;the existence of infrastructure not only supports the market but allows you to exploit it the internet here makes a great example prior to funding and a push by the government to standardize military and academic networks and technology as well as make more powerful in order to stay ahead in tech race we had a mish mash of proprietary networks with very poor abilities to use them today we have the internet a largely private system today however it would not exist without the involvement and funding from the government for the multiple programs that led to it 's existence   great nobody ever said otherwise   gt if the taxes really outweighed utility businesses would not operate in the area at all the thing is they do n't and taxes are not preventing businesses from growing    i said personal utility i personally employ 40 families i pay considerable taxes for them they pay income and sales taxes on top of that it 's a huge amount of money the government receives that they would n't have had i not chosen to go into business   incidentally this brings up another point does n't the government owe me something for generating that many jobs why am i not getting a tax break   gt yes but that is because unless you are doing it all yourself then you did not generate that $ 10 as a business owner you are in charge of managing resources to help generate that $ 10 you yourself however did not generate that $ 10 you had employees and contractors and people managing your building payroll and yes even taxes every person involved in getting the product or service from idea to the door are all part of that $ 10 if your efforts in that co are netting you 15 of the total then you are beating the market already and i am not sure what your problem is if you are looking to double or triple your investments you are looking for las vegas not wall st or main st.   i see you do n't understand how business works   gt i think the issue i see among people with your opinion is a failure to understand 2nd and 3rd order effects your bubble extends to what you do in your daily life and the parts of it you visibly see and touch the world you see and touch every day is supported and made comfortable by a whole system and people whom you will never see or know    the issue i see among people with your opinion is that it is naive and obviously not based in any real world experience if you had ever actually run a business you would realize how many people get paid before you do including the government you have maybe a 5 chance of making an above average wage and you fight like hell every day to stay afloat    i encourage you to open your eyes and try to see the perspective of people who are actually making a difference in this world and not the political and

given that a poor person probably has much less to invest how can odds be in their favor to add to lan 's great answer if one is poor because they do n't have enough income to build wealth invest then there are only two ways to change the situation earn more or spend less   neither are easy but both are usually possible   one can take on side jobs look for a better paying career etc   cutting spending can also be hard but is generally easier than adding income in general wealth building is more about what you do with your income than about how much you make   obviously the more you make the easier it is but just about anyone can build wealth if they spend less than they make once your net income is high enough that you have income then you can start building wealth   unfortunately many people have piles of debts to clean up before they are able to get to that point what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor anymore right just having $ 100 is not going to make you rich there is a practical limit to how much return you can make short of high risk activities like gambling lottery tickets etc i have actually seen this as a justification for playing the lottery which i disagree with but is an interesting point   if you just invest $ 100 at 25 per year for illustration traditional investments typically only make 10 12 on average in 10 years you 'll have about $ if instead you invest $ 100 per month at 12 annualized in 10 years you 'll have over $ 23,000 not that $ 23,000 makes you rich the point is that regularly saving money is much more powerful than having money to start with

perhaps buying some internationally exchanged stock of china real estate companies it 's never too late to enter a bubble or profit from a bubble after it bursts as a native chinese my observations suggest that the bubble may exist in a few of the most populated cities of china such as beijing shanghai and the price does n't seem to be much higher than expected in cities further within the mainland such as and i myself is living in i did a post about the urban housing cost of at the end of last year it may give you a rough idea of the pricing level the average of 5,500 cny per square meter condo has n't fluctuated much since the posting of the entry but you need to pay about 1,000 to 3,000 higher to get something desirable for location just search china in google maps = = = = = = = = = = = i actually have no idea how you a foreigner can safely and easily profit from this i 'll just share what i know it 's really hard to financially enter china to prevent speculative funds from freely entering and leaving china the admin of forex has laid down a range of rigid policies regarding currency exchange by law any native individual such as me is imposed of a maximum of $ 50,000 that can be converted from usd to cny or the other way around per year and a maximum of $ 10,000 per day larger chunks of exchange must get the written consent of the admin of forex or it will simply not be cleared by any of the banks in china even hsbc that 's not owned by china however you can circumvent this limit by using the social id of your immediate relatives when submitting exchange requests it takes extra time and effort but viable however things may change drastically should china be in a forex crisis or simply war you may not be able to withdraw usd at all from the banks in china even with a positive balance that 's your own money my whole income stream are usd which is wired monthly from us to bank of china i purchased a property in the middle of last year that 's worth cny using the funds i exchanged from usd i had earned it 's a down payment on a mortgage loan of 20 years in cny not usd the current household loan rate is across the entire china however because this is my first property it is discounted by 30 to to encourage the first house purchase there will be no more discounts of loan rate for the 2nd property and so forth to discourage speculative stocking that drives the price high the apartment i bought in july of 2009 can easily be sold at 300,000 now some of the earlier buyers have enjoyed much more appreciation than i do to give you a rough idea a house bought in 2006 is now evaluated 100 more one bought in 2008 now 50 more and one bought in the beginning of 2009 now 25 more

to avoid having it become overly complicated i suggest it be run as would a mutual fund mutual funds transact each evening to set a price transactions for purchases or sales are done at that price each evening   initially you have a dollar amount invested for each person you can calculate the percent of the fund each has and assuming the total is under $ 10 k 7 digits after the decimal accuracy is enough to track each share to the 1/10 cent   when new money is added that night you calculate the exact value of investments and add the new funds so each person now has a smaller share of the larger fund   if you wish you can normalize this to share value so my initial investment of $ 1000 is 100 shares regardless of the total amount invested then when new money comes in the shares increase as well this may feel better as a declining percent may just seem awkward even though that 's the case

i was doing some thinking about this a while back and it makes absolute perfect sense for amazon to buy ups with issued shares   first off amazon 's stock is overpriced in every form of the word which means using issued stocks to buy things is the best way to abuse the current situation it gives even more validity to their share price some examples if lets say amazon issued 1 extra share for every existing share it would give them 235 billion of purchasing power if they used this to buy 235 billion worth of utility companies the stock price can not really go down below 235 billion in market cap because they own 235 billion in real valuable companies so if a completely worthless company like the south seas company issued stock to buy real businesses they could make validity to their absurd price if the south seas company had a market cap of 500 billion at their high and issued 1 share per existing share and bought 250 billion dollars of businesses and assets they suddenly became a real company and can not really go under a market cap of 250 billion too bad they did n't and the company went under almost instantly once the scam was found out    by buying ups they gain the company at a discount of the discrepancy of amazon 's price and intrinsic value but the biggest reason to merge with ups is for their current customers so with deliveries amazon would have to spend the same amount on their route as ups they still have to hire a driver for 8 hours a day they still have to pay for the same amount of gas and they stop at more or less the same amount so your expenses are fixed any extra package that amazon would deliver that they would n't before is almost pure profit the expenses do n't change if the truck is 3/4 full or full which means that all of ups 's business would become almost pure profit they need to buy ups or fedex making a new service is a huge mistake it 's probably just a bargaining chip in negotiation because of these reasons   also a side note amazon should also buy a huge railroad they have a part in every inch of this country and to buy its own method of transportation to transport boxes which is more fuel and time efficient than trucks makes sense they would also be able to design a lighter weight train designed to just carry boxes sending one truck to a warehouse is much more costly than just attaching a light weight train car heading to that warehouse anyways    just my two cents if i were ceo of amazon

the answer to your question is it depends   depending on the state you your friend and the llc are located in it can be very easy to run afoul of state banking laws or to somehow violate some other statute pertaining to the legal activities an llc may undertake by doing something like a loan it is not unusual or illegal for officers or employees of a business entity to be loaned money by the company they work for so something of this nature would n't be an issue with regulatory agencies   having your llc loan money to a friend who is n't an employee or officer of your llc just might not be kosher though the best advice i can give is that you should call the state banking commission or similar agency in your state and ask them whether what you want to do is alright   the last thing you want is to end up with auditors or regulators around your business even if you have n't done anything wrong and you certainly do n't want to run the risk of accidentally piercing the corporate veil as someone else here pointed out good luck

inflation will hurt your landlord but it wo n't hurt you in either case you have to pay 7200 regardless of how much inflation has increased over two years   however they are not equivalent to you if you take the monthly payment then you can potentially come out ahead if you were to take the 7200 and put it in a savings account and just pay monthly then you 'll be earning interest that you would n't get if you paid up front   there 's a whole lot of other investment options you could go with too but that 's another question the risk here is that if you go through financial hardship you may be tempted to draw on that 7200 early and come up short for rent one month

unfortunately in this market environment your goal is not very realistic at the moment real interest rates are negative and have been for some time   this means if you invest in something that will pay out for sure you can expect to earn less than you lose through inflation   in other words if you save your $ 50 k when you withdraw it in a few years you will be able to buy less with it then than you can now you can invest in risky securities like stocks or mutual funds   these assets can easily generate 10 per year but they can and do also generate negative returns   this means you can and likely will lose money after investing in them   there 's an even better chance that you will make money but that varies year by year   if you invest in something that expects to make 10 per year meaning it makes that much on average it will be extremely risky and many years it will lose money perhaps a lot of it   that 's the way risk is   are you comfortable taking on large amounts of risk good chances of losing a lot of your money you could make some kind of real investment   $ 50 k is a little small to buy real estate but you may be able to find something like real estate that can generate income especially if you use it as a down payment to borrow from the bank   there is risk in being a landlord as well of course and a lot of work   but real investments like that are a reasonable alternative to financial markets for some people another possibility is to just keep it in your bank account or something else with no risk and take $ 5000 out per year   it will only last you 10 years that way but if you are not too young that will be a significant portion of your life   if you are young you can work and add to it unfortunately financial markets do n't magically make people rich   if you make a lot of money in the market it 's because you took a risk and got lucky   if you make a comfortable amount with no risk it means you invested in a market environment very different from what we see today edit to get an idea of what risk free investments after inflation earn per year at various horizons see this table at the treasury   at the time of this writing you would have to invest in a security with maturity almost 10 years in order to break even with inflation   beating it by 10 or even 3 per year with minimal risk is a pipe dream

in most cases the brand on the card eg visa or mastercard is a middleman the company processes the transaction transferring $ xx from the bank to the seller and telling the bank to debit the buyer 's account the bank is at risk not the company transacting the purchase what 's interesting is that american express started as both my first amex card issued in 1979 long expired but in my box of had no bank american express offered a card that offered no extended credit it was pay in full each month since then amex started offering extended credit i.e. with annual interest and minimum payments and more recently offering transaction processing for banks which take on the credit risk essentially becoming very similar to mastercard and visa

you need to determine for the taxing jurisdiction when the next tax appraisal will be done in some cases the appraisal is done every year or two or three in other cases it is also done when the property is sold the county tax office website should contain this information they will also have information on how to appeal most jurisdictions do have a way of looking up not only the rates but the value of the property in question you will also be interested in determining if the tax value of the property is lower due to local state laws that limit the growth in value from one assessment to another a sale of the property could trigger a for the value it is possible that the value of the home has already been factored into the assessment it is also possible that it has n't keep in mind that taxes in some jurisdictions can be more complicated because there is also a town city county component and some places that also breakout other items on the tax bill like storm water management schools pest spraying these other items can be based on value square footage of the lot or a flat amount you should get a local opinion on the likelihood of a successful appeal and how much adjustment you would be able to get depending on the sale date and the due date for the taxes you may be forced to pay the higher tax rate for a while until either the next re appraisal or the next appeal window   note the fact that it is being auctioned may mean that what you pay for the house may be immaterial because the tax authorities could determine that the motivation to sell quickly could have depressed the value this type of sale will not impact the value of other houses and ca n't be used as a basis for determining the value of other properties

as someone who has a very similar debt amount and environment new grad nice new paying job want a car etc i 'd like to share something with you life has unexpected costs luckily i did n't buy that new car the first few months out of college like i had planned to i 'm glad that i did n't because as a fledgling adult despite having lived on my own while in college while working part to full time there are some things you just do n't realize until it either happens or it happens to someone else here are some of those things i could go on but i wo n't $ 95 k is good money and i would definitely recommend spending it a bit to enjoy yourself but i would honestly tell you that taking your monthly expenses adding a few hundred on top of that and then multiplying   that sum by 3 would be a smart savings amount before picking up a car loan maybe that 's an excessive savings but i 've seen way too many people burn out over their cost of living and their failure to adjust appropriately when shit hits the fan so instead of having to deal with the stab at your pride when having to lower the cost quality of living that you 'll probably grow accustomed to at a $ 95 k salary just prepare for the worst   oh and did i mention a new job is not a secure job consider yourself to likely be the first asset dropped from the company if even the tiniest thing goes wrong i know way too many people who were fresh hires at intel boeing and a few other big tech companies that pay around what you make and despite being bad asses in college they were dropped like a bad habit when their employers hit rough patches to those even more experienced than me please feel free to add to the list i 'd personally love to know them myself

details as usual will depend on local culture and jurisdiction but in most jurisdictions there is generally no obligation for you to actively return something money parcel whatever you received in error usually it 's enough to notify the sender actually it might be a dangerous mistake to return it yourself what if you send it to the wrong account so you probably have done all you had to and can close your account without further delay however until the time specified by statute of limitations or similar concept in your jurisdiction has passed usually a few years the company could ask you to return the money if they do ask be prepared to return it so do not spend it my recommendation would be then lean back and wait

if you are investing in a mortgage strictly to avoid taxes the answer is pay cash now   a mortgage buys you flexibility but at the cost of long term security and in most cases an overall decrease in wealth too   at a very basic level i have to ask anyone why they would pay a bank a dollar in order to avoid paying the government 28 36 cents depending on your tax rate after all one can only deduct not principal interest is like rent it accrues strictly to the lender not equity in theory the recipient should be irrelevant if you have a need to stiff the government go ahead just realize you making a banker three times as happy   additionally the peace of mind that comes from having a house that no banker can take away from you is at least for me compelling if i have a $ 300,000 house with no mortgage no payments etc i feel quite safe even if my money is tied up in equity if a serious situation came along say a huge doctors bill i always have the option of a reverse mortgage later on so to directly counter other claims yes i 'd rather have $ 300k in equity then $ 50k in equity and $ in liquid assets did you notice that the total net worth is $ 25k less and that 's even before one considers the cash flow implication of a continuing mortgage   i have no mortgage and i 'm 41 i have a lot of net worth but the thing that i really like is that i have a roof over my head that no on e can take away from me and sufficient savings to weather most crises   that said a mortgage is not about total cost it is about cash flow to the extent that a mortgage makes your cash flow situation better it provides a just not one that is quantifiable in dollars and cents rather it is a risk reward situation by taking a mortgage even when you have the cash you pay a premium the interest rate in order to have your funds available when you need it   a very simple strategy to calculate and/or minimize this risk would be to invest the funds in another investment if your rate of return exceeds the interest rate minus any tax preference e.g. 4 minus say a 25 deduction = 3 your money is better off there obviously and indeed when interest rates are only 4 it may may be possible to find that that said in most instances a cd or an inflation protected bond or so wo n't give you that rate of return there you 'd need to look at slightly more risky when interest rates are back to say 5 or 6 it gets even harder   if you could however find a better return than the effective interest rate it makes the most sense to do that investment hold it as a hedge to pay off the mortgage see you get your security back if you decide not to work and pocket the difference if you ca n't do that your only real reason to hold the cash should be the cash flow situation

through that link what exactly do you want me to read   the changes to inflation under clinton were made to made to more accurately account for inflation so if anything things are more accurate now than in 1950 the precise details of the changes are documented on the bls website somewhere but the short of it is that the old inflation definition had the problem where if prices went up or down and then back to original you would still have inflation which is incorrect the changes lessen this effect many independent groups like the billion price project agree that the current bls methods for measuring inflation is more correct than the older methods and match actual pricing better note that the billion prices index does not include hedonics as far as i know and in practice the amount of goods to which hedonics applies in the cpi basket is so small as to not matter much anyways finally the idea is sound one should account for to products as adding value so comparing a 20 tv from 1970 to one today needs more than merely retail price to evaluate price increases certainly gets more tv than back then   if you have claims otherwise i 'd like to hear them until then i suspect we more accurately measure gdp and inflation than in 1950 not less accurately   all this still does not show there is more of the numbers than in 1950 and the poster above you said it seems he 's making excuses to obtain an he desires rather than the correct approach which is to measure carefully and then think what it means   and no one here said gdp was a universal measure of economic health

there are several factors here firstly there 's opportunity cost i.e. what you would get with the money elsewhere if you have higher interest opportunities investing paying down debt elsewhere you could be paying that down instead there 's also domino effects by reducing your liquid savings to or below the minimum you ca n't move any of it into tax advantaged retirement accounts earning higher interest then there 's the insurance costs you are required to buy extra insurance to protect your lender you should factor in the extra insurance you would buy vs the insurance required given that you can buy the car yourself catastrophic insurance may not be necessary or you may prefer a higher deductible than your lender will allow if you 're not sufficiently capitalized you may need gap insurance to cover when your car depreciates faster than your loan is paid down a 30 percent payment should be enough to not need it though finally there 's some value in having options if you have the loan and the cash you can likely pay it off without penalty but it will be harder to get the loan if you do n't finance it maybe you can take out a loan against the car later but i have n't looked into the fees that might incur   if it 's any help i 'm in the last stretch of a 3 year car loan at the time paying in cash was n't an option and having done it i recognize that it 's more complicated than it seems

this is why california tax code is even more messed up than the federal they take the federal and then add some or remove or mix up whether your brokerage will send 1099 or not is up to the brokerage its a federal requirement california may require them to send it out for ca residents or may not they may adhere to the ftb or may not it does n't matter to you you 'll have to keep track of the interest and dividends received cost basis for the securities etc etc just as any other brokerage account you can not rely solely on the information on the 1099 anyway since it does n't include many things you have to take into account for your federal tax return as well wash sales inter brokerage being the most obvious example as to what happens when you 're 65 you 'll have to keep track again of all the taxes paid and track your california basis in the account and your federal basis in the account and they will not be   the same reconciliation time again when you get there what a mess if you move to another state the taxes you paid to ca are lost   similarly if you move in to california all the gains prior to moving in are not taxed by california whatever happens after is taxed by ca as if it was a regular investment account

the gold standard did n't work because of the following process   start with 10 oz of gold deposit in bank a bank lends out 9 oz of gold certificates gold certificates deposited in bank b bank b lends out 8 oz of gold certificates etc   now at the end of all this we have a lot of gold certificates   this is called the money wiki effect   what if someone wants to take their gold certificates and buy a boat made in europe   well   if they spend 5 gold certificates on that boat then the certificates land in the european bank who requests gold to be shipped from america to pay for it     suddenly america 's bank reserves collapse and there is a very sharp credit contraction as all the banks stop lending because they are out of reserves that back their gold certificates   if the person had actual coins he was using to buy the boat only his consumption would be reduced and it would n't cause damage throughout the whole financial system   so basically wherever you have fractional reserve banking gold backed monetary systems will fail   anywhere you criticize fractional reserve banking your theory will be basically ignored because criticizing banking gets you nowhere in economics career wise   praising derivatives and all sorts of hair financial innovations will win you awards and prizes and guest appearances on cnbc though

yea i know the dimensions too and it is the exact same wood because it is all imported from the us the japanese mills cut wood to mm but the imported dimensional lumber from the us is cheaper but not used in house framing whatsoever people use it for decks and sheds and and whatnot    having the name for the board be a dimension the board is n't and not display the actual dimensions as well is lame that is the key point i have learned being here in japan    they have an array of 2x4 ft boards labeled as such and the mm right below them    when i buy mm thin lumber that lumber is exactly there is no assumption the actual dimension is smaller the fact that you need to know that the actual dimensions is smaller for us dimensional lumber is both traditional and asinine inches means nothing to japanese people they do n't know the actual dimensions are wrong so it never bothers them everything is displayed in actual so they are not   affected by such    2x4 lumber is common and well understood by most people in the us but they should also have the exact dimensions displayed as because most is n't all

100 debt free is an objective being there is good but as long as you have a plan to get there are sticking to it and it 's moving you towards it at a reasonable rate e.g. i will be debt free by the end of 2011 you should be in good shape it 's when you do n't ever expect to be debt free that you have a problem going into debt is one question and a very situation dependent one getting back out is another and a very easy one pay off all debts as a fast as you reasonably can starting with the highest interest ones otoh this does n't imply that you should forgo every optional expense including things like savings and entertainment to pay off debts that would be unreasonable but just that paying down debts should always be considered when thinking about what to do with money

this chart summarizes the fed 's balance sheet things the fed has purchased us treasuries mortgage backed securities etc nicely   it shows the massive level of printing the fed has done in the past two years   the fed prints new money to buy these assets as has pointed out the fractional reserve banking process also expands the money supply   when the fed buys something from bank a then bank a can take the money and start lending it out   this process continues as the recipients of the money deposit the newly printed money in other fractional reserve banks fyi it took 95 years for the fed to print the first $ 900 billion   it took one year to print the next $ 900 billion

lets look at possible use cases if you ever converted your cryptocurrency to cash on a foreign exchange then yes you had to report that means if you ever and the us dollar or other fiat amount was $ 10,000 or greater when you went out of crypto then you need to report because the regulations stipulate you need to report over $ 10,000 at any point in the year if you did not convert your cryptocurrency to cash and only had them on an exchange 's servers perhaps traded for other cryptocurrency pairs then no this did not fall under the regulations example in 2013 i wanted to cash out of a cryptocurrency that did n't have a usd market in the united states but i did n't want to go to cash on a foreign exchange specifically for this reason amongst others so i sold my litecoin on btc e slovakia for bitcoin and then i sold the bitcoin on coinbase usa   even though btc e had a litecoin usd market and then i could day trade the swings easily to make more capital gains but i wanted cash in my bank account and did n't want the reporting overhead read the regulations yourself financial instruments that are reportable cash fiat securities futures and options also whether it is just in the blockchain or on a server irs and fincen said bitcoin is not reportable on fbar when they update their guidance it 'll be in the news the director of fincen is very active in cryptocurrency developments and guidance bitcoin has been around for six years it is n't that esoteric and the government is n't that confused on what it is irs and fincen 's hands are tied by congress in how to more realistically categorize cryptocurrency although at this point in time there are several very liquid exchanges within the united states such as the one nyse ice hosts coinbase

you can apply for a position with any company you like whether or not you are a shareholder however owning shares in a company even lots of shares in a company does not entitle you to having them even look at your resume for any job let alone the ceo position you generally can not buy your way into a job   the hiring team if they are doing their job correctly will only hire you if you are qualified for the job not based on what your investments are stockholders get a vote at the shareholders meeting and a portion of the profits dividend and that 's about it   they usually do n't even get a discount on products let alone a job of course if you own a significant percentage of the stock you can influence the selections to the board of directors   with enough friends on the board you could theoretically get yourself in the ceo position that way

a couple ideas use excel it has an irr internal rate of return that can handle a table of inputs as you describe along with dates deposited to give you a precise number   go simple track total deposits over the year assume half of that was present in january so for example your account started the year with $ 10k ended with $ 15k but you deposited $ 4k over the year it should be clear the return gain is $ 1k right but it 's not 10 as you added during the year i 'd divide $ for an return not knowing how your deposits were structured the true number lies between the 10 and 6.7 as extremes you 'll find as you get older and have a higher balance this fast method gaining accuracy as your deposits are a fraction of your account and likely spread out pretty smoothly over the year anyway

consider the mechanic which actually drives the price of a stock in simplest terms the price of a stock is the price at which the most recent trade occurred ie if the price of ibm is $ 100/share that means the last time someone bought ibm stock they paid $ 100 above and below the spot price are dozens hundreds thousands of buyers and sellers who have placed orders that no one is yet willing to match ie if ibm 's spot price is at $ 100 there could still be 10,000 people willing to sell for $ 101 called the ask price for the lowest price someone is currently willing to sell at and 15,000 willing to buy for $ 99 called the bid price for the highest price someone is currently willing to buy for   until someone is willing to buy for $ 101 then no one will be able to sell at $ 101 until someone is willing to sell for $ 99 no one will be able to buy for $ 99 typically orders are placed in the market at a particular limit meaning that those orders to buy at $ at $ 101 are already in the system and will be matched immediately as soon as someone is willing to meet the price on the other side now consider general market economics high demand drives up price and high supply drives down price if the details above for ibm were yesterday and today some news came out that ibm was laying off employees imagine that another 10,000 people who held shares wanted to sell now there would be 20,000 sellers and only 15,000 buyers if those new sellers were aggressive about wanting to sell they would have to drop their price to $ 99 to match the highest buyers in the market put together this means that as more sellers enter the market supply of shares increases driving down price conversely as more buyers enter the market demand for shares increases driving up share price as a result of the above you can say that all else being equal if price for a stock goes up there were more buyers that day and if price goes down there were more sellers that day on the face of it that is not necessarily true because you could have the same number of buyers and sellers one side could have simply decreased increased their acceptable price to match the other side

because it ignores several important facts namely   a the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else   b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals a simple example if i have $ 5 m in net worth i can invest it in the stock market and stay home if you do n't have that option you need to go to work and that will likely require roads i wo n't be taking unemployment benefits but you are far more likely to and so on   c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   d society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   the infrastructure argument has been used to fool low and middle income voters the truth is that infrastructure benefits these voters and the government far more than it does wealthy individuals

i had a chat with a coworker whose spouse also teaches music lessons one interesting insight was that after raising prices the children were much more likely to come prepared because the parents felt more invested when it cost them more they were also less likely to cancel the lessons at the last minute this is an argument in favor of 's suggestion to charge something even if we donate the income to charity along those lines it might also make sense to give discounts if the child comes prepared having practiced daily   i agree that it 's not a lot of paperwork for some additional pay the problem is that i would also be tempted to buy a new piano and find other expenses to reduce the income that 's a discussion for another day   i think the break even point is probably somewhere around $ when i weigh record keeping time verses the income so as long as we exceed that i will probably encourage her to charge for the lessons even if she charges below the market for them i will consider setting up a charitable giving account that they can pay to instead of paying us directly

the answer depends entirely on your mortgage terms is the interest rate low how many years left questions like this are about cost of capital if your mortgage has a low interest for a lot of years you have a low cost of capital   by paying it off early you are dumping that low cost of capital use the extra money to start a business invest in something or even buy another property rental   whenever you have a low cost of capital do n't rush to get rid of it of course if there are no other investment business opportunities available and the extra money is going into a low return savings account you might as well pay down your debt   or if you lack the self discipline to use the extra money properly buying flat screens and meals out then yeah just pay down your debt but if you 're disciplined with the extra money use it to get access to more capital and make that new capital work for you

there are two in investing active management and passive management passive management is based on the idea you ca n't beat the market passive investors believe in the efficient markets hypothesis the market all information about an asset so price is equal to underlying value another idea in this field is that there 's a minimum risk associated with any given return you ca n't increase your expected return without assuming more risk to see it graphically    as expected return goes up so does risk if we stat with a portfolio of 100 bonds then remove 30 bonds and add 30 stocks we 'll have a portfolio that 's 70 stocks turns out that this makes expected return increase and lower risk because of diversification markowitz showed that you could reduce the overall portfolio risk by adding a riskier but uncorrelated asset basically if your entire portfolio is us stocks then you 'll lose money whenever us stocks fall but if you have half us stocks quarter us bonds and quarter european stocks then even if the us market tanks half your portfolio will be unaffected theoretically adding different types of uncorrelated assets can reduce risk and increase returns   let 's tie this all together we should get a variety of stocks to reduce our risk and we ca n't beat the market by security selection ideally we ought to buy nearly every stock in the market so that   so what 's our solution why the exchange traded fund etf of course an etf is basically a bunch of stocks that trade as a single ticker symbol for example consider the spdr s&p 500 spy you can purchase a unit of spy and it will move up down proportional to the s&p 500 this gives us diversification among stocks to prevent any significant downside while limiting our upside how do we diversify across asset classes luckily we can purchase etf 's for almost anything gold etf 's commodities us bond etf 's domestic bonds international stock etfs intl bonds etfs etc so we can buy etf 's to give us exposure to various asset classes thus diversifying among asset classes and within each asset class determining what of our portfolio to put in any given asset class is known as asset allocation and some people say up to 90 of portfolio returns can be determined by asset allocation   that pretty much sums up passive management the idea is to buy etfs across asset classes and just leave them you can readjust your portfolio holdings periodically but otherwise there is no rapid trading now the other umbrella is active management the idea is that you can generate superior returns by stock selection active investors reject the idea of efficient markets   a classic and time proven strategy is value investing after the collapse of bank stocks greatly fell but all the other stocks fell with them some stocks worth $ 100 were selling for $ 50 value investors quickly snapped up these stocks because they had a margin of safety even if the stock did n't go back to 100 it could go up to $ 80 or $ 90 eventually and investors profit the main ideas in value investing are have a big margin of safety look at a company 's fundamentals earnings book value etc and see if it promises adequate return coke has tremendous earnings and it 's a great company but it 's so large that you 're never going to make 20 profits on it annually because it just ca n't grow that fast another field of active investing is technical analysis as opposed to the fundamental analysis of value investing technical analysis involves looking at charts for patterns and looking at stock history to determine future paths things like resistance points and trend lines also play a role technical analysts believe that stocks are just ticker symbols and that you can use guidelines to predict where they 're headed   another type of active investing is day trading this basically involves buying and selling stocks every hour or every minute or just at a rapid pace day traders do n't hold onto investments for very long and are always trying to predict the market in the short term and take advantage of it many individual investors are also day traders   the other question is how do you choose a strategy the short answer is pick whatever works for you the long answer is day trading and technical analysis is a lot of luck if there are consistent systems for trading then people are keeping them secret because there is no book that you can read and become a consistent trader high frequency trading hft is an area where people basically mint money but it s more technology and less actual investing and would not be categorized as day trading   benjamin graham once said in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine value investing will work because there 's evidence for it throughout history but you need a certain temperament for it and most people do n't have that furthermore it takes a lot of time to adequately study stocks and people with day jobs ca n't devote that kind of time so there you have it this is my opinion and by no means definitive but i hope you have a starting point to continue your study i included the theory in the beginning because there are too many monkeys on cnbc and the news who just do n't understand fundamental economics and finance and there 's no sense in applying a theory until you can understand why it works and when it does n't

living in one unit of a multi family while renting out the others although not without its risks can be a viable if gradual way to build wealth it 's been recently as house hacking but the underlying mechanics have been around for many years many cities in the northeast in particular remain full of neighborhoods of homes built and used for exactly that purpose for decades though now frequently sub divided into condos   it 's true you 'd need to borrow money but there are a number of reasons why it 's certainly at least worth exploring which is what you seem to be asking should you bother doing the homework tl;dr yes and yes you would be relying on tenants to meet your monthly expenses including a mortgage bill that will arrive whether the other units are vacant or not but in most markets rental prices are far less volatile than home prices from the san francisco federal reserve the main result from this is that the behavior of the    price rent ratio for housing mirrors that of the price dividend ratio    for stocks the majority of the movement of the price rent ratio comes    from future returns not rental growth rates emphasis added it 's also important to remember that rental income must do more than just cover your mortgage there 's lots of other expenses associated with a rental property including insurance taxes maintenance vacancy an allowance for the periods when the property will be empty in between tenants reserves for capital improvements and more as with any investment it 's all about whether the numbers work you mentioned not being interested in the upkeep work so that 's another 8 10 off the top to pay for a property manager if you can find a property at an attractive price secure financing on attractive terms and can be reasonably confident that it will rent in the ballpark of 1.5 2 of the purchase price then it might be a fine choice for you assuming you are willing and able to handle the work of being a landlord something worth at least as much of your research time as the investment itself   it sounds like you 're still a ways away from having enough for even an fha down payment which gives you a great opportunity to find and talk with some local folks who already manage rental properties in your area for example you might look for a local chapter of the national real estate investment association to get a sense of what 's really involved

a check is simply an order to the bank to pay money to someone the payor 's signature on the front of the check is all that 's needed to make that order binding if you read the check carefully you 'll see that it says pay to the order of that 's the payor 's instruction to the bank and as payee you can make a further order to pay the money to someone else in which case you 'd have to endorse the check to make your order binding but nobody does that any more instead people always just deposit checks into their accounts when you deposit a check the payor 's signature is all that 's needed to tell the payor 's bank that it should pay the money if your bank insists on a signature as well that 's just to pretend that they 're paying attention in case it turns out that you stole the check in reality banks do n't pay attention to signatures nor to the name of the payee i once put the wrong check into an envelope and the phone company got a check for something over $ 700 on a bill of less than $ 50 payable to some completely different company they deposited it and gave me a credit for the balance none of the banks in the transition chain questioned it

yes you may make non deductible contributions to an ira the main benefit of a non deductible ira is tax deferred earnings if the investment pays out dividends they will be kept in the ira whether you take them in cash and put them in a cash management account or you automatically reinvest them you do not get taxed on these earnings until you withdraw from the ira during retirement if your income at that time is significantly lower than your income while you 're working you will be in a lower tax bracket unless tax rates change drastically between now and then so the taxes you pay on these earnings will be lower than if you 'd invested outside the ira and paid taxes along the way you also get the benefit of compounding of the tax deferred earnings there 's one caveat when you withdraw from the ira all the growth is treated as ordinary income even if some of it is capital gains it will be taxed at your ordinary income rate not your capital gains rate so this is most beneficial for investments that produce dividends   if you have a mix of deductible and non deductible contributions to your ira the tax on the principle portion of your withdrawals is pro rated based on the ratio of deductible to total contributions this ensures that you eventually get taxed for the deductible portion it 's not really tax free it 's tax deferred but do n't get taxed twice for the non deductible portion another option if your 401(k plan allows it is to make after tax contributions to the 401(k at the end of the year you can make an in service distribution of these contributions and their earnings from the 401(k to a roth conversion ira this allows you to contribute to a roth ira even if you 're above the income limit for normal roth ira contributions you can also do this even if you 're also making non deductible contributions to your regular ira

not to state the obvious but whenever an investment is being made the nuts and bolts is your return on investment   analyzing the rate of return on an investment is the primary factor in any decision   ideally once the actual mechanics of investment and side benefits are factored out the goal is to be able to analyze the pure financial return usually the biggest problem faced in analyzing various investments is comparing the present value of an investment to a series of payments that may be made or received in the future   when considering the purchase of a large equity for example you might be looking at what series of payments are required to purchase the asset   you can also reverse this and ask what amount of money is equivalent to this series of payments ultimately the present value of an annuity is the way to make these comparisons equal    fundamentally the present value of an annuity is an amount of money that should in theory be equivalent to a series of payments   there is for example technically no difference between $ today and $ 100 a month for a year at an interest rate of 1 per month   grant you most people would be happier with the money now but that is what interest does it compensates you for waiting on your money    you can fire up a spreadsheet and calculate the present value as long as you have the monthly payment interest rate and number of periods   alternatively you can calculate any one of those missing four variables and the key is usually to understand what that rate would be in order to compare the investments finally the taxable implication is really just an adjustment to the rate of return imagine the following three scenarios obviously the rates are fictional the goal is to show they are the same scenarios 1 2 are really just two sides of the same coin   using the future value formula in excel = 12 -100 you get $   in scenario 1 you would have $ in your bank account   in scenario 2 your bank would have $ from you and you would have $ 100 less debt per month   they are equivalent transactions    scenario 3 is really just a variation on scenario 2 localized to the united states   because the interest is tax deductible however the rate of 6 is n't really accurate   assuming you had a 25 tax bracket you 'd actually be getting back one quarter of your interest   put another way 7.5 mortgage interest costs you as much as 6 credit card debt this is how you compare apples and just turn everything into an annuity or a lump sum using present value calculations    finally quick rule of thumb if you owe taxes in both canada and the us your canadian taxes are probably higher than your american ones   as such any tax incentives will be higher   if you only can only use canadian tax incentives then look to those incentives other things being equal

i think that author does a disservice by writing such seemingly sensible articles without actually knowing how things work if i did n’t know better i would think this guy was teaching me something it ’s a shame he did not do research before he started writing   let ’s say you buy a classic car you take super good care of it all original mint condition you paid cash for it out of your savings this is a balance sheet transaction that has nothing to do with income you traded your cash asset for a classic car asset   now let ’s say this car is so rare and you keep it in such good condition that it gains value every year maybe it was worth $ 15k when you bought it but this year it ’s already worth $ 17k great job on making a great purchase but is that $ 2k gain counted as income to you no it is not the value of that asset on your balance sheet went up but you did not make anything off of that increase in value because you have not sold it   if you had to pay taxes on the increase in value every year those taxes would essentially force you to sell that car to pay the taxes just because you took care of it additionally in the long term no one would want to own anything so this would destroy the value of everyone ’s stuff but i digress   in this example amazon stock is the car the author is seeing the increase in stock value adding to the balance sheets of the investors who bought the stock and confusing that with income   back to our example let ’s say your car increased in value $ 2k a year for two years and you decide to sell it for $ 19k now we are about to realize some income since you bought it for $ 15k and sold for $ 19k you earned an income of the difference or $ 4k    your income was n’t $ 19k because you originally put $ 15k in cash into the car that cash was already saved from income you made in the past and it is not counted again as income in this sale   because you did not work for this new car sale income but it was derived from asset growth the income is called capital gains you invested your capital $ 15k into the asset car and that asset appreciated when you sold it you received capital money back in exchange for that asset the capital you received is more than what you invested which is to say you gained $ 4k of capital by investing in and then selling your   asset car   because you held the car for two years you qualify for lower long term capital gains tax rate on that $ 4k had you sold it after year 1 you paid your regular normal income tax rate on those capital gains either way you owe the tax when you sell the asset not when it appreciates   i ’m sure you realize this already but if we change the car to amazon stock in my story this is exactly how it works with investors   the author gets several things wrong    1 amazon profits are not passed through to shareholders for income tax purposes if amazon paid dividends those dividends would be taxed at payout at the long term capital gains rate and they would be paid out of cash amazon has left after it already paid corporate taxes on profits    amazon has decided they can add more value to investors by using cash to grow instead of paying dividends when the investors sell the stock they will owe capital gains on the growth of that stock if amazon is correct that using cash to grow then investors will effectively pay more when they sell the stock than they would pay today if dividends were paid   2 asset appreciation is not income those investors will realize the income when they sell the stock and they will pay the tax then    3 he is missing the point entirely on why amazon runs a low profit or how business strategy translates into financials low prices are not a function of low profitability low profitability could be an adverse result of low pricing but being low profit in order to be low price is a ridiculous and failing strategy amazon ’s low pricing is a function of their unparalleled buying power unparalleled consumer and product data amazing logistics prowess clever loyalty programs like amazon prime and many other brilliant things they ’ve done their low profitability is a function of their investment in things like amazon fresh amazon alexa drone delivery automated convenience stores building out cloud computing infrastructure and many other r&amp;d projects $ 4 billion in original content spending for amazon prime video and all kinds of expenditures years ahead of when they become profitable by the time consumers want it amazon already built it three years ago this is the power of amazon sometimes multi billion dollar experiments fail and all that money was for nothing sometimes they lose money for a few years and then become the infrastructure that runs a third of the internet amazon does not let fear of failure stop them they invest in growth with their cash this is how bezos thinks how do we build the future not how can i avoid tax     i do need to make a disclaimer here there could be special tax treatment of classic cars that makes my example not work also classic cars may not appreciate in value i do n’t know anything about classic cars i just picked a politically neutral thing to put in my story and made some assumptions to illustrate how capital gains work my story is definitely how stocks work and probably cars but i just want to point out that i do n’t know shit about car collecting

the best option for maximizing your money long term is to contribute to the 401(k offered by your employer if you park your inheritance in a savings account you can draw on it to augment your income while you max out your contributions to the 401(k you will get whatever the employer matches right off the bat and your gains are tax deferred in essence you will be putting your inheritance into the 401(k and forcing your employer to match at whatever rate they do so if your employer matches at 50 cents on the dollar you will turn your 50 thousand into 75 thousand

talk freely about what you can now do because of saving if you plan to retire sooner than most or more comfortably than most and can tie that to something you want them to do show them that if you buy a very nice car or install a pool and they wish they could afford that tell them it took 5 or 10 or 20 years to save up for it at x a week and now you have it with no loan or be a cautionary tale wish you had something and regret not having saved for it young adults are generally well served by knowing more of parental finances than they did while they were dependents ask them if they will want or need to fund parental leaves make a down payment for a house own vacation property put a child through post secondary education share the cost of theirs including living expenses if you paid them or go on amazing vacations fairly regularly tell them what those things cost in round figures explain how such a huge sum of money can accumulate over 2 5 10 years of saving x a month for example $ 10 a week is $ 500 a year and so on while they may not want to save 20 years for their downpayment doing this simple math should let them map their savings amounts to concrete wishes and timeframes finally if this is your own child and they live with you charge them rent this will save them from developing the habit of spending everything they earn along with the expensive tastes and selfish speaking habits that come with it some parents set the rent aside and give it back as a wedding or graduation present or to help with a downpayment later but even if you do n't making them live within their true means not the inflated means you have when you 're living rent free is truly a gift

so if an out of the money option all time value has a price p say $ 3.00 and there are n days the extrinsic value is n't solely determined by time value as your quote suggests it 's also based on volatility and demand here is a quote from distinguishing between extrinsic time value and extrinsic non time value the time value of an option is entirely predictable time value premium declines at an accelerating rate with most time decay occurring in the last one to two months before expiration this occurs on a predictable curve intrinsic value is also predictable and easily followed it is worth one point for every point the option is in the money for example a call with a strike of 30 has three points of intrinsic value when the current value of the underlying stock is $ 33 per share and a 40 put has two points of intrinsic value when the underlying stock is worth $ 38 the third type of premium extrinsic value increases or decreases when the underlying stock changes and when the distance between current value of stock and strike of the option get closer together as a symptom of volatility extrinsic value may be greater for highly volatile underlying stock and lower for less volatile stocks extrinsic value is the only classification of option premium that is unpredictable the you point out probably had a volatility component affecting value this portion is a factor of expectations or uncertainty so an event expected to conclude prior to expiration but of unknown outcome can cause theta to be higher than p n for example a drug company is being sued and the outcome of a trial will determine whether that company pays out millions or not the extrinsic will be higher than p n prior to the outcome of the trial then drops after   of course the most common situation where this happens is earnings after the announcement it 's not unusual to see a dramatic drop in the extrinsic portion of options this is why sometimes a new option trader gets angry when buying calls prior to earnings when surprise good earnings are announced as hoped the rise is stock price is largely offset by a fall in extrinsic value giving call holders little or no gain as for the reverse situation where theta is lower than p n would expect well you can actually have negative theta meaning the extrinsic portion rises over time this statement is a little confusing because theta is usually described as negative but since you describe it as a positive number negative here means the opposite of what you 'd expect   this is a quote from option volatility pricing keep in mind that they use positive theta to mean the time value increases up over time is it ever possible for an option to have a positive theta such that if nothing changes the option will be worth more tomorrow than it is today when futures options are subject to stock type settlement as they currently are in the united states the carrying cost on a deeply in the money option either a call or a put can under some circumstances be greater than the volatility component if this happens and the option is european no early exercise permitted it will have a theoretical value less than parity less than intrinsic value as expiration approaches the value of the option will slowly rise to parity hence the option will have a positive theta sheldon option volatility pricing advanced trading strategies and techniques kindle locations kindle edition

is the stock 's price at any given moment the price at which all shares could be sold to new investors no   for the simple fact that the current bid offer always have sizes associated what you should be looking at is the consolidated price to buy sell x shares does n't really work as not everyone is willing to sell buy if you look at the spread of the consolidated price at your quantity level you 'd notice it would be in stark contrast to the spread of the best bid offer but by definition that would be the price to buy or sell x shares to new investors edit calculation of the consolidated price of x shares you go through the order book and calculate the size weighted average price until you covered x. example so the consolidated price for 3000 shares would be $ the consolidated price for 2000 shares would be $

i 'm assuming that when you say convert to s corp tax treatment you 're not talking about actually changing your llc to a corporation there are two distinct pieces of the puzzle here first there 's your organizational form your state which is where the business is legally formed and recognized creates the llc or corporation s corp does n't come into play here your company is either an llc or a corporation there are a handful of other organizational types your state might have e.g. limited partnership etc none of these are immediately relevant to this discussion second there 's the tax treatment you receive by the irs if your company was created by the state as an llc note that the irs does n't recognize llcs as a distinct organizational type you elect to be taxed as an individual for single member llcs a partnership for multiple member llcs or as a corporation the former two elections are pass through there 's no additional level of taxation on corporate profits everything just passes through to the owners the latter election introduces a tax on corporate profits when you elect pass through treatment a single member llc files on schedule c a multiple member llc will prepare a form k-1 which you will include on your 1040 if your company was created by the state as a corporation not an llc you could still elect pass through taxation if your company qualifies under the rules in subchapter s i.e. an s corp states do not recognize s corp as part of the organizational process that 's just a tax distinction used by the irs and possibly your state 's tax authorities in your case if you are a single member llc and assuming there are no other reasons to organize as a corporation talking about s corp tax treatment does n't make any sense you 'll just file your schedule c in my experience it 's fairly simple note that this is based on my experience of and multiple member llcs in just two states your state may have different rules that affect state level taxation and the rules may change from year to year i 've found that hiring a good cpa to prepare the forms saves a good bit of stress and time that can be better applied to the business

right now you are standing at a fork in the road   if i could tell my younger self who blasted past that fork without noticing it what to do i would say   research financial independence and early retirement and frugal living   if you do it right you can be financially independent in 5 15 years depending on your comfort level with frugal living many people celebrate graduation by financing a new car   it 's like a quadruple whammy   new car brings sticker shock   financing is paying to use someone else 's money   buying a car period is buying into the commuter lifestyle   and the cash flow could have gone to reducing debt or building savings   one blog i read advises that this step adds ten years to the time you have to work before you become financially independent

ok looking at the balance sheet they have $ 42 m in cash but that is down from $ 325 m in december meanwhile their debt has increased from $ in december to $ as of june so their net cash has dropped by $ m in only 6 months it looks like they spent $ m give or take buying other companies in those 6 months otherwise their working capital an important measure of the ability to run the business looks ok at $ looking at the income statement they are making money $ m in the last quarter on revenue of $ m which is quite remarkable however they had an unusual item which increased earnings somewhat otherwise their earnings would have been about $ 39 m which is still pretty healthy   all in the company itself looks healthy and on a bit of a buying binge growing through acquisition i do n’t like the debt load but that is probably usual for the industry   when companies grow through acquisition they generally plan to reduce total employment because of redundancies because you sort of get economies of scale this usually factors into the decision to buy the company you increase revenues through the purchase and reduce costs by eliminating employees this is typically how they sell an acquisition to investors   if i was to guess and it would only be a guess this company has a team which looks at the employees of the company it just bought and decides where to downsize it may not downsize from the newly acquired company but from its own existing employees for a variety of reasons so most likely that is what you were a victim of it was n’t because the company was struggling or because you were necessarily not a good employee it is a process albeit sometimes unfair and you were a victim of it   the layoff decisions are not always prudent and it can be hard to understand why a particular group was cut instead of another one management does n’t always make the right call the broadcast industry has been going through consolidation companies buying companies for some time now most likely management is hoping to bulk up to make it harder for another company to buy it and/or to get a better price when it is bought    so in summary most likely they are doing this for reasons of greed ie they ’ll make more money with fewer employees sorry about your situation

revenue canada allows for some amount of tax deferral via several methods the point is that none of them allow you to avoid tax but by deferring from years when you have high income to years when you have lower income allows you to realize less total tax paid due to the marginal rate for personal income tax the corporate dividend approach as explained in another answer is one way tfsas are another way but as you point out they have limits   since you brought tfsas into your question about the best and easiest tax deferral option available in canada is the rrsp if you do n't have a company pension you can contribute something like 18 of your income if you have a pension plan you may still be able to contribute to an rrsp as well but the maximum contribution amount will be lower the contribution lowers your taxable income which can save you tax interest earned on the equity in your rrsp is n't taxed tax is only paid on money drawn from the plan because it is deemed income in that year they are intended for retirement but you 're allowed to withdraw at any time so if you have little or no income in a year you can draw money from your rrsp tax is withheld which you may or may not get back depending on your taxable income for that year you can think of it as a way to level your income and lower your legitimate tax burden

as others have stated ceo 's often make more than 200 k and when they do they 're compensated with stock options and other lucrative bonuses and deals that allow them to build wealth above and beyond the face value of their salary however remember that having wealth makes it easier to build further wealth as victor pointed out having wealth allows you to increase your wealth in different kinds of investments also it gives you access to more human capital e.g. wealth management services at firms like northern trust a greater ability to diversify into investments like hedge funds more abilities to invest abroad through foreign trusts etc also you have to realize that wealthier people often pay a lower percentage in taxes than people who earn a salary in the us long term capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate than income so wealthy individuals who earn much of their money from long term investments wo n't pay nearly as high a rate in my case my current salary places me at the top of the 25 tax bracket in the us but if i earned all of my income through long term capital gains instead of salary i would only pay around 15 20 in taxes plus i could afford numerous tax accounting firms to help me find ways to pay fewer taxes it 's not altruism that causes ceos like steve jobs and mark zuckerberg to take a $ 1 salary   this is n't directly related to ceos and i 'm not leveling accusations of corruption against high net worth individuals but i remember spending a few months in a small town in a country known for its corruption the mayor had recently purchased a home worth the equivalent of several million dollars on his annual civil servant salary of approximately $ 20k. one of the students asked him how he managed to afford such a sizable property and he replied i live very frugally this is probably a relatively rare case i 'm sure it depends on the country but nevertheless it illustrates another way that some people build wealth

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

indefinitely is easy to answer assume that the average house currently costs four times the average salary and that house prices rise 1 faster than salaries indefinitely then in only 1,000 years time the average house will cost around times the average salary in 10,000 years it will be 6.5 times the average salary that does n't seem plausible to me if you want arguments about for the foreseeable future instead of indefinitely then that 's harder

break the transactions into parts go to your bank or credit union and get a loan commitment when applying for loan get the maximum amount they will let you borrow assuming that you will no longer own the first car take the car to a dealer and get a written estimate for selling the car pick one that gives you an estimate that is good for a week or ten days you now know a data point for the trade in value finally go to the dealer where you will buy the replacement car negotiate the price tell them you do n't need financing and you will not be trading in the car get all you can regarding rebates and other special incentives once you have a solid in writing commitment then ask about financing and trade in if they beat the numbers you have regarding interest rate and trade in value accept those parts of the deal but do n't let them change anything else if you keep the bank financing the dealer will usually give you a couple of days to get a check   if you decide to the car to the first dealer do so as soon as you pick up the replacement car if you try to start with the dealer you are buying the car from they will keep adjusting the rate length of loan trade in value and price until you have no idea if you are getting a good deal

please refer to this question to understand the basics of how an order is matched how do exchanges match limit orders   now most of the times even block orders follow the same matching criteria i think you are assuming that for every large buy order there is a matching large sell order this is not true      so on the buy side at various point in times there were buy orders with single order more than 10,000 shares on the sell side to fulfil these orders there may or may not be a single order of 10,000 more often there will be quite a few smaller orders or 500 1000 or whatever amount that are present in the queue based on the amount time sort order or even partially matching out of a sell order of 10,000 similarly when there is a large sell order of more than 10,000 these may not have got filled in by a large buy order but by smaller buy orders etc    so if you average out the amounts on the buy side and the sell side there would definately be a difference the analysis of this difference is as indicated in your question buy price is more than sell price and hence people are bullish

i 've been budgeting with ms money since 2004 and was pretty disappointed to hear it 's being discontinued budgeting is actually a stress hobby for me and i can be a bit of a control freak when it comes to finances so i decided to start early looking for a replacement rather than waiting until ms money can no longer download transactions here are the pros and cons of the ones i 've tried updated you need a budget pro ynab based on the old envelopes system ynab has you money from each paycheck to a specific budget category envelope it encourages you to live on last money 's income and if you have trouble with overspending that can be a great plan personally i 'm a big believer in the envelope concept so that 's the biggest pro i found also it 's a downloaded software so once i 've bought it for about $ 50 it 's mine without forced upgrades as far as i 've seen the big con for me was that it does not automatically download transactions i would have to sign on to each institution 's website and manually download to the program also coming from money i 'm used to having features that ynab does n't offer like the ability to store information about my accounts overall it 's forward thinking and a good budgeting system but will take some extra time to download transactions and is n't really a comprehensive management tool for all my financial needs you can try it out with their free trial mint this is a free online program the free part was a major pro it also looks pretty if that 's important to you updating is automatic once you 've got it all set up so that 's a pro mint 's budgeting tools are so so basically you choose a category and tell it your limit it at you by text or email when you cross the line but does n't seem to offer any other incentive to stay on budget   when i first looked at mint it did not connect with my credit union but it currently connects to all my banks and all but one of my student loan institutions   another recent improvement is that mint now allows you to manually add transactions including pending checks and cash transactions   the cons for me are that it does not give me a good end of the month report does n't allow me to enter details of my paychecks and does n't give me any cash flow forecasting overall mint is a good casual retrospective free online tool but does n't allow for much planning ahead mvelopes here 's another online option but this one is subscription based again we find the old envelopes system which i think is smart so that 's a pro for me it 's online so it downloads transactions automatically but also allows you to manually add transactions so another pro the big con on this one is the cost depending on how you far ahead you choose to pay quarterly yearly or you 're paying $ to $ 12 per month they do offer a free trial for 14 days plus another 14 days offered when you try to cancel another con is that they do n't provide meaningful reports overall a good concept but not worth the cost for me quicken i had n't tried quicken earlier because they do n't offer a free trial but after the last few fell short i landed with quicken 2009 pro for quicken as an ms money user is that it is remarkably similar in format and options the registers and reports are nearly identical one frustration i 'd had with money was that it was ridiculously slow at start up and after a year or so of entering data quicken is dragging con for quicken again as an ms money user is that it 's budgeting is not as detailed as i would like   also it does not download transactions smoothly now that my banks all ask security questions as part of sign in   i have to sign in to my bank 's website and manually download   quicken 2011 is out now but i have n't tried it yet   hopefully they 've solved the problem of security questions   quicken 2011 promises an improved cash flow forecast which sounds promising and was a feature of ms money that i have very much missed   have n't decided yet if it 's worth the $ 50 to upgrade to 2011

cash price is $ 22,500 financed it 's the same thing 0 interest but you pay a $ 1500 fee = 6.6 basically the apr for your loan is 1.1 per year but you are paying it all upfront opportunity cost if you take the $ 22,500 you plan to pay for the car and invested it could you earn more than the $ 1500 interest on the car loan according to google as of today you can get 1 year cd 1.25 so yes it 's likely that interest rates will be going up in medium term so you can potentially earn even more   insurance cost if you finance you 'll have to get comprehensive insurance which could be costly however if you are planning to get it anyway it 's a brand new car after all that 's a wash which brings me to my main point why do you have $ 90k in a savings account even if you are planning to buy a house you should have that money invested in liquid assets earning you interest   conclusion take the cheap money while it 's available you never know when interest rates will go up again

i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that well this is n't a meaningful distinction the mutual fund may or may not be in an ira similarly the mutual fund may or may not be in a 401(k however so i 'm going to treat your question as if it 's why would a person get a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that in an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into the same mutual fund in a 401(k same mutual fund same amount of money narrowing your question to the difference between the two types of accounts as stated in your question 's title others have answered that to the extent that you really have no choice other than pick which type of account to use for a given bundle of money other than nobody having mentioned the employer match even if there were no other difference at all in tax treatment it 's pretty typical that 401(k contributions will be matched by free money from the employer no ira can compete with that but that 's not the only choice either many of us contribute to both the 401(k and the ira why because we can i 'm not suggesting that just anybody can but if you max out the employer matching in the 401(k or if you max out the tax advantaged contribution limit in the 401(k and you still have more money that you want to save in a tax advantaged retirement account this year you can do so the ira is available it 's not instead of the 401(k

in any technical field practitioners have difficulty explaining general abstract concepts to outsiders they 're accustomed to using a particular set of concepts and ideas that make communication fast and easy between their colleagues but make communication difficult with outsiders who do n't know that language it 's usually easy to come up with a mediocre analogy that communicates the gist of the idea but finding analogies that capture the complete essence of the concept is extremely hard and maybe impossible   have you studied mathematics try explaining the concept of a continuous function in all its without talking about and deltas or open sets and you can talk about drawing a line and not picking up your pencil but that 's not quite what a continuous function is likewise if you 've studied law try explaining what a security interest is in its full without talking about liens or pledges you can come up with specific examples sure but it 'll be tough to find one that captures the whole concept i 'm sure you can come up with examples from whatever field it is you specialise in   added to this is the problem that the skill set needed to be a good across disciplines is n't really valued in most corporations including banks    edit i accidentally a word

the literal answer to your question what determines the price of an etf is the market it is whatever price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept but if the market price of an etf share significantly from its nav the per share market value of the securities in its portfolio then an authorized participant can make an arbitrage profit by a transaction creation or redemption that pushes the market price toward nav thus as long as the markets are operating and the aps do n't vanish in a puff of smoke we can expect price will track nav that reduces your question to why does nav = market value of the holdings underlying a bond etf share decrease when the market interest rate rises   let 's consider an example i 'll use us treasuries because they have very active markets are treated as risk free although that can be debated and excluding special cases like tips and strips are almost perfectly fungible and i use round numbers for convenience let 's assume the current market interest rate is 2 and 10-year treasury fund opens for business with $ 100 m invested via aps in 10-year t notes with 2 coupon at par and 1 m shares issued that are worth $ 100 each now assume the interest rate goes up to 3 this is an example not a prediction no one wants to pay par for a 2 bond when they can get 3 elsewhere so its value goes down to about 0.9 of par not exactly due to the way the arithmetic works but close enough and shares similarly slide to $ 90 at this price an investor gets slightly over 2 basis plus approximately 1 amortized capital gain slightly less due to time value per year so it 's competitive with a 3 coupon at par   as you say new bonds are available that pay 3 but our fund does n't hold them we hold old bonds with a face value of $ 100 m but a market value of only $ 90 m if we sell those bonds now and buy 3 bonds to try to replace them we only get $ 90 m par value of 3 bonds so now our fund is paying a competitive 3 but nav is still only $ 90   at the other extreme say we hold the 2 bonds to maturity paying out only 2 interest but letting our nav increase as the remaining term duration and thus discount of the bonds decreases assuming the market interest rate does n't change again which for 10 years is probably unrealistic ignoring 2009 2016 at the end of 10 years the 2 bonds are redeemed at par and our nav is back to $ 100 but from the investor 's point of view they 've forgone $ 10 in interest they could have received from an alternative investment over those 10 years which is effectively an additional investment so the original share price of $ 90 was correct

i think three things are happening right now   1 the stock market is one of the only sensible places to get a return on your money bond rates are very low and real estate is a little trickier    2 there are fewer publicly traded companies now than there have been in the past it 's easier to invest in public companies than private companies so more money is going into fewer companies inflating the prices   3 wealth inequality is higher now than it has been in decades if you give poor people more money they just spend it to lead more comfortable lives they wo n't invest in the stock market if you give a rich person more money they just invest more of it since they are already spending as much as they reasonably can in this economy for the past few decades we 've been giving the rich more and more money   so with these 3 factors more money is pouring into the fewer companies of the stock market inflating their prices    at least this is the idea put forward by a fidelity analyst i heard a talk from recently and it makes sense to me

auto correlation is a statistical concept for measuring repeating patterns in series   in stocks it is of particular interest as if future prices can be reliably guessed from past prices a lot of money could be made    note even in cases where auto correlations are high and persistent near 1 there is still some possibility that the next time period would be down even if the previous period was up   now the important part here is that high and persistent auto correlation also means once the price falls the next period the price is also more likely to fall once one period was down the next period is more likely to be down so the price does not need to go to infinity   instead it generally would display up and down trends now the key word above for investing is persistence for stocks auto correlations are at best persistent at reasonable time scales   so even if a stock was highly auto correlated during a previous period it is tough to make consistent money off of trading on these past trending patterns   this does not mean some people do n't try

let me paint you a picture to show you why this does not make sense     it is never fair to ask a business to pay a living wage it is always fair to ask a worker to chose their jobs based on their needs   here 's why   i ran a business when i was a teenager doing web development i did not make very good money but it pushed me to learn and to teach myself to meet the needs of the few clients that i did manage to find   over the course of the business the thought had crossed my mind to maybe get help from my peers maybe talk to classmates and see if any of them might have wanted to go into business with me help me drum up more work or help me do design or development     as soon as the thought crossed my mind i realized right away that i would never be able to do it because the regulation was just way too big for little old sole proprietorship me to deal with   not only was it confusing but it was dangerous to me if i did it wrong i knew i   could be sued and lose more than my tiny little business made     on top of the regs involved i personally was not making minimum wage   what i was making though was experience   this was more valuable than all the money i made combined because i worked this way by myself for three years learning more about my craft all the while   i have that experience into a ten year long career that currently supports my family working for someone else   now imagine if i could pay anyone whatever we both agreed on   imagine if i could talk to a in highschool and say hey i m not making much but i can pay you x to start with and i will certainly teach you what i know   it always struck me as selfish unearned moral superiority to sit here and mandate a minimum wage you price teenagers and entry level workers out of the market because people ca n't afford an army of $ 20 per hour workers   its so ignorant of the narrow margins that these business have to face   it is also really short sighted and money obsessed to boil a job down to it 's wages alone   minimum wage destroys an ancient method of generating skilled workers the apprentice system   also there is a really ugly moral side to this   person a offers person b x amount to do y why does the government have the right to say no you ca n't pay them x because it is not x enough   our economy and work is far more complex than minimum wage it is an old idea that is nothing but a drain on our economy   tl;dr i would have added three or more skilled workers to our economy in high school if i did not have to pay them minimum wage   i personally was priced out of hiring people because of it so i hate it     millennials need not wonder why no one can find a job

i would phrase it this way if someone needs costly procedures especially for conditions they caused themselves then yes those procedures will not be covered and they are not covered in all national healthcare systems in the world   it 's immoral to cover a transplant for a drunk or extended for an obese person while an old lady can not get an aid to stay independent in her home because it 's not covered in the medical insurance   and i have no issue if the aca will be repealed before a replacement is put in place this will be the fastest way to get a replacement   it seems to me that you are not familiar with how national health care systems work and so i will give you personal example of my aunt covered by the excellent national healthcare in israel and i mean it it 's one of the best national health care systems in the world   her locked suddenly and she had to have a hip replacement no problems said the doctors you will get hip replacement totally covered by the insurance but you have to wait 3 months for that so my aunt said but i got supplemental private medical insurance every one smart in israel who can afford it get that why did n't you tell us asked the doctors you will have the hip replacement done next week with better parts and so it happened   my aunt thought that at least the recovery and rehab in the hospital will be covered by her standard insurance so in the morning after the surgery the nurse comes and says please make a choice either i come once in the morning to take you out of bed to the toilet and some rehab or once in the evening   my aunt chose none of the options and paid out of her pocket partially covered by her private insurance to stay in a private hospital   do you get it   but in israel an obese women will get her 3rd artificial to have her 3rd baby + an aid to help her raise her kids because she 's too fat to care of the her children we have that nonsense in israel

gt;i'm playing devil 's advocate mostly   i should hope so because it seems disingenuous to suggest that viewing tons of photos is equivalent to seeing and touching something in real life particularly shoes or clothes   also say for example you go to your local shoe store and try on a pair of shoes your usual size is 9.5 so you try that on first but it feels big and a 9 fits you better if you 'd gone to amazon without going to the store first even though they offer free exchanges you 'd still have to deal with the costs of printing out a return label boxing them up going to the post office waiting two days for them to arrive at amazon and waiting two days for the new pair but going to the store first saved you that cost and the store does n't get any reward for it   i 'm not condemning you or anyone else for doing this but i would feel guilty about it and i 'm trying to explain why

there are two ways to handle this the first is that the better brokers such as charles schwab will produce summaries of your gains and losses using historical cost information as well as your trades on a monthly and annual basis these summaries are ready made for the irs more brokers will provide these summaries come 2011 the second is that if you are a frequent trader see irs rulings for what constitutes one then they 'll allow you to use the net worth method of accounting that is you take the account balance at the end of the year subtract the beginning balance adjust the value up for withdrawals and down for and the summary is your gain or loss a third way is to do all your trading in say an ira which is taxed on distribution not on stock sales

short answer absolutely not unless you 're comfortable with putting years of your labor into a depreciating asset that will incur hefty maintenance costs over its remaining life i.e. consider your 10 k gone forever once you buy the car and then some some comments on your reasons keeping up with spoiled brats is a losing proposition and is a mindset counterproductive to financial independence i 'd encourage you to find a way to not care about how the spoiled brats live their lives it wo n't be easier when you 're older and you see your peers driving fancy cars and living fantasy lifestyles that you are tempted to emulate break the impulse to keep up and you 'll be in a much better place a used bmw may not be a piece of junk at first but once you hit 100 k miles everything will suddenly fall apart and need repair been there myself still have the car after 7 years only because very few people want to buy a high mileage german sport sedan with recurring maintenance issues see 2 it will be a good drive for a while then it will own you this is not so bad when you have a decent amount of savings but when you have nothing it 's very hard to truly enjoy the car while knowing that any problems not covered by warranty will be financially devastating are you prepared to ride the bus for 4 weeks while saving enough income from work to replace a bad clutch i had to do this and it 's not something i brag about

to expand on @joetaxpayer 's answer the devil is actually in the fine print all   the credit card checks that i have ever received in the mail explicitly says that the checks can not be used to pay off   or pay down the balance on any other credit card issued by the same bank whether the card is branded with the bank logo or is branded with a department store or airline logo etc the checks can be used to pay utilities or even taxes without paying the service fee that is charged for using a credit card for such payments the payee is paid the face amount of the check in contrast to charges on a credit card from a merchant who gets to collect only about of the amount on the   charge slip generally speaking balance transfer offers are a bad deal regardless    of whether you pay only the minimum amount due each month or whether    you pay each month 's statement balance in full by the due date or    anything in between the rest of this answer is an explanation in support of the above assertion feel free to tl;dr it if you like if you make only the minimum payment due each month and some parts of the balance that you are carrying has different interest rates applicable than other parts then your payment can be applied to any part of the balance at the bank 's discretion it need hardly be said that the bank invariably chooses to apply it to pay off the lowest rate portion by law card act of 2009 anything above the minimum payment due must be applied to pay off the highest rate part and then the next highest rate part etc but minimum payment or less is at the bank 's discretion as an illustration suppose that you are not using your credit cards any more and are paying down the balances due by making the minimum payment due each month suppose also that you have a balance of $ 1000 carrying 12 apr on card a and pay off the entire balance of $ 500 on card b transferring the amount at 0 apr to card a for which you are billed a 2 fee your next minimum payment   will be likely be $ 35 computed as $ 10 interest on $ 1000 + $ 10 transfer fee + $ 15 1 of balance of $ 1500 if you make only the minimum payment due that payment will go towards paying off the $ 500 and so for next month your balance will be $ 1500 of which $ will be charged 1 interest and $ will be charged 0 interest   in the months   that follow the balance on which you owe 1 interest per month will grow and the 0 balance will shrink   you have to pay more than the minimum amount due to reduce the amount that you owe in this example in the absence of the balance transfer the minimum payment would have been $ 20 = $ 10 interest on $ 1000 at 1 per month + $ 10 1 of balance and would have left you with $ 990 due for next month   to be at the same point with the balance transfer offer you would need to pay $ 30 more than the minimum payment of $ 35 due this extra $ 30 will pay off the interest and transfer fee $ 20 and the rest will be applied to the $ 1000 balance to reduce it to $ 990 there would be no balance transfer fee in future months and so the extra that you need to pay will be a little bit smaller etc if you avoid paying interest charges on credit cards by never taking any cash advances and by paying off the monthly balance   consisting only of purchases made within the past month in full by the due date then the only way to avoid paying interest on the purchases made during the month of the balance transfer offer is to pay off that month 's statement in full including the balance just transferred over and the balance transfer fee by the due date   so depending on when in the billing cycle the transfer occurs you are getting a loan of the balance transfer amount for 25 to 55 days and being charged 2 or 3 for the privilege if you are getting offers of 2 balance transfer fees instead of 3 you are probably among those who pay their balances in full each month and the bank is trying to tempt you into doing a balance transfer by offering a lower fee it is unlikely that they will make a no transfer fee offer they would prefer laughing all the way to themselves by collecting a 2 transfer fee from you and possibly interest too if you fail to read the fine print than having you decline such offers at 3 as being too expensive can you make a balance transfer offer work in your favor sure   do n't make any purchases on the card in the month of the balance transfer or during the entire time that the 0 apr is being offered in the month of the transfer pay the minimum balance due plus the balance transfer fee in succeeding months pay the minimum balance due typically 1 of the balance owed each month all of it will go to reducing the 0 apr balance because that is the only amount owing just before the 0 apr expires anywhere from 6 to 24 months pay off the remaining balance in full   but remember that you are losing the use of this card for this whole period of time put it away in a locked trunk in the attic because using the card to make a purchase will mean paying interest on charges from the day they post something that might be totally alien to you

has good advice here i would like to add my notes if they give a 50 match that means you are getting a 50 return on immediately i do not know of a way to get a better guaranteed roi next when investing you need to determine what kind of investor you are i would suggest you make yourself more literate in investments as i suggest to anyone but there are basic things you want to look for if your primary worry is loss of your go for conservative investments this means that you are willing to accept a reduced expected roi in exchange for lower of loss of principal this does not mean you have a 100 safe investment as the last market issues have shown but in general you are better protected the fidelity investments should give you some information as to volatility or if they deem the investments conservative conservative investments are normally made up of trading bonds which have the lowest roi in general but are the most secure you can also invest in blue chip companies although stock is inherently riskier it is pointed out in comments that stocks always outperform bonds in the long term and this has been true over the last 100 years i am just suggesting ways you can protect yourself against market downturns when the market is doing very well bonds will not give you the return your friends are seeing i am just trying to give you a basic idea of what to look for when you pick your investments nothing can replace a solid investment adviser and taking the time to educate yourself

i 'm surprised nobody else has suggested this yet before you start investing in stocks or bonds buy a house not just any house but the house you want to live in 20 years from now in a place where you want to live 20 years from now but you also have to be savvy about which part of the country or world you buy in i 'm also assuming that you are in the usa although my suggestion tends to apply equally anywhere in the world why simple as long as you own a house you wo n't ever have to pay rent you do have to pay taxes and maintenance of course you have a guaranteed return on investment and the best part is because it 's not money you earn but money you do n't have to spend it 's tax free even if the house loses value over time you still come out ahead and if you live abroad temporarily you can rent out the house and add the rent to your savings although that does make various things more complicated you only asked for options so that is mine i 'll add some caveats ok now here are the caveats

upstream is into businesses that supply the original business downstream is into businesses that make use of the original product   so in that description what they are saying is that the original business received products from plantations and sent products to manufacturing this is also called vertical integration   meaning that they are diversifying along their supply chain so that they control more of it   this is in contrast with horizontal integration where they move into new products that either compete with the existing products or which are entirely separate    in general the upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers and intermediate consumers and has more control over its supply chain   the downside is that they have less opportunity to partner with other companies in the same supply chain as they compete with them   some companies are better at managing to do both   for example amazon.com has integrated fulfillment and sales   but partners can still do their own fulfillment and/or sales choosing how much to send out to amazon    if you are investing in individual stocks integrated companies can be problematic in that they cut across diversification areas   so they can be harder to balance with other stocks   you can either buy plantations transport and manufacturing together or not buy at all   if your investment strategy says to increase plantations and reduce manufacturing this can be difficult to implement with an integrated company   of course everyone else has the same problem which can lead to integrated companies being undervalued   so they may be an opportunity as a value stock

not sure why this has n't received any answers yet the link to the investopedia page you posted explains it pretty well however when you hear about a golden cross in the media it is most likely a reference to the sma crossing above the sma   in general a golden cross consists of a short term ma that was previously below a long term ma crossing above that lt ma however the most common reference will imply a day cross because this is considered as a stronger signal compared to shorter mas with that said it 's important to realize that the golden cross is just one of many technical analysis signals and the entire field of technical analysis is considered controversial to say the least   many studies such as those examined in a random walk down wall street have found that after transactions costs are considered e.g. the commissions you pay to your broker on every trade charting is a losing proposition in the end

the rate of spending growth is relevant the reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period    this would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat but if it 's growing particularly if it 's growing sharply just maintaining the same absolute revenue level wo n't be enough to pay the government 's bills   basically whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the laffer curve and on the level of spending growth hence my previous comment

i am strongly skeptical of this   in fact after reading your question i did the following i wrote a little program in python that a stock by flipping a coin each time the coin comes up heads the stock 's value grows by 1 each time the coin comes up tails the stock 's value drops by 1   i then group say 50 of these steps into a day and for each day i look at opening closing maximum and minimum this is then in a candlestick chart   funny enough those things look exactly like the charts analysts look at here are a few examples     if you want to be a troll show these to a technical analyst and ask them which of these stocks you should sell short and which of them you should buy you can try this at home i posted the code here and it only needs python with a few extra packages and should both be in the package in reply to a comment from joetaxpayer let me add some more theory to this my code actually performs a one dimensional random walk now joe in the comments says that an infinite number of flips should approach the zero line but that is not exactly correct in fact there is a high chance to end up far from the zero line because the expected distance from the start for a random walk with n steps is   what does indeed approach the zero line is if you took a bunch of these random walks and then performed the average over those there is however one important aspect in which this random walk differs from the stock market the random walk can go down as far as it likes whereas a stock has a bottom below which it can not fall reaching this bottom means the company is bankrupt and gets removed from the market this means that the total stock market which we might interpret as a sum of random walks does indeed have a bias towards upwards movement since i 'm only averaging over those random walks that do n't go below a certain threshold but you can really only benefit from this effect by being broadly diversified

my father this advice to me when i was a teenager and it has n't failed me yet > pay yourself first what this means is that the first bill you pay should always be your savings preferably in a way that automatically comes out of your paycheck or account without requiring you to take an active step to make it happen   i save a ton of money but i am no more disciplined than anyone else i just realized that over the years of progressing in my career that i gradually got higher and higher salaries yet never had a substantial increase in the money i had leftover in my bank at the end of the month despite the fact that i make about the money i used to live reasonably comfortably on therein is the point we spend whatever money we see so you almost have to hide it from yourself first participate to the fullest in your company 's 401k if they offer it after a while you will adjust naturally to the net take home pay and wo n't miss the savings you are accumulating absent that or in addition to that set up a separate bank or investment account and arrange an automatic transfer from your checking account every month then set up automatic investing in cd 's or some other less liquid than cash investment so you it is just enough hassle to get at the money that you wo n't do it on a whim it sounds too simple but it works

no there is no special given to first time tax payers in general this should n't be an issue the irs collects your taxes out of every one of your paychecks throughout the entire year in what is called a withholding tax the amount that the irs withholds is calculated on your w-4 form that you file with your employer whenever you take a new job the form helps you calculate the right number of allowances to claim usually this is the number of personal exemptions but depending upon if you work a second job are married and your spouse works or if you itemize the number of allowances can be increased withholding tax withholding tax also known as payroll withholding is essentially income tax that is withheld from your wages and sent directly to the irs by your employer in other words it ’s like a credit against the income taxes that you must pay for the year by subtracting this money from each paycheck that you receive the irs is basically withholding your anticipated tax payment as you earn it in general most people overestimate their tax liability this is bad for them because they have essentially given the irs an interest free loan and were n't able to use the money to earn interest themselves i have n't heard of any program targeted at first time tax payers to tell them to file a return but considering that most tax payers overpay they should or they are giving the government a free grant

lenders pay attention to where your down payment money comes from if they see a large transfer of money into your bank account within about a year before your purchase this will cause an issue for you down payments are not just there to make the principal smaller they are primarily used as an underwriting data point to assess your quality as a borrower if you take the money as loan it will count against your credit worthiness if you take the money as a gift it will raise some other red flags all of this is done for a reason if you ca n't get a down payment you are a higher credit risk poor discipline lack of consistent income even if you can currently pay the monthly cost of a mortgage   ps the cost of home ownership is much higher than the monthly mortgage payment will all this mean you won't get a loan of course not you can almost always get some loan but it will likely be at a higher rate than you otherwise would qualify for if you just waited a little bit and saved money for a down payment   another option cheaper house edit the below comments provide examples where gifts were are not a problem my experience from buying a house just a few years ago and my several friends who bought house in the same period some with family gifts and some without is that it is an issue your best bet is to talk in person with an actual mortgage broker in your area who can go through the options with you and the downsides to various approaches

yes you can certainly keep it in a savings account until you spend it you 'll get much less interest than you will be paying on the loan but it will be better than nothing however you may want to ask if you can use the loan flexibly instead i.e. only draw down the money you need when you need it and not start paying interest until that happens that would save you a lot more money note that the isa limit is currently £ and the limit is on total deposits so you wo n't be able to reuse the amount later in the tax year since that ends on april 5th that probably wo n't be an issue for you

the definitive answer is it depends what are your goals first and foremost you need to have at least 3 months expenses in cash or equivalent i.e. an investment that you can withdraw from quickly and without penalty   the good news is that you do n't have to come up with it instantly   set a time frame one year for creating this safety net and pay towards that goal   this is the single most important piece of financial advice you will receive now determine what you need to do   for example you may need a car   compare interest rates on your student loan and the car loan   put your cash towards whichever is higher if you do n't need a car or other big ticket item then you may consider sticking your surplus into the student loans   50k at $ a month will be paid down in about 3 years which might be a bit long to live the lifestyle i 'd look at paying down the smallest loan first assuming relatively similar rates and freeing up that payment for yourself   so if you can pay off a month and free up $ 100 of that in six months then you can reward yourself with half that surplus and apply the other half to the next loan    this is different than some would suggest because you 're talking about entering severe spartan mode which is not sustainable    remember that life happens   you 'll meet someone   you 'll have an accident your brother will get sick and you 'll give him some money to help out   you 've got to be prepared for these events and for these reasons i do n't recommend living that close to the edge   remember you 're not in default and you do have the option of continuing to pay the minimum for a long time

so i 'm in australia and we have our very own housing price credit bubble right now which is finally deflating and i 'll try explain it as i understand i welcome anyone to chime in and correct me   the problem we faced still face to a large degree is the idea of rising asset prices and how this fuels a feedback loop into increasing personal debt all based on the false assumption that house prices always go up now before i continue house prices do always go up in the long run but so does the cost of everything and we call that inflation adjusting for this effect usually reveals that house prices are cyclical in the long term and never really grow so that aside we in australia recently saw a long period of increasing house prices as did the usa and europe and more recently china the thing about house price is it is your equity i 'll try and explain all figures are made up to provide a simple example if you borrow $ 200,000 to buy a house that costs $ 250,000 you owe the bank 80 of the equity what your home is worth and notionally this is value that you own in your home and the bank will be happy remembering that they make money on your interest payments not your principal repayments if your house then increases in value to $ 300,000 but you still owe $ 200,000 then you now owe only 66 of your equity the bank sees you as a lower risk and encourages you to borrow more to get back up to that sweet spot they had before of 80 this is a nice tradeoff between risk and reward for the bank you the consumer have just been mailed a new credit card with a 50k limit hypothetical and there s a new being released next week and you really did want to trade in your old car see where this is going yet not only is this type of spending given a mighty boost but consumers feel like this house thing has done them very well and suddenly they have the ability to borrow lots more money why not get a second house and do it all over again the added demand for investment housing drives prices throw in some generous government incentives here and in the usa and demand is pushed hard prices grow more and the whole thing feeds back into itself people feel richer spend more from their credit cards buy another house etc   but what happens if your house value then drops to $ the bank now sees you as a high risk so do the bank 's investors you have negative equity the bank demands the difference paid back to it or it might take your home somehow nobody believed this would happen   hopefully you start to see the picture in australia we are now facing a slow melt in housing prices which has not yet hurt en masse but it has dried up the credit cards spending has collapsed and everyone is worried about the future   now to realise where the usa got to you have to also understand that banks were not merely asking for a maximum of 80 owed on the asset many of them let this figure go to 100 since hey prices always go up right they then in some cases went further and neglected to look into your income and confirm you could even repay your loan sounds this is just the setup   remember i mentioned the bank 's investors well banks smart people basically figured out a clever way of dealing with the risk of a few outliers with bad financial situations by collecting large numbers of home loans into a single entity and selling it on loans were graded according to risk and i believe they were even cut up into smaller pieces 10 of your high risk loan assigned to 10 different debt objects with different risk profiles these debt obligations were traded from one bank investment firm to another with everyone happily accepting the risk profiles until eventually nobody knew what risk was where think about it like i 'll throw 10 high risk loans 50 medium risk loans and 40 low risk loans into a pot stir it up and sell the soup as pretty safe this all seemed like a very good idea until it gradually became clear just how much of these loans were in the extremely stupid high risk category this is probably extremely confusing by now but that s the point investors could no longer judge how risky an investment in a bank or financial institute was the market did not correct for any of this until it was all too late   the moral of the story is when people tell you an investment is guaranteed to make you money you stay away from that investment and to specifically answer your question you ca n't solely blame government incentives as you might be able to see but they play a part in a giant there are many factors that drive this sort of stupidity stupidity being the primary one

you may have misunderstood some parts of the system if you make a pension contribution in any given year the tax relief is based on your income for that year the gross pension contribution is subtracted from your gross income and you only end up paying tax based on the reduced gross income so if the higher rate threshold is £ 40 k you have income for the year of £ 65 k and you make a gross contribution of £ 25 k then you 'll get tax relief at 40 on the whole contribution i.e. £ 10k. if your income for the year is less e.g. £ 50 k then you 'll get tax relief at 40 on £ 10 k and at 20 on the other £ 15 k i.e. £ so if you 're significantly into the higher rate band it 's usually not worth making a contribution large enough to reduce you to basic rate tax better to wait till the next tax year for the rest overall while you probably could do what you suggest subject to the caveats below why not just spread the pension contribution over the three years rather than making it all up front if you are confident you can invest the money at better than the 3.4 interest on the loan then it might make sense to borrow but you should be pretty clear that you 're deliberately borrowing to invest otherwise known as investing with leverage or you might know that your income is going to drop next year another clarification as your comment on another answer mentions basic rate tax relief is claimed directly by your pension provider relief at source whereas the higher rate part of the relief comes straight to you via your tax return so for the above £ 25 k gross contribution example you 'd hand over £ 20 k initially and then get £ 5 k back at the end of the tax year leaving you with £ 15 k less in your pocket if you did want to make a £ 20 k net contribution and had enough higher rate salary to cover it the gross contribution you 'd end up with would be £ and you 'd need to find £ more temporarily note that there are also limits on the annual contribution you can make of £ 40 k the annual allowance but you can carry forward allowances from three previous years so it 's very unlikely to be relevant

i have n't seen this answer and i do not know the legality of it as it could raise red flags as to money laundering but about the only way to get around the exchange rate spreads and fees is to enter into transactions with a private acquaintance who has euros and needs dollars the problem here is that you are taking on the settlement risk in the sense that you have to trust that they will deposit the euros into your french account when you deposit dollars into their us account if you work this out with a relative or very close friend then the risk should be minimal however a more casual acquaintance may be more apt to walk away from the transaction and disappear with your euros and your dollars really the only other option would be to be compensated for services rendered in euros but that would have tax implications and the fees of an international tax attorney would probably outstrip any savings from forex spreads and fees not paid

your idea is a good one but as usual the devil is in the details and implementation might not be as easy as you think   the comments on the question have pointed out your steps 2 and 4 are   not necessarily the best way of doing things and that perhaps   keeping the principal   amount invested in the same fund instead of taking it all out and re investing it in a similar but different fund might be better the other points for you to consider are as follows how do you identify which of the thousands of conventional mutual   funds and etfs is the average risk high gain mutual fund into which you will place your initial investment   broadly speaking most actively managed mutual fund with average risk are likely to give you   less than average gains over long periods of time   the   unfortunate truth to which many pay only service is that   x% of actively managed mutual funds   in a specific category failed   to beat the average gain of all funds in that category or the   corresponding index e.g. s&p 500 index for large stock mutual funds over the past n years where x is generally between 70 and   100 and n is 5 10 15 etc   indeed one of the arguments in   favor of investing in a very low cost index fund is that you are effectively guaranteed the average gain or loss do n't forget the possibility of loss this of course is also the argument used against investing in index funds   why invest in boring index funds and settle for average gains at essentially no risk of not getting the average performance average performance is close to guaranteed when you can   get much more out of your investments by investing in a fund that is among the funds that had better than average returns   the difficulty is that which funds are x rated and which non x rated i.e. rated g = good or pg = pretty good is known only in hindsight whereas what you need is foresight as everyone will tell you past performance does not guarantee future results   as someone john bogle said   when you invest in a mutual fund you are in the position of a in you can see where you have been but not where you are going   in summary implementation of your strategy needs a good crystal ball to look into the future there is no such things as a guaranteed bond fund they also have risks though not necessarily the same as in a stock mutual fund you need to have a plan b in mind in case your chosen mutual fund takes a longer time than expected to return the 10 gain that you want to use to trigger profit taking and investment of the gain into a low risk bond fund and also maybe a plan c in case the of the market cause your chosen mutual fund to have negative return for some time what is the exit strategy

i used to be a trader at a desk that sold delta one derivatives on listed indices think swaps etfs there is a lot to do    sell stocks according to redemptions or new orders manage the currency exposure indices rebalance their composition everyday based on stock corporate actions dividends and index reviews you need to be aware of each and everyone and rebalance your portfolio to account for it manage your inventory to get the best repo rates possible trade single stock swaps with foreign counterparties to get access to better tax rates on dividends when you have a big order where certain stock orders may not get filled you have to create a strategy for managing that risk sometimes you hedge your positions using futures that expire every three months in which case you need to figure out the best times to roll your expiring futures i could go on and on   basically since the profit margins are so low the market so competitive for such vanilla products and the volumes so high you have to really make your processes super efficient and error proof trust me there is a lot to be done

afaik there are two kinds of taxes your web freelancing income may be subject to in quebec on the income taxes   the net income you realize from your web freelancing activities would be considered taxable income   assuming you are not operating as an incorporated business you would need to declare the freelancing income on both your federal and provincial tax returns   you should be able to deduct certain costs related to your business for instance if you paid for software hosting domain name registration etc   that is only the profit from your business would be subject to income tax   with income and expenses arising from self employment you may want to use a professional to file your taxes on the sales taxes you may also need to charge federal gst and provincial quebec sales tax on your services   you must enroll and charge gst and once you exceed the small supplier revenue threshold of $ 30,000 measured over four consecutive quarters   you can still choose to enroll for gst before you reach that amount but over that amount enrollment becomes mandatory   some businesses enroll before the threshold is reached so they can claim input tax credits for tax paid on expenses but then there 's more paperwork one reason to perhaps avoid enrolling until necessary in quebec the du du administers both gst on behalf of the federal government as well as provincial   be sure to also check out their informative booklet should i register with quebec pdf   see also general information concerning the and the gst hst pdf

you must mean the current debt ceiling debacle the meaning of it is us government is constantly borrowing money by issuing treasury bonds and constantly repaying some of the bonds that come to maturity and also has other obligations it has to meet by law all the time such as social security checks bonds interest federal employees salaries and pensions etc by law total amount of money that can be borrowed at the same time is capped that means there can be situation where the government needs to borrow money to pay say interest on existing bonds but can not since the limit is reached such situation is called a default since the government promised to pay the interest but is unable to do so that does not mean the government has no money at all and will completely collapse or could n't raise money on the market if it were permitted by law to do so currently the market is completely willing to buy the debt issued by us government and with interest that is not very high though of course that may change it also does not mean the economy ceases to function dollars cease to have value or banks instantly go bankrupt but if the government breaks its promises to investors it has various consequences such as raising the costs of borrowing in the future breaking promises to other people like social security recipients would also look bad and probably hurt many of them going back to your bank account most probably nothing would happen to the money you store there even if the bank had invested 100 of the money in us treasury bonds which does n't really happen they still can be sold on the open market even if with some discount in the event of credit rating downgrade so most probably your account would not be affected as stated in another answer even if the fallout of all these causes a bank to fail there 's fdic and if your money is under insured maximums you 'll be getting your money back but if your bank is one of the big ones nothing of the sort would happen anyway as we have seen in the past years government would do practically anything to not allow any big bank failures

see and the articles linked from it the issue with holding a levered etf past 1 day is that investors expose themselves to path dependency in the underlying the reason for the difference in payouts comes from the fact that the manager of the levered etf promises you a multiple of the daily returns of the underlying to be able to promise you these daily returns the etf manager has to buy sell some of the underlying every day to position himself to have a constant leverage ratio the next day the short video below explains this process in detail for a 2x long etf but the same result holds for a 2x short etf the manager has to buy more of the underlying on a day when the underlying increases in value and sell more of the underlying when the underlying goes down in value

why would you want to withdraw only the company match and presumably leave your personal contributions sitting in your ex company 's 401k plan generally 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an ira so unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to and you think those investments are where you want your money to be roll over part or all of your 401k assets into an ira and withdraw the rest for personal expenses   if your personal contributions are in a roth 401k roll them over to a roth ira but as i remember it company contributions are not part of the roth 401k and must be rolled over into a traditional ira perhaps this is why you want to take those in cash to pay for your personal purchase also what is this 30 hit you are talking about you will owe income tax on the money withdrawn from the 401k and custodians traditionally withhold 20 and send it to the irs on your behalf plus penalty for early withdrawal which the custodian may also withhold if you ask them but the tax that you will pay on the money withdrawn will depend on your tax bracket which may be lower if you are laid off and do not immediately take on a new job that is the 30 hit may be on the cash flow but you may get some of it back as a refund when you file your income tax return

why not ask a fee only financial adviser contact a local adviser and ask how much they will charge to work through the process   the options are n't as complex as they seem the general idea is to first figure out what you can afford each month this is a generally straight forward calculation   then figure out the costs that are specific to your area e.g property taxes   figure out how much of a down payment costs you can gather   then start with your local bank or credit union the number of options for mortgages will not be as complex if you already know how much you can afford and how much cash you can bring to the transaction a simple table can be easily created based on what you can afford each month how much cash you have and the rates currently available the bank will have a way to estimate the costs of each option as part of the required disclosures another source of good info can be a highly regarded local real estate agent focus on one that will represent you as a purchaser they want you to be able to buy a house while they do have a bias they want a commission most of it is eliminated if you know how much you can afford before you meet with them they will know all the government programs that can make the monthly costs or closing costs cheaper

i debated whether to put this in an answer or a comment because i 'm not sure that this can be answered without a lot more information which actually would then probably make it a candidate for closing as too localized at the very least we would need to know where which jurisdiction she is located in so speaking in a generic way the options available as i see them are contact the mortgage companies and explain she ca n't continue to make payments they will likely foreclose on the properties and if she still ends up owing money after that if you are in the us this also depends on whether you are in a non recourse state then she could be declared bankrupt this is rather the nuclear option and definitely not something to be undertaken lightly but would at least wipe the slate clean and give her some degree of certainty about her situation look very carefully at the portfolio of properties and get some proper valuations done on them depending on where she is located this may be free also do a careful analysis of the property sales and rental markets to see whether property prices rental rates are going up or down then decide on an individual basis whether each property is better kept or sold you may be able to get discounts on fees if you sell multiple properties in one transaction this option would require some cold hard analysis and decision making without letting yourselves get emotionally invested in the situation difficult i know depending on how long she has had the properties for and how she came to own them it might be an option to pursue action against whoever advised her to acquire them clearly a large portfolio of decaying rental properties is not a suitable investment for a relatively elderly lady and if she only came by them relatively recently on advice from an investment consultant or similar you might have some there   another option could she live in one of the properties herself to reduce costs if she owns her own home as well then she could sell that live in the one of the rentals and use the money saved to finance the sale of the other rentals aside from these thoughts one final piece of advice do n't get your own finances tangled up in hers so do n't take out a mortgage against your own property for example obviously if you have the leeway to help her out of your budget then that is great but i would restrict that to doing things like paying for grocery shopping or whatever if she is heading for bankruptcy or other financial difficulties it wo n't help if you are too

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

withdraw in cash bank reports it to irs no matter what would this    affect my tax filing in the coming year no and no the bank does n't report to the irs in the us the bank will probably report to fincen it has nothing to do with your tax return withdraw in check bank does not seem to report it is this correct does n't have to still might if they think it is a suspicious irregular activity wire transfer to another person 's account would this always be    slapped with a gift tax if this is a gift it would regardless of how you transfer the money is it answers to your follow up questions in the us what documents do we need to prepare in case our large sum    withdraw from the bank triggers a flag in relevant government local    and/or federal divisions and they decide to investigate depending on what the investigators request fincen would investigate money laundering the irs would investigate tax evasion the fbi would investigate terrorism sponsorship etc depending on who 's investigating and what the suspicions are different documents may be required but the bottom line is that you should be able to explain the source of the funds and the destination for example i found $ 1 m in cash and sent it to some drug lord because he 's such a good friend of mine will probably not fly does the local federal government care if we stash our money in    cash or check under our mattress if we purchase foreign properties    taxable documents needed for proof or if we give it away to    individuals or organizations individual a gift tax organization    tax the government cares about taxes and illegal activities stashing money under a mattress is not illegal but earning cash and not paying income tax on it usually is in many cases money stashed under the mattress was obtained illegally and/or income taxes were not paid it seems that no matter what we do except spreading thin our assets    to multiple accounts in multiple banks the government will always be    notified of any large bank transaction and we would be forever flagged    since is this correct yes reportable transactions will be reported also spreading around in multiple accounts transactions to avoid reporting is called structuring and is on its own a crime this is for cash cash equivalent transactions only of course not sure about the forever flagged since that part is probably sourced in your imagination

10 seems to be a little bit too optimistic but annually on average is doable 1 is way too little you 're doing something wrong unless you mean real return i.e. after adjustment for inflation and even then it 's not too high at any given year it may be easy or difficult but the point is that we 're talking about long term averages for example if you look at the dji for the last 30 years you 'll see a rise of 1300 give or take which annually is ~40 in the last 3 years the rise is even steeper but in the last week it is negative so it depends on your time line and the way you manage your investments you 've got to balance between stocks and bonds and cash but even if you park your money in cash you can get more than 1 right now capitol one on line savings is 1.15 and that 's with the lowest rates ever so getting 1 over time does mean that you 're doing something wrong imho

it could be a a way to preserve the value of your money but depends upon various factors if a country defaults and it leads to hyper inflation by definition that means that money loses its purchasing power   in even simpler terms it can not buy as much tomorrow as i could today therefore people can be to either hoard physical goods or other non perishable items real estate may well be such an item   if you are resident in the country you have to live somewhere   it is possible that a landlord might try to raise rent beyond what your job is willing to pay   of course in a house you might have a similar situation with utilities like electricity assuming some kind of re stabilization of the economy and currency even with several more zeros on the end it is conceivable that the house would subsequently sell for an appropriately inflation adjusted amount as other in demand physical goods may lots of variables good luck

if by can we trust the analyst recommendations you mean are they right 100 of the time the answer is absolutely no   analysts are human and make mistakes some more than others   there are many stories of superstar managers that make for several straight years then have a few bad years and lose it all back however do n't take you ca n't trust them to mean that they are nefarious in some way while there may be some that recommend stocks for selfish purposes i suspect that the vast majority are just going off what information they have and ca n't predict market behavior or future performance with perfect accuracy   look at many analysts recommendations   do your own analysis if you 're still not comfortable buying individual stocks then do n't buy them   buy index funds if you are satisfied with market returns or other mutual funds if you want to invest in specific sectors   or at the very least make sure you are sufficiently diversified so that you do n't lose your entire investment by one bad decision   one rule of thumb is to not have more than 10 of your entire portfolio in any one company

well yes it does but just because the debt is trading at 80 cents on the dollar does n't mean that the company can actually legally get away with paying only 80 cents on the dollar they would have to come to an agreement with the debt holders first and perhaps they could but the more conservative approach is to use the book value of the debt   or what about debt that 's trading at a premium to its face value because say interest rates have come down relative to the time the debt was issued the amount that the owes to the debt holders has n't suddenly gone up

you question is a bit scary to me you show $ 2100 rent and let 's even assume that 's 100 i.e. never a vacancy rule of thumb is 10 vacancy depending on area a tenant may stay a year but when they leave you might need to have a bit of maintenance and miss 2 months rent you count the mortgage and taxes and are left with $ 500/mo where is the list of ongoing expenses i suggest you put that $ 500/mo into a separate account and let us know a year from now if anything is left to anthony 's point i agree 100 no one can tell you everything you need to know but whatever my answer or his other members with experience similar or different will add to this and in the end you 'll have a great overview the truth is that it 's easy for me to sit here and see what you may be missing by the way if you look at the rules of thumb they will make your head spin there are those who say the target is for the rent to be 2 of the value of the house but there are markets where this will never happen there 's another rule that says the expenses besides tax should be planned at 50 of the rent i.e. you should put aside $ 1000/mo for expenses over the long term the new house will be lower of course but in years past year 10 or so this number will start to look reasonable

there are many variables to this answer one is how close are you to the average salary range in the industry you are working in if you are making more than average it would make sense that you are not getting a big raise from the employer 's perspective you have to be a top performer if you are looking for the top salary range big raises come from promotions or new jobs generally speaking   the short and personal answer is i worked at a big company bank and now know that companies do not give large raises to people as a rule   honestly the only way to make good $ is to leave all employers have all kinds of excuses as to why they are not giving you significant raises large raises and bonuses are reserved for management the bigger the company the less likely it is that they will give you raises just because esp above 3 5 at the same time the market sets the rate and if you are not getting passively recruited it may mean that you need to work on getting a broader skill set if you are looking to make more $ somewhere else the bottom line is you have to think of yourself as a free agent at all times you also need to make yourself more attractive as a potential hire elsewhere

yeah    they actually have said that their new strategy is not to make money from breakage people who pay but do n't use it i believe they also guaranteed the $ 10 deal for a year but i 'm not at all certain so do n't quote me on that    instead they want to make money from the data and eventually convince movie theaters to cut them in on sales and/or give them discounts on tickets both of which depend on people actually using moviepass    i think those are really silly plans the movie data is highly unlikely to cover the costs of the tickets that moviepass has to buy    movie theaters like studios are stubborn bastards who have a history of sticking to their guns and refusing to budge even an inch when it comes to certain terms they also have recently demonstrated a preference for building out their own direct to consumer offerings rather than with third party offerings    i do n't see them getting a ton more traffic from mp customers and more concession sales and then deciding to give up any of their highly prized concession sales considering that most heavy theater likely have a primary theater that they go to it would probably make more sense for theaters to simply market their own offering to them in theater and wait for mp to run out of money    finally amc is the biggest chain and actively wants this $ 10/month subscription to fail amc has announced that it absolutely will not give mp any deals on ticket prices something that mp is counting on to make this sustainable maybe mp is counting on amc to eventually change its mind but i do n't think that 's a smart bet    otoh what the hell do i know i 've been wrong plenty of times before

it 's whatever you decide taking money out of an s corp via distribution is n't a taxable event practically speaking yes you should make sure you have enough money to afford the distribution after paying your expenses lest you have to put money back a few days later in to pay the phone bill you might not want to distribute every penny of profit the moment you book it either keeping some money in the business checking account is probably a good idea if you have consistent cash flow you could distribute monthly or quarterly profits 30 or 60 days in arrears for example and then still have cash on hand for operations your net profit is reflected on the schedule k for inclusion on your personal tax return as an s corp the profit is passed through to the shareholders and is taxable whether or not you actually distributed the money you owe taxes on the profit reported on the schedule k not the amounts distributed you really should get a tax accountant long term you 'll save money by having your books set up correctly from the start rather than have to go back and fix any mistakes go to a chamber of commerce meeting or ask a colleague trusted vendor or customer for a recommendation

there 's the fear that one might forget the debit is coming and still bounce the payment   personally i agree with dheer 's list i do n't want to give someone unlimited access to my account i make good use of electronic payments where i initiate the payment   for the credit card i use regularly i have a $ 250 monthly payment set to go automatically if i forget to make a payment or lose the bill at least the minimum is covered the monthly charges are enough that when i actually pay the bill in full upon receipt it just goes in toward current charges   bills like gas electric phone are different every month so an auto debit is actually more trouble than how i handle

i think you should really start a limited company for this it 'll be a lot simpler to spread the income over multiple years if your business and you have completely separate identities you should also consult an accountant if only once to understand the basics of how to approach this having a limited company would also mean that if it has financial problems you do n't end up having to pay the debts yourself with a separate company you would keep any money raised within the company initially and only pay it to yourself as salary over the three years so from an income tax point of view you 'd only be taxed on it as you received it the company would also pay for project expenses directly and there would n't be any income tax to pay on them at all you would have to pay other taxes like vat but you could choose to register for vat and then you 'd be able to reclaim vat on the company 's expenses but would have to charge vat to your customers if you start making enough money currently £ you have to register for vat whether you want to or not the only slight complication might be that you could be subject to corporation tax on the surplus money in the first year because it might seem like a profit however given that you would presumably have promised something to the over a three year period it should be possible to record your promises as a liability for unearned income in the company accounts in effect you 'd be saying although there 's still £ 60,000 in the bank i have promised to spend it on the thing so it 's not profit again you should consult an accountant at least over the basics of this

always use limit orders never market orders period do that and you will always pay what you said you would when the transaction goes through whichever broker you use is not going to negotiate for the best price on your trade if you choose a market order   their job is to fill that order so they will always buy it for more than market and sell it for less to ensure the order goes through it is not even a factor when choosing between tradeking and scottrade i use trade king and my friend uses   besides the transaction fee tk is a few $ $ cheaper the only other things to consider are the tools and research and customer service if you need it that each site offers i went with tk and the lower transaction fee since tools and research can be had from other sources i basically only use it when i want to make a trade since i do n't find the tools particularly useful and i never take an analyst 's opinion of a stock at face value anyway since everybody always has their own agenda

here 's what i 'd do   show these figures to your bank and ask if they can offer you some type of account with a small overdraft say up to $ 2000   typically this wo n't pay the same kind of interest as your savings account but it does n't matter if such an account is available then yes dump most of your savings into the student loan and keep a few hundred in your new account   the overdraft on this account is your emergency fund   this means that in the more likely scenario no emergencies you 're saving yourself 6 interest on something like $ 4000 to $ 4500   in the case of an emergency you 're still covered but you 'll be paying a larger amount of interest   let 's say you have an emergency cost and need to dip into the overdraft for $ 1000   if the interest is 15 then you 've cost yourself an extra 9 on that $ 1000 over leaving that debt in the student loan   this seems to me like a really good gamble more likely to gain 6 of $ 4000 less likely to lose 9 of $ 1000 if your bank wo n't give you a low interest account with a small overdraft then use your credit card as your emergency fund   the same kind of logic applies but since credit card interest rates are typically higher than overdraft interest rates you 'll want to keep slightly more in your savings account   about $ 1200 to $ 1500 feels right to me and move the remaining $ 3500 to $ 3800 to your student loan    so yes pay off the student loan   that 6 interest really is worth having even if you 'd be taking a small gamble edit alexander has suggested that i should compare this to matched retirement plans   the 100 gain in a matched retirement plan is n't 100 per annum it 's 100 divided across the length of time you have to wait until you can get your hands on that money   suppose the money is accessible when you turn 60 a matched plan is a good deal if you 're in your 50 's but not so good if you 're in your 20 's   the 100 matching is equivalent to 6 interest per annum compounded over slightly under 12 years    so if you 're less than 12 years away from retiring go for the matched plan   otherwise pay off your student loan first

wire transfers normally run through either the fedwire system or the clearing house interbank payments system chips the process generally works like this you approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money you give the bank a certain code either an international bank account number or one of several other standards which informs the bank where to send the money   the bank sends a message through a system like fedwire to the receiving bank along with settlement instructions   this is where the process can get a bit tricky for the wire transfer to work the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver if the sending bank sends the money to a third party bank the transaction is settled between them and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third party bank this last transaction may be a wire transfer ach transfer etc   the federal reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the federal reserve this allows them to use the fed as the third party bank referred to above interestingly enough this is one of the significant ways in which the fed makes a profit because it along with every other bank and routing agent in the process collects a miniscule fee on this process   you 'll often find sources that state that fedwire is only for transferring large transactions while this is technically correct it 's important to understand that financial institutions do n't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately although the orders are put in immediately the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day and even then they normally only settle the difference so if chase owes bank of america $ 1 m and bank of america owes chase $ 750 k they do n't send these as two transactions chase simply credits bac $ 250k.   you did n't specifically ask about ach transfers which as littleadv pointed out are different from wire transfers but since ach transfers can often form a part of the whole process i 'll explain that process too ach is a payment processing system that works through the federal reserve system among others the federal reserve through the and systems is by far the largest payment processor   the physical cash itself is n't transferred in simple terms the money is transferred through the ach system between the accounts each bank maintains at the federal reserve   here is a simple example of how the process works i 'm summarizing the example from wikipedia let 's say that bob has an account with chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer stack exchange directly deposited into this account assume that stack exchange uses bank of america as their bank   bob the receiver fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer called the originator once the originator has the authorization they create an entry with an originating depository financial institution which acts as a middleman between a payment processor like the federal reserve and the originator the odfi ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations in this example bank of america is the odfi   bank of america the odfi converts the transaction request into an ach entry and submits it through an ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi which in this case is chase bank chase credits deposits the paycheck in bob 's account   the federal reserve fits into all of this in several ways through systems like and the fed acts as an ach operator and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the federal reserve so it 's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks

do you have a separate bank account for your business   that is generally highly recommended i have a credit card for my single member llc   i prefer it this way because it makes the separation of personal and business expenses very clear using a personal credit card but using it for only business expenses seems to be a reasonable practice   you may be able to do one better though for your sole proprietorship you can file a dba which establishes the business name   the details of this depend on your state   with a dba i believe you can open a bank account in the name of your business and you may also be able to open a credit card account in the name of the business   i 'm not sure what practical difference it makes but it does make the personal business distinction clearer   though at that point you might as well just do the llc

first congratulations on choosing to invest in low cost passively managed plans if you choose any one of these options and stick with it you will already be well ahead of most individual investors almost all plans will allow you to re balance between asset classes with some companies sales agents will encourage you to sell your assets and buy assets as this generates brokerage commissions for them but when you only need to make minor adjustments you can simply change the allocation of the new money going into your account until you are back to your target weights most plans will let you do this for free and in general you will only need to do this every few years at most i do n't see much reason for you to be in the target funds the main feature of these plans is that they gradually shift you to a more conservative asset allocation over time and are designed to prevent people who are close to retirement from being too aggressive and risking a major loss just before retirement it 's very likely that at your age most plans will have very similar recommendations for your allocation with equities at 80 or more and this is unlikely to change for the next few decades the main benefits of betterment seems to be simplicity and ease of use but there is one concern i would have for you with betterment precisely because it is so easy to tweak your allocation i 'm concerned that you might hurt your long term results by reacting to short term market conditions i know i said i wanted a hands off account but what if the stock market crashes and i want to allocate more to bonds one of the biggest reasons that stock returns are better than bond returns on average is that you are being paid to accept additional risk and living with significant ups and downs is part of what it means to be in the stock market if you are tempted to take money out of an asset class when it has been losing feels dangerous and put more in when it is winning feels safe my concerns is that you will end up buying high and selling low i 'd recommend taking a look at this article on the emotional cycle of investing my point is simply that it 's very likely that if you are moving money in and out of stocks based on volatility you 're much less likely to get the full market return over the long term and might be better off putting more weight in asset classes with lower volatility either way i 'd recommend taking one or more risk tolerance assessments online and making sure you 're committed to sticking with a long term plan that does n't involve more risk than you can really live with i tend to lean toward vanguard life strategy simply because vanguard as a company has been around longer but betterment does seem very accessible to a new investor best of luck with your decision

if you buy a call that 's because you expect that the stock will go up if it does not go up then forget about buying more calls as your initial idea seems to be wrong and i do n't think that buying a put to make up for the loss will work either the only thing that is sure is that you will pay another premium on a stock that could stay where it is even if you are 100 sure that the stock will go up again do n't do anything as john maynard keynes stated markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent my idea is wait until the expiration date the good things about options is that you wo n't lose more than the premium that you paid for it and that until it reaches its maturity you can still make money if the market turns around more generally when you are purely speculating adding to a position when it goes against you is called averaging down i sincerely discourage you to do that if the stocks goes in the wrong direction that means that your    initial idea was wrong in the first place or you were not right at    the right moment in my opinion adding up to a wrong idea is not the    right thing to do when you are losing just take your loss and do n't    add up to your position based on your emotions on the other hand adding to your position more when the stock goes in    your direction is called and is in my opinion a better    way of doing things you bought you were right let 's buy more but    at some point you will have to take your profits there are plenty of other stocks on which you can try to invest and the market will still be here tomorrow there will be other opportunities to make profits rushing things by constantly trying to have a position is not a good idea not doing anything is also a strategy

if you want to invest in the stock market whether over a shorter period of 1 to 2 years or over a longer period of 10 or 20 years or longer you need to take some precautions and have a written investment plan with a risk management strategy incorporated in your plan others have said that 1 to 2 years is too short to invest in the stock market as the stock market can have a correction and fall by 50 but it does n't matter if you invest for 1 year or if you invest for 50 years the stock market can still fall by 50 just before you plan to withdraw your funds what you need to figure out is a way to get out before the market falls by 40 to 50 a simple way to do this is to use technical indicators to warn you when a market trend is starting to change and that it is time to get out of the market two simple indicators you can use on a market index are the rate of change roc indicator and the 100 week moving average ma below is a 10 year weekly chart of the s&p500 with these two indicators charted they show good times to get into the market and good times to get out   if you are using the 100 week ma you would buy in when the price crosses above the ma line and sell when the price crosses below the ma line if you are using the roc indicator you would buy in when the roc indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when the roc indicator crosses below the zero line so your investment plan could be to buy an index etf representing the s&p500 when the roc moves above zero and sell when it crosses below zero you can also place a trailing stop loss of 10 to protect you in case of a sudden fall over a couple of days you can manage your investments in as little as 10 minutes per week by checking the chart once per week and adjusting your stop loss order   if you want to progressively add to your investment each month you could check the charts and only add any new funds if both the roc is above zero and sloping upwards another option for adding new funds could be if the price is above the ma and moving further away from the ma all these rules should be incorporated into your investment plan so that you are not basing your decisions based on emotions there are many other technical analysis indicators you could also learn about to make better educated decisions about your stock market investments however what i have provided here is enough for anyone to test over different indexes and time frames and do their own paper trading on to gain some confidence before placing any real money on the table

the biggest issue with yahoo finance is the recent change to the api in may. the data is good quality includes both dividend split adjusted and raw prices but it 's much more difficult to pull the data with packages like r than before   google is fine as well but there are some missing data points and you ca n't the prices or is it that they 're all unadjusted and you ca n't get adjusted i ca n't recall i use google at home when i ca n't pull from bloomberg directly and when i 'm not too concerned with accuracy   quandl seems quite good but i have n't tried them there 's also a newer website called i have n't tried them yet either but their data seems to be pretty good quality from what i 've heard

gt we are making progress on the strategic priorities we outlined earlier this year and remain focused on returning our company to profitability sears holdings ceo eddie lampert said in a statement   it 's been how many years i 'm impressed that it could last this long but if it has n't happened by now it 's not going to happen ever maybe it would if they got new leadership in fact    gt we are primarily focused on profitability instead of revenues market share and other metrics which relate to but do n’t necessarily drive profit    in 2014    gt to this end we have set out to improve the profitability of our business model our objective is disciplined growth we do not want to grow simply for the sake of becoming bigger rather our aim is to become more profitable and as such we need to ensure that any revenue growth occurs at an appropriate level of profitability   2007 archives edgar he 's been saying the same line for at least 10 years   i may be a but i would absolutely love being proved wrong by mr. lampert

no   this amount of money is not appropriate for friends to go in on although you could consider buying a house with a business partner have the contracts drawn up see an attorney read up on the penalties if one of the partners does n't hold up their end from the law 's point of view also since this is a business arrangement write and sign all sorts of details regarding the penalties amongst the partners not just the law when one person does n't hold up it is n't that you do n't have good intentions or that you could n't do it just fine if no problems ever happen   the issue is that over the course of a mortgage which is at least several years something is very likely to come up   if you and your friend are n't prepared to think about all those issues and how to handle them you will lose a friend probably a house and your good credit i would n't go into business with my best friend because i want him to stay my best friend

but they do n't fill the same roles society you ca n't run into an amazon that is 5 minutes away and grab a few things you need right away but you can with walmart amazon filled the hole of easy online shopping with a focus on consumers i understand that they can and could very well take out walmart at some point but that also assumes walmart will not adapt at all to the changes they certainly see coming assuming it happens soon implies amazon nailing 1 2 hour delivery really soon they will also need to have those virtual stores hammered down as well i think though perhaps not my point is that it 's not nearly as cut and dry as you make it out to be and it 's not imminent by any means

if walmart violated the law then bring the full force of it down on them   on the other hand the usual reason the local businesses went bust is because they were less convenient and more expensive   the people who shopped in that area decided to stop shopping at the local stores and shop at walmart instead   unless you believe everyone is irrational they would have changed their behaviour for good reasons

internet happens to be the best option when it comes to finding plus size as most of the local stores only stock regular sized ones there are several online stores dealing in specialized and of branded companies which are of non regular sizes also the demand for plus size is on the rise leading to business expansions by many companies

yes   have been a product manager   key difference is ceo has responsibility for capital allocation   product manager does n't do that   product manager has a boss who is an of the same company reviewing their expenses   has to ask permission for a day off   all sort of other things   not the same     it 's a stupid metaphor designed to inflate the ego of the target   and the targets love it

are you sure about that i 'm not saying this case falls into this category but i also think there is a definitive right and wrong the reaction is definitely subject to perception but that does n't necessarily mean there is no universal right and wrong

lol i work at a major prop shop and it is far from retail trading existing relations are important and if used well will result in an increased pnl   also this is why i was referring to risk adjusted pnl to take into account different firms strategies   honestly your company might have a different way of doing things but at every prop shop and bank i ve worked for my pnl was their primary focus   edit i also would nt take such a condescending tone if i were you you are far from the only person on reddit working in the industry

you can withdraw from cpp as early as 60 however by doing so you will permanently reduce the payments the reduction is calculated based on average life if you live for an average amount of time that means you 'll receive approximately the same total amount after inflation adjustments whether you start pulling from cpp at 60 65 or even delay your pension later people may have pensions through systems other than cpp this is often true for big business or government work they may work differently people who retire at 55 with a pension are not getting their pension through cpp a person retiring at 55 would need to wait at least five years to draw from the cpp and ten years before he or she was eligible for a full pension through cpp canada also offers old age security oas this is only available once you are 65 years old or older though this is changing starting in 2023 this will gradually change to 67 years or older see this page for more details as always it 's worth pointing out that the cpp and oas will almost certainly not cover your full retirement expenses and you will need supplementary funds
