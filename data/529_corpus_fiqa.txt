the primary advantage is protection of your personal assets if your llc gets sued they ca n't take your house car dog wife there are n't really any financial incentives to be an llc because of the pass thru taxing structure you wind up paying the same in taxes either way the cost will depend on where you 're located and usually involves a few factors expect to pay $ 300 500 to start it depending on your state and who you register with technically you can usually register for free at the secretary of state but would n't you rather pay an expert and state franchise tax which will can be a minimum of up to $ depending on the state plus even more if your llc earns more than $ edit as an aside i 'll mention that i 'm based in california and our state franchise tax starts at $ i 'm all web based so i 've been investigating incorporating in nevada or delaware instead no franchise tax lower filing fees but from what i 've found it 's hardly worth the trouble in addition to having to pay a registered agent someone to act as my permanent mailing address in that state for apparently california likes to search for people just like me and charge them $ 800 anyway you can fight that of course and claim that your business really is done in nevada but do you really want to

you might want to just keep it in cash for one step further you could do an even split of usd eur and silver usd hedges against loss of value in the euro precious metal hedges against a global financial problem silver over gold because of high gold silver ratio is high you could lose money this way there are some bad things that can happen that will make your portfolio fall but there are also many bad things that can happen that would result in no change or gain with careful trades in stocks and even more aggressive assets you could conceivably see large returns but since you 're novice you wo n't be able to make these trades and you 'll just lose your investment ordinarily can buy an s&p etf and enjoy decent return 7 8 annual on average at reasonable risk but that only works if you stay invested for many years in the short term s&p can crash pretty badly and stay low for a year or more if you can just wait it out great it has always recovered eventually but if some emergency forces you to take the money out you 'd have to do so at a big loss lately the index has shown signs of being overvalued if you buy it now you could luck out and be 10 15 up in a year but you could also end up 30 down not a very favorable risk reward rate which is why i would hold on to my cash until it does crash or failing that starts looking more robust again and then think about investing

i have heard that investing more money into an investment which has gone down is generally a bad throwing good money after bad so to speak this is over simplified statement to explain the concept what is essentially says is say i hold stocks of xyz 100 units worth say usd 1000 this has lost me x% say 50 the general tendency is to buy 100 more units in anticipation hope that the price will go up this is incorrect   however on case to case basis this maybe the right decisions on a periodic basis or whenever you want to invest more money say you have usd 1000 and did not have the stock of xyz will you buy this at current price and outlook of the company if the answer is yes hold the stock or buy more if the answer is no sell the stock at current market price and take the loss the same applies when the price has appreciated if you have usd 1000 given the current price and future outlook will you buy the specific stock if yes hold the stock or buy more if answer is no sell the stock and book profit off course i have not the various other considerations when buying stocks like diversification risk profiles of individual stocks segments tax implications etc that are also essential even if you decide to buy or sell specific stock

stocks prices are determined whenever a buyer and seller agree to trade at a given price the company you use aapl as an example does n't set its own stock price rather the investors set the price every time it trades there 's no official price just the last trade likewise you can offer to trade a stock at whatever price you want that 's the definition of a limit order you might not find a willing buyer or seller at that price but you can certainly open an order stock quotes that you get from your broker or a finance web site reflect the price as last traded these quotes are updated throughout the trading day and the frequency and delay varies amongst quote providers like knuckle suggests in the comments there are ways to get real time quotes it 's often more helpful to think in terms of bid ask instead of official price see this question for details

i 'm going to give a simpler answer than some of the others although somewhat more limited the complicated loan parameters you describe benefit the lender   i 'll focus on this part of your question you should be able to pay back whenever what 's the point of an arbitrary timeline here you refers to the borrower   sure yes it would be great for the borrower to be able to do whatever they want whenever they want increasing or decreasing the loan balance by paying or not paying arbitrary amounts at their whim   but it does n't benefit the lender to let the borrower do this   adding various kinds of restrictions and extra conditions to the loan reduces the lender 's uncertainty about when they 'll be receiving money and also gives them a greater range of legal recourse to get it sooner since they can pursue the borrower right away if they violate any of the conditions rather than having the wait until they die without having paid their debt then you say and if you want you can set a legal deadline but the mere deadline in the contract does n't affect how much interest is paid the interest is only affected by how much money is borrowed and how long has passed i think in many cases that is in fact how it works or at least it is more how it works than you seem to think   for instance you can take out a 30-year loan but pay it off in less than 30 years and the amount you pay will be less if you pay it off sooner   however in some cases the lender will charge you a penalty for doing so   the reason is the same as above if you pay off the loan sooner you are paying less interest which is worse for the lender   again it would be nice for the borrower if they could just pay it off sooner with no penalty but the lender has no reason to let them do so i think there are in fact other explanations for these more complicated loan terms that do benefit the borrower   for instance an amortization schedule with clearly defined monthly payments and proportions going to interest and principal also reduces the borrower 's uncertainty and makes them less likely to do risky things like skip lots of payments intending to make it up later   it gives them a clear number to budget from   but even aside from all that i think the clearest answer to your question is what i said above in general it benefits the lender to attach conditions and parameters to loans in order to have many opportunities to penalize the borrower for making it hard for the lender to predict their cash flow

this article is correct but it 's focused on just one issue with ibm which is the tip of an iceberg ibm has taken its office work policy too far especially in light of all of its recent office closures    the company has driven out its most senior skilled labor while limiting its recruiting to a very narrow set of remaining offices located exclusively in the most competitive hiring environments and no ibm does not have cash on hand to both pay new recruits premium salaries and continue supporting their massive product portfolio in fact all hiring is presently frozen for lack of stable finances   do n't be surprised as it continues to tank after it fails to meet contract obligations due to a lack of skilled resources

many partnership agreements include a shotgun clause one person sets a price the other can either buy at that price or sell at it it 's rather brutal you can make offers that you know are less than the company is worth if you 're sure the other person will have to take that money from you say if you know they ca n't run the company without you   he has asked for $ x to be bought out and failing that he would like to keep owning his half and send his wife who may very well be competent but who among other things has a very ill husband to deal with to take his place if he can occasionally contribute to the overall vision and she can do the day to day then keeping things as they are may be the smart move but if that 's not possible it does n't mean you have to buy him out for twice what you think it 's worth   in the absence of a partnership agreement it 's going to be hard to know what to do but one approach might be to pretend there is a shotgun clause ask him if he thinks half the company is worth $ x if he 's willing to buy you out for that price and have his wife run it without you he is likely to out that it is n't worth that and she ca n't do that   and at that point you 'll actually be negotiating

great question   a yield curve is a plot of the yields for different maturities of debt this can be for any debt but the most common used when discussing yield curves is the debt of the federal government the yield curve is observed by its slope   a curve with a positive slope up and to the right or a curve i.e. one that 's becoming more positively sloped or less negatively sloped may indicate several different situations the kansas city federal reserve has a nice paper that summarizes various economic theories about the yield curve and even though it 's a bit dated the theories are still valid i 'll summarize the major points here a positively sloped yield curve can indicate expectations of inflation in the future the longer a security has before it matures the more opportunities it has to be affected by changes in inflation so if investors expect inflation to occur in the future they may demand higher yields on longer term securities to compensate them for the additional inflationary risk a yield curve may indicate that investors are increasing their expectations of future inflation a positively sloped yield curve may also reflect expectations of in the dollar the publication linked before states that depreciation of the dollar may have increased the perceived risk of future exchange rate changes and discouraged purchases of long term treasury securities by japanese and other foreign investors forcing the yields on these securities higher supply shocks e.g. decreases in oil prices that lead to decreased production may cause the yield curve to because they affect short term inflation expectations significantly more than long term inflation for example a decrease in oil prices may decrease short term inflation expectations so short term nominal interest rates decline investors usually assume that long term inflation is governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term factors like commodity price swings so this price shock may lead short term yields to decrease but leave long term relatively unaffected thus the yield curve even if inflation expectations remain unchanged the yield curve can still change the supply of and demand for money affects the required real rate i.e. the price of credit loans etc the supply comes from private savings money coming from abroad and growth in the money supply while demand comes from private investors and the government the paper summarizes the effects on real rates by saying lower private saving declines in the real money supply and reduced capital inflows decrease the supply of funds and raise the required real rate a larger government deficit and stronger private investment raise the required real rate by increasing the demand for funds the upward pressure on future real interest rates contributes to the yield curve 's positive slope and a yield curve could indicate an increasing government deficit declines in private savings or reduced capital coming in from abroad for example because of a recession in europe that reduces their demand for us imports an easing of monetary policy when is economy is already producing near its capacity would initially expand the real money supply lowering required short term real interest rates with long term real interest rates unchanged the yield curve would lower interest rates in turn would stimulate domestic spending putting upward pressure on prices this upward price pressure would probably increase expected inflation and as the first bullet point describes this can cause long term nominal interest rates to rise the combination of the decline in short term rates and the rise in long term rates the yield curve   similarly an inverted yield curve or a positively sloped yield curve that is becoming less steep may indicate the reverse of some or all of the above situations for example a rise in oil prices may increase expectations of short term inflation so investors demand higher interest rates on short term debt because long term inflation expectations are governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term swings in commodity prices long term expectations may not rise nearly as much as short term expectations which leads to a yield curve that is becoming less steep or even negatively sloped forecasting based on the curve slope is not an exact science just one of many indicators used   note yield curve was not yet defined here and was key to my answer for what is the bernanke twist and operation twist what exactly does it do so i took the liberty of ask answer

to answer your question directly   you can investigate by using google or other means to look up research done in this area   there 's been a bunch of it here 's an example of search terms that returns a wealth of information i 'd especially look for stuff that appears to be academic papers etc and then raid the references section of those   look for stuff published in industry journals such as journal of portfolio management as an example if you want to try out different models yourself and see what works and what does n't this monte carlo simulator might be something you would find useful the basic theory for those that do n't know is that various parts of a larger market do not usually move in perfect but go through cycles one year tech might be hot the next year it 's healthcare   or for an international portfolio one year korea might be doing fantastic only to slow down and have another country perform better the next year     so the idea of re balancing is that since these things tend to be cyclic you can get a higher return if you sell part of a slice that is doing well e.g. sell at the high and invest it in one that is not buy at the low because you do this based on some criteria it helps circumvent the human tendency to hold on to a winner too long how many times have you heard someone say but it 's doing so well why do i want to sell now presuming trends will continue and they will lose out on future gains only to miss the peak and ride the thing down back into mediocrity   depending on the volatility of the specific market and the various slices using re balancing can get you a pretty reasonable lift above the market average for relatively low risk generally the more volatile the market such as say an emerging markets portfolio the more opportunity for lift i looked into this myself a number of years back the i came was that the most effective method was to rebalance based on need rather than time   need is defined as one or more of the slices in your portfolio being more than 8 above or below the average   so you use that as the trigger how you rebalance depends to some degree on if the portfolio is taxable or not   if in a tax deferred account you can simply sell off whatever is above baseline and use it to buy up the stuff that is below    if you are subject to taxes and do n't want to trigger any short term gains then you may have to be more careful in terms of what you sell   alternatively if you are adding funds to the portfolio you can alter how your distribute the new money coming into the portfolio in order to bring up whatever is below the baseline which takes a bit more time but incurs no tax hit   the other question is how will you slice a given market   by company size   by sectors such as tech finance industrial healthcare by geographic regions

that really depends on the lender and in the current climate this is extremely unlikely in the past it was possible to get a loan which is higher than the value of the house deposit considered usually on the basis that the buyer is going to improve the property extend renovate etc and this increase the value of the property responsible lenders required some evidence of the plans to do this but less responsible ones simply seem to have given the money here in the uk this was often based on the assumption that property value tends to rise relatively quickly anyway so a seemingly reasonable addition to the loan on top of the current value of the property will quickly be covered that meant that indeed some people have been able to get a loan which is higher than the cost of the purchase even without concrete plans to actively increase the value of the property today the situation is quite different lenders are a lot more careful and i ca n't see this happening all that aside had it been possible is it a good idea i find it difficult to come up with a blanket rule it really depends on many factors   on the one hand   mortgage interest rates tend to be significantly lower than shorter term interest rates and from that point of view it makes sense right however they are usually very long term often with limited ability to overpay which means the interest will be paid over a longer period of time

i would strongly encourage you to either find specifically where in your written contract the handling of early over payments are defined and post it for us to help you or that you go and visit a licensed real estate attorney even at a ridiculously high price of 850 pounds per hour for a top uk law firm and i suspect you can find a competent lawyer for 10 20 of that amount it would cost you less than a year of prepayment penalty to get professional advice on what to do with your mortgage a certified public accountant cpa might be able to advise you as well if that 's any easier for you to find i have the suspicion that the company representatives are not being entirely forthcoming with you thus the need for outside advice generally speaking loans are given an interest rate per period such as yearly apr and you pay a percentage the interest of the total amount of money you owe the principle so if you owe 100,000 at 5 apr you accrue 5,000 in interest that year if you pay only the interest each year you 'll pay 50,000 in interest over 10 years but if you pay everything off in year 8 at a minimum you 'd have paid 10,000 less in interest assuming no prepayment penalties which you have some of those so paying off early does not change your apr or your principle amount paid but it should drastically reduce the interest you pay amortization schedules do n't change that they just keep the payments even over the scheduled full life of the loan even with prepayment penalties these are billed at less than 6 months of interest at the rate you would have payed if you kept the loan so if you are supposedly on the hook for more than that again i highly suspect something fishy is going on in which case you 'd probably want legal representation to help you put a stop to it in short something is definitely and most certainly wrong if paying off a loan years in advance even after taking into account pre payment penalties costs you the same or more than paying the loan off over the full term on schedule this is highly abnormal and frankly even in the us i 'd consider it if it were the case so please do look deeper into this something is n't right

the idea being that if when the cad recovers i could see a gain of ~30 that is the big if maybe the usd and cad will return to their previous exchange rates maybe the cad will fall further you just do n't know you should try to keep a diversified pool of investments that may include some cash in various currencies but unless you think you will need the money in the next few years it should be mostly in other things if you do think you will need the money in the next few years it should be in a currency that is stable relative to the things you are likely to need it for

i agree with grade eh bacon 's answer but there are a couple of ideas that are relevant to your particular situation if i were you i would invest at least half of the cash in growth etfs because you 're young enough that market variability does n't affect you and long term growth is important the rest should be invested in safer investments value and dividend etfs bonds cash so that you have something to live off in the near term you said you wanted to invest ethically   the keyword to search is socially responsible etfs   there are many and if this is important to you you 'll have to read their prospectus to find one that matches your ethics since you 're american the way i understand it you need to file taxes on income selling stocks at a gain is income   you want to make sure that as your stocks appreciate you sell some every year and immediately rebuy them so that you pay a small tax bill every year rather than one huge tax bill 20 years from now   claiming about $ of capital gains every year would be tax free assuming you are not earning any other money   i would claim a bit more in years where you make a lot you can mitigate your long term capital gains tax exposure by opening a roth ira and maxing that out   capital gains in the roth ira are not taxable   even if you do n't have income from working you can have some income if you invest in stocks that pay dividends which would allow you to contribute to a roth ira you should figure where you 're going to be living because you will want to minimize the currency risk of having your money in usd while you 're living abroad   if the exchange rate were to change by a lot you might find yourself a lot poorer   there are various hedging strategies but the easiest one is to invest some of your money in securities of the country you 'll be living in you should look into how you 'll be converting money into the foreign currency   there are sometimes way of minimizing the spread when converting large amounts of money e.g. 's gambit   shaving off 1.5 when exchanging $ 100k saves $ 1500

one estimate is to sell today estimate the taxes and determine how much cash you need to set aside over the next 12 months the is no way to calculate what impact dividends and capital gains the funds will have because unlike interest they are n't guaranteed the other complexity is that the funds themselves could drop in value in that case the dividends and capital gains may not even be enough to get you back to even i use mutual funds to invest over the long term with the idea of spending the funds over decades when needing to save for a short term goal i use banking products they are guaranteed not to lose value and the interest changes are thus easier to predict

the tax comes when you close the position if the option expires worthless it 's as if you bought it back for $ 0 there 's a short term capital gain for the difference between your short sale price and your buyback price on the option i believe the capital gain is always short term because short sales are treated as short term even if you hold them open more than one year if the option is exercised calling away your stock then you add the premium to your sale price on the stock and then compute the capital gain so in this case you can end up treating the premium as a long term capital gain see irs pub 550 search for writers of puts and calls

as one answer points out people buying cards care little about whether they cost 25 cents or $ 5   those are both small amounts of money and it 's not something you buy often also people feel the need to spend money because it 's a gift on the supplier side it should be noted that the cost of cards has little to do with the paper they are printed on   there is an expectation that cards are new and unique something the buyer and recipient have never seen   so they have writers and graphic designers constantly out a large variety of cards and replacing existing cards with new ones of which only a small number get sold before they move to the next model   relatively speaking there is a lot of human effort per thousand cards sold   then of course there is the real estate they occupy in the store disproportionate to a bunch of pieces of paper and other retail marketing and distribution costs   i 'm not saying margins are particularly thin but if they were crazy high we probably would see more entry as you suggest

but how does the quantity matching happen for example if i want to buy 1000 shares at $ 100 but there is only one seller to sell 10 shares at $ 100 what happens then this depends on the type of order you 've placed if you placed a fill or kill order your order to buy or sell a certain number of shares is routed to the trading floor for immediate execution if the order can not be immediately filled it is cancelled killed automatically note that the order must be filled in its entirety partial fills are not allowed in your example your buy order would n't be filled because it could n't be matched to a sell order of the same volume this is similar to an all or none order which is an order that contains   a condition instructing the broker to fill the order completely or not at all if there is insufficient supply to meet the quantity requested by the order then it is canceled at the close of the market in this case if your order was n't matched to an order of the same volume by the time the market closes it 's cancelled if you simply placed a market limit order and in the case of the limit order part of your order was matched to another order with the right price that part of your order will be filled while the rest will remained unfilled

if you have an s corp with several shareholders you probably also have a tax adviser who suggested using s corp to begin with   you 're probably best off asking that adviser about this issue if you decided to use s corp for multiple shareholders without a professional guiding you you should probably start looking for such a professional or you may get yourself into trouble that said and reminding you that 1 free advice on the internet is worth exactly what you paid for it and 2 i 'm not a tax professional or tax adviser you should talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state here 's this generally s corps are disregarded entities for tax purposes and their income flows to their shareholders individual tax returns through k-1 forms distributed by the s corp yearly the shareholders do n't have to actually withdraw the profits but if not withdrawing they 're added to their cost bases in the shares i 'm guessing your corp does n't distribute the net income but keeps it on the corporate account only distributing enough to cover the shareholders taxes on their respective income portion in this case the amount not distributed is added to their basis the amount distributed has already been taxed through k-1 if the corporation distributes more than the shareholder 's portion of net income then there can be several different choices depending on the circumstances the extra distribution will be treated as salary to the shareholder and a deduction to the corporation i.e. increasing the net income for the rest of the shareholders the extra distribution will be treated as return of investment reducing that shareholder 's basis in the shares but not affecting the other shareholders if the basis is 0 then it is treated as income to the shareholder and taxed at ordinary rates the extra distribution will be treated as buy back reducing that shareholder 's ownership stake in the company and reallocating the bought back portion among the rest of the shareholders in this case it is treated as a sale of stock and the gain is calculated as with any other stock sale including short term vs. long term taxation there 's also sec that can come in handy here the extra distribution will be treated as dividend this is very rare for s corp but can happen if it was a c corp before in that case it will be taxed as dividends note that options 2 3 and 4 subject the shareholder to the while option 1 subjects the shareholder to fica self employment tax and subjects the company to payroll taxes there might be other options your licensed tax adviser will go with you through all the facts and circumstances and will suggest the best way to proceed

yours two funds are redundant   both are designed to have a mix of bonds and stocks and allow you to put all your money in them   pick the one that has the lowest fees and stick with that i did n't look at the funds you did n't select they did n't look great either   although all your funds have high fees some are higher than others so do n't ignore fees when you have decided on your portfolio weights prioritize your money thus contribute enough to your 401(k to get the full match from your employer put everything else toward paying off that credit card until you have 0 balance   it 's ok to use the card but let it be little enough that you pay your statement balance off each month so you pay no interest then set aside some savings and invest any retirement money into a roth ira   at your income level your taxes are low so roth is better than traditional ira or 401(k   if you max out your roth put any other retirement savings in your 401(k

generally in international transfers there are 4 banks involved customer 's bank customer who initiating the payment also called sender bank there is sender 's correspondent bank then there is beneficiary bank also called receiver bank bank where beneficiary holds account there is receiver 's correspondent bank so person a- > a 's bank > a 's correspondent bank > b 's correspondent bank > b 's bank > person b. depending on the currency at times there is only one correspondent bank the chain of correspondent bank is common knowledge and quite often if you do n't provide all the details your bank or other bank will fill in default details and processes the payments however it all depends on which bank and whether they are inclined to do so some bank specifically insist to use a preferred correspondent bank so if you do n't specify any they may return reject it

i had one of those banks that transactions deposit cash first thing in the morning means you should have money in your account right nah son first they 're going to take your balance at the beginning of the day then they 'll deduct all of the transactions you made that day in order from largest to smallest did one of those put you in the red ignoring the deposit time to apply an overdraft fee to that one and every single one that comes after in order of largest purchase to smallest mind you only then would they apply your deposit but for many that was n't enough to cover the overdraft fees i eventually received money from either a class action or a cfpb thing but not enough to cover the amount they took in fees through that scheme thankfully my deposits were large enough to at least cover the fees so i did n't have those daily fees on top of it all

customers are regularly confused by software pricing microsoft 's windows for example either they 're dumb and should n't confuse the customers or they know what they 're doing i 'm betting the latter   at 99 bucks a product can seem expensive but if the other offerings are 89 and 150 99 seems like you 're saving a lot on the 150 while only paying a bit more than the 99 yet without those other options 99 might seem expensive   business consumers are more likely to pay more so you can gouge them with the enterprise edition at 150 99 for the gold edition and 89 for lite 99 will sell great and if that 's what you were hoping for in the first place that 's good   do n't think of the premium getting just thing of the premium edition as a way to capture the consumer surplus of businesses

it is possible for him to get a loan against the house as long as the all takes place at the same time as the loan is closing basically you and your brother will both have paperwork to sign and the title company will not send out checks until the loan funds from the mortgage company for that to take place the estate will generally have to be fully settled that can take time but you might wish to retain a lawyer to be certain your interests are completely protected many people feel like getting legal representation will strain family relationships but i find the opposite to be true they often grease the wheels and get the process finished quickly and fairly which ultimately reduces such strain i would view it as a good sign if he is paying off large debts because that means he will be in a better position to take a mortgage to pay you your share but that assumes he is acting in good faith

neither party gives an f about the consumer    the real issue is class action lawsuits in which the consumer gets shafted and the lawyers make a killing    real class action reform would not come in the form of favoring arbitration over lawsuits or vice versa but in requiring that fees in class action suits be paid in the same form as the payment to consumers and requiring that people opt in to join a class rather than having to actively opt out ending payment of fees in cash but consumers getting coupons which are only good one buys more of the alleged wrong doing products services would ensure consumers get a fair shake   this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most democrats and many republicans would never support it requiring people to opt in to class action suits rather than go through a long process of opting out would reduce the number of frivolous class action suits   again this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most of our politicians would n’t support it in short it comes down to most democrats favoring the lawyer lobby over the business lobby and most republicans favoring the opposite neither cares about the consumer citizen

so after a great deal of clarification it appears that your question is how to adjust your withholding such that you 'll have neither a refund or a balance due when you do your 2016 taxes next year   first a little terminology the more you have withheld the more money will be taken out of your check to cover your estimated tax liability the more allowances you select on your w-4 the less money you will have withheld more allowances means more dependents deductions other reasons why you will owe less tax when you go to file your 2015 tax return next year you 'll figure out exactly how much you owe if you had too little tax withheld you 'll have to pay the difference if you had too much tax withheld you 'll get a refund back   given your situation simply following the instructions on the w-4 should work pretty well if you want to be more precise you can use the irs withholding calculator to figure the number of allowances and submit a new w-4 to your employer   it 's a little hard to tell whether paying this much year in taxes seem steep because you 've lumped all the taxes together in one big bucket does the $ in taxes per paycheck include social security and medicare taxes whatever you do it 's not going to be an exact science come tax time you 'll figure out exactly what you owe and either pay the balance or get a refund back as long as you 're relatively close that 's fine you can always adjust your withholding again next year after you 've done your taxes

it is better to have it than to not have it but the valued added is very marginal also you ca n't get the cfa charter without work experience in the finance field i think 5 years so people doing a career change can not get the cfa charter the most value actually comes from passing the cfa level 1 it is a big signal that you are interested it is evidence of interest rather than just a statement of interest because it is expected to take 300 hours of studying from someone with no financial experience to pass it i.e. it 's like taking ~3 finance courses in college

how can i avoid this so we are taxed as if we are making the $ 60k yr that we want to receive   you ca n't in the us the income is taxed when received not when used if you receive 1 m this year taking out 60 k does n't mean the other k were n't received they were and are taxable create a pension fund in the corporation feed it all profits and pay    out $ 60k yr of pension i doubt that the corporation could deduct a    million a year in pension funding you can not do that you can only deposit to a pension plan up to 100 of your salary and no more than $ 50 k total maybe a little more this year its adjusted to inflation buy a million dollars in business equipment of some sort each year    to get a deduction then sell it over time to fund a $ 60k yr salary i    doubt such a vehicle exists if there 's no real business purpose it will be disallowed and you 'll be penalized your only purpose is tax avoidance meaning you 're trying to shift income using your business to avoid paying taxes that 's illegal do crazy section 79 life insurance schemes to tax defer the income    the law caps this so i can only deduct < $ 100k of the $ 1 million    annually and there are other problems with this yes would n't go there   added from what i understand this is a term life insurance plan sponsored by the employer for the employee this is not a deferral of income but rather a deduction instead of paying your term life insurance with your own after tax money your employer pays with their pre tax it has a limit of $ 50 k per employee and is only available for employees there are non discrimination limitations that may affect your ability to use it but i do n't see how it is at all helpful for you it gives you a deduction but its money spent not money in your pocket end added do some tax avoidance like facebook does with its double irish trick    storing the income in some foreign subsidiary and drawing $ 60k yr in    salary to be taxed at $ 60k yr rates this is probably cost prohibitive    for a $ 1mm yr company you 're not facebook what works with a billion will not work with a million keep in mind that you 're a one man business things that huge corporations like google or facebook can get away with are a no no for a sole proprietor even if incorporated bottom line you 'll probably have to pay the taxes get a good tax professional to help you identify as much deductions as possible and if you can plan income ahead plan it better

in the normal course of events you should receive a separate check for the amount of the purchase and that amount should not be included in your wages as shown on your w-2 statement   if the amount is included on your paycheck it should still be listed separately as a non taxable item not as part of wages paid   in other words the irs should not even be aware that this money   was paid to you there is no need to list the amount anywhere on your   income tax return and if you are paranoid about the matter staple the stub attached to the reimbursement to a copy of your bank statement showing that you deposited the money into your account and save it in your file of tax papers for the year just in case the irs audits you and requires you to document every deposit in your checking account   the amount is a business expense that is deductible on your employer 's tax return and your employer is also required to keep documentation that the   employee expense reimbursement plan is running as per irs rules i.e. the employer is not slipping money to you under the table as a reimbursement instead of paying you wages and thus avoiding the employer 's share of fica taxes etc and that is why your employer needs the store receipt not a hand written note from you to show the irs if the irs asks you said you paid with your own cash but in case this was not meant literally and you paid via credit card or debit card or check then any mileage award or points or cash back for credit card use are yours to keep tax free and any interest charges   if you are carrying a revolving balance or paid through your heloc or   overdraft or bounced check fees are yours to pay

my personal rule is to not loan money or co sign for any amount that i am not willing to give away   it can go wrong in so many ways and having a family or friend involved means making a business decision is difficult if a bank wo n't loan the person the money why should i   being a co signer is the same as borrowing the money in my name and giving it right over to the borrower there might be great reasons to do it   i would probably sign a loan to keep my family alive or healthy but no other reason   there are many ways to help without signing a loan   give a room and a place to live loan a car the other thing is if you really truly believe in the borrower it wo n't do long term damage to your credit or your financial goals and you are the only resort go ahead   i am thinking about helping a teenager afford their first car or student loans

i think johnfx 's answer is pretty much the right thing to do i 'd just like to suggest that the budget does n't have to be fixed it sounds like you are n't completely sure what an acceptable lifestyle costs for you and it might feel like a budget locks you into a spending pattern that could end up being or keep you in debt longer than necessary to reduce that risk you could start with a very easy level of contributions then every month see if you can spend $ less without sacrificing in the lifestyle department and eventually if you feel like you 're missing out you can stick with the previous month 's budget you might avoid depriving yourself by starting with something easy but i think if you make an effort to save money you 'll more likely be surprised how much you can improve your lifestyle while spending less i like a lot of the advice on mr. money mustache and early retirement extreme and i 'd recommend the introductory sections of both blogs if you ever hit a block at some level of contribution and one minor highly situational comment you mentioned having less to save if you contribute more but if you have high interest loans paying them down early can be pretty much a guaranteed very high roi so while you might want to prioritize an emergency fund and maybe an employer match first most saving will probably be less useful than extra contributions

since it 's not tagged united states i 'd like to offer a more general advice your emergency fund should match the financial risks that are relevant to you the two main classes of financial risk are of course a sudden increase in costs or a decrease in income you 'd have to address both independently first loss of income for most this would simply equate to the loss of a job how much benefits would you expect to get and for how long this is often the most important question the 6 months advise in the us is based on a lack of benefits   with two incomes you 're less likely to lose both jobs at the same time that 's a general advise though if you both work for the same employer the risk of losing two jobs at the same time is certainly real also in countries with little protection against dismissal such as the us the chance of being off at the same time is also higher on the debit side there are also two main risks the first is the loss or failure of an essential possession i.e. one which requires immediate replacement this could include a car or a washing machine you already paid for one before so you should have a good idea how much it costs the second expenditure risk is health related costs those can suddenly crop up but often you have some kind of insurance if not you 'd need to account for some costs but it 's hard to come up with an objective number here the two categories are dependent of course health related costs may very well coincide with a loss of income especially if you 're self employed now once you 've figured out what the risks are it 's time to figure out how to insure against them insurance might be a better choice than an emergency fund especially for the health costs you might even discover that you do n't need an emergency fund at all in large parts of europe you could establish a credit margin that 's not easily revoked i.e. overdraft agreements and unemployment benefits are sufficient to cover your regular cost of living the main risk would then be a sudden lack of liquidity if your employer goes bankrupt and fails to pay the monthly wages which means your credit should be guaranteed sufficient to borrow one month of expenses this of course assumes quite good credit pay off my car does n't suggest that

evaluate if the rs 5 million term insurance is sufficient typically the term insurance provided by employer is in the range of 1 to 3 times the gross generally one should be covered in the range of 5 to 10 times the gross the sooner you start the lesser the premium and you can get insured for a large amount for a long duration at very nominal rate   note   you can also buy a health insurance for your father note these typically come at high cost generally if over 70 years of age 25 is the premium amount and 25 as co pay so if your dad does n't fall ill once in 3 years its a loss making proposition edit accident insurance best take is along with rider on term plan additional health insurance is a good idea and helps if you are in between jobs plus the new company health insurance can reject a particular treatment as pre existing i.e. certain illness in certain plans require one to have coverage for 3 years before the claim for it can be covered

basically no   selecting an actively managed fund over a low fee index fund means paying for the opportunity to possibly outperform the index fund a random walk down wall street by burton malkiel argues that the best general strategy for the average investor is to select the index fund because the fee savings are certain assuming a random walk means that any mutual fund may outperform the index in some years but this is not an indication that it will overall   unless you have special information about the effectiveness of the bank fund management it 's run by the next warren buffett you are better off in the index fund and even warren buffett suggests you are probably better off in the index fund this year regarding wall street buffett wrote when trillions of dollars are managed by wall charging high fees it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits not the clients both large and small investors should stick with low cost index funds

in many most cases luxury cars are leased rather than purchased so the payments on even an expensive car might not be as high as you 'd expect for simplicity take a $ 100,000 car if you were to buy that in cash or do a standard five year auto loan that would be incredibly expensive for all but the wealthiest of people but a lease is different when you lease a car you are financing the car 's depreciation over the lease term so let 's suppose that you 're signing up for a three year lease the car manufacturer will make an estimate of what that car will be worth when you bring it back in three years this is called the residual value if this number is $ 80,000 that means the is only financing the $ 20,000 difference between the car 's price and its residual value after three years rather than the full $ 100,000 msrp at the end of the lease he or she just turns the car back in luxury cars are actually especially amenable to leasing because they have excellent brand power just because of the name on the hood there are many people who would be happy to pay a lot for a three year old mercedes or bmw with a or low range car the brand is not as powerful and used cars have a lower residual value as a percentage of the msrp than luxury cars so do n't look at an $ 80,000 luxury car and assume that the owner has paying for the entire $ 80,000

from my experience payments from banks and other financial entities such as loyalty programs generally are n't as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank thus keeping a bank account open simply for some reward loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons the more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ach payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services perhaps the biggest tell that you 're in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account   for example if you had a direct deposit to your bmo bank account make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account if you 're making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account you should n't need to move the auto loan but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account   some financial advisors such as in this bankrate article titled lenders can tap bank account for mortgage even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations if for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what 's in your checking account to avoid getting nickel and to death by payment processing fees i tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi annually thus consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months if so you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head it 's a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late if all that is in order close the account

here is a page that seems to have specific advice on the matter   this site speculates that even though the private loan industry does not have to settle and the private student loans like federal loans can not be discharged with a bankruptcy they sometimes will anyway    if she could file bankruptcy to erase the private student loan debt    she owes to sallie mae she would but because of a 2005 reform law    private student loans can not be discharged in bankruptcy except in    extremely rare cases   the advice that works for you is the same advice with negotiating any debt   get it in writing that the amount will constitute payment in full   be sure that the written agreement makes some mention of how they will report it on your credit   you are going to take a credit hit if you settle but time will heal that the best plan is to pay but if you ca n't and you can honestly prove you ca n't the debt collection company would be foolish to not take a settlement   they can wait around forever and sue you add penalties and fees but if you can not pay you can not pay    i am going to guess because you are dealing with a debt collector they are less vested in collecting the full amount   so get that settlement offer in writing   and do n't be too much of a hard core negotiator   the power is all on their side   you will likely have to appeal to the greed of the collection company to succeed   hope they would rather have $ .50 today than $ 1.25 tomorrow

given that utilizing all the funds available to you drains your retirement and leaves you with very little cushion for unforeseen events as already noted it may be best to use a smaller amount for closing and just deal with the pmi for a couple years pmi is likely less than the taxes penalties incurred from withdrawing a full 20 + closing costs let alone the lost earning on the accounts above your mortgage interest rate but personally i think the stability of significant home equity is worth more than anticipated stock gains i would recommend pulling enough to buy the house comfortably without dipping too deeply in any one area while still paying down your balance to where you can eliminate pmi quickly say 2 3 years your limits for each account are approximately roth iras   traditional iras brokerage non retirement checking things to consider    if you are current on your payments you can request pmi removal once your loan to value drops below 80 it also automatically when it is scheduled to drop below 78 not if it actually has many loans have a 2 year minimum pmi period though regardless of your loan to value ltv changes ltv changes could be from

yeah so where are the scholarly articles i do n't see any being referenced in the article seems to me like it 's just his opinion explains why it 's an op ed rather than a research article or something of substance    it sure is easy to say do n't have a kid before 21 but have you considered that a lot of kids do n't have access to birth control or even sex ed i 've met teens who do n't even understand how sex works but they sure are having it what about marriage for some kids it 's easier to get married because it gives them access to housing health care if the spouse has a plan but even then the divorce rate is so incredibly high that a lot of them face homelessness and situational poverty when they separate have you ever seen someone working 2 3 jobs but they 're still poor i 've certainly seen it i 've seen kids choose work over high school because it means they can support their families a lot of families in poverty depend on every single member of the family to bring in a source of revenue and even then they ca n't seem to get by you said it yourself you ca n't support a family on minimum wage but kids in generational poverty have learned to their mothers taught them getting out of poverty just is n't real for most of these kids that 's why the cycle of wiki usually spans across three generations in a family what happens in a child 's home life will affect them for the rest of their lives when they learn how to live in poverty as children the behaviors they learn are much more likely to carry through to adulthood   it does n't matter what your political stance is it 's going to take some intervention from the government to create programs for these kids in generational poverty this issue is much too complicated and pervasive to treat it otherwise

in some states it is your responsibility to pay the sales tax on a transaction even if the party your purchase from does n't collect it this is common with online purchases across state lines for example here in massachusetts if i buy something from new hampshire where there is no sales tax i am required to pay ma sales tax on the purchase when i file my income taxes buying a service that did not include taxes just shifts the burden of paperwork from the other party to me even if you would end up saving money by paying in cash as other here have pointed out you are sacrificing a degree of protection if something goes wrong with the transaction he could take your money and walk away without doing the work or do a sloppy job or even damage your vehicle without a receipt it is your word against his that the transaction ever even took place should you be worried that he is offering a discount for an under the table transaction probably not as long as you do n't take him up on it

but their strategy is not debt spending to increase demand every time we start getting anywhere near a balanced budget they cut taxes again so that they can continue blaming the deficit on pork barrel spending forcing ever more draconian budget cuts that will never ultimately balance the budget it 's called a starve the wiki strategy    deficit spending does drive demand short term but as this debt rises so does the rent seeking cost of that debt after some point this debt cost exceeds the benefits derived from the debt incurred in any given year just because you cab say the debt incurred this year exceeds the cost of the debt incurred this year does not mean that these benefits will remain positive overall as the debt remains on the books indefinitely not just for the year they were incurred this is not to claim that all debt is bad but you ca n't make broad statements about the benefits of debt in general   most such debt spending is a complete waste because your taxes are not defined by how much they take from your paycheck alone when debt is used for consumption spending rather than investment spending that increases productive capacity this consumption leaves fewer goods and services remaining on the market for the rest of the consumers competing for it raising your cost of living your tax rate is not determined by how much money the government takes from you it 's determined by how much they spend that is how much they are taking from the consumer market    granted given the low wages relative to capital prod media newshour jpg demand consumption is overly suppressed resulting in an wiki overproduction problems which makes debt spending look even more financially appealing because it 's not actually suppressing the already excessive demand constraints but this is because you wages have been suppressed so instead of paying taxes you are working for a lower income in fact the loss of wages relative to capital returns i.e. your cost of living actually well exceeds your tax cut your just paying those taxes through lower wages or an increased cost of living instead of taxes out of your paycheck so your being conned out of that money while the people doing it are pretending to cut taxes   the same applies to the rich sites files in a different way there is a limit to how rich you can get from a population of poor people when you cut wages too far below productive capacity to save cost it dries up demand people ca n't afford as much of your product as you can produce so they cut jobs i. production to match market demand which drives demand even lower pushing inflation and the velocity of money to historic lows in spite of an increased money supply this also makes it unprofitable to invest in new productive capacity when market demand is already saturated wages relative to capital returns must increase to fix it but if you take it too far it drives inflation to unacceptable levels but at the present ratio we are a long ways from that

yes you will come out ahead slightly by putting the money in the savings account then paying off your mortgage later   however we do n't know what will happen to these interest rates after 1 year if you put the £ 300 per month into the savings account for a year then put the money into you mortgage you will save about £ 78 for the year over just putting the money toward your mortgage in the first place   for me i 'm more concerned about longer term strategy what happens to your mortgage rate after 2 years what happens to your savings account rate after 1 year the mortgage rate likely goes up and the savings account rate likely goes down making the savings of this strategy even less after the first year instead you may want to put this £ 300 per month toward retirement investments assuming you have no other debt which should over the long term earn more than the savings account

pay down the lower balance on the rental property generally speaking you are more likely to need want to sell the rental house as business conditions change or if you need the money for some other purpose if you pay down your primary residence first you are building equity but that equity is n't as liquid as equity in the rental also in the us you can not deduct the interest on a rental property so the net interest after taxes that you 're paying on the rental the gap between the loan and the 5 loan

dollar cost averaging is a fancy name someone came up with to say invest all of the time i would not bother with spreading out purchases if the market is too expensive right now so what the items you sell will bring top dollar the fund you buy will cost top dollar it all out   you could sell your assets and just sit on cash but that would require knowing when the next market drop is coming which no one knows also it never really is cash it goes into a money market fund which is not guaranteed i would rather own and collect the dividend

fsemx has an annual expense ratio of 0.1 which is very low what that means is that each month the fsemx will pay itself one of 0.1 of   the total value of all the shares owned by the shareholders in the mutual fund   if the fund has cash on hand from its trading activities or dividends collected from companies   whose stock is owned by fsemx or interest on bonds owned by fsemx the   money comes out of that but if there is no such pot or the pot is not large enough then the fund manager has the authority to sell some shares of the stocks held by fsemx so that the employees can be paid etc if the total of cash generated by the trading and the dividend collection in a given year is say 3 of the share value of all the outstanding mutual fund   then only 2.9 will be paid out as dividend and capital gain distribution   income to the share holders the remaining 0.1 already having been paid to fsemx management for operating expenses    it is important to keep in mind that expenses are always paid even if there are no profits or even if there are losses that year so that no dividends or capital gains distributions are made   you do n't see the expenses explicitly on any statement that you receive   if fsemx sells shares of stocks that it holds to pay the expenses this reduces   the share value nav of the mutual fund shares that you hold   so if your mutual fund account lost 20 in value that year because the market was falling and you got no dividend or capital gains distributions either remember that only 19.9 of that loss can be blamed on the president or congress or wall street or public sector unions or your neighbor 's refusal to ditch his old pc in favor of a new mac and the rest 0.1 has gone to fsemx to pay for fees you agreed to when you bought fsemx shares if you invest directly in fsemx through fidelity 's web site there is no sales charge and you pay no expenses other than the 0.1 annual expense ratio   there is a fee for selling fsemx shares after owning them only for a short time since   the fund wants to discourage short term investors whatever other fees lists might be descriptive of the uses that fsemx puts its expense ratio income to in its internal management but are not of any importance to the prudent investor in fsemx who will never encounter them or have to pay them

that 's true though i feel he means it more in terms of hindsight yes low interest rates will cause the stock market as a whole to rise though it is not actionable by us prior to the rise or fall in rates because we can never know before it happens   we 're then left with only one real way of making money in the market and that 's the purchase of undervalued companies with all the aforementioned criteria

first step is determine how much equity is in the car positive or negative then for your car payments has that been paid out of money that has already been split or is it from a pool that is still to be if the later then it is irrelevant to this discussion since it was from a joint pool if the money has already been split then adjust her half of the equity in the car by what you have been paying an make her that offer for her half of the car   i recommend showing her the calculations so as to explain how you came with what she is owed and then let her make a counter offer

reminds me of last winter when two girls knocked on our door to shovel snow i asked how much they said $ 20 i pay $ 50 75 since i have a huge driveway circular on one side and a regular driveway on to another street i asked if they were sure because that is a lot of driveway they say yes i say you got a deal and i 'll give you $ 30 and you only have to do one of the driveways   look down 20 minutes later and they found out how hard it was and called their dad and he was stuck doing most of it very shitty job and they walked all over the snow on the other driveway making it even harder to shovel laughed a lot but had to pay a professional to clean up their mess

the most likely reason for this card is that amazon has an arrangement with the issuer i believe that that used to be chase may have changed since   such an arrangement may allow amazon to take the risk of chargebacks etc in return for the issuer handling the mechanics of billing   this is advantageous for amazon as otherwise they are subject to both their own procedures and those of the issuer   amazon would rather take the entire risk than share it with someone else who charges for the privilege    fees for processing credit cards can be as much as 5 although 1 2 is more typical   due to its size amazon may already have negotiated fees lower than 1   but even so any savings they make are to their benefit   further now they can get a share of the fees charged to other merchants   for example if you buy a book from barnes noble an amazon competitor with the amazon card then amazon gets some money in return say 1 of the transaction    if the price is the same on amazon and at barnes noble you can actually save money with the amazon card   amazon gives more cash back in the form of gift card balance for an amazon purchase   so the card may mean that you buy from amazon when you might otherwise have chosen someone else   if we again assume a 20 margin they only need $ 200 of additional purchases to make $ 40 of profit   someone who buys $ 1000 additional on the amazon site makes them $ 200 of profit   they 're over $ 160 ahead    also note that amazon is only giving you a gift card which you have to use on amazon   and it 's difficult to spend exactly $ 50   as a practical matter most people will buy say $ 60 with $ 10 of that money   so they sell you $ 48 of merchandise their cost assuming a 20 margin for $ 10   they lost $ 38 on that transaction but they 've you into a long term relationship that may return more than that   and they did n't lose the $ 50 you gained   they only lost $ 38    think about it as a marketing cost   amazon is willing to pay $ 38 for a long term relationship with you   from their perspective doing so in such a way that you come out $ 50 ahead assuming you would have made the same purchases without this is a win win   because once they have that relationship they can leverage it to give them savings elsewhere    this is amazon 's approach in general   originally all their products were drop shipped from someone like micro   they handled the web site and billing while the drop handled inventory and shipping   then amazon added their own warehouses   now they can do all that separately    this is just the same thing for buyers   amazon manages all the risk of the transaction and thus gets all the profit   because amazon is managing the credit card risk they have access to all the credit history   this helps them better determine if that sudden shipment of a $ 2000 camera to thailand is a real transaction you 're a photographer who regularly vacations in thailand or a fake you 've never been to thailand in your life and your phone is camera enough   that additional information may itself be worth enough to make the relationship profitable for amazon    amazon certainly gets something out of the relationship   you give them money   and you are likely to give them more money with the amazon card than they would otherwise receive   but you get products in return   is that a good deal   if you prefer having the products to the money then yes    others have suggested that it 's the irresponsible credit card users that generate the real profit   i disagree   they generate more revenue in the short term but then they overspend and declare bankruptcy   then amazon loses its money   yes they get more interest and fees in that case but if they lose $ 1000 they needed to make $ 1000 in profit just to break even   it 's safer to make the smaller short term profits with responsible customers who will continue to be customers for the long term    a steady profit of $ 100 or $ 200 a year is better than a one time profit of $ 500 followed by a loss of $ 1000 followed by nothing for ten years    anyway your question was if you should sign up for the card   if you are planning on doing a lot of shopping on amazon you might as well   it gives you cash back   if shopping on amazon is inconvenient then perhaps that outweighs the advantage of the card   the cash back is just amazon money   you ca n't spend it anywhere but amazon   if each transaction gives you a little bit of amazon money you have to keep going back to spend it

let 's start from the premise that the mortgage is something you will have anyway because you need it to live as opposed to say getting a bigger mortgage initially in the expectation of paying it down faster than scheduled in that case i think paying down a mortgage certainly is an investment one with a well defined interest rate and maturity that depends on the precise terms of the mortgage for example i have a uk mortgage that 's fixed for the next two years at about 5 and allows overpayments of £ 500 per month which can be withdrawn at any time so i treat those overpayments as equivalent to savings with quite a nice interest rate especially since mortgage interest is n't tax deductible and so i actually get the full benefit of that interest rate

thanks for the info things are starting to make more sense now for some reason i 've always neglected learning about investments now that i m in a position to invest and am still fairly young i 'm motivated to start learning    as for help with td ameritrade i was looking into index funds as another commenter mentioned that i should on their site and am a little overwhelmed with the options first i 'm looking at mutual funds going to symbol lookup and using type = i 'm assuming that 's the same thing as an index fund but since the language is slightly different i 'm not 100 sure however at that point i need some kind of search for a symbol in order to see any results makes sense but i do nt know where to start looking for good index funds     so my first question is if i find a good mutual fund is it correct to simply go to buy mutual funds and find it from there and if so my second question is how do i find a good mutual fund    my goal is to have my money in something that will likely grow faster than a savings account i do n't mind a little volatility i can afford to lose my investment i 'd plan on leaving my money in the fund for a several years at least    my last question is when investing in these types of funds or please point me in another direction if you think index funds are n't the place for me to start should i be reinvesting in the funds or having them pay out dividends i would assume that reinvesting is the smart choice but i can imagine situations that might change that in order to mitigate risk and as i 've said a few times in this thread including the title i 'm a complete amateur so my assumptions are n't necessarily worth that much    thanks for the help i really appreciate all the info so far

think about the credit card business model they have two revenue generators interest and fees from borrowers and commissions and fees to merchants the key to a successful credit card is to both sign up lots of borrowers and lots of merchants credit card fortunes have improved dramatically since the 1990 's when formerly off limits merchants like grocery stores began to accept cards so when a credit card lets you just pull cash out of any atm there are a few costs they need to account for when pricing the cost for such a service credit card banks have managed to make cash advances both a profit center and a self serving perk knowing that you can always draw upon your credit line for an emergency when cash is necessary makes you less likely to actually carry cash and more likely to just rely on your credit card

look i agree with you in theory    in practice it is quite different    the fact that there is way more educated people than is even remotely necessary the extreme vast majority of jobs out there do not even require actual ability to get a diploma let alone a degree    think about your daily life with whom do you actually deal with that requires much of an education few people are going to pay more to their retail sales or car because they have an advanced degree     everybody having a college degree drives the value down for everybody which is exactly what is happening     things need to be turned on their head i propose that colleges need to receive their income as a percentage of the first 10 15 years of income from their students   it will cut down on bogus degrees concentrate on valuable students even those with questionable academics like steve jobs and larry and concentrate on degrees with high future value    however when you get 2500 applications for a lower end job i would immediately take it down to those with a degree because it 's easy and nobody will second guess you

absolutely   just because a spouse does n't have a taxable income does n't mean they are n't providing real tangible benefit to the family economy with an important job as tragic as it is to consider losing your spouse are you truly in a position to replace everything they do you for you   knowing what they do for you and appreciating the effort your spouse gives is important but do n't sell short the dollar amount of what they provide   your life insurance policy should be to keep you whole without your spouse you will need childcare   you might need domestic services to the home   what about a nanny or similar service   would $ 50 k cover that until your child is an adult   there are a number of added expenses in the short and long term that would occur if a spouse died   how much for a funeral obviously you know the amount and term depends on the age of your kid   but i think you should really try to account for the number of daily hours you spouse puts in and try to attach a cost to those hours   then buy insurance for them just as you would for a wage earning    for example buy a policy that is 10x the annual cost for services it would take to compensate for your spouse   your tolerance for risk and cost can adjust it up and down from there

no your business can not deduct your non business expenses   you can only deduct from your business income those reasonable expenses you paid in order to earn income for the business moreover for there to be a tax benefit your business generally has to have income but i expect there are exceptions hst input tax credits come to mind the employment income from your full time job would n't count as business income for your corporation the corporation has nothing to do with that income it 's earned personally by you with respect to restaurant bills these fall under a category known as meals entertainment   even if the expense can be considered reasonable and business related e.g. meeting customers or vendors the canada revenue agency decided that a business can only deduct half of those kinds of expenses for tax purposes with respect to gasoline bills you would need to keep a mileage and expense log only the portion of your automobile expenses that relate to the business can be deducted   driving to and from your full time job does n't count of course i 'm not a tax professional   if you 're going to have a corporation or side business you ought to consult with a tax professional a point on terminology a business does n't write off eligible business expenses it deducts them from business income   write off is an accounting term meaning to reduce the value of an asset to zero e.g. if you damaged your car beyond repair one could say the car is a write off

since i ca n't vote up the answer yet i will agree with it here i find the best tactic when you call is to tell them you have an offer in hand and will use it if they do n't match the rate exactly or discount it enough to save you the trouble of going through the process of a balance transfer so if they balk and say no then walk and go to the in hand offer just remember the worst they can say is no   if you do n't even bother to ask it 's as if you did and they said no as either scenario leaves you with the same result an unchanged interest rate

your mother has a problem that is typical for a woman with children   she is trying to help her children have a good life by sacrificing to get them to a point where they can live comfortably on their own   though she has a difficult situation now much of the problems come from a very few choices by her and her children and her situation can be fixed let me point out a few of the reasons why she has come to this point my mother is a single mom she is turning 50 this summer she has about $ 60k in school loans from the college i attended she has payments of $ 500/month $ 10k to my sisters college she lives on her own in a 2 bedroom apartment mother 's current income statement income essentials total $ 71 too high goal $ 2200 lifestyle total $ 150 low she should have $ 500 900 to live her life financial total $ 31 some observations and suggestions even though the $ rents seems high your mom might enjoy her apartment and consider part of her rent $ 300 a lifestyle choice spending money for time and the higher rent may make sense   but the rent is high for her income your mom should be spending more on food and budget $ 200/month your mom should be saving money for investments and retirement   she should be putting 10 into savings $ 440 plus any k pretax savings your sister should be paying for her own college   she should take her own student loans so that her mother can save for retirement   and since she only has $ 10 k left an alternative would be that you could loan her the money and she could repay you when she graduates you have money as you loaned your mother $ 8 k you should be repaying the $ 500/month on the $ 60 k student loan your mother took to help you get through college   you have benefited from the education and the increased opportunity the college education has given you   now is the time to accept responsibility and pay your debts   you could at least agree to split the expense with her and were you paying even $ 300/month leaving $ 200 for her that would still fix her budget your mom should get a car that is paid for and reduce her transportation expenses until the $ 350/month debt is resolved   she should resolve to spend no more than $ 300/month for a car and with $ 100/month for insurance be under 10 for her vehicle since your mother lives in the us nj she could avoid the $ 350/month debt payment though bk   but since there are other solutions she could exercise to resolve her problems this is probably not needed you mom could consider sharing her apartment to share expenses   paying $ for an apartment for one person seems extravagant   she might enjoy sharing her apartment with a room mate that is about it   once her children take responsibility for their lives your mom will have a manageable budget and less stress in her life mother 's revised income statement income essentials total $ 62 high need to reduce by $ 500 lifestyle total $ 450 10 low financial total $ 990 23 while you and your sister have these changes summary of changes some rent is lifestyle reduced car loan by $ 200 sister pays her college $ 500 you pay your college $ 300 mom saves 10 of her income   once your sister graduates and starts to repay you for your help with her college you can take over paying the remainder of your loans saving your mom an additional $ 200/month

are all bonds priced in such a way so that they all return the same amount on average after accounting for risk in other words do risk premiums only compensate for the amount investors might lose no ge might be able to issue a bond with lower yield than say a company from china with no previous records of its presence in the u.s. markets a bond price not only contains the risk of default but also encompasses the of the bond by the issuer with a specific stream of income location of main business any specific terms and conditions in the prospectus or not insurances against default etc else for the same payoff why would you take a higher risk the payoff of a higher risk not only default but term structure e.g. 5 years or 10 years coupon payments bond is more to compensate for the extra risk it entails for the bondholder the yield of a high risk bond will always be higher than a bond with lower risk if you travel back in time to 2011 2012 you would see the yields on greek bonds were in the range of 25 30 to reflect the high risk of a greek default some hedge funds made a killing by buying greek bonds during the eurozone crisis if you go through the efficient frontier theory your argument is a counter statement to it same with individual bonds or a portfolio of bonds you always want to be compensated for the risk you take the higher the risk the higher the compensation and vice versa when investors buy the bond at this price they are essentially buying a risk free bond logically yes but no it is n't and you should n't make that assumption

saving for retirement and actually retiring are 2 different things it is always a good idea to keep some money away that you ca n't easily use this allows you to create a large amount that acts as buffer for rainy day most countries have a special account to save for retirements apart from giving tax benefits and effect of compounding there are also laws that protect it from getting attached in case of default for example if you at some point in time default on an obligation the funds in normal savings account can be attached by court of law however in certain countries funds in retirement account can not be attached by court of law for your obligations thus always leaving you with funds

this question has the united kingdom tag so the information about usa or other law and procedures is probably only of tangential use except for understanding that no this is not something to ignore it may well indicate someone trying to use your i d fraudulently or some other sort of data processing foul up that may adversely impact your credit rating the first thing i would do is phone the credit card company that sent the letter to inform them that i did not make his application and ask firmly but politely to speak to their fraud team i would hope that they would be helpful it 's in their interests as well as yours added later by the way do not trust anything written on the letter it may be a fake letter trying to lure or panic you into some other sort of scam such as closing your compromised bank account and transferring the money in it to the fraud team for safety yes it sounds stupid but con men are experts at what they do and even finance industry professionals have fallen victim to such scams so find a telephone number for that credit card company independently for example google and then call that number if it 's the wrong department they 'll be able to transfer you internally if the card company is unhelpful you have certain legal rights that do not cost much if anything this credit company is obliged to tell you as an absolute minimum which credit reference agencies they used when deciding to decline your application yes you did not make it but it was in your name and affected your credit rating there are three main credit rating agencies and whether or not the bank used them i would spend the statutory £ 2 fee if necessary with each of them to obtain your statutory credit report which basically is all data that they hold about you they are obliged to correct anything which is inaccurate and you have an absolute right to attach a note to your file explaining for example that you entries x y and z were fraudulently caused by an unknown third party trying to steal your id they may be factually correct e.g. credit search on so it 's possible that you can not have them removed and it may not be in your interests to have them removed but you certainly want them flagged as unauthorized   if you think the fraudster may be known to you you can also use the data protection act on the company which write to you requiring them to send you a copy of all data allegedly concerning yourself which it holds this costs £ 10 in particular you will require sight of the application and signature if it was made on paper and the ip address details if it was made electronically as well as all the data content and subsequent communications you may recognise the but even if not you then have documentary evidence that it is not yours as for the ip address you can deduce the internet service provider and then use the data protection act on them they may decline to give any details if the fraudster used his own credentials in which case again you have documentary evidence that it was not you and something to give the police and bank fraud investigators if they get interested i suspect they wo n't be very interested if all you uncover is   fraudulent applications that were declined however you may uncover a successful fraud i.e. a live card in your name being used by a criminal or a store or phone credit agreement in which case obviously get in touch with that company to get it shut down and to get the authorities involved in dealing with the crime in general write down everything you are told including phone contact names and keep it confirm anything that you have agreed in writing and keep copies of the letters you write and of course the replies you receive you should n't need any lawyer the uk credit law puts the onus very much on the credit card company to prove that you owe it money and if a random stranger has stolen your i d it wo n't be able to do that in fact it 's most unlikely that it will even try unless you have a criminal record or a record of financial delinquency but it may be an awful lot of for years to come if somebody has successfully stolen your id so even if the first lot of credit reference agency print outs look clean check again in about six weeks time and yet again   in maybe 3 months finally there is a scheme that you can join if you have been a victim of id theft i 've forgotten its name but you will probably be told about it your credit reference files will be tagged at your request with a requirement for extra precautions to be taken this should not affect your credit rating but might make obtaining credit more hassle for example requests for additional id before your account is opened after the approval process oh and post a letter to yourself it 's not unknown for fraudsters to persuade the post office to redirect all your mail to their address

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

government registering of financial institutions usually is to make the government safe eg is watching for money laundering and financing terrorism rather than to make it 's customers safe   most governments have many levels of registrations and regulatory bodies the most stringent requirements are usually obligatory only for banks and they indeed often include precautions for insuring customer 's deposits even this insurances have limits eg in most eu countries the state guarantees deposits up to if you deposit more and the bank you lose everything over the limit companies like forex or currency exchanges usually make their best effort to avoid as many regulations as possible just because it 's costly if a given company does have guarantee funds and/or customer insurance it should be advertised and explained on their website however the whole issue of trust is you do n't have to trust in your grocery store to shop there there is no government guarantee that the vegetables sold will be tasty if you buy and the product short of your expectations you call it a loss and start shopping elsewhere financial services are no different than any other product i recommend to your aunt to start small and see how it works if a service turns out well she can increase the amount sent through exchange and decrease amount sent through bank but still it 's always prudent to send eg $ 1000 every week instead of $ 4000 once a month it 's more time consuming and cumbersome than having your bank do it but it 's the safety and convenience you 're paying premium for

yes you are generally allowed to make contributions yourself to your hsa even if your employer also made contributions let me explain further the contribution limit for tax year 2015 is $ for individual coverage   it is higher for family coverage or for account holders age 55 +   the limit is for everything contributed to the hsa whether it is an employer contribution or an account holder contribution   in other words if your limit is $ and your employer contributed $ 3000 you can only contribute $ 350 as far as the irs is concerned anything that your employer sends in is considered an employer contribution   this might be money from the company as part of a benefit or it might be money deducted from your salary as part of a voluntary contribution on your part   either way if the employer sends it in it is an employer contribution   none of this employer contribution shows up on your w-2 as taxable income so you do n't get to deduct it on your tax return   it has already been taken off of your income money that you send in yourself with your after tax dollars is your account holder contribution   this is money that you can deduct on your tax return so that you are n't paying tax on this money so here is what you need to do determine your total hsa contribution limit for tax year 2015 find out how much your employer has already contributed for 2015   the difference is how much you can still contribute for 2015 contact your hsa provider and find out how to make a 2015 contribution   do n't just send money in because there is probably a form they want you to fill out to make a prior year contribution get all this done by april 15 the deadline for making a prior year contribution   actually get it done before april 15 because often there will be some sort of delay of a day or two that will prevent you from doing this on the last day

i 'm assuming this is a publicly traded company if not things are somewhat different the objection that management might have that flows out of the fact that the pool of available options is fixed in size for the current year or maybe several years depending on how they structured the compensation plan within that pool they have allocated some to various key individuals and then some to to the esop pool they do n't want requests for more options than they planned to issue in that period suppose that many people notice that the companies prospects are good and offer to forgo some salary for options this could easily eat up the whole pool and leave nothing for the rest of the year if i was management here i would want to structure it so that i had control over how many options were granted so that everyone eligible got some and the pool lasted until the end of the year

gt;it 's more like never let the government really try to help these people    no there are actually several inherent effects of such assistance that actually tend to exacerbate the problem     was reducing poverty up until the early 90 's   ummm no it was n't from the university of michigan 's national poverty center   the late 1950s the poverty rate for all americans was percent or million individuals these numbers declined steadily throughout the 1960s reaching a low of percent or million individuals in 1973 over the next decade the poverty rate fluctuated between and percent but it began to rise steadily again in 1980 by 1983 the number of poor individuals had risen to million individuals or percent   note that 's great society initiative and it 's war on poverty aka the welfare wiki were not passed as legislation until near the end of wiki and really were n't rolled out in their initial limited form until 2 years later circa 1967 nixon 's administration elected in the fall of 68 and taking office in early 1969 then expanded the programs to what is commonly thought of as the full welfare system   and that took effect in the early 1970 's about the time that the poverty levels actually quit descending in fact they had already off and began increasing again   now the inflation of the mid to late 1970 's exacerbated the problem said inflation chiefly due to the nixon shock of effectively defaulting by taking the dollar off the gold standard a move that was not the result of some grand economic theoretical change but rather was something that had to occur due to the balance of payments crisis foreign countries were cleaning out the us gold reserve demanding gold in exchange for the dollars that had been blatantly printed and spent by both and nixon to pay for the welfare warfare state   but regardless the point holds that the welfare system accomplished nothing as far as ending poverty which was in fact it 's purported aim and in reality it ended the steady long term natural reduction in poverty that had been ongoing for the post depression decades and the several decades prior to the depression era   gt;if you want to say welfare is a failure you should really limit your data to periods where we were actually providing a realistic amount of aid to families and not the last 20 years    if you want to claim that it actually reduces poverty you should come up with some data really any that shows that because history both in the us and elsewhere shows that it simply and plainly does n't   if you want to know the how s and why s i 'd suggest you check into a fairly recent book entitled the careless society community and its careless society community its counterfeits by john a lefty disciple of people like who is director of the community studies program at the center for urban affairs and policy research at northwestern university i.e. hardly a of conservatives   we gave them an increasingly smaller share and wondered why they were n't getting ahead   your correlation is   the chief reason for the flattening of wages has a lot more to do with economic fundamentals of monetary manipulation look at any graph of wage growth you will see an almost direct change right around the time the dollar went off the gold standard   the reasons this impacts the lower classes lower and middle class significantly more than the upper class are oversimplified but still essentially    1 the lower and middle classes have to conduct business in the form of dollar based contracts and chiefly derive income via selling their labor something that is not easily multiplied iow their potential revenue streams are limited and their wages are set in terms of dollars which are being steadily and regularly often very significantly debased via inflation even when they do achieve cost of living increases in pay to purportedly make up for inflation said increases always lag the inflation by definition   2 while the lower classes may have some debt basically mortgages that might benefit from the inflation via being able to pay off the debt in later debased dollars because of the lag factor mentioned above the benefit is essentially negated in addition the lower classes are not leveraging debt for productive investment they are instead carrying consumption debt   3 meanwhile the upper class chiefly owns assets and increasingly under the fiat monetary system that has existed in pure form since the fall 1971 nixon shock they have leveraged that via easily available credit on far better terms in the form of lower interest rates often well below the rate of inflation thus every dollar borrowed actually increases their holdings values and so they gain increased control over productive assets which they have via the leverage been able to multiply several times over   the really sad thing is that instead of what the real problems are far too many people like you have been duped and tricked and indoctrinated into looking for even more of the same things that have caused the worsening current situation

i reread your question you are not asking about the validity of selling a particular stock after a bit of an increase but a group of stocks we do n't know how many   this is the s&p for the past 12 months trading at 1200 or so means that 80 100 points is an 8 move i count 4 such moves during this time   the philosophy of you ca n't go wrong taking a gain is tough for me to grasp as it offers no advice on when to get back in studies by firms such as dalbar you can google for some of their public material show data that supports the fact that average investors lag the market by a huge amount 20 years ending the s&p returned investor equity returns showed i can only conclude that this is a result of buying high and selling low not staying the course   the data also leads me to believe the best advice one can give to people we meet in these circumstances is to invest in index funds keeping your expenses low as you can i 've said this since read jack bogle decades ago and this advice would have yielded about over the 20 years beating the average investor by far by guaranteeing lagging the average by 10 basis points or so   a summary of the more extensive report citing the numbers i referenced is available for down load 2015 quantitative analysis of investor behavior it 's quite an eye opener and a worthy read the original report was dated 2009 but the link broke so i 've updated to the latest report 2015

the bit i do n't quite understand is why you are thinking about staying in debt in the first place you 're basically thinking about shuffling around assets and liabilities in order to stay in debt i think what i would do in your situation is to liquidate enough of the investments you have and pay off the mortgage this does n't change your net worth position less the fees etc that you might incur but it 'll save you the interest for the mortgage over the remaining term of your mortgage

yea i pretty much the same but i 'd argue that if you play a record in a room with large speakers then you can get some or feedback effects on the actual turntable and/or needle       this can be annoying or pleasant depending on what kind of music you are playing of course but i kind of like when it happens at bass or lower mid range frequencies     of course this all depends on size and shape of the room volume the music is played position of the speakers what kind of furniture the actual turntable is on     it 's kind of similar to how different kick drum setups can sound different very different rooms well smaller rooms at least you do n't as interesting and effects as the space gets large with drums

an example where i live when you buy a house the seller wants black money this is because that way the seller pays less taxes however it 's not smart for the buyer to pay in black as the tax reductions are lower eventually when the buyer tries to sell the house he has to declare the difference so a higher buy price should not have affected apart from the notary minutes

403b plans are used by school districts colleges and universities nonprofit hospitals charitable foundations and the like for their employees while 401k plans are used by most everybody else i would suspect that a school district etc can use a 401k plan instead of a 403b plan if it chooses to do so but the reverse direction is most likely forbidden a for profit company can not use a 403b plan one difference between a 403b plan and a 401k plan is that the employer can choose to offer and the employee can choose to purchase stock in the company inside the 401k plan this option obviously is not available to charities etc which do n't issue stock your comment that the 403b plan invests solely in variable annuities suggests that the plan administrator is an insurance company   and that the employer is moving to more modern version that allows investments in mutual funds and the like forty years ago my 403b plan was like that the only investment choice was an annuity but some time in the 1980s the investment choices were to include mutual funds possibly because the 1986 tax reform act changed the rules governing 403b plans   so are you sure that your employer is changing from a 403b plan to a 401k plan or is it just a change of 403b plan administrator from the insurance company to another administrator who offers investment choices other than an annuity note of course that insurance companies have changed their options too for example tiaa the teachers insurance and annuity association which was the 403b plan administrator for many schools and colleges became tiaa cref college retirement equities fund where the cref mutual funds actually were pretty good investments

a qualifying distribution seems guaranteed to fall under long term capital gains but a disqualifying distribution could also fall under long term capital gains depending on when it is sold so what 's the actual change that occurs once something becomes a qualifying as opposed to a disqualifying distribution yes a qualifying distribution always falls under long term capital gain the difference between qualifying and disqualifying is how the bargain element of benefit is calculated in case of disqualifying distribution it is always the discount offered irrespective of the final sale price of the stock in case of qualifying distribution it is lower of actual discount or profit thus if you sell the stock at same price or slightly lower price than the price on exercise date your bargain element is less this is not the case with disqualifying distribution

there are those who are knowledgable in real estate who offer rules of thumb do n't pay more that 50x the rent for the house here $ 972 x 50 is $ assume half the rent goes to expenses so from $ 972 you net $ and after that mortgage you have $ 111 in profit zillow usually assumes 20 down here $ 20k. so you are seeing a return on your 20k. plus appreciation and principal paydown   for the record i just bought a 3 family under renovation now expecting total cost to be $ 160 k and total rent $ 2500 i missed ratio a by a bit but $ 1250 to go toward a $ 120 k mortgage works out fine $ 550 profit mo on the 25 down $ 40 k by the way a turnover of tenants can cost a a month of no rent b a cost to the real estate agent if you use one and the cost to paint repair this is generally considered 10 so if the 50 of rent seemed high here 's 10 of it

these sort of issues in structuring your personal finances relative to expenses can get complicated quickly as your example demonstrates   i would recommend a solution that reduces duplication as much as and depending on what information you 're interested in tracking you could set it up in very different ways one solution would be to create virtual sub accounts of your assets and to record the source of money rather than the destination   thus when you do an expense report you can limit on the his or hers asset accounts and see only the expenses which pertain to those accounts likewise for liabilities credit cards if on the other hand you 're more interested in a running sum of rather than create me and spouse accounts at every leaf of the expense tree it would make much more sense to create top level accounts for expenses his etc and expenses hers etc   using this model you could create only the sub expense accounts that apply for each of your spending with matching account structures for common accounts

swimming clubs exist    treat it as a start up business and it 's easier to figure out    once you know about what people are willing to pay to join you know about how much you can spend    our family business invites tenants to use a private pool located at one of our properties we maintain the facility and have appropriate signs posted and a balloon insurance policy specifically for the pool in 1975 the pool cost 25,000 to install and we spend about $ to operate and heat it each season    the downside is that there is likely a lot less support for the idea than you think you 're going to have to limit access to it with a membership and that 's going to be a pain to figure out because it will almost certainly require an employee or a very expensive electronic access control   you ca n't really open it up to the entire community without some sort of contract or no one has an incentive to pay every time a home sells in the community you either lose a customer or gain a headache if you do n't have some sort of deed restriction or membership fee

besides all of the other answers i will point out that many people simply do n't have enough cash sitting around to buy a home outright   it would take many years or even decades for the average family to accumulate the necessary cash also while you are pinching your pennies for years in an attempt to save up for your dream house remember that inflation is steadily driving up the cost of goods and services   a house that costs $ 200 k today could cost $ 230 k in 5 years due to inflation

it 's possible   our healthcare systems is a serious mess but universal healthcare could also make things worse   the problem is that our healthcare system is by a of regulations neither guarantee care to the most vulnerable nor allow the market mechanisms to work   the mises institute has a few good pieces on this here 's blog how government regulations made healthcare so expensive but to put it very simply the issue is we are letting bureaucrats run our healthcare instead of leaving medical choices to physicians     i 'd wager that nz physicians have greater freedom to practice than us ones but that 's only a guess   that 's the key though   medical choices need to be left up to doctors and patients whether we adopt a market oriented system or a universal care scheme   if this is n't done quality of care will be poor and costs direct or indirect will be high   at the end of the day we could screw up either approach     i will say that i 've read rand paul 's imo media doc not the current republican plan and it seems like a good example of practical market reforms

you left out the part where i said cities use it as a source of revenue meaning there are two factors at play the city limiting the number of medallions drives up their auction price because there 's high demand and the cab companies trying to extract enough profit from the medallion to be worth it the city decides how many medallions to release just like in nyc they auction off permits for hot dog vendors which are ironically similarly priced imagine for a moment they gave vendor licenses to everyone who wanted to open a stand in central park you would n't even be able to see the park   i would n't really say it 's fair to call it a stranglehold more of wringing the last drop out of because you 're dying of thirst   personally i think the medallion model is bullshit in that sense i 'm all for a regulated free market where supply and demand find an equilibrium within the rules in reality you only find the medallion model in large markets which is n't really representative of the taxi industry as a whole

am i on crack or do the perceived tax savings via s corp    distributions really not matter at a certain level of business income you 're not on crack generally if all the income is generated by your own personal services this is the outcome the benefit of s corp is when you have employees who generate your income and you distribute to yourself profits that come out of other 's personal services in this case your distributions are exempt from fica since it is not in fact a self employment income you 'd still have to pay yourself a reasonable salary for your position as a manager officer but it would n't have to cover all of the available profits so if the irs takes a position against you it would be that your salary should be to include the whole profits since it is the compensation to you for the personal services that produced the income to the corporation you in many cases they might agree that a salary at the ss maximum limit would be reasonable but that 's only a speculation of mine in that case you might gain some portion of the medicare tax with the recent law changes at the levels you 're talking about you 'll pay some medicare anyway there are a lot of accountants who take more aggressive position saying that not all of the distributions are liable for se taxes even if you 're the sole employee of the corporation these cases often end up in the tax court and whatever the outcome your legal fees become higher than the fica savings what is probably missing in your picture is the ss limit of currently $ 112 k above which you do n't pay social security tax so whether you get it as a salary or as a distribution that limit is the same that is why you do n't see a significant difference i know there are a lot of accountants who 'd disagree but i would argue that for a sole employee of your company s corp does n't provide significant benefits over the disregarded llc taxation but has some additional overhead that adds to your expenses here 's a link to a lawyer 's blog where he suggests and says many accountants follow 60/40 division between salary and distributions i.e. his take similarly to mine is that most of the earnings have to be treated as salary in your case when the total is about 300 k you indeed will not get any fica savings with such a division other than some of the medicare   unusually low wages when compared to distributions can draw unwanted    irs scrutiny and an audit an unfavorable audit will likely result in    some portion of the distributions being reclassified as earned income    for federal income tax purposes which results in a deficiency    assessment i.e. a tax bill interest on those unpaid taxes and irs    penalties the article also talks about the watson case one of the tax court cases i referred to which can be used as the guidelines for determining the reasonable compensation talk to your tax adviser i 'm neither a tax adviser nor a tax professional for a tax advice contact a cpa ea licensed in your state this is not a tax advice just my personal opinion

td will only sell the stock for you if there 's a buyer there was a buyer for at least one transaction of at least one stock at but who said there were more obviously the stocks later fell i.e. there were not that many buyers as there were sellers what i 'm saying is that once the stock passed reached the limit the order becomes an active order but it does n't become the only active order it is added to the list and to the bottom of that list obviously in this case there were not enough buyers to go through the whole list and get to your order and since it was a limit order it would only execute with the limit price you put once the price went down you got out of luck   that said there could of course be a possibility of a system failure but given the story of the market behavior it just looks like you and lost on a bet

note the main trade off here is the costs of holding cash rather than being invested for a few months vs trading costs from trading every month   let 's start by understanding investing every month vs every three months   first compare holding cash for two months at for most canadians right now and then investing on the third month vs being invested in a single stock etf ~5 annually   at those rates she is forgoing equity returns of around   these costs and the $ 10 for one big trade give total costs of $ dollars    if you were to trade every month instead there would be no cost for not being invested and the trading costs over three months would just be   so in this case it would be better to trade monthly instead of every three months however i 'm guessing you do n't trade all $ 2000 into a single etf   the more etfs you trade the more trading more infrequently would be an advantage   you can redo the above calculations the amount across more etfs and including the added trading costs to get a feel for what is best   you can also rotate as suggests but that can leave you unbalanced temporarily if not done carefully   a second option would be to find a discount broker that allows you to trade the etfs you are interested in for free   this is not always possible but often will be for those investing in index funds   for instance i trade every month and have no brokerage costs dollar cost averaging and value averaging are for people investing a single large amount instead of regular monthly amounts   unless the initial amount is much much larger than the monthly amounts this is probably not worth considering edit hopefully the above edits will clarify that i was comparing the costs including the forgone returns of trading every 3 months vs trading every month

private investors as mutual funds are a minority of the market   institutional investors make up a substantial portion of the long term holdings   these include pension funds insurance companies and even corporations managing their money as well as individuals rich enough to actively manage their own investments    from business insider with some aggregation    numbers do n't add to 100 because of rounding   also i pulled insurance out of household because it 's not household managed   another source is the tax policy center which shows that about 50 of corporate stock is owned by individuals 25 and individually managed retirement accounts 25    another issue is that household can be a bit confusing   while some of these may be people choosing stocks and investing their money this also includes employee stock ownership plans esop and company founders   for example jeff bezos owns about 17 of amazon.com according to wikipedia   that would show up under household even though that is not an investment account   jeff bezos is not going to sell his company and buy equity in an index fund    anyway the most generous description puts individuals as controlling about half of all stocks   even if they switched all of that to index funds the other half of stocks are still owned by others   in particular about 26 is owned by institutional investors that actively manage their portfolios    in addition day traders buy and sell stocks on a daily basis not appearing in these numbers   both active institutional investors and day traders would hop on stocks either shorting the overvalued or buying the undervalued    it does n't take that much of the market to control prices so long as it is the active trading market   the passive market does n't make frequent trades   they usually only need to buy or sell as money is invested or withdrawn   so while they dominate the ownership stake numbers they are much lower on the trading volume numbers    tl;dr   there is more than enough active investment by organizations or individuals who would not switch to index funds to offset those that do   unless that changes this is not a big issue

basically speaking japanese bank accounts are identified by three numbers the four digit bank number   for example is mitsubishi tokyo bank the three digit branch number for example = main branch for mitsubishi the account number   this is your account number your atm cash card and passbook will have these numbers on it in the format xxxx    when you use an atm to send money to someone else like your landlord you but in these three numbers or use the search feature instead for the first two   this works the same whether you are talking about mitsubishi etc   the only thing to note is that while real banks use locations for the branch number i.e. branch branch etc online only banks like sony bank bank sbi etc use fake locations like colors etc   this does n't matter much though japan post bank is technically not a bank and uses a totally different system though recently they have come up with a strange formula to convert your jp bank account number into a normal bank account number so you can send payments to it as shown above all of this is basically for domestic transfers only though   if you want to transfer money internationally there are two basic ways the official way   go to your bank overseas and give them the swift code and account code for your bank likely the branch code will be necessary as well   the problem here is that they will likely charge a high fee for sending the money and your bank in japan may also charge a high fee for receiving it   in addition to any currency conversion fees   a second problem is that only the very major banks even have swift codes use a money transfer service that can handle both japan and your other country   for example you can use 2 paypal accounts only in the direction of from japan to overseas though or you can use something like either way iban is a european standard and is n't used in japan if you just want to spend some money in japan the most convenient way is probably a foreign visa debit card   or you can use a foreign atm card in japan to withdraw cash and then deposit it into your japanese account

depending on your strategy it could be though there is also something to be said for what kind of order are you placing market limit or otherwise something else to consider is whether or not there is some major news that could cause the stock etf to gap at the open   for example if a company announces strong earnings then it is possible for the stock to open higher than it did the previous day and so a market order may not to take into account that the stock may jump a bit compared to the previous close   limit orders can be useful to put a cap on how much you 'll pay for a stock though the key would be to factor this into your strategy of when do you buy

it 's wrong in several situations   one the business owner counts this as a business expense which it is not and therefore reduces the company 's profit and taxes that would be tax avoidance and probably criminal   two someone who is not the sole owner counts this as a business expense which it is not reduces the company 's profit and when profits are shared the company pays out less money to the other owners that 's probably fraud   third if the owner or owners of a limited liability company draw out lots of money from the company with the intent that the company should go bankrupt with tons of debt that the owners are not going to pay while keeping the money they off for themselves that would probably bankruptcy fraud   apart from being wrong there is the obvious risk that you lose control over your company 's and your own expenses and might be in for a nasty surprise if the company has to pay out money and there 's nothing left that would be ordinary stupidity if you have to tell your employees that you ca n't pay their salaries but offer them to admire your brand new ferrari that 's something i 'd consider deeply unethical

the answer to your question is very simple the preauth and the shipment of the goods have no connection within the credit card system it is possible to process a payment that does not cancel a preauthorization this is needed for the case where you place two orders and the one you placed second ships first a preauth can remain active for some time unless it is captured or cancelled so in your case a preauth was placed and remained active that you were shipped and billed for some goods had no effect on the preauth because one side or the other failed to attach them

i fear this question may be impossible to answer beyond the options you already seem to know about   it depends too much on the details of your situation some of which you say you do n't know   if you do n't even know how much debt you have i think you 're going to need some kind of professional advice to assess your situation   one place to start is the national foundation for credit counseling   this organization can provide free or low cost advice about your situation including bankruptcy options that said the main missing piece i see in your question is your expenses   the first thing you should ask yourself is what am i spending money on and can i stop spending on money on that in order to save and/or pay off debt instead   you say that you can live comfortably paycheck to paycheck and routinely put money into savings   can you start living and thus put a lot more into savings or towards debt repayment   whether this will work or not depends on how much debt you have but it definitely needs to be part of your thought process likewise if you continually are wiped out by expenses start budgeting for them

problem with deciding investments in a company is that you have multiple potential options each with their projected returns but each also has some hard to estimate risks a further problem is that these opportunities arrive one by one so you usually can not compare project a vs. project b to decide which one is better the internal rate of return is a rule of thumb like way to make these decisions the company board may set an irr target of e.g. 15 and each executive will compare their projects against that target they 'll execute only the projects that are projected to give a good return but some of these projects will end up failing thus the real average profit will not be equal to irr important thing is that this target number gives ways to compare projects and also for the board to control the investments if the company has a good track record of being successful at projects the board might set an irr target of 10 and expect to get e.g. 8 return on their investment however if the company has a much larger risk of projects failing they might demand a predicted irr of 20 to account for the risk ultimately if the irr target is set too high the company will find no projects it considers profitable to invest in in practice if this happens the company owners are better off taking out the cash as dividends and investing it elsewhere

it 's what modern advertising is based on they 're not selling you a product they 're selling you a new you modern advertising is based on the erroneous assumption that by buying the product your personality and lifestyle will improve and the customer believes he she is entitled to the lifestyle they see people in the commercial enjoying by buying the product at least subconsciously they think that it 's not logical but look at how many commercials barely feature the product or its benefits at all but instead focus on the customers of the product looking cool and popular and successful   having the logo of the brand of clothing that you bought prominently displayed on the clothing lets everyone else know how you see yourself and what lifestyle you want for yourself that 's why so many people are eager to pay to advertise a corporation 's brand

if you are looking for money to speculate in the capital markets then your brokers will already lend to you at a much more favorable rate than an outside party will for instance with $ 4,000 you could easily control $ 40,000 with many brokers at a 1 interest rate this is 10:1 leverage much like how us banks operate every dollar that you deposit with them they speculate with 10x as much interactive brokers will do this for you with your current credit score they are very reputable and clear through goldman sachs so although reputable is subjective in the investment banking world you wo n't have to worry the federal government raiding them or anything if you are investing in currencies than you can easily do 50:1 leverage as an american or as anyone else this means with only $ 400 dollars you can control $ 40,000 account if you are investing in the futures market then there are many many ways to double and triple and quadruple your leverage at the lowest interests rates any contract you enter into is a loan from the market you have to understand that if you did happen to have $ 40,000 of your own money then you could get $ account size for speculating at 1 interest again these are quick ways to lose your money and owe a lot more so i 'd really advise against it a margin call in the futures market can destroy you i advise you to just think more efficiently until you come up with a way to earn that much money initially and then speculate

my biggest concern with this plan is that there 's no going back should you decide that it is not going to work either due to the strain on the relationship or for some other reason    if you were borrowing from a relative in place of a mortgage or a car loan you can always refinance and might just pay a little more interest or closing costs from a bank   student loans are effectively unsecured so your only option for a refinance would be to get a personal unsecured loan or borrow against existing collateral if you have it you are going to have a tough time getting another 50k unsecured personal loan at anywhere near student loan rates    the other negative aspects overall risk of borrowing from family loss of possible tax deduction make this plan a no go for me i 'm not saying that it 's always a good idea to borrow from family for homes or cars only that there 's at least an exit plan should you both decide it was a bad idea

i actually had a similar situation when i tried to buy my house i paid off all my loans and was proud of my debt free status i had no car note no student loans absolutely no debt but i did have a bank issued credit card usaa not chase but i assume the same may apply    when i tried to get a home loan they told me i had absolutely no information on my credit report aka i had no credit the mortgage lender had no idea what was going on nor did i or anybody else it took a lot of research before i realized that the credit bureaus use a formula for the credit rating that involves a lot of things but if you have n't had a current line of credit reported to the agency in over a year maybe it was longer i did n't have anything for 3 years you are n't going to have a credit score    because i was debt free i was also credit report free and eventually the credit bureaus had nothing to go on and my score disappeared the bank issued credit card was on my credit report but they did n't report monthly balances so the bureaus could n't use it to determine if i was paying off the card or if i even had a balance on it it was essentially not doing my credit any favors despite what i had thought in short based on the fact that you have no debt in her name and you have taken on all debt in your own name its very plausible that she has no credit rating anymore it wo n't take long to get it back once you have anything on your credit that 's actually reported the formula can kick back in and look at credit history as well as current credit and she 'll be fine

actually asking to be refinanced at a lower rate is asking them to forgive give up part of the mortgage    either my knowledge of finance is wrong or how interest rates work is wrong if that statement is true    here is why your statement is not true   the interest rate is money the bank makes on the loan    for example say you buy a home valued at $ 250,000 put 10 down and your interest rate is 5 for 30 years    well now you 've got a mortgage $ 225,000 that you pay $ monthly now expand this out to 30 years which means you 'll make 360 payments for a total balance of $ so even though you have a mortgage of $ 225,000 and your home is only valued at $ 250,000 due to the interest rate on that loan you will   be giving the bank $ in profit for that $ 225,000 loan    refinancing the loan at a lower rate is not debt forgiveness or a write off    greed in getting themselves into upside down mortgages are why we have problems not the banks not helping them out enough   actually it 's the bank 's greed which is wanting to keep the homeowner at the higher interest rate because it will make them more money over the long run if the bank was to reduce the interest rate on the loan they would be reducing their potential profits    and now you know why i support non profit banks

i am strongly skeptical of this   in fact after reading your question i did the following i wrote a little program in python that a stock by flipping a coin each time the coin comes up heads the stock 's value grows by 1 each time the coin comes up tails the stock 's value drops by 1   i then group say 50 of these steps into a day and for each day i look at opening closing maximum and minimum this is then in a candlestick chart   funny enough those things look exactly like the charts analysts look at here are a few examples     if you want to be a troll show these to a technical analyst and ask them which of these stocks you should sell short and which of them you should buy you can try this at home i posted the code here and it only needs python with a few extra packages and should both be in the package in reply to a comment from joetaxpayer let me add some more theory to this my code actually performs a one dimensional random walk now joe in the comments says that an infinite number of flips should approach the zero line but that is not exactly correct in fact there is a high chance to end up far from the zero line because the expected distance from the start for a random walk with n steps is   what does indeed approach the zero line is if you took a bunch of these random walks and then performed the average over those there is however one important aspect in which this random walk differs from the stock market the random walk can go down as far as it likes whereas a stock has a bottom below which it can not fall reaching this bottom means the company is bankrupt and gets removed from the market this means that the total stock market which we might interpret as a sum of random walks does indeed have a bias towards upwards movement since i 'm only averaging over those random walks that do n't go below a certain threshold but you can really only benefit from this effect by being broadly diversified

what you charge them depends on what kind of use you want them to have of the house   your use of the term roommate implies you 're imagining well a roommate type situation where everyone has full access to all common areas   this is the usual situation when multiple people jointly rent a house that none of them owns   in this situation all the roommates are essentially equals but if you own the house and are renting it out you can do whatever you want   a lot of people would not look for roommates but for or tenants you rent one room to a person and you decide what the terms are for their use of the rest of the house   that means you get to decide if when they use the kitchen if when they get to use your dishes what they can do in the back yard etc   in this situation the roommates are not your equals   you own the property and you set the terms for everyone else   to clarify after reading the other answer by not your equals i do n't mean to imply that renters are n't equal as human beings to the landlord or should be treated as lowly peasants or anything like that   i just mean that they need not have equal decision making powers with regard to the housing itself i would say the big difference is the social dynamic personally i would n't feel comfortable renting out rooms to roommates unless i was quite sure i would get along with them basically the kind of people i would actually rent with not just rent to if you do rent roommate style and everyone has essentially equal access to all the facilities of the house i 'd say it 's reasonable to split all house expenses roughly equally with perhaps some adjustments for differences in amenities like if one person has a larger bedroom than others   if you rent tenant style where you 're not expecting them to be your buddies the best way to determine a reasonable rent is to find other people renting similar rooms and see how much they 're charging   craigslist is a great way to do that you can also ask around to people you know

remember that long term appreciation has tax advantages over short term dividends if you buy shares of a company never earn any dividends and then sell the stock for a profit in 20 years you 've essentially deferred all of the capital gains taxes and thus your money has compounded faster for a 20 year period for this reason i tend to favor non dividend stocks because i want to maximize my long term gain another example in estate planning is something called a step up basis

it 's not like most of the people working there will care if obama loses his job the chief position of a government agency who is selected by potus often is n't a person liked by the rest of the agency and they could n't care less if he was changed in 2013   for example in the cia the director was always chosen by the president and thusly the rest of the cia usually do n't fully respect them since they are just some random person from outside the agency who was put into power for political reasons they do n't like the director and likewise do n't care if potus changes and the director gets fired by the new guy    my point is that entire government agencies are not lying and cheating just to keep obama in office just because the director was appointed by obama does n't mean the entire organization will lie to help obama    i mean what if romney gets elected will the entire agency and it 's hundreds thousands of employees now immediately do a 180 and lie and cheat to keep romney in power the same workers that were doing illegal things to help obama and now going to on a whim break laws to help romney    these agencies are not machines they are made of hundreds of real people each with their own views just because obama chose the director does n't mean all those people are now his slaves willing to lie and cheat to help him    what 's to stop one of them from leaking the story to the media i would think there has to be at least one republican working there if the director told everyone that this quarter they were all going to lie to help obama stay in power pretty sure any republicans in the agency would leak that to the media if that story got out obama would be    no way the entire agency would go forward with a lie to help obama

the fact that your ex is on the mortgage limits their ability to get more loans while you have been making the payments on time if you had any problems making those payments it would have also impacted their credit score it is understandable that they would like to be released from the mortgage the options that they have are limited you would have to refinance the mortgage lenders do n't just drop borrowers from a mortgage unless they have determined that the remaining people on the mortgage can make the payments besides the mortgage ownership documents were probably filed with the local government the refinancing process will require a signature by your ex unless the earlier agreement documents removed your ex as an owner and those were filed with the authorities regarding an exchange of funds it can be negotiated an attempt was done with the earlier agreement if the documents that were signed are proof of the agreement ca n't be determined by the internet how this is settled is outside the scope of this site it depends on what documents have been signed in the past the jurisdiction involved and the state of the relationship at the time of the purchase and at the time of the refinancing

the answer is there are a lot of answers it always seems so daunting to start saving when you 're living paycheck to paycheck and anticipate more bills on the way kids are expensive start small and make it automatic if you can if you can take $ 25 out of every paycheck and put it into a savings account and do this automatically using your bank 's bill pay system that will go a long way it 's about setting up a new habit for yourself and increasing as you can one way i 've heard it phrased is pay yourself first   do n't set unrealistic expectations for yourself either you need to start building a savings account to cover emergencies not just future purchases if something happens and you ca n't get a paycheck for a week a month 2 months how will you pay your bills set up a savings account just for that purpose and do n't touch it unless it 's a true emergency there are several banks out there that will let you set up multiple savings accounts and mark them for specific purposes like capitalone 's 360 accounts set one up for the emergency account that gets your automatic per paycheck deposit then set up another one for fun money or new home fund or whatever else you want to save up for   starting the savings process is hard no doubt about it you need to learn how to budget with the money you have after paying yourself first but the important part is to stick with it consider your savings account as another mandatory utility you have to pay it $ or risk i do n't know a smack on the back of the head if you wait until the end of the month to see what you have left after everything else you 'll find you do n't have anything left if you can set it up through your bank so when you get your paycheck it automatically puts $ 25 into a savings account then you 'll never have that $ 25 burning a hole in your pocket if your paychecks are n't direct deposit and you 're physically cashing them when you receive them then tell the bank teller to put $ 25 into your savings account   you can do it make sure your wife is on board and you communicate the importance of setting up a savings account and work together to make it happen be patient and realize that $ 25 may seem like a trivial amount to put away now but after 24 paychecks 1 year depending on pay schedule that 's $ 600 plus interest but rates are too low now to worth noting that

you did n't have a situation of excess contribution if you have proof that someone in fidelity actually told you what you said you might try to recover some of your losses through a lawsuit however their first and main defense would be that they 're not in the business of providing tax advice and it is your problem that you asked random person a tax question and then acted on an incorrect answer by the way that only goes to say that anything you might read here you should as well take with a grain of salt the only one who can give you a tax advice is a licensed tax professional i explained it in details in my blog post but in short it is either an ea enrolled agent with the irs credentials or a cpa certified public accountant or attorney licensed in your state back to your question excess contribution to a ira is when you contribute in excess to the limits imposed for traditional ira in 2012 the limit was $ 5000 you contributed $ 4000 this means that you were not in excess there 's nothing they can correct the 1099-r you got seems to be correct and in order what you did have was a case of non deductible contribution non deductible contribution to your ira should have been reported to the irs on form 8606 non deductible contribution creates basis in your ira withdrawals from your ira are prorated to the relation of your basis to your total value and the taxable amount is determined based on that rate it is also calculated using form 8606 so in short you should have filed a form 8606 with your 2012 tax return declaring non deductible ira and creating $ 4000 basis and then form 8606 with your 2013 tax return calculating which portion of the $ 4000 you withdrew is non taxable if your total ira in all accounts was that $ 4000 then nothing would be taxable talk to a tax adviser you might need to amend your 2012 return or send the 2012 form separately if possible and then do some math on your 2013 return if 60 days have n't passed you might want to consider depositing the $ 4000 in a roth ira and perform what is called conversion

if you are tax resident in the us then you must report income from sources within and without the united states   your foreign income generally must be reported to the irs   you will generally be eligible for a credit for foreign income taxes paid via form 1116 the question of the stock transfer is more complicated but revolves around the beneficial owner   if the stocks are yours but held by your brother it is possible that you are the beneficial owner and you will have to report any income there is no tax for bringing the money into the us   as a us tax resident you are already subject to income tax on the gain from the sale in india   however if the investment is held by a separate entity in india which is not a us domestic entity or tax resident then there is a separate analysis   paying a dividend to you of the sale proceeds or part of the proceeds would be taxable   your sale of the entity containing the investments would be taxable   there are look through provisions if the entity is foreign de facto us such as a f   there are ways to structure that transaction that are not taxable such as making it a bona fide loan which is enforceable and you must pay back on reasonable terms   but if you are holding property directly not through a foreign separate entity then the sale triggers us tax the transfer into the us is not meaningful for your taxes except for reporting foreign accounts please review publication 519 for general information on taxation of resident aliens

you are correct that 20 has an impact on your interest rate although it is not always hugely significant   you would have to do your own shopping around to find that information out   however 20 has an impact that i consider to be far more important than your monthly payment and that is in your equity   if the dc market tanks which i know it has not really done like much of the country but none of us have crystal balls to know if it will or not then you will be more easily underwater the less you put down   conversely putting 20 or more down makes you an easy sell to lenders means that you do n't have to worry nearly so much about having to do a short sale in the future i would never buy a house with less than 20 down personally and have lived well below my means to get there but i am not you with regards to mortgages the way that i found information that i needed was to get books from the library that explained the mortgage process to me   when it came time to select an actual broker i used my realtor 's recommendation because i trusted my realtor to actually have my interests at heart because he was an old family friend you ca n't usually do that so i do n't recommend it and that of others i knew who had bought recently   i compared four lenders and competed them against each other to get the best terms   they will give you estimate sheets that help you weigh not only rates but costs of different fees such as the origination fee and discount points   make sure to know what fees the lender controls and what fees s)he does n't so that you know which lines to actually compare beyond a lender make sure that before closing you have found a title company that you think is a good choice your realtor or lender will try to pick one for you because that 's the way the business is played but it is a racket pick one who will give you the best deal on title a company may be title company lender or other that wo n't charge you an excessive amount a survey company that you like if required in dc for your title insurance and homeowner 's insurance coverage that you think is a good deal   the time between contract and closing is short and nobody tells you to research all the closing costs that on a $ 500,000 place run to in excess of $ 10,000 but you should   also know that your closing costs will be about 2 of the purchase price and plan accordingly in general take some time to educate yourself on as well as neighborhoods and price ranges   do n't rush into this process or you will lose a lot of money fast

most markets around the world have been for the last 6 to 10 months the definition of a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs and until you get a higher low and confirmation with a higher high the downtrend will continue if you look at the weekly charts of most indexes you can determine the longer term trend if you are more concerned with the medium term trend then you could look at the daily charts so if your objective is to try and buy individual stocks and try to make some medium to short term profits from them i would start by first looking at the daily charts of the index your stock belongs to only buy when the intermediate trend of the market is moving up higher highs and higher lows   you can do some brief analysis on the stocks your interested in buying and two things i would add to the short list in your question would be to check if earnings are increasing year after year the second thing to look at would be to check if the earnings yield is greater than the dividend yield that way you know that dividends are being paid out from current earnings and not from previous earning or from borrowings you could then check the daily charts of these individual stocks and make sure they are uptrending also buy uptrending stocks in an uptrending market before you buy anything write up a trading plan and develop your trading rules for example if price breaks through the resistance line of a previous high you will buy at the open of the next day have your money management and risk management rules in place and stick to your plan you can also do some backtesting or paper trading to check the validity of your strategy a good book to read on money and risk management is trade your way to financial freedom by van tharp your aim should not be to get a winner on every trade but to let your winners run and keep your losses small

if the mortgage is against your primary residence then the only part that 's probably deductible is the mortgage interest   if you pay down your loan principal faster then all other things being equal you 'll get less of a tax deduction because you 'll accrue less interest in the months after you throw a big chunk at the principal the principal is less so the interest is less but do n't worry that 's all right   it 's a tax deduction so your actual tax savings will be only a fraction of the interest you paid so at the end of the day you 'll be saving yourself money

the basic problem here is that you need to have money to invest before you can make a profit from it   now if you have say $ 500 k or more you can put that in mutual funds and live modestly off the profits   if you do n't have that $ 500 k to start out with you 're either looking at a long time frame to accumulate it say by working a job for 30 + years and contributing the max to your 401k or are playing the market trying to get it   the last is essentially gambling though with somewhat better odds than casinos or horse racing and puts you up against the gambler 's ruin problem you also i think have a very mistaken idea about the a typical investor 's lifestyle   take for instance the best known one warren buffet   no offence to him but from everything i 've read he lives a pretty boring life   spends all day reading financial reports and what sort of life is that as for flying places being exciting ever tried it   i have with scientific conferences but i expect are much the same and it is boring   flying at 30,000 ft is boring and if it 's a commercial flight unpleasant as well   a conference room in london paris or is exactly the same as a conference room in iowa   even the cities outside the conference rooms are much of a these days you can eat at mcdonalds in paris or shanghai   only way to find interest is to take time from your work to get outside the conference rooms commercial districts and then you 're losing money

the real value of a share of stock is the current cash value of all dividends the owner will receive plus the current cash value of the final liquidation if any   since people with different needs may judge the current cash value of an income stream differently there would be a market basis for people to buy and sell stocks even if everyone could predict all future payouts perfectly if shareholders knew that a company would n't pay any dividends until it was liquidated in the year it would pay $ then each share would in 2016 effectively be a fifty year zero coupon bond with a $ 2000 maturity value   while some investors would be willing to trade in such an instrument the amount of money a company could charge for such an instrument would be far lower than the money it could charge for one with payouts that were more evenly distributed through time since the founders of most companies want their companies to be around for a long time that would mean that shareholders would have no expectation of their shares ever yielding anything of value within any foreseeable timeframe   even those who would be more interested in share price appreciation than dividends would n't be able to see share prices rise if there was n't any likelihood of the stock being bought by someone who wanted the dividends

i do n't think that there is a generic answer that will apply to this question across all goods   the answer depends on how the related businesses work how much insight you have into the true value of the goods and probably other things   your car example is a good one that shows multiple options there are dealers who will buy as a single transaction sell as a single transaction or do a simultaneous sell with trade in   i had a hot tub once on the other hand where i could find people who would do a trade in but there was no dealer who would just buy my used tub   there 's not much parallel between the car and the tub because the options available are very different to the extent that there is a generic answer i generally agree with the point in @keshlam 's answer about trying to avoid but i take a slightly different view   if you want to get your best deal you need to have an idea going into the process of what you want in net and keep focused on meeting your goal if for some reason it 's convenient for the dealer to move money around between the new car and the trade in i 'm ok with that as long as i 'm getting what i want out of the deal   if possible i prefer to deal with both transactions at once because it 's simpler   at the same time i 'm willing to remove the trade in from the deal if i 'm not getting what i want threatening to do so can also give you some information about where the dealer really puts the value between the new car and trade in since if you threaten to pull the trade in the price on the car will probably change in response

i really have to use the business card for personal expenses please assume that in your answer this is very hard to believe you must do that why not just have the company pay you $ 1600 each month then you can use that money for whatever you want why ca n't you do this i can not think of a legitimate reason how to integrate the personal expenses in company anyway to answer your question what i 've done when i accidentally used my corporate card for a personal expense is to code the expense as a payment to me similar to if a check had been written to me if you are n't ever paying yourself then you should just pay the company back the $ 1600 every month as a side note i highly recommend you do n't do this by doing this on a regular basis you are opening the door for piercing the corporate veil this means that the financial protections provided by the llc could potentially be stripped away since personal and corporate funds are being mixed the unfortunate end result is that personal assets could end up being fair game too in a judgement against the company even if you are n't an owner your relative could be considered to be using business money for personal expenses namely letting a relative spend business funds for personal use how to show more expenses and lessen the profit if you 're referring to the personal expenses then you absolutely do not want to do this that 's illegal and worthy of stiff penalties which possibly include jail time for tax evasion better to just have the company pay you and then the entire payment is deductible and reduces the profit of the company

with a check there are limits on cashing the stale check but that is set by the banks involved with a debit card transaction it will be up the the debit card company and your bank imagine a situation where a person finds an old check and tries to cash it at their bank if the bank considers the check stale they might reject it or put a longer hold on the check when the check writers bank gets the transaction they will also decide what to do if they reject it the first bank will reverse the transaction you ca n't count on a 90 day or 180 day limit most banks will ask you to put a stop payment on an old check that you do n't want cashed this is especially important step if you write a replacement check because there is no check number to put a stop payment on in fact the temporary hold will fall off after a few days there does n't appear to be a way to stop an old transaction be careful if you do contact the restaurant you could end up double paying for the meal if they swipe your card again   your best option may be just to keep the transaction as pending

moving your text out of order for i hope clarity   gt because it is a violation of the social contract i 'm quite sure i explained this already multiple times   you 've not explained you just keep repeating your assertion   you say the social contract is x and i ask why must it be x and you respond because the social contract is x.   let me try a different approach   gt because the only modern justification for the existence of a nation is the social contract   i disagree   i think a nation can exist for whatever reason it 's populace decides and today more often than not it includes providing for the welfare of it 's citizens   what do you think prevents a social contract from being so   gt exactly that 's why we have the social contract   great it sounds like you now agree that a modern government is required for capitalism to exist   gt please elaborate as to why that is a problem in the first place   because it makes for an unstable system which will hurt the welfare of the people which is opposed to my definition of the social contract

collective bargaining existed before the government officially granted people that right since collective bargaining would still be legal without the understand that essentially what you 're saying is that you think there should be a law that bars people from negotiating contract as a group in the process making it near impossible have the same resources to help them that the other side has like lawyers analysts economists pr people etc    this would go against of right to freedom of association   i do understand your argument though someone 's private company is their own to do with what they 'd like however we 've been through that in this country and child labor unsafe working conditions and 80 hour weeks having labor laws has proven beneficial for everyone even very weak laws compared with the rest of the industrial world   and raised living standards for millions you may not realize it but you have the labor movement to thank for many of the things that are just expected from employers today benefits holidays weekends safety overtime without the labor movement raising standards in the private sector and pushing for govt regulations our working lives would look very different today   like all laws there is a balance to be struck between individual rights and the common good and what can be seen as a right for one can often be seen as a right to violate another 's rights for someone else do n't people have the right to withhold their work when they feel like their dignity is on not everyone can own a business of their own so are the vast majority of us who will spend our lives working for someone else expected to have as little influence in our working lives as an indentured servant you probably tow the libertarian line however good this sounds on paper it ignores the child of who has to work to feed his her siblings     gt the mighty is those who use the force of government or the threat of violence e.g. violent strikes to prevent another party from exercising their contract liberty and firing them   this is some pretty extreme hyperbole and hard to take seriously as someone who was recently involved in organizing their workplace i can assure you that the deck is definitely stacked in favor of ownership modern anti union strategies are sophisticated and implemented by highly paid experts skilled in using psychological tactics that your average worker just is n't ready for union membership in this country has dwindled to around 10 down from around 50 during the middle of the century and the erosion of the middle class has been the undeniable result    use the force of government you know we may have the right to strike in this country but there 's no law that says a company ca n't hire replacement workers indefinitely plus striking is not a risk free action for someone barely getting by especially when up against people who have enough money for 20 lifetimes   threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here   objectively when you look at the wealth disparity in this country it 's pretty hard to argue that the right to collective bargaining has resulted in an unfair advantage for workers

what an awfully written rambling article i had to scan it a few times just to see if there 's any real information in there seems to try to give the message that start ups are a scam and they 'll just work you to death for very little money while some rich vc guy makes a ton of money   what a of shit   seems like it was written by someone with very little business sense if a start up looks like a good idea with some potential but ca n't afford to pay you much the main priority for you is to get a contract stipulating back end pay and continuing employment being as they have very little money to bargain with you 're in an excellent position to negotiate a good deal   going into a startup without a contract is the height of stupidity

your credit score is definitely affected by the age of your credit accounts so if you frequently close one card and open another new one you 're adversely affecting the overall average age of accounts   this is something to consider and whether it is worth what you 're trying to achieve sometimes if you 're a good customer and are enough you can simply call your credit card company and use the threat of closing your account in favor of another card that offers something attractive to get your current bank to sweeten its incentives to keep your business   i know many people who 've done this with real success and they spare themselves the hassle of obtaining a new card and suffering the short term consequences on their credit report   this might be an avenue worth trying before you just close the account and move on i hope this helps good luck

@joetaxpayer gave a great response to your first question here are some thoughts on the other two 2 transaction fees for mutual funds are tied to the class of shares you 're buying and will be the same no matter where you buy them a shares have a front end load the fee charged and the lowest expenses and can be liquidated without any fees b shares have no up front load but come with a 4 7 year period where they will charge you a fee to liquidate technically called contingent deferred sales charge and slightly higher management fees after which they often will convert to a shares c shares have the highest management fees and usually a to 18-month period where they will charge a small percentage fee if you liquidate there are lots of other share classes available but they are tied to special accounts such as managed accounts and 401-k plans not all companies offer all share classes c shares are intended for shorter timeframes eg 2 5 years a and b shares work best for longer times use a b share if you 're sure you wo n't need to take the money out until after the fee period ends most fund companies will allow you to exchange funds within the same fund family without charging the edit no load funds do n't charge a fee in or out usually they are a great option if they are available to you most self service brokerages offer them few full service brokerages offer them the advantage of a brokerage versus personal accounts at each fund is the brokerage gives you a single view of things and a single statement and buying and selling is easy and convenient 3 high turnover rates in bond funds depending on how actively the portfolio is managed the fund company may deliver returns as a mix of both interest and capital gains and the management expenses may be high with a lot of churn in the underlying portfolio bond values fall as interest rates rise so at least in the usa be prepared to see the share values of the fund fall in the next few years the biggest risk of a bond fund is that there is no maturity date so there is no point in time that you have an assurance that your original investment will be returned to you

gt;this is actual socialism you understand that right did you forget to read the part of socialism that defines it as workers controlling the means of production   this is not socialism socialism is the collective ownership of the means of production i 'm not advocating that   i said the exact opposite i advocate the private ownership of the means of production   i also advocate the distributed private ownership of the means of production   the more capitalists and entrepreneurs the better   the scenario i described helps distribute the means of production to more individuals   and this is also exactly socialism 's end goal   the ends are one thing the means are another

yes the fed has made a point of buying up longer term bonds to push down rates on that part of the curve   that 's not an indication that they 're having problems selling treasuries in fact far from it   but apparently there 's no demand for treasuries and bloomberg is just making up lies to help get obama reelected   are plowing into treasuries at a record pace as the supply of the world ’s safest securities ensuring yields will stay low regardless of whether the federal reserve   more stimulus to fight unemployment buyers bid $ for each dollar of the $ 538 billion in notes and bonds sold this year the most since the government began releasing the data in 1992 and on pace to beat the high of $ in 2011 the net amount of treasuries available will decline by 30 percent once proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested according to data from crt capital group llc

let me offer an anecdote to this   i started helping a woman retired who had been paying $ to get her taxes done as i mentioned in my comment here she got a checklist each year and provided the info requested from where i sat it seemed a clerk entered the info into tax software   as part of the transition to me helping her i asked the prior guy very nice guy really for a quick consult she took the standard deduction but also showed a nice annual donation did n't take advantage of the donate directly from an ira she was over 70 1/2 to save on the tax of this sum that could have saved her $ 500   she was in the 15 bracket with some room left for a roth conversion converting just enough to fill that bracket each year seemed a decent strategy as it would avoid the 25 rate as her rmds rose each year and would push her to 25 to both items the guy suggested that this was not his area he was not a financial planner yes i understand different expertise with how simple her return was i did n't understand the value he added   if you go with a professional be sure you have an understanding of what he will and wo n't do for you
