from the banks point of view the point of a current account like this is to get you as a regular customer they want to be your main bank the bank you interact with the most the bank you turn to first when you need financial products and services the bank whose advertising you see every time you log into online banking or walk into a branch the bank knows that if they just offer the high interest rate or other perks with no strings that people will open the account and dump a bunch of savings in it but wo n't actually move their financial life over their old bank will still be their main bank so they strings like a required minimum deposit a minimum number of direct debits and similar these have minimal effect on people actually using the account as their main current account while being a pain for people trying to game the system of course as you point out it is still possible to game the system but they do n't need to make gaming the system impossible they just need to make it enough that most people wo n't bother

banks are not your friends they are not performing services for you because they like you they are a business and they make money by borrowing money from you at low interest and loaning it out at higher interest they are trying to persuade you to deposit more money however briefly in their bank so they can loan out more money they are probably also counting on the fact that most folks wo n't go to the trouble of setting up accounts at multiple banks with the automatic transfers in order to meet the required deposit threshold that lets them save on the interest payments to consumers that are individually tiny but significant in the aggregate

there are a couple of reasons that a person might choose to use insurance even if they could handle the financial loss if something went wrong they know their risk better than the insurance company while it might seem odd at first glance that an individual can be better at assessing risk than a large company with thousands of actuaries there are limits to the amount of knowledge that an insurance company can have or use to price their insurance products for instance if you were a very aggressive driver but did n't have any recent tickets or accidents because you were in college and did n't have a car on a regular basis but now you have a job and drive 30 miles to work every day you know your risk is relatively high but the insurance company sees you as relatively low risk and are n't able to price that extra risk into your premium just because a person can survive financial after losing something like a car or a house does n't mean it is n't desirable to pay a small price to mitigate that risk if you are using your savings to pay for an emergency then that money needs to be semi liquid in case you need it limiting your investment options where as if you purchase insurance you pay a small amount of money to be able to invest the rest of your money liquidity is a big deal particularly if you are a small business and investing into your business where your money can make your more money but you may or may not be able to access that money very easily

actually most insurance policies don't have a cash value if you do n't make a claim   the reason that some life insurance policies do this is that they are really tax sheltered investments posing as insurance   with that in mind the root of your question is really whether insurance premiums are wasted if you never make a claim it really makes no difference if you are talking about ei auto or homeowner 's insurance my answer to that is no what you are paying for when you buy insurance is financial risk avoidance look at it this way you do n't buy ei as an investment where you hope to get a return on your investment you are buying the right to be protected against catastrophic financial difficulty associated with losing your job whether you claim it or not you did receive that protection this is what drives me so crazy when i hear people talk about how an insurance company is ripping you off because you paid more in premiums than they paid out in benefits of course you did if most people did n't pay in more than the company paid out there would be no financial interest for someone to form an insurance company

the number one rule of thumb that will generally answer the is it taxable question for any money you may have or receive did you pay taxes on it already pretty much any money you actually get in your paycheck dd has already been taxed or at least the projected amount of tax has been withheld is your money to dispense with as you will or according to your pre arranged obligations for most of it deposits paid are one such example if you wrote a check or obtained a money order that they then cashed that 's still your money until it is n't the contract states that it is being held effectively in escrow though the landlord has free use of it so long as he can pony up according to the contract anything not used to pay for damages is yours and you get it back the atm fee refund is trickier but basically this is a benefit offered to you as a service by your bank you front for the atm fees incurred when withdrawing and then those fees are refunded to you by your bank effectively increasing the number of atms you can withdraw from for free as long as there is no net income it 's treated like a mail in rebate you did n't gain any money so there 's nothing new to tax there are a couple of specific exceptions to this otherwise overarching rule of thumb one is roth iras typically on investments you either pay income tax on the money going in and capital gains tax on the money coming out or you pay nothing going in and income tax coming out with a roth however you pay income tax going in and nothing coming out even though you 're eventually getting back more than you put in   another is gifts whoever gave you the gift paid the taxes on it or the money to buy it however if they give you a gift valued more than a certain limit changes every year and there 's a lifetime limit they have to pay an additional gift tax of 35 on any amount over the limit that 's taxing taxed income usually   there are other examples but for the overwhelming majority of situations if it 's money you already had after any and all applicable taxes it 's not taxable even if you have n't seen that money for a while

the correct answer to this question is   the person who the short sells the stock to here 's why this is the case   say we have a who owns the stock and lends it to b who then sells it short to c. after this the price drops and b buys the stock back from d and returns it to a. the outcome for a is neutral   typically stock that is sold short must be held in a margin account the broker can borrow the shares from a collect interest from b and a has no idea this is going on because the shares are held in a street name the brokerage 's name and not a. if a decides during this period to sell the transaction will occur immediately and the brokerage must shuffle things around so the shares can be delivered   if this is going to be difficult then the cost for borrowing shares becomes very high the outcome for b is obviously a profit they sold high first and bought back low afterwards this leaves either c or d as having lost this money   why is n't it d one way of looking at this is that the profit to b comes from the difference in the price from selling to c and buying from d.   d is sitting on the low end and thus is not paying out the profit   d bought low compared to c and this did not lose any money so c is the only remaining choice another way of looking at it is that c actually lost all the money when purchasing the stock   after all all the money went directly from c to b.   in return c got some stock with the hope that in the future c could sell it for more than was paid for it   but c literally gave the money to b so how could anybody else pay the loss another way of looking at it is that c buys a stock which then decreases in value   c is thus now sitting on a loss   the fact that it is currently only a paper loss makes this less obvious if the stock were to recover to the price c bought at one might conclude that c did not lose the money to b.   however in this same scenario d also makes money that c could have made had c bought at d 's price proving that c really did lose the money to b. the final way of seeing that the answer is c is to consider what happens when somebody sells a stock which they already hold but the price goes up who did they lose out on the gain to   the person again is who bought their stock   the person would buys the stock is always the person who the gain goes to when the price appreciates or the loss comes out of if the price falls

for two reasons primarily   for one it is very simply because china is at a different stage in its economic development than the usa that is just a fact   secondly and more the nation of china is experiencing predictable short term gains that are primarily the result of modernization in best practices technical skills and equipment the reality of the chinese economy is that it is mostly fueled by a global need for cheap labor and a lot of it this is many of china 's still 3rd world citizens into modern era industry and production through the many nationalized development and relocation projects taken on by the government these base realities of chinas economic development when set against any relevant metric are in no way indicative of economic success    if anything the growth china is experiencing the ever present reality and impact of driven market based economies in the short term the nation will have increasing challenges and suppressing the nation 's workforce as workers fight for improved workers rights conditions in the long term the nation government will struggle with managing and planning the nation 's inevitable transition into a market based consumer economy as all those workers in turn spend their newly acquired wealth in all truth the chinese government is almost driving growth by sacrificing untold amounts of money and chinese lives to advance an agenda that increases domestic production and attempts to modernize the largely 3rd world population into the 21st century   as a final note the nations concerning disregard in the pursuit of its workforce and domestic production can best be classified as a series of human rights violations especially when considering the impacts and conditions for many in chinas workforce

from what i 've heard in the past debt can be differentiated between secured debt and unsecured debt    secured debt is a debt for which something stands good such as a mortgage on your house   you have a debt but that debt is covered by the value of an asset and if you needed to free yourself of the debt then you could by selling that asset    this is what is known as good debt    unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income   an example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that could n't be sold again to pay off the debt    this is know as bad debt you have to be careful about thinking that house debt is always good debt because the house stands good for it though   the problem with that is that the house could go down in value and then suddenly your good debt is bad debt or no longer secured   cars are very risky this way because they go down in value   it is really easy to get a car loan where before long you are upside down     this is the problem with the term good debt the label makes it sound like it is a good idea to have that debt and the risk associated with having the debt is and allows yourself to feel good about your financial plan   perhaps this is why so many houses are in foreclosure right now people believed the good debt myth and thought that it was ok to borrow more than the home was worth to get into a house   thus they turned a secured debt into an unsecured debt and put their residence at risk by levels of debt they could n't afford other advice i 've heard and tend to agree with is that you should only borrow for a house an education and maybe a car danger on that last one being careful to buy a modest house car etc that is well within your means to repay    so if you do have to borrow for a car go for basic transportation instead of the $ 40,000 bmw   keep you house payment less than of your take home pay pay off the school loans as quickly as possible regardless of the label good bad unsecured secured i think that less debt is better than more debt    there is definitely such a thing as too much good debt

it would essentially make goods from other countries more cheaper than goods from us and it would make imports from these countries to china more expensive   the below illustration is just with 2 major currencies and is more illustrative to show the effect it does not actually mean the goods from these countries would be cheaper 1 gbp = 1.60 usd   1 eur = 1.40 usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd lets say the above are the rates for gbp eur cny the cost of a particular goods assume in international market is 2 usd this means for the cost of manufacturing this should be less than gbp 1.25 in uk less than 1.43 in euro countires less than cny in china only then export would make sense if the real cost of manufacturing is say 1.4 gbp in uk 1.5 eur in euro countires clearly they can not compete and would loose now lets say the usd has appreciated by 20 against other currencies the cny is at same rate 1 gbp = usd 1 eur = usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd now at this rate the cost of manufacturing should be less than gbp gbp less than eur in euro countires in effect this is more than the cost of manufacturing so in effect the goods from other countires have become cheaper and goods from china have become expensive similarly the imports from these countires to china would be more expensive

whether you can establish an hsa has nothing to do with your employment status or your retirement plan it has to do with the type of medical insurance you have   the insurance company should be able to tell you if your plan is hsa compatible to be hsa compatible a plan must have a high deductible in 2014 $ 1250 for an individual plan or $ 2500 for a family plan it must not cover any expenses before the deductible that is you can not have any first dollar coverage for doctor 's visits prescription drug coverage etc there are some exceptions for services considered preventive care there are also limits on the out of pocket max i think that 's it but the insurance company should know if their plans qualify or not if you have a plan that is hsa compatible but also have another plan that is not hsa compatible then you do n't qualify and all that said if you are covered under your husband 's medical insurance and your husband already has an hsa why do you want to open a second one there 's no gain there is a family limit on contributions to an hsa $ in 2014 you do n't get double the limit by each opening your own hsa if you have two hsa 's the combined total of your contributions to both accounts must be within the limit if you have some administrative reason for wanting to keep separate accounts yes you can open your own and in that case you and your husband are each allowed to contribute half the limit or you can agree to some other division   i suppose you might want to have an account in your own name so that you control it especially if you and your husband have different ideas about managing finances though how to resolve such problems would be an entirely different question personally i do n't think the solution is to get into power struggles over who controls what but whatever maybe there 's some advantage to having assets in your own name if you and your husband were to divorce probably not though i think a divorce court pretty much ignores whose name assets are in when dividing up property   see irs publication 969 for lots and lots of details

it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

this depends on the terms and conditions of your ira account and those of the investments you have chosen in general you are better off investing as quickly as is feasible given those terms   money in your cash account does n't earn much of a return so the quicker you get money into something earning a return the better however pay attention to the fees and costs associated with investing   if there is a per transaction fee you may want to consolidate as it may be more efficient to do so after all if you contribute $ 500 at a shot and it costs you $ 5 to make a trade you 're paying 1 off the top to make that trade if you make 11 of them versus 0.1 to make 1 so the question is do you earn that 1 back over the course of the six months   that will depend on what you are investing in    more than likely you 're going to earn more than 1 over the course of the six months so it 's probably worth investing it in pieces still in that situation but if the transaction cost is higher or the time differential lower you may have a less clear cut answer   i invest at vanguard in their funds and have no transaction fees so i have a more obvious answer invest as soon as possible you also need to consider whether you have minimums to pay attention to maybe your investment is something you can only buy whole shares of for example or you might have a much higher fee if you make small transactions   in that case you should wait until you have the minimum to make that transaction if the fee is more than the return you 'll get so the answer is make the transactions as early as you can subject to considering the fees you will pay for making them

as mentioned in other answers the interest you make is negligible and the calculations would depend on the bank in saying that the general trend is calculate daily pay monthly   a typical scenario would be that every night at midnight the interest for your account at that point in time is calculated this occurs every midnight and at the end of the month the sum of those calculations will be added to your account you could have had several significant transactions pass through your account in one day although if the interest is calculated at a specific point in time some transactions may not contribute to any interest these calculations are worth thinking about   even in circumstances of negligible returns as it could assist when considering combining credit cards with home loan offset accounts so it is not a complete waste of time to understand how interest is calculated the more you know

the first question is essentially asking for specific investment advice which is off topic per the faq but i 'll take a stab at 2 and 3 2 if my 401k does n't change before i leave my job not planned in the    near future i should roll it over into my roth ira after i leave due    to these high expense ratios correct my advice is that you should roll over a 401 k into an ira the first chance you get usually when you leave the job 401 k plans are notorious for high expense ratios and why leave your money in a plan where you have a limited choice of investments anyway versus a self directed ira where you can invest in anything you want 3 should i still max contribute with these horrible expense ratios if they are providing a match yes even with the expense ratios it is hard to beat the immediate return of an employer match   if they are n't matching the answer is still probably yes for a few reasons you already are maxing out your ability to contribute to sheltered accounts so assuming you still want to sock away that money for retirement the tax benefits are still valuable and probably offset the expense ratios although you seem to be an exception it is hard for most people to be disciplined enough to put money in a retirement account after they have it in their hands versus auto deduction from paychecks

in case other people arrive at this page wondering whether they should enable automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains for taxable non retirement accounts which is what i was searching for when i first arrived on this page you might want to review and you automatically reinvest the general idea is that assuming you plan to regularly manually rebalance your portfolio to ensure that all of the pieces of the pie are the relative sizes that you want there are approaches you can use to minimize taxes and also fees although at vanguard i do n't think that 's a concern if you choose a cost basis and manual reinvestment then you can go to change your dividends and capital gains distribution elections at

from getting rid of pmi per the federal homeowners protection act you can ask that your pmi be canceled when you 've paid down your mortgage to 80 of the loan if you have a good record of payment and compliance with the terms of your mortgage you make a written request and you show that the value of the property has n't gone down   what 's more when you 've paid down your mortgage to 78 of the original loan the law says that the lender must automatically cancel your pmi so in this case to prove it has n't gone down an appraisal is in order but all of this does n't answer the question the pmi is a separate line item once it 's removed your total monthly payment drops you are welcome to keep it in and indicate it should be a prepayment of principal if that 's your wish but that 's up to you it 's not automatic   in researching this the first time i ran into an article how to calculate pmi costs in which an example is given where a 91 ltv $ 200 k loan has a pmi cost of $ so the impact of not having that extra $ 20 k or so is to pay what amount to an extra 5 on the last $ 20 k of the loan the pmi does n't scale over time when you are $ 10 k away from 80 ltv you still pay the $ 1k yr for this reason if you absolutely must go over 80 ltv i 'd suggest shopping for a bank that will permit the excess to be a home equity loan   at least the payoff of that 2nd loan in totally in your control

it 's been said before but to repeat succinctly a company 's current share price is no more or less than what the market thinks that share is worth as measured by the price at which the shares are being bought and sold as such a lot of things can affect that price some of them material others a common reason to own stock is to share the profits of the company by owning 1 share out of 1 million shares outstanding you are entitled to of that company 's quarterly profits if any these are paid out as dividends two key measurements are based on these dividend payments the first is earnings per share which is the company 's stated quarterly profits divided by outstanding shares with the second being the price earnings ratio which is the current price of the stock divided by its eps your expected yield on this stock is more or less the inverse of this number if a company has a p e ratio of 20 then all things being equal if you invest $ 100 in this stock you can expect a return of $ 5 or 5 1/20 as such changes in the expected earnings per share can cause the share price to rise or fall to maintain a p e ratio that the pool of buyers are willing to tolerate news that a company might miss its profit expectations due to a decrease in consumer demand an increase in raw materials costs labor financing or any of a multitude of things that industry analysts watch can cause the stock price to drop sharply as people look for better investments with higher yields however a large p e ratio is not necessarily a bad thing especially for a large stable company that stability means the company is better able to weather economic problems and thus it is a lower risk now not all companies issue dividends apple is probably the most well known example the company simply retains all its earnings to reinvest in itself this is typically the strategy of a smaller start up whether they 're making good money or not they typically want to keep what they make so they can keep growing and the shareholders are usually fine with that why well because there 's more than one way to value a company and more than one way to look at a stock owning one share of a stock can be seen quite literally as owning a share of that company the share can then be valued as a fraction of the company 's total assets   sounds simple but it is n't because not every asset the company owns has a line in the financial statements a company 's brand name for instance has no tangible value and yet it is probably the most valuable single thing apple owns similarly intellectual property does n't have a book value on a company 's balance sheet but again these are huge contributors to the success and profitability of a company like apple the company is viewed as a center of innovation and if it were not doing any innovating it would very quickly be seen as a middleman for some other company 's ideas and products a company ca n't sustain that position for long even if it 's raking in the money in the meantime overall the value of a company is generally a combination of these two things by owning a portion of stock you own a piece of the company 's assets and also claim a piece of their profits a large company with a lot of material assets and very little debt can be highly valued based solely on the sum of its parts even if profits are lagging conversely a company more or less operating out of a storage unit can have a patent on the cure for cancer and be shoveling money into their coffers with

cfd 's are highly speculative so they should represent a very small proportion of your asset or less if you need the 100 for food or rent then definitely not   however if you have some money spare that you could afford to will definitely need more than 100 and you are prepared to put the time and effort it to learn and manage your risks carefully then there is no reason why you should n't try it   i would advise against trading on a demo account for learning most of what you need to learn is how to stick to your plan while under emotional pressure i also would n't call it gambling but managing risk the best traders only win half of their trades so they might have a losing streak of 5 10 or 20 trades if they are trading 5 of their capital with each trade then poof they 're out their winning trades might make 10 100 times the amount risked so they know that it is more profitable to always only risk around 1 sticking to that requires discipline    this page has a pretty comprehensive introduction

that 's just not how it works i 'm in europe by the way and am actually in the process of hiring someone for my company we know how much we are willing to pay them the pay is pretty good      what we care about the job being done quickly and well      what we could n't give less of shit about and what would get you laughed out of a conference call the person 's life circumstances their heating bill their three kids or anything not strictly related to their role     you put an inordinate amount of value on comfort for the employee but none on the risk that the employer runs employers do n't just drop out of the sky to gift people jobs and money particularly in the case of a franchise which are typically run by small scale and whose risk rises as employees are paid more and are harder to fire strong labor laws are a disincentive to hiring

thanks for your additional comments sam that is helpful here is an overview of what you can and can not do with an fsa as it applies to your situation the government intends that a general health fsa be used to cover expenses that are usually out of pocket when you are covered by a qualifying health plan it is funded with pre tax dollars and is on a use it or lose it basis however an hsa is itself a form of health coverage that is tax advantaged and the balance can be invested because of this an hsa is not considered by the government to be a health plan that qualifies for use with a general health fsa however this means that a given covered person can not have both of these simultaneously in your wife 's case if you have an hsa and she has traditional health benefits with an fsa this is not considered a problem since she can only use the fsa money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan however if she were to join you on the hsa which sounds like it could be a good idea overall she would need to wind down her fsa and would not be able to fund it for the next year this could be a problem if you have a lot of money in the fsa that she is n't able to spend prior to joining the hsa the reason why the government does n't want one given person covered by both an hsa and given access to an fsa at the same time is that they are both tax advantaged what they intend is that people can set aside money pre tax which they will use to pay their non covered health expenses if someone had both there would be two potential problems if you do ultimately want your wife to be on the hsa see if you can spend what is left in her fsa as it will end when she ends her health coverage with her employer if the amount you stand to lose is significant you may need to wait another year until your next open enrollment period or life event such as the birth of a child to enroll her on your hsa it is also likely that her premium on the hsa will be lower which could impact the effect of ending her fsa recently there has also been a rule change regarding what is called a limited use fsa these are fsas that are used for qualifying expenses such as dental and vision that can be used together with an hsa this may be something that is helpful to you and/or your wife on the hsa if your employer offers this as a possibility please note that unlike retirement accounts you can not rollover funds between fsa plans offered by two different employers as each fsa is a separate benefit fund that is on a use it or lose it basis again because the government wants to restrict tax advantaged contributions to what you are likely to spend you may also find the article here helpful to learn more about fsa hsa combinations and limited use fsas i hope this helps

ramsey promotes growth mutual funds and says he can screen out examples of good funds with a solid history of 10 returns in a couple of minutes on morningstar   the 12 in the video is fairly unrealistic but 10 or 8 are realistic especially when you buy into the market every month at all levels rather than chasing winners buying high at 10 you will still get $ 3 million in 40 years and at 8 you 'll get $ 1.5 million you need to make sure you include reinvestment of dividends as well as mere price appreciation in these calculations of returns on investment so yes you could probably drive really nice cars this way without breaking the bank like any financial endeavor this requires hard work patience and discipline the actual work in this case would be fairly minimal in comparison to the patience and discipline if you get really lucky you might end up with millions of dollars 40 years from now if a health disaster job loss children 's college etc strikes then you it might save you from financial ruin both are better than the rat race i agree his predictions are too rosy but this ad is an emotional sales pitch designed to change goals and behavior compare it to the psychology and unrealistic claims in some of the auto commercials you see on tv

the answer is simple you can generally claim a deduction for an expense if that expense was used to derive an income of course social policy sometimes gets in the way and allows for deductions where they usually would n't be allowed your rent is not tax deductible because this expense is not used to derive your income if however you were working from your home example you had a home based business and you dedicated a part of your home for your work say an office then part of your rent may then become tax deductible

the s&p 500 index from 1974 to present certainly looks exponential to me 1974 is the earliest data google has   if you read jeremy siegel 's book there are 200 year stock graphs and the exponential nature of returns on stocks is even more evident   this graph only shows the index value and does not include the dividends that the index has been paying all these years   there is no doubt stocks have grown exponentially aka have grown with compound interest for the past several decades and compounded returns is definitely not a myth   the cagr on the s&p 500 index from 1974 to present has been ^ 1 40 1 here is another way to think about compounded investment growth when you use cash flow from investments dividends capital gains to purchase more investments with a positive growth rate the investment portfolio will grow exponentially   if you own a $ 100 stock that pays 10 dividends per year and spend the dividends every year without reinvesting them then the investment portfolio will still be worth $ 100 after 40 years   if the dividends are reinvested the investment portfolio will be worth $ after 40 years from the many years of exponential growth +

a lot of people use dividend stocks as a regular income which is why dividend stocks are often associated with retirement if your goal is growth and you 're reinvesting capital gains and dividends then investing growth stocks or dividend stocks should have the same effect the only difference would be if you are manually reinvesting dividends which could incur extra trading fees

in addition to the excellent answers here i might suggest a reason for investing in leveraged funds and the original purpose for their existence   lets say you run a mutual fund that is supposed to track the performance of the s&p 500    if you have cash inflows and outflows from your fund due to people investing and selling shares of your fund you may have periods where not all funds are invested appropriately because some of the funds are in cash   lets say 98 of your funds are invested in the securities that reflect the stocks in the s&p 500   you will will miss matching the s&p 500 because you have 2 not invested in some money market account    if you take 1/3 of the cash balance and invest in a triple leveraged fund or take 1/2 of the funds and invest in a double leveraged fund you will more accurately track the index to which your fund is supposed to track   i am not sure what percentage mutual fund owners keep in cash but this is one use that i know these etfs are used for the difference over time that compounding effects have on leveraged funds is called beta slippage there are many fine articles explaining it at you can find one located at this link

in an ideal world say on 24th july the share price of apple was $ 600 everyone knows that they will get the $ 2.65 on 16th august there is not other news that is affecting the price you want to go in and buy the shares on 16th morning at $ 600 and then sell it on 17th august at $ 600 now in this process you have earned sure shot $ or in an ideal world when the announcement is made on 24th july why would i sell it at $ 600 when i know if i wait for few more days i will get $ so i will be more inclined to sell it at $ so on 16th aug after the dividend is paid out the share price will be back to $ in a real world dividend or no dividend the share price would be moving up or down notice that the dividend amount is less than 1 of the stock price stock prices change more than this percentage so if you are trying to do what is described in paragraph one then you may be disappointed as the share price may go down as well by more than $ 2.65 you have made

ah two things   first there is n't a small state with capitalism   capitalism requires lots of support from a state    for example there needs to be a functioning judicial system to settle disputes and to enforce all sorts of laws that benefit capitalism   there also needs to be large investments in infrastructure including infrastructure that would be impossible for a private entity to build and run   also capitalism has this thing called business cycles   we have had two now in the past 80 years that required massive state intervention in order to save capitalism itself   you say you are in favor of democracy but that does n't extend to the enterprise   would n't democracy also include workers being able to own and vote how a company is run   how is it democratic for the person with the most shares and thus the most money to have the most votes   even in our political democracy capital has a giant influence   one only has to look at our current government to see that influence

since you mentioned £ there 's a good chance you 're in the uk the uk is something of an anomaly in the world in so much as you do n't need to use because you can spread bet the principle is ultimately the same you 're making a bet that the price will change in your favour as others have said this is n't investment and is n't a good idea if you do n't know what you 're doing it 's a possibly risky way into the field because your losses can exceed your deposit it 's generally pretty short term and so is highly susceptible to unpredictable temporary market fluctuation real investing is usually longer term and so based on the general trend of the market which is generally less difficult to predict that said half way decent spread betting companies will check you out pretty thoroughly before you start they 'll offer a demo account where you can trade with fake money ie you make no deposit and can make no withdrawals until you 're comfortable some do training courses and seminars too when you first start trading for real you 'll need to put a stop loss on every trade and thus mostly avoid the problem of losing more than you it 's still possible to lose more than you with a stop loss but in most cases your excess loss wo n't be just eye watering i worked for one such spread betting company a good honest one at that we once had an internal competition using demo accounts the aim was to make as much money as you could in a two week period i think we started with £ 10,000 each a couple of people made a decent looking amount of money in that time but dozens more of us lost at least all of the money it is possible to make money but there 's a far far greater chance you 'll lose all you 're prepared to stake and maybe more also using a demo account is very different from using real money no matter how much you tell yourself it is n't

mary who has a column on money in the nz herald had this to say on the matter research shows that over and over again the top dogs in one decade can be bottom dogs the next decade and vice versa past performance really is no guide to the future fees are much less likely than returns to change over time and low fees make a big difference to the long term growth of your account so just how low are your fund 's fees perhaps that means the most sensible bet would be to pick a fund with good but not necessarily best historical returns but also with low fees personally i 've also included ethics as a factor in the decision and i chose the ethical investment option offered by hoping that it makes a small difference as explained here i have no affiliation with

the main reason as far as i can see is that the dividends are payments with which the shareholders may do what they want capital that the company has no use for does not make a significant positive return on investment as you pointed out yes the company could accrue interest but that is not going to make the company large sums of cash while the company may be great at making shoes maybe even the best in the world does n't mean they are good investors sure they could dabble at using their capital to invest in other equities but they do n't because they just want to focus on making shoes if the dividend goes to the investors they can do what they wish be it reinvest in the company or invest elsewhere other companies that may make good use of the capital and create significant returns on it are one such example that is the rational answer beyond that one of the main reasons is that people like the feeling of receiving dividends it might not be the answer you are looking for but many people prefer companies that pay dividends for no rational reason over companies which grow their asset value

while i agree with ben a lot i feel like his answer is really poor here you do not call a number to give your credit card information out for a refund   that is ridiculous   just from his answer he has had 5 cases of fraud lately you should know that you should n't follow this advice i personally do n't ever give my credit card number over the phone unless it is the very very very last resort   it is not just about money and safety but it is about time   every time that you give your number out over the phone there is a chance that the employee on the other end by either scam or legitimate business will use or sell your info   so you need to determine if the time saved by doing a transaction over the phone is worth hours days of your time if your card has a fraud issue   and note that fraud sometimes is easily negated but if done smartly can be hard to prove via a quick call or email to card company what should you do tell company that you will simply get the refund through your credit card company and if we go back to time element   you fill out form on card website   card company goes back to vendor and says why are you asking for card numbers via email   card company either cancels vendor contract or more likely helps them understand the technology available so they do n't have to do this   therefore that quick form that you filled out will now keep this company from bugging you again   by going through their archaic systems you are enabling their behavior

the debt is owed to banks   so until people get control of the banks and cease to let banks control the government the answer is no   there are systems in which the currency could be issued by government or in the name of the people which would not necessitate increasing indebtedness to banks to increase money supply to support a growing economy   as currencies now stand we are paying a tax to banks in the form of debt for the growth of the economy   the faster an economy grows the greater the debt   in addition when an economy shrinks in a recession the debt does not shrink and becomes more burdensome stifling its ability to recover   if currency were an asset it would shrink with the economy and pose no burden to its recovery

quoted from nasdaq has come up with an auction approach called the opening cross here 's how it works in the morning a computer program looks at all the orders that have come in overnight in each different stock based on those orders the program picks a price level that would be the best opening price however it also looks to see if there 's a trade imbalance for example if a company announced bad news after the market closed there might be 10 times more sell orders than buy orders nasdaq then broadcasts the price and imbalance information to its network of dealers with the goal of offsetting the imbalance it then lets dealers place orders this all happens very quickly in a time window of two minutes or so right before the market opens dealers can place orders and those orders are factored into the opening price further reading here opening price calculation

while this seems overall a macroeconomics question and not really personal finance let me give it a shot the question of why corporations form in a free or efficient market is why ronald coase received the 1991 nobel prize in economics for his work developing the theory of the firm corporations organize when there are transaction costs in the free market corporations form when it is in fact more efficient for a corporation to exist than a number of small producers contracting with one another   to the extent that corporations add efficiency to a total market they are not zero sum at all the net production is increased over what would exist in a market of sole proprietors who would have costs such as researching the trust levels in counterparts regulatory compliance etc that they can not bear to engage in the same level of transactions

from what i have read from to van tharp etc etc no one can pick winners more than 75 of the time regardless of the system they use and most traders consider themselves successful if 60 of the trades are winners and 40 are losers   so i am on the side that the chart is only a reflection of the past and can not tell you reliably what will happen in the future it is difficult to realize this but here is a simple way for you to realize it if you look at a daily chart and let 's say it is 9:30 am at the open and you ask a person to look at the technical indicators look at the fundamentals and decide the direction of the market by drawing the graph just for the next hour he will realize in just a few seconds that he will say to him or her self how on earth do you expect me to be able to do that   he will realize very quickly that it is impossible to tell the direction of the market and he realizes it would be foolhardy to even try because mickey hit over 250 every year of his career for the first 15 years it would be a prudent bet to bet that he could do it again over the span of a season but you would be a fool to try to   guess if the next pitch would be a ball or a strike you would be correct about 50 of the time and wrong about 50 of the time you can rely on larger patterns of behavior over years but short hourly or even minute by minute prediction is foolish that is why to be a trader you have to keep on trading and if you keep on trading and cut your losses to 1/2 of your wins you will eventually have a wonderful profit   but you have to limit your risk on any one trade to 1 of your portfolio   in that way you will be able to trade at least 100 times   do the math   trade a hundred times   lose 5 and the next bet gain 10   keep on doing it you will have losses sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row and also wins sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row but overall if you keep on trading even the best traders are generally only right 60 of the time   so lets do the math if you took 100 dollars and make 100 trades and the first trade you made 10 and reinvested the total and the second trade you lost 5 of that and continue that win loss sequence for 100 trades you would have dollars minus commissions that is a 1200 return in one hundred trades   if you do it in a roth ira you pay no taxes on the short term gains   it is not difficult to realize that the stock market does trend and the easiest way to make 10 quickly is to in general trade 3x leveraged funds or stocks that have at least 3 beta from the general index   take any trend up and count the number of days the stock is up and it is usually 66 75 and take any down trend and it is down 66 75 of the days   so if you bet on the the beginning of a day when the stock was up and if you buy the next day about 66 75 of the time the stock will also be up so the idea is to realize that 1/3 of the time at least you will cut your losses but 2/3 of the time you will be up then next day as well   so keep holding the position based on the low of the previous day and as the stock rises to your trend line then tighten the stock to the low of the same day or just take your profit and buy something else   but losing 1/3 times is just part of the unpredictable nature of the stock market which is causes simply because there are three types of traders all betting at the same time on the same stock   day traders who are trading from 1 to 10 times a day swing traders trading from 1 day to several weeks and buy and hold investors holding out for long term capital gains they each have different price targets and time horizons and that difference is what makes the market move   one person 's short term exit price at a profit is another persons long term entry point and because so many are playing at the same time with different time horizons stop losses and exit targets it is impossible to draw the price action or volume   but it is possible to cut your losses and ride your winners and if you keep on doing that you have a very fine return indeed

you promised to pay the loan if he did n't   that was a commitment and i recommend owning your choice and following it through to its conclusion even if you never do that again   tldr you made a mistake own it keep your word and embrace the lesson   why   because you keep your promises   nevermind that this is a rare time where your answer will be directly recorded in your credit report this is n't i see this as a defining moment in a long game 10 years down the road i 'd like you to be wise confident and in financial matters with a healthy if distant relationship with our somewhat corrupt financial system   i know austerity stinks but having a strong financial life will bring you a lot more money in the long run many are to the conclusions that this is an ex friend who did this deliberately   do n't assume this for instance it 's quite possible your friend sold the car at a dealer who failed to pay off this note or did and the lender the paperwork   and when the collector called he told them that thinking the collector would fix it which they do n't do the point is you do n't know your friend may be an innocent party here   creditors generally do n't report late payments to the credit bureaus until they 're 30 days late   but as a co signer you 're in a bad spot you 're liable for the payments but they do n't send you a bill   so when you hear about it it 's already nearly 30 days late   you do n't get any extra grace period as a co signer so you need to make a payment right away to keep that from going 30 late or if it 's already 30 late to keep it from going any later    if it is later determined that it was not necessary for you to make those payments the lender should give them back to you   a less reputable lender may resist and you may have to threaten small claims court which is a great expense to them cheaper to pay you   they say france is the nation of love they say america is the nation of commerce   so it 's not surprising that here people are quick to burn a lasting friendship over a temporary financial issue   just saying that is n't necessarily the right answer   i do n't know about you but my friends all have   nobody 's perfect   financial issues are just another kind of   and financial life in america is hard because we let commerce run   and because our obsession with it makes it a loaded issue and thus hard to talk about   perhaps your friend is in trouble but the actual villain is a predatory lender   point is the friendship may be more important than this temporary adversity   the right answer may be to come together and figure out how to make it work   yes it 's also possible he 's a human leech who hops from person to person charming them into cosigning for him but to assume that right out of the gate is a bit silly   the first question i 'd ask is where 's the car if it 's a car many lenders especially those who loan to poor credit risks put trackers in the car   they can tell you where it is or at least where it was last seen when the tracker stopped working   if that is a car dealer 's lot for instance that would be very informative    simply reaching out to the lender may get things moving if there 's just a paperwork issue behind this   many people deal with life troubles by fleeing they dread picking up the phone they throw summons in the trash   this is a terrifying and miserable way to deal with such a situation   they learn nothing and it 's pure suffering    i prefer and recommend the opposite turn into it deal with it head on get ahead of it    ask questions google things read become an expert on the thing be the one calling the lender not the other way round   this way it becomes a technical learning experience that 's interesting and fun for you and the lender is your calls instead of the other way round   i 've been sued   it sucked   but i took it on and and actually led the fight and strategy albeit with counsel   and turned it around so he wound up paying my legal bills   ha   with that precious experience i know exactly what to do i do n't fear being sued or if absolutely necessary suing    you might as well get the best financial education   you 're paying the tuition

distributions of interest from bonds are taxable as income by the federal state and municipal if applicable government end of year fund distributions are subject to capital gains taxes as well you can minimize taxation by note that the only bonds that are guaranteed safe are us government obligations as the us government has unlimited taxation powers and the ability to print money municipal obligations are generally safe but there is a risk that municipal governments will default you can also avoid taxation by not realizing gains if you buy individual stocks or tax efficient mutual funds you will have minimal tax liability until you sell also just wanted to point out that bonds do not equal safety and money markets do not pay sufficient interest to offset inflation you need a diversified portfolio five year treasury notes are only paying 1.3 now and bond prices drop when interest rates go up given the level of federal spending and the wind down of the war its likely that rates will rise

for political reasons almost all governments including the us spend more money than they get from taxes etc   there are a number of things a government can do to cover the difference most governments opt for selling bonds   the national debt of a country can be thought of as being the sum of all the bonds that are still paying interest and that the government has n't redeemed it can all go horribly wrong   if the government gets into a situation where it can not pay the interest or it can not redeem the bonds it has promised to then it may have to break its promise default on its payments   this makes the owners of the bonds unhappy and means potential buyers of future bond sales are less likely to want to buy the governments new bonds effectively meaning the government has to promise to pay more interest in the future   recent examples of this include argentina and may include greece soon the us is in the fortunate position that not many people believe it will default   therefore the new bonds it sells which it does on a regular basis are still in demand even though its interest payments and promises to redeem bonds are huge

great question   first my recommendation would be for you to get a card that does not have a yearly fee there are many credit cards out there that provide cash back on your purchases or points to redeem for gift cards or other items be sure to cancel the credit card that you have now so you do n't forget about that yearly fee canceling will have a temporary impact on your credit score if the credit card is your longest held line of credit   second it is recommended not to use more than 20 of all the available credit staying above that line can affect your credit score i think that is what you are hearing about running up large balances on your credit card if you are worried about staying below the 20 line you can always request a larger line of credit just keep paying it off each month though and you will be fine   you already have a history of credit if you have begun paying off your student loans

it is typically best to pay minimum payments to 2 of the loans and pay aggressively on the third loan some will tell you to pay the highest interest rate loan off first because personal finance is about finance and mathematically that saves you the most interest some will tell you to pay the smallest balance loan off first because personal finance is personal and the psychological win of paying off a loan is more valuable than the small amount of interest difference between this strategy and paying off the loan with the highest interest rate first

as proposed buy 100 oz of gold at $ spot = sell 1 aug 2014 future for $ = $ profit $ 1,600 alternative risk free investment 1 year cd 1 would earn $ on $ investment rate from ads on real profit all you are really being paid for this trade is the difference between the   profit $ 1,600 and the opportunity for $ in risk free earnings   that 's only $ 360 or around    pitfalls of trying to do this many retail futures brokers are set up for speculative traders and do not want to deal with customers selling contracts against delivery or buying for delivery if you are a trader you have to keep margin money on deposit   this can be a t note at some brokerages but currently t notes pay almost 0    if the price of gold rises and you are short a future in gold then you need to deposit more margin money   if gold went back up to $ that could be $   if you need to borrow this money the interest will eat into a very slim profit margin over the risk free rate    since you ca n't deliver the trades have to be reversed   although futures trades have cheap commissions the bid ask spread even at 1 grid is not so minimal   also there is often noisy in the price   the spot market in physical gold may have a higher bid ask spread you might be able to eliminate some of these issues by trading as a or for delivery   good luck finding a broker to let you do this but the issue here for gold is that you 'd need to trade in depository receipts for gold that is acceptable for delivery instead of trading physical gold   to deliver physical gold it would likely have to be tested and certified which costs money by the time you 've researched this you 'll either discover some more costs associated with it or could have spent your time making more money elsewhere

does it make sense to calculate the irr based on the outstanding value of the project or just use the cash flows paid out let 's assume i invest x amount every year for 49 years and the investment grows at a constant rate but i do not get dividends before which will be constant 50 years later i assume that the value of the investment will decline as it pays dividend and will be worth 0 when the dividends stop    do i calculate the irr as the negative streams of outflows for the first 49 years and then positive cash inflows from 50 year in the future if i apply this method the irr will be very low almost equal to the annual expected return   or based on the current value of the project for each year combined with cash outflows for the first 49 years and dividends from year 50 if i apply this method the irr will be a lot higher than the first method

selling short is simply by definition the selling then later re buying of stock you do n't initially own say you tally your entire portfolio balance the quantity of each stock you own and your cash assets let 's call this your initial position we define profit as any increase in assets relative to this initial position if you know a particular stock will go down you can realize a profit by selling some of that stock waiting for the price to go down then buying it back in the end you will have returned to your initial position except you will have more cash if you sell 10 shares of a stock valued at £ 1.50 then buy them back at £ 1.00 you will make a £ 5.00 profit while having otherwise returned to your previous position if you do the same but you initially owned 1000 shares sold just 10 of those then bought 10 back that 's still a profit of £ 5.00 selling short is doing the same thing but with an initial and ending balance of 0 shares if you initially own 0 shares sell 10 then buy 10 back you return to your initial position 0 shares plus a profit of £ 5.00 and in practice you must also pay a borrowing fee to do this the advantage of selling short is it can be done with any stock not just those currently owned

rich people use depositor banks the same way the rest of us use banks to keep a relatively small store of wealth for monthly expenses and a savings account for a rainy day the bulk of a wealthy person 's money is in investments money sitting in a bank account is not making you more money and in fact as correctly points out would be losing value to inflation now all investments have risk that 's why interest exists if in some alternate universe charging interest were illegal across the board nobody would loan money because there 's nothing to be gained and a lot to lose you have to make it worth my while for me to want to loan you my money because sure as you 're going to use my loan to make yourself wealthier a wealthy person will choose a set of investments that represent an overall level of risk that he is comfortable with much like you or i would do the same with our retirement funds early in life we 're willing to take a lot of risk because there 's a lot of money to be made and time to recover from any losses closer to retirement we 're much more risk averse because if the market takes a sudden downturn we lose a significant portion of our nest egg with little hope of it before we have to start cashing out the very wealthy have similar variances in risk with the significant difference that they are typically already drawing a living from their investments as such they already have some risk aversion but at the same time they need good returns and so they must pay more attention to this balancing act between risk and return managing their investments in effect becomes their new job once they do n't have to work for anyone else anymore the money does the real work and they make the executive decisions about where best to put it the tools they use to make these decisions are the same ones we have they watch market trends to identify stages of the economic cycle that large movements of money to or from safe havens like gold and t debt they diversify their investments to shield the bulk of their wealth from a sudden localized loss they hire investment managers to have a second pair of eyes and additional expertise in navigating the market you or i can do much the same thing by buying shares in managed investment funds or simply consulting a broker the difference is that the wealthy get a more personal touch so what 's the difference between the very wealthy and the rest of us well first is simple scale when a person with a net worth in the hundreds of millions makes a phone call or personal visit to the financial institutions handling their money there 's a lot of money on the line in making sure that person is well looked after if we get screwed over at the teller window and decide to close our the teller can often give us our entire account balance in cash without an our multimillionaire is at the lower end of being able to alter his banks profit loss statements by his decisions and so his bank will fight to keep his business second is the level of control the very wealthy the upper 1 have more or less direct ownership and control over many of the major means of production in this country the factories mines timber farms software houses power plants recording studios etc that generate things of value and therefore new wealth while the average joe can buy shares in these things through the open market their investment is typically a drop in the bucket and their voice in company decisions equally small our decision therefore is largely to invest or not to invest the upper 1 on the other hand have controlling interests in their investments often majority holdings that allow them far more control over the businesses they invest in who 's running them and what they do

thanks just to clarify i am looking for a more value neutral answer in terms of things like sharpe ratios i think it 's an oversimplification to say that on average you lose money because of put options even if they expire 90 of the time they still have some expected payoff that kicks in 10 of the time and if the price is less than the expected payoff you will earn money in the long term by investing in put options i am sure you know this as a phd student i just wanted to get it out guess more formally my question would be are there studies on whether options prices correspond well to the diversification benefits they offer from an mpt point of view

the main risk i see to this plan is with a late payment to your credit card   for a variety of reasons some outside your control you could end up with a late payment on the cc and a + 18 interest rate making your arbitrage attempts unprofitable you sense that this is risky and it derives from placing short term risk on a long term asset    your interest rate is high for the current market   what kind of things can you do reduce that rate   what kind of things can you do to reduce your principle   those kind of things represent far less risk and accomplish the same goal

why do you keep going on about test results you do realise that the drug does n't last very long in the system and as explained by the testimonies there were techniques to delay blood testing until it was clear from the system such as ringing each other up telling them that testers are here and to say out on the track for longer or to dope more often at night when testers were n't around or to simply not answer your door when testers came around   and yes there were was a test result i do n't remember which year exactly that when tested at the time was found to have no drugs but that s because the drug he used was n't by any method the blood was later on when they did have a method to test for it and they did find it in his system   let 's say i have a gun which disappears into thin air after firing i use it to kill a person in a room full of people nobody sees me directly firing the gun but i do manage to use it to kill someone and the gun disappears police search everyone including me for a gun but find no gun they find that i had motive but again no gun now a week later 26 of my one of them who was the person who manufactured this magical gun own up to the police and confess how i was able to do what i did would n't it be stupid of me to argue you never found a gun on me after the murder therefore i 'm innocent   the gun is like the drug it disappears after use with the drug it 's not so instant but still disappears fairly quickly with regards to the blood testing frequency therefore do you not see how it is stupid to say no positive test results therefore it 's evidence he never used drugs again i 'll reiterate it incase you still do n't understand it of the drug disappears quickly from the blood

i understand and i 'm not necessarily disagreeing i 'm just asking how we know this   it 's one thing if it 's a logical deduction you 've made but it 's another if there 's direct objective evidence   do these statistics pertain to all car sales or just factory car sales   the car i own today is the car i 've owned the longest but it 's not because i ca n't afford to buy another one it 's because i have absolutely no reason to   my car was made in 2000 it has miles on it   i could write a long list of things that are still performing just as adequately as they did when it was new and how aside from being somewhat less powerful it does n't actually do anything worse than comparable new cars i 'll spare you   cars in 1970 were never expected to be driven past 100k miles without major service work including an engine and transmission overhaul   many cars well into the late 70s did n't even come with that many digits on the odometer   the economic conditions you mention including the astonishing transfer of wealth between classes are not good signs and it obviously needs to be reversed or this country is going to be a really shitty place to live soon   and hell yes i believe it 's affecting car sales   but i 'm really not convinced it 's the main reason car sales peaked 40 years ago   housing sales only peaked a few years ago and both markets have screwed themselves over issuing credit albeit in different ways   point is you do n't need to be able to afford a car when you can get a loan practically at the push of a button americans do n't think in terms of what something costs they think in terms of what it costs per   income has been allowed to happen because people have been allowed to spend money they do n't have   i know people living paycheck to paycheck who spend $ 150 $ 250 per month on just data   they also have $ 10k 's of revolving credit card debt and even worse $ 10k 's in student loans   $ 250 per month wo n't save up for a new cadillac anytime soon but it will put you into a cadillac if you do n't mind having spent $ on a $ 38k car by the time your loan matures   edit those numbers are pretty exaggerated $ would n't get you a cadillac until it was several years old   you 'd still end up paying several thousand more than if you 'd paid cash though the point is that our economy is floating on credit and this has allowed rampant overspending and living above means in the average household   you see what i 'm saying   all other factors being equal car sales should have peaked a few years ago or at least in the late 90s during the first dot com bubble   there was far more spending power out there not income but spending power

no they do not stock funds and bonds funds collect income dividends in different    ways stock funds collect dividends   as well as any capital gains    that are realized from the underlying stocks   and incorporates these    into the funds’ net asset value or daily share price that ’s why a    stock fund ’s share price drops when the fund makes a distribution    the distribution comes out of the fund ’s total net assets with bond funds the internal accounting is different   dividends    accrue daily and are then paid out to shareholders every month or    quarter   bond funds collect the income from the underlying bonds and    keep it in a separate internal bucket   a bond fund calculates a    daily accrual rate for the shares outstanding and shareholders only    earn income for the days they actually hold the fund   for example if    you buy a bond fund two days before the fund ’s month end distribution    you would only receive two worth of income that month   on the    other hand if you sell a fund part way through the month you will    still receive a partial distribution at the end of the month    pro rated for the days you actually held the fund source   also via bogleheads most vanguard bond funds accrue interest to the share holders daily    here is a typical statement from a prospectus each fund distributes to shareholders virtually all of its net income    interest less expenses as well as any net capital gains realized    from the sale of its holdings the fund ’s income dividends accrue    daily and are distributed monthly the term accrue used in this sense    means that the income dividends are credited to your account each day    just like interest in a savings account that accrues daily since the    money set aside for your dividends is both an asset of the fund and a    liability it does not affect the calculated net asset value when the    fund distributes the income dividends at the end of the month the net    asset value does not change as both the assets and liabilities    decrease by exactly the same amount note that if you sell all of    your bond fund shares in the middle of the month you will receive as    proceeds the value of your shares calculated as number of shares    times net asset value plus a separate distribution of the accrued    income dividends

if you are looking for numerical metrics i think the following are popular price earnings p e you mentioned this very popular one in your question   there are different p e ratios forward essentially an estimate of future earnings by management trailing etc   i think of the p e as a quick way to grade a company 's income statement i.e how much does the stock cost the amount of earnings being generated on a per share basis some caution must be taken when looking at the p e ratio   earnings can be by the company   revenue can be moved between quarters assets can be depreciated at different rates residual value of assets can be adjusted etc   knowing this the p e ratio alone does n't help me determine whether or not a stock is cheap in general i think an affordable stock is one whose p e is under 15 price book i look at the price book as a quick way to grade a company 's balance sheet   the book value of a company is the amount of cash that would be left if everything the company owned was sold and all debts paid i.e. the company 's net worth   the cash is then divided the outstanding shares and the price book can be computed   if a company had a price book under 1.0 then theoretically you could purchase the stock the company could be liquidated and you would end up with more money then what you paid for the stock this ratio attempts to answer how much does the stock cost based on the net worth of the company again this ratio can be by the company   asset values have to be estimated based on current market values think about trying to determine how much a company 's building is worth unless of course mark to market is suspended   this involves some estimating   again i do n't use this value alone in whether or not a stock is cheap i consider a price book value under 10 a good number    cash i look at growth in the cash balance of a company as a way to grade a company 's cash flow statement   is the cash account growing or not as they say cash is king   this is one measurement that can not be which is why i like it   the p e and price book can be tuned but in the end the company can not hide a shrinking cash balance return ratios return on equity is a measure of the amount of earnings being generated for a given amount of equity roe = liabilities   this attempts to measure how effective the company is at generating earnings with a given amount of equity   there is also return on assets which measures earnings returns based on the company 's assets i tend to think an roe over 15 is a good number these measurements rely on a company accurately reporting its financial condition   remember in the us companies are allowed to accounting reports if approved by the government so be careful   there are others who simply do n't follow the rules and report whatever numbers they like without penalty there are many others   these are just a few of the more popular ones   there are many other considerations to take into account as other posters have pointed out

absolutely   you can trace all of it back to reagan   his awful tax reform act of 1986 made corporate profits from operations in foreign countries tax exempt unless and until the corporations chose to repatriate those profits i.e. bring them back to the u.s. in which case they were subject only to a sharply reduced tax   this provision created the huge impetus for u.s. corporations to move their operations and their jobs overseas   reagan initiated the huge increase in income and wealth inequality

i have had pension programs with two companies   the first told you what your benefit would be if you retired at age x with y years of service each year of service got you a percentage of your final years salary there was a different formula for early retirement and there was an offset for social security they were responsible for putting enough money away each year to meet their obligations just before i left they did add a new feature you could get the funds in the account in a lump sum when you left if you left early you got the money in the account if you left at retirement age you got the money that was needed to produce the benefit you were promised which was based on current interest rates the second company had a plan where they published the funding formula you knew with every quarterly statement how much was in your account and what interest it had earned and what benefit they estimated you would receive if you stayed until retirement age this fund felt almost like a defined contribution because the formula was published if most people took the lump sum that was the only part that mattered both pension plans had a different set of formulas based on marriage status and survivor rules the interest rates are important because they are used to determine how much money is needed to produce the promised monthly benefit they are also used to determine how much they need to allocate each year to cover their obligations   if you ca n't make the math work you need to keep contacting hr you need to understand how much should be flowing into the account each month

i just want to stress one point which has been mentioned but only in passing the disadvantage of a credit card is that it makes it very easy to take on a credit paying it off over time which i know is the point of the card then you fell into the trap of the issuer of the card they benefit if you pay off stuff over time that 's why taking up a credit seems to be so easy with a credit sic card all the technical aspects aside you are still in debt and you never ever want to be so if you can avoid it and for any voluntary non essential payment you can avoid it buy furniture that you can pay off in full right now if that means only buying a few pieces or used junk stuff then so be it save up money until you can buy more better pieces

in general there should be a liquidity premium which means that less liquid stocks should be cheaper that 's because to buy such a stock you should demand a higher rate of return to compensate for the liquidity risk the possibility that you wo n't be able to sell easily lower initial price = higher eventual rate of return that 's what 's meant when investopedia says the security would be cheaper on average is liquidity good it depends here 's what illiquidity is imagine you own a rare piece of art say there are 10 people in the world who collect this type of art and would appreciate what you own that 's an illiquid asset because when you want to sell maybe those 10 people are n't buying maybe they do n't want your particular piece or they all happen to be short on funds or maybe worse only one of them is buying so they have all the negotiating leverage you 'll have to lower your price if you 're really in a hurry to sell maybe if you lower your price enough you can get one of the 10 buyers interested even if none were initially an illiquid asset is bad for sellers illiquid means there are n't enough buyers for you to get a bidding war going at the time of your choosing you 'll potentially have to wait around for buyers to turn up or for a stock maybe you 'd have to sell a little bit at a time as buyers want the shares illiquid can be bad for buyers too if the buyer is for some reason in a hurry maybe nobody is selling at any given time but usually buyers do n't have to be in a hurry an exception may be if you short sell something illiquid brokers often wo n't let you do this btw in that case you could be a forced buyer and this could be very bad on an illiquid security if there are only one or two sellers out there they now have the negotiating leverage and they can ask whatever price they want illiquidity is very bad when mixed with margin or short sales because of the potential for forced trades at inopportune times there are plenty of obscure penny stocks where there might be only one or two trades per day or fewer the spread is going to be high on these because the bids at a given time will just be lowball offers from buyers who are n't really all that interested unless you want to give your stock away in which case they 'll take it and the asks are going to be from sellers who want to get a decent price but maybe there are n't really any buyers willing to pay so the ask is just sitting there with no takers the bids and asks may be limit orders that have been sitting open for 3 weeks and forgotten about contrast with a liquid asset for example a popular model used car in good condition would be a lot more liquid than a rare piece of art though not nearly as liquid as most stocks you can probably find several people that want to buy it living nearby and you 're not going to have to drop the price to get a buyer to show up you might even get those buyers in a bidding war from illiquid penny stocks there 's a continuum all the way up to the most heavily traded stocks such as those in the s&p500 with these at a given moment there will be thousands of buyers and sellers so the spread is going to close down to nearly zero if you think about it just statistically if there are thousands of bids and thousands of asks then the closest bid ask pair is going to be close together that 's a narrow spread while if there are 3 bids and 2 asks on some illiquid penny stock they might be dollars away from each other and the number of shares desired might not match up you can see how liquidity is good in some situations and not in others an illiquid asset gives you more opportunity to get a good deal because there are n't a lot of other buyers and sellers around and there 's some opportunity to negotiate within the wide spread for some assets maybe you can literally negotiate by talking to the other party though obviously not when trading stocks on an exchange but an illiquid asset also means you might get a bad deal especially if you need to sell quickly and the only buyers around are making lowball offers so the time to buy illiquid assets is when you can take your time on both buying and selling and will have no reason for a forced trade on a particular timeline this usually means no debt is involved since creditors including your margin broker can force you to trade it also means you do n't need to spend the money anytime soon since if you suddenly needed the money you 'd have a forced trade on your hands if you have the time then you put a price out there that 's very good for you and you wait for someone to show up and give you that price this is how you get a good deal one more note another use of the term liquid is to refer to assets with low or zero volatility such as money market funds an asset with a lot of volatility around its intrinsic or true value is effectively illiquid even if there 's high trade volume in that any given point in time might not be a good time to sell because the price is n't at the right level anyway the general definition of a liquid investment is one that you 'd be comfortable cashing out of at a moment 's notice in this sense most stocks are not all that liquid despite high trading volume in different contexts people may use liquid in this sense or to mean a low bid ask spread

the trinity study looked at safe withdrawal rates from retirement portfolios they found it was safe to withdraw 4 of a portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds i can not immediately find exactly what specific investment allocations they used but note that they found a portfolio consisting largely of stocks would allow for the withdrawal of 3 4 and still keep up with inflation in this case if you are able to fund $ 30,000 the study claims it would be safe to withdraw $ 900 $ 1200 a year that is pay out as scholarships while allowing the scholarship to grow sufficiently to cover inflation and that this should work in perpetuity my guess is that they invest such scholarship funds in a fairly aggressive portfolio most likely they choose something along these lines 70 80 stocks and 20 30 bonds this is probably more risky than you 'd want to take but should give higher returns than a more conservative portfolio of perhaps 50 60 stocks 40 50 bonds over the long term just a regular interest bearing savings account is n't going to be enough they almost never even keep up with inflation yes if the stock market or the bond market takes a hit the investment will suffer but over the long term it should more than recover the lost capital such scholarships care far more about the very long term and can weather a few years of bad returns this is roughly similar to retirement planning if you expect to be retired for say 10 years you wo n't worry too much about pulling out your retirement funds but it 's quite possible to retire early say at 40 and plan for an infinite retirement you just need a lot more money to do so $ 3 million invested appropriately should allow you to pull out approximately $ 90,000 a year adjusted upward for inflation forever i leave the specifics of how to come up with $ 3 million as an exercise for the reader as an aside there 's a memorial and traffic safety fund which kindly and gently solicited a $ 10,000 donation after my wife was killed in a motor vehicle accident that would have provided annual donations in her name in perpetuity this shows you do n't need $ 30,000 to set up a scholarship or a fund i chose to go another way but it was an option i seriously considered edit the trinity study actually only looked at a 30 year withdrawal period so long as the investment was n't exhausted within 30 years it was considered a success the trinity study has also been when it comes to retirement nevertheless there 's some withdrawal rate at which point your investment is expected to last forever it just may be slightly smaller than 3 4 per year

first off i do n't know of the nature of the interpersonal relationship between you and your roommate and i do n't really care but i will say that your use of that term was a red flag to me and it will be so to a bank buying a home is a big deal that you normally do not undertake with just a friend or roommate spouses business partners domestic partners etc are the types of people that go in together on a home purchase not roommates going on a house is not something that 's easily contracted you ca n't take out two primary mortgages for half the house 's value each because you ca n't split the house in half so if one of you defaults that bank takes the house leaving both the other person and their bank in the co signing on one mortgage is possible but then you tie your credit histories together if one of you ca n't make their half of the mortgage both of you can be pursued for the full amount and both of you will see your credit tank that 's not as big a problem for two people joined in some other way marriage family ties but for two friends there 's just way too much risk involved second i do n't know what it 's like in your market but when i was buying my first house i learned very quickly that extended haggling is not really tolerated in the housing market you 're not bidding on some trade good the guy bought wholesale for fifty cents and is charging you $ 10 for the seller might be breaking even on this thing an offer that comes in low is more likely to be rejected outright as frivolous than to be countered it 's a fine line if you offer a few hundred less than list the seller will think you 're and stay firm while if you offer significantly less the seller may be unable to accept that price because it means he no longer has the cash to close on his new home and bank owned properties are often sold at a concrete asking price the bank will not even respond to anything less and usually will not even agree to eat closing costs even if it 's for sale by owner the owner may be in trouble on their own mortgage and if they agree to a short sale and the bank gets wind it 's trivial to match a list of distressed mortgaged properties with the mls listings the bank can swoop in foreclose the mortgage take the property and kill the deal they 're the primary lienholder you do n't own your house until it 's paid for and then everybody loses third housing prices in this economy depending on market are pretty depressed and have been for years if you 're selling right now you are almost certainly losing thousands of dollars in cash and/or equity despite that sellers in listing their home must offer an attractive price for the market and so they are in the position of pricing based on what they can afford to lose that again often means that even a seller who is n't a bank and is n't in mortgage trouble may still be losing thousands on the deal and is firm on the asking price to the bleeding your agent can see the signs of a seller backed against a wall and again in order for your offer to be considered in such a situation it has to be damn close to list as far as your agent trying to talk you into offering the asking price there 's honestly not much in it for him to tell you to bid higher vs lower a $ 10,000 change in price which can easily make or break a deal is only worth $ 300 to him either way there is on the other hand a huge incentive for him to close the deal at any price that 's in the ballpark whether it 's $ or $ he 's taking home around $ 11k in commission so he 's going to recommend an offer that will be seriously considered from the previous points that 's going to be the asking price right now the agent 's exact motivations for advising you to offer list depend on the exact circumstances typically around the time the house has been on the market and the offer history which he has access to via his fellow agents and the mls the house may have just had a price drop that brings it below comparables meaning the asking price is a great deal and will attract other offers meaning you need to move fast the house may have been offered on at a lower price which the seller is considering not accepted not rejected meaning an offer at list price will get you the house again if you move fast or the house may have been on the market for a while without a price drop meaning the seller can go no lower but is desperate again meaning an offer at list will get you the house here 's a tip virtually all offers include a buyer 's option for a negotiated price typically very small like $ 100 from the moment the offer is accepted until a particular time thereafter one week two weeks etc you can say no at any time for any reason during this time period you get a home inspection and have a guy you trust look at the bones of the house check the basic systems and look for things that are wrong that will be expensive to fix never make an offer without this option written in if your agent says to forego the option fire him if the seller wants you to strike the option clause refuse and that should be a huge red flag that you should rescind the offer entirely the seller is likely trying to get rid of a house with serious issues and does n't want a competent inspector telling you to lace up your running shoes another tip depending on the the seller may be expecting to pay closing costs those are traditionally the buyer 's responsibility along with the buyer 's agent commission but in the current economy in the for your market that attracts first time homebuyers sellers are virtually expected to pay both of those buyer costs because they 're attracting buyers who can just barely scrape the down payment together $ in my home region dfw is a bit high to expect such a concession for that reason usually those types of offers come in for homes at around the $ range here but in the overall market conditions you have a good chance of getting the seller to accept that concession if you pay list but that is usually an offer made up front not a weapon kept in reserve so i would have expected your agent to recommend that combined offer up front list price and seller pays closing if you offer at list you do n't expect a counter so you would n't keep closing costs as a card to play in that situation

yes it 's normal if you buy your own disability insurance with after tax money any payout you get is non taxable if your employer buys your disability insurance with their own money any payout you get is taxable since the payout is not 100 of your pre disability income most folks strongly prefer that the payout be non taxable to achieve this i pay the premiums on behalf of my employees including myself and then add that premium to their salary as a taxable benefit in effect i paid it to them then took it from them and used it to buy the insurance it has no impact on my corporate taxes since i can either deduct premiums or salaries same either way this ensures they wo n't pay tax if they should collect and i have had people collect and it was non taxable to them

gt i ve read that consumer spending stimulates an economy more than investment somewhere   investment is necessary for an economy to grow as is consumer spending neither is more important if you lack one of those stimulating it will do more than stimulating the other   it 's like a racing team saying the driver is more important than the car in situations where everyone 's cars are as good as they 'll get improving the driver is more important in situations where the quality of cars differs improving the car becomes more important   gt;also the theory that decreasing the income gap helps society in many other ways   there is strong speculation that that is the case however it 's 100 fact that increasing everyone 's wealth helps society much more it 's why you 'd rather live today than in any more egalitarian point in our past if tinkering with income inequality gets in the way of overall wealth creation it will do more harm than good

there is no general theory to support the notion that larger companies will be more profitable than smaller companies   economies of scale are not always positive one can have of scale too    it is more common to talk about an optimal firm size even going back to 's the economies of scale   intuitively if economies of scale extended indefinitely then natural monopolies would dominate all industries in the long run a profit ratio unfortunately would n't quite get at scale economies   consider for example that the denominator of your metric would be and that you are trying to get at the cost reduction that derives from scale   then you are measuring the size of a company by the exact metric that should be reduced if scale economies exist so the calculation would be a bit it is my understanding that such assessments are usually conducted at the industry level by determining whether the industry is becoming increasingly concentrated among fewer firms over time again see    if concentration is increasing there is an implication that at current firm sizes there are economies of scale in the industry

definition fundamental analysis involves analyzing financial statements and health management and competitive advantages and competitors and markets books are a great way to learn fundamental analysis but can be time consuming for something that really is n't very difficult so the internet might be a better way to get started when using fundamental analysis all you are doing is trying to figure out how much a company is worth the vocabulary and huge range of acronyms can be intimidating but really its a fairly simple task you can use investopedia for definitions and simple examples when you do not fully understand something ie peg you can search for definitions using the search bar on the top right google also is a good source to look for additional definitions i recommend starting out by doing an independent analysis on a well known name such as gamble or mcdonald 's then you can compare your analysis to a professionals and see how they stack up books and resources getting started in fundamental analysis fundamental analysis for dummies fundamental analysis wiki what is fundamental analysis video from investopedia fundamental analysis introduction step by step example of fundamental analysis it 's a pretty in depth forum post side notes personally when i first began using fundamental analysis i found it difficult to understand why something is considered undervalued or overvalued i could n't figure out who was the authority on saying this well in short the authority basically is the market you can say you believe xyz is undervalued but you are only proven correct if the market agrees with you over long period of time some key facts you should know many times a stock can be broken for many reasons the price can go far beyond what would be considered a normal valuation this is considered a bubble e.g. the tech bubble of 1999 2000 it can also go far below a normal valuation in most cases these types of valuations are short lived and in the end a stock should return to normal valuation or at least this is the theory behind fundamental analysis

to determine how much you can contribute to a regular and roth ira you have to calculate your compensation what is compensation   generally compensation is what you earn from    working for a summary of what compensation does and does not include    see table 1 1 compensation includes all of the items discussed next    even if you have more than one salaries etc wages    salaries tips professional fees bonuses and other amounts you    receive for ing personal services are compensation the irs    treats as compensation any amount properly shown in box 1 wages    tips other compensation of form w-2 wage and tax statement    provided that amount is reduced by any amount properly shown in box 11    nonqualified plans scholarship and fellowship payments are    for ira purposes only if shown in box 1 of form    w-2 it a also includes commissions self employment income and alimony an non taxable combat pay for most people it is what i in box 1 of the w-2 for the example in the question if the sum of box 1 's equals $ that is the maximum you can contribute to all your iras regular and roth the funds can come from anywhere it is not related to your net check the money can be from savings gifts parents grandparents the irs does n't care about the source of the funds only that you do n't over contribute of course the calculation is more complex if the person is married and if they have access to a retirement account

there are basically two different markets for adrs and ordinary shares 1 the american market 2 the local market the following is not true for most stocks in developed markets but it is often true that the american market for adrs is far more liquid than the local market for ordinary shares of a developing country for instance there was a time when the adrs of of mexico was the fifth most traded stock in the world after exxon before its merger with mobil ibm microsoft and a meaning that it was easy to trade with low fees on the nyse it was much harder and slower to buy the local shares of in mexico on the mexican exchange also the accompanying currency transactions were harder to execute with the because you have to settle in local currency and pay an fx commission with the adr the exchange rate is built into the dollar price and you settle in dollars

but what if i am getting paid salary from a source in india in other words it may be that in india a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in us in that case even if my cost of living there is much less so is my salary there are sites that provide a good guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be of course some would get paid more than average so you can try and make a logic if in us say you are being paid more than average you would be paid more than average elsewhere plus if moving from developed to developing country one has the advantage of positive pedigree bias   there are also websites that would give the purchasing power parity for quite a few currency pairs the real difficulty to find is whether the lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar in other country if you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed if you compare equivalence then can you adjust   a relevant example my friend in us had a independent bungalow in us it was with basement and attic 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom he shifted to india and got a great salary compared to normal indian salary however this kind of house in india in bangalore would be affordable only to ceo 's of top companies so is living in a 3 room apartment fine there are multiple such aspects drinking a starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in us in india this would be considered luxury a like for equivalent comparison is one drinks 3 4 mugs of coffee in us and average indian drinks tea coffee 3 4 mugs in india the local tea coffee would be rs 10 rs 20 a starbucks would come with starting price of rs 150 the same applies to food a in india would be around rs 100 the indian equivalent is for rs 10 a sub way would be rs 150 a equivalent mumbai sandwich around rs 25 i personally am picky about food so it does n't matter where i go i can only eat specific things which means i spend a huge amount of money if i am outside of india when i was in us i could n't afford a maid driver or any help in india i have 2 maids a cooking maid and a driver plus i get plumber electrician window cleaner and all the help without costing me much things that i absolutely ca n't dream in us my colleague in uk preferred to stay in a specific locality as it has a very good church so if its important one may find few good ones in india if one is roman catholic if one follows greek orthodox tough luck   citizenship does it matter a foreign national may never get an indian citizenship children do n't qualify either unless both parents are indian health care again is quite different one may feel health care in us is not good or very expensive but there are multiple aspects of this so in essence its very broad there is traffic cleanliness climate culture etc ps a research assistant in india is poorly paid because colleges do n't have funds research in fundamental science is quite low industry to university are primitive and now where close to what we have in us

kudos for wanting to start your own business   now let 's talk reality unless you already have some kind of substantial track record of successful investing to show potential investors what you want to do will never happen and that 's just giving you the honest truth there are extensive regulatory requirements for starting any kind of public investment vehicle and meeting them costs money   you can be your own hedge fund with your own money and avoid all of this if you like   keep in mind that a hedge fund is little more than someone who is contrarian to the market and puts their money where their mouth is   i know some of you will argue this is simplistic and you 'd be right but i 'm deliberately avoiding complexity for the moment the simple truth is that nobody is going to just give you their money to invest unless for starters you can show that you 're any good at it and for the sake of it we 'll assume you 've had success in the markets and perhaps most importantly you have skin in the game meaning you have a substantial investment of your own in the fund too    you might have a chance at creating something if you can show that whatever your hedge fund proposes to invest in is n't already overrun by other hedge funds   at the moment there are more mutual and hedge funds out there than there are securities for them to invest in so they 're basically all fighting over the same pie   you must have some fairly unique opportunity or approach that nobody else has or has even considered in order to begin attracting money to a new fund these days   and that 's not easy trust me there is no short or easy path to what you want to do and perhaps if you want to toy around with it a bit find some friends who are willing to invest based on your advice and/or picks   if you develop a track record of success then perhaps you could more seriously consider doing what you propose and in the meanwhile you can look into the requirements for laying the foundations toward your goal i hope you do n't find my answer cruel because it is n't meant to be   i am all about encouraging people to succeed but it has to start with a realistic expectation   you have a great thought but there 's a wide gulf from concept to market and no quick or simple way to bridge it here 's a link to a web video on how to start your own hedge fund if you want to look into it more deeply how to legally start a hedge fund from the investopedia website good luck

if you have been putting savings away for the longer term and have some extra funds which you would like to take some extra risk on then i say work yourself out a strategy plan get yourself educated and go for it if it is individual shares you are interested then work out if you prefer to use fundamental analysis technical analysis or some of both you can use fundamental analysis to help determine which shares to buy and then use technical analysis to help determine when to get into and out of a position you say you are prepared to lose $ 10,000 in order to try to get higher returns i do n't know what percentage this $ 10,000 is of the capital you intend to use in this kind of investments trading but lets assume it is 10 so your total starting capital would be $ 100,000 the idea now would be to learn about money management position sizing and risk management there are plenty of good books on these subjects if you set a maximum loss for each position you open of 1 of your capital i.e $ 1,000 then you would have to get 10 straight losses in a row to get to your 10 total loss you do this by setting stop losses on your positions i 'll use an example to explain say you are looking at a stock priced at $ 20 and you get a signal to buy it at that price you now need to determine a stop price which if the stock goes down to you can say well i may have been wrong on this occasion the stock price has gone against me so i need to get out now i put automatic stop loss conditional orders with my broker you may determine the stop price based on previous support levels using a percentage of your buy price or another indicator or method i tend to use the percentage of buy price lets say you use 10 so your stop price would be at $ 18 10 below your buy price of $ 20 so now you can work out your position size the number of shares to buy your maximum loss on the position is $ 2 per share or 10 of your position in this stock but it should also be only 1 of your total capital being 1 of $ 100,000 = $ 1,000 you simply divide $ 1,000 by $ 2 to get 500 shares to buy   you then do this with the rest of your positions with a $ 100,000 starting capital using a 1 maximum loss per position and a stop loss of 10 you will end up with a maximum of 10 positions if you use a larger maximum loss per position your position sizes would increase and you would have less positions to open i would not go higher than 2 maximum loss per position if you use a larger stop loss percentage then your position sizes would decrease and you would have more positions to open the larger the stop loss the longer you will potentially be in a position and the smaller the stop loss generally the less time you will be in a position also as your total capital increases so will your 1 of total capital just as it would decrease if your total capital decreases using this method you can aim for higher higher return investments and reduce and manage your risk to a desired level one other thing to consider do n't let tax determine when you sell an investment if you are keeping a stock just so you will pay less tax if kept for over 12 months then you are in real danger of increasing your risk considerably i would rather pay 50 tax on a 30 return than 25 tax on a 15 return

i doubt it in the states you would only owe tax if you sold such an item at a profit garage sales are n't taxable as they are nearly always common household items and sale is   more about clearing out one 's attic garage than about profit keep in mind if i pay for a book and immediately sell it for the same price there 's no tax due why would tax be due if i sell for a loss

summarized article recent mishaps causing supply disruptions at 14 california refineries caused wholesale gas prices to reach an all time high of $ per gallon    local gas stations increased prices to 30 cents or more per gallon overnight with some stations charging as much as $ per gallon    some stations chose not to buy high priced wholesale gas for fear they would n't be able to sell it while others shut off their pumps after they ran out of the gas they bought at lower wholesale prices   some of the refinery mishaps include an oil pipeline problem a power outage at exxon mobil corp 's refinery and a shutdown of the crude unit at chevron corp 's richmond refinery    it is unknown when wholesale prices will come down but one solution may be to allow refineries to switch over from the summer blend to the cheaper winter blend earlier than planned     the california energy commission is considering the idea but notes an early switch over could impact air quality the summer blend reduces evaporation of pollutants during warm weather which would be less damaging to air quality in california 's current heat wave   for more summarized news subscribe to the /r skimthat](http://www.reddit.com r skimthat subreddit

i guarantee you that this wo n't put a on the problem for all of retail i work in a specialty cheese shop located inside a grocery store for most cheeses we tag pieces that are cut off of a wheel for 30 days this is not a use by date in any way this is simply a good estimate for how long it will look fresh the actual use by date varies by cheese and is typically several weeks later then the date you 'll see on the label longest being about a month fact is that most customers just do n't buy product that does n't look damn perfect and a piece of cheese simply looks worse after 30 days of sitting under display lights and being handled every day for packaged nestle shit this will work fine but for fresh cut or specialty items nah y'all just wo n't buy it

if that condition is permanent the stock will never pay dividends and you will never be able to sell it then yes it sounds to me like this is a worthless piece of paper if there is some possibility that the stock will pay dividends in the future or that a market will exist to sell it then you are making a long term investment it all depends on how likely it is that the situation will change if the investment is small maybe it 's worth it

is this right the example is slightly off google would be running a cafeteria that can be subsidized employees pay an amount to buy food not every one spends the same amount or eats the same amount of food if someone does n't use cafeteria he does n't get more money for example suppose john doe makes $ 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20 for a take home pay of $ 80,000 he spends $ 10,000 on food his employer corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense costing them $ 10,000 but now they can pay john doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $ 10,000 $ the company is now spending $ employing john doe for a savings of $ if a scheme is devised specifically to evade taxes then it is invalid in this case bill may buy groceries worth only $ 5000 so keep track of which employee buys how much groceries in added cost of google plus one ca n't really call it a business expense

this is second hand information as i am not a millionaire but i work with such people everyday and have an understanding of how they handle cash the wealthy people do n't simple definitely not if they do n't have to cash is a tool to them that they use only if they get benefit of it being a cash transaction one of my friends is a re seller and he gets a 10 discount from suppliers for settling lines using cash everything else they place on a line of credit for people who dislike credit cards and pay using atm or debit cards might actually have a very poor understanding of leverage i assure you the wealthy people have a very good understanding of it frankly wealthy people pay less for everything but they deserve it because of the extreme amount of leverage they have built for themselves their aprs are low their credit limits are insanely high they have longer billing periods and they get spoiled by credit card vendors all the time for example when you buy your groceries at walmart you pay at least a 4 markup because that 's the standardized cost of processing credit cards even if you paid in cash a wealthy person uses his credit card to pay for the same but earns the same percentage amount in cash back points and what not i am sure littleadv placed the car purchase on his credit card for similar reasons the even more wealthy have their groceries shipped to their houses and if they pay cash i wo n't be surprised if they actually end up paying much less for fresh organic vegetables than what equivalent produce at walmart would get them i apologize for not being able to provide citations for these points i make as they are personal observations

typically developing economics are marked by moderate to high inflation as they are growing at a faster pace higher in savings rate and higher lending rates if you reduce the lending rate more business start up will borrow at cheaper rate this in turn means lowers savings rate and leads to higher inflation to combat this central banks make borrowing expensive which lowers inflation and increases the saving rate essentially all these 3 are tied up as to why these countries offer higher interest on usd is because most of the developing countries have trade current account deficit they need to bring in more usd in the country one of the ways is to encourage non resident citizens to park their foreign earning back home ensuring more funds usd inflow   the rate differential also acts as a guide as to how the currency would be valued against usd for example if you get 8 on usd less than 12 had you converted same to rouble at the end of say 3 years the exchange rate between usd and rouble would factor that 4 ie rouble will go down developed countries on the other hand are marked by low inflation they have already achieved everything as there is no in growth it more they are also characterized by low savings and lending rates

it has got to do with the irrationality of humans   the so called long term investor is in it for the long term they are not worried about market fluctuations nor timing the market but yet they will aim to try to get a bargain when they buy in   it is contradictory in a way think about it if i buy a stock and it drops by 30 i am not worried because i am in it for the long term but i am worried about getting 1 off when i buy it   they usually tend to buy when the stock starts falling however what they do n’t realise is when a stock starts falling there is no telling when it will stop so even if they get a bargain for that day it is usually quickly wiped out a few days later instead of waiting for the price to find support and start recovering they are eager to buy what they think is a bargain i think this type of long term investing is very risky and the main reason is because the investor has no plan they just try to buy so called bargain stocks and hold them until they need the money usually in retirement but what happens if the stock price is lower when they want to retire than when they bought it i hope no long term investor was trying to retire in 2008 if they simply had a plan to indicate when they would buy and under what conditions they would sell and have a risk management plan in place then maybe they could reduce their risk somewhat and conserve their capital a good article to read on this is what 's wrong with long term investing

you could try to refine your options strategy   for instance you could buy the usd 750 call you mentioned and at the same time sell short call options with a higher strike price which is above the share price level you expect that apple will trade at in one year for instance usd 1,100   by doing this you would receive the premium of the call with the higher option which in turn would help you finance buying your usd 750 the net effect of this trading strategy would be that you would give up the extra profit you would earn if apple would rose above usd 1,100 the strike price of the call option sold short your total risk would be even less than with your actual strategy in my view

you do n't want to do that don't lie to the irs we live overseas as well and have researched this extensively you can not make $ 50k overseas and then say you only made $ 45k to put $ 5k into retirement   i have heard from some accountants and tax attorneys who interpret the law as saying that the irs considers foreign earned income as not being compensation when computing ira contribution limits regardless of whether or not you exclude it publication what is compensation scroll down a little to the what is not compensation section those professionals say that any amounts you can exclude not just ones you actually do exclude then there are others that say the can is not implied so be careful trying to use any foreign earned income to qualify for retirement contributions i have n't ran across anyone yet who has gotten caught doing it and paid the price but that does n't mean they are n't out there an alternative in certain cases there are two things you can do that we have found to have some sort of taxable income that is preferably not foreign so that you can contribute to a retirement account we do this by using capital gains from investments as income since our agi is always zero we pay no short or long term capital gains taxes as long as we keep short term capital gains lower than $ 45k   another way to contribute to a roth ira when you have no income is to do an ira rollover of course you need money in a tax deferred account to do this but this is how it works i always recommend those who have tax deferred ira 's and no agi due to the feie to roll over as much as they can every year to a roth ira that really is tax free money the only tax you 'll pay on that money is sales tax when you spend it =)

thanks for the writeup it was a really informative read i 've been aware for a while now that reagan and were in a large way the start of most of the current problems in the economic and political landscape but you filled in a few gaps that were really useful for me   so i guess ultimately a lot of conservatives see it as a kind of necessary evil in order to bring about the success story that the current economy needs right now unfortunately their strategy is totally wrong that kind of makes sense with my observation that rather than supporting the cronyism and corruption they turn a blind eye to it because they think it 's necessary   my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value the modern banking crisis was a great example of the ability to generate wealth while in fact destroying real value

a bona fide company never needs your credit card details certainly not your on back of card to issue a refund   on an older charge they might have to work with their merchant provider   but they should be able to do it within the credit card handling system and in fact are required to   asking for details via email does n't pass the sniff test either   to get a credit card merchant account a company needs to go through a security assessment process called pci security gets into you pretty good   of course they could be using one of the dumbed down services like square but those services make refunds ridiculously easy    how did you come to be corresponding on this email address   did they initially contact you   did you find it on a third party website   some of those are fraudulent and many others like yelp it 's very easy to insert false contact information for a business consumer forums even moreso   you might take another swing at finding a proper contact for the company   stop asking for a cheque   that also the credit card system   and obviously a scammer wo n't send a check at least not one you 'd want   if all else fails call your bank and tell them you want to do a chargeback on that transaction   this is where the bank to reverse the charge   it 's rather straightforward especially if the merchant has agreed in principle to a refund but requires some paperwork or e paperwork    do n't chargeback lightly   do n't use it casually or out of laziness or unwillingness to speak with the merchant e.g. to cancel an order   the bank charges the merchant a $ 20 or larger investigation fee separate from the refund   each chargeback is also a strike too many strikes and the merchant is barred from taking credit cards it 's serious business    as a merchant i would never send a cheque to an angry customer   because if i did they 'd cash the cheque and still do a chargeback so then i 'd be out the money twice plus the investigation fee to boot

it depends on whether or not you are referring to realized or unrealized gains   if the asset appreciation is realized meaning you 've sold the asset and actually collected liquidity from it then has provided a good route to follow    however if the gains are unrealized meaning only that the current value of the underlying have increased or decreased then you might want to record this under an income unrealized gains account   one of the main distinctions between the two are whether or not you have a taxable event realized or just want to better track your net worth at a given time unrealized    for example i generally track my retirement accounts increase in value sans interest dividends and contributions as income from an income unrealized gains account   i can still reconcile it with my statements and it shows an accurate picture for my net worth but the money is not liquid nor taxed and is more for informational purposes than anything    and no i do n't create an additional expense account here to track losses   just think of unrealized gains as an income account where the balance will fluctuate up and down and potentially even go negative over time

without knowing actual numbers it 's tough to say   personally i would pay off the car then going forward use the money that would have been paid on your car note toward your mortgage   i always think of things in the worst possible scenario   it 's easier and faster to repossess a car than to foreclose on real estate   also in an emergency situation depleting your fund for your car loan and your mortgage would be significantly more detrimental than only paying a mortgage with a car owned outright   fewer obligations means fewer things to draw down your funds in an emergency whether the tax deductability of the mortgage interest outweighs the lower rate on your car loan will depend on a lot of factors that have n't been shared   i think it 's safe to assume with only 1 of separation the real difference is n't significant   i think when determining which credit cards to pay off choosing the one with the highest rate is smart   but that 's not the situation you 're in if you do n't have foreclosure concerns i 'd still pay off the car then start investing

think about it this way if the strike price is $ 200 and cost of the option is $ 0.05 $ 200 + $ 0.05 is $ that does not mean that the price of buying the option is more neither is the option writer going to pay you $ 70 to buy the contract   when you are buying options you can only have a limited downside and that is the premium that you pay for it   in case of the $ 115 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $   in case of the $ 130 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $ this is due to the fact that the chances of aapl going to hit $ 130 is less than the chance of aapl hitting $ 115 therefore option writers offer the lower probability contracts at a lower price   long story short you do not pay for the strike price you only pay the premium and that premium keeps getting lower with and increase in strike decrease if it is a put option strike price is just a number that you expect the stock or index to break i would suggest you to read up a little more on pricing from here

in the united states short term capital gains are taxed at rates similar to regular income which is 25 if you make less than $ and 28 if you make more than that but less than $ 190,000 if you make more than $ 190,000 then the rate is 33 if you hold the stock for a year or more than the tax rate is 15 unless your income is less than $ in which case there is no tax on long term gains as a general rule the way to make money is to stay out of debt so i can not advise you to assume a mortgage financially you are better off investing your money much like you i bought a house with a mortgage using about $ 30,000 in a down payment about 20 years ago and i paid it off a few years ago if i had to do it over again i would have bought a shack a steel building for $ 30,000 and lived in that and invested my income if i had done that i would be about $ 500,000 richer today than i am now

there are multiple reasons why this may have happened 1 i could n't tell in your question whether or not you had already paid off the loan before requesting the rollover but if the loan was defaulted then the $ 9k left in your account is not but is there to pay back the remaining balance on your loan the $ 9k will be treated as income and will be taxed you will receive   a 1099-r detailing the taxes you 'll owe i do n't know why this was n't done when they did your rollover distribution typically it all happens at the same time but it can vary depending on the administrator 2 do you get some type of safe harbor discretionary match or profit sharing contribution if so perhaps this contribution was made after your account was liquidated so now there is residual money in your account and it is treated as a new distribution which incurs a new $ 60 distribution fee 3 stock if some of your investments were in stock these take a few extra days to liquidate typically a tpa recordkeeper would wait until all of the funds are liquidated before issuing the rollover but some companies may be shady and do it separately incurring an additional $ 60 distribution fee if this was the case i would go to your former employer 's hr and tell them what s happening and to start looking for a new 401(k administrator i hope this helps good luck

reit is to property as mutual fund is to stock   in others words a reit spreads your risk out over a greater number of properties making the return safer at the expense of both upside and downside risk on average both would average out to be the same that said you have a much wider range of outcomes when investing in a single property as with stocks over the long haul unless you think you can somehow beat the market is usually considered the better move   technically your roi is the same but your beta is much better in a reit

there are two reasons leases are generally a worse deal than buying first inherent in the lease is the concept of trading in the car at the end of the lease term as we all know cars depreciate the most in the first year or two by repeatedly leasing cars on short time frames you own the vehicles during those most expensive years of course there 's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing when buying be it via cash or loan but leasing builds in a schedule and encourages you to stick to it second it is easier for the dealer salesperson to hide things from the consumer in a lease contract most salespeople will try to get a car purchaser to focus on the monthly payment or they 'll four box the purchaser but even then there 's only 4 numbers and most consumers have a rough idea what they are and what they mean but in a lease the numbers in question are renamed and price becomes capitalized cost interest rate becomes money factor and is divided by 2400 making it look really small and not easily without a calculator or pencil and paper down payment becomes a capitalized cost reduction there 's a new concept residual value neither of those reasons change when interest rate is lower

you ca n't short a stock unless there is someone willing and able to lend shares to you and there are several reasons why that might not be the case first is a new stock which means that no one has held it very long it 's much easier to short ibm or exxon mobil where there are some long term holders who would like to earn a little extra money lending you their shares but if everyone involved is busy buying or selling the stock there wo n't be many people to lend it that 's not manipulation that 's just the market another reason may be a large short interest that is many others have shorted it before you that 's dangerous for you because if some lenders want to pull their shares off the market they can cause a short squeeze that will drive the price much higher   and stock shortages can be orchestrated by the company or large investors to artificially drive the price higher unless you have a lot of experience do n't try shorting small cap stocks try to gain some experience with large caps like ibm or exxon mobil first those are stocks that people at least ca n't play games with you will win or lose based on the market itself

in the uk at least dealers definitely want you to take finance they get benefits from the bank which are not for doing this these benefits translate directly to increased commission and internal rewards for the individual salesman it 's conceivable that the salesman will be less inclined to put himself out for you in any way by your deal as much as you 'd like if he 's not going to get incentives out of it indeed since he 's taking a hit on his commission from you paying in cash it 's in his best interests to perhaps be with you during price negotiation so will the salesman be frustrated with you if you choose to pay in cash yes absolutely though this may manifest in different ways in some cases the dealer will offer to pay off the finance for you allowing you to pay directly in cash while the dealer still gets the bank referral reward so that everyone wins this is a behind the scenes secret in the industry which is not made public for obvious reasons it 's arguably on fraud if the salesman likes you and trusts you then you may be able to get such an arrangement if this does not seem likely to occur i would not go out of my way to disclose that i am planning to pay with cash that being said you 'll usually be asked very early on whether you are seeking to pay cash or credit the salesman wants to know for the reasons outlined above and there is little use lying about it when you 're shortly going to have to come clean anyway

several people here have highlighted the incentive agency problems that tend to naturally arise when mortgages however the market for mortgage backed securities has existed for decades and during most of that time these agency problems were held in check moreover academics knew about this problem even before the credit crisis and actually recommended the use of in order to avoid the moral hazard problems associated with securitization see 2005   so to give a compelling historical explanation for why the crisis happened when it did you need to explain what changed in the mortgage securitization market to enable these previously agency relationships to breakdown   so what changed in short the growth of the market for cdos collateralized debt obligations composed of mortgage backed securities and not the mbs market itself this market grew so rapidly in the because the ratings agencies created an opportunity for banks to take low rated mbs debt and give it a higher rating by merely it into a cdo it was ratings arbitrage through and through explanations that place the brunt of the blame on the i.e. fannie and freddie can not adequately explain why the majority of mortgage related losses during the credit crisis were concentrated in cdos of mbss and not in the vanilla mbs market   here 's what happened back in the day say pre early 2000s the agency incentive problems that naturally arise in mortgage securitization were held in check by careful institutional investors who would rigorously assess the default risk of the higher risk mbs tranches they had a deep knowledge of the mortgage business sometimes they would even go so far as manually examining the loan documentation the profile of the borrowers the quality of the collateral and so on there were a lot of buyers who were happy to purchase the aaa and aa tranches but they could afford to be because the banks who were mbss knew that without selling to the discriminating buyers of higher risk debt they would n't be able to break even    it worked a bit like a market for fine wines i do n't know much about wine but when i walk into a shop that sells fine wines i can be reasonably certain that there will be a reasonably strong relationship between price and the quality of the wine basically i get to free ride off the superior discrimination of the wine who regularly visit the shop   once the ratings agencies created the now infamous ratings arbitrage between the mbs and cdo markets the market for cdos on mbss expanded as this market grew these discriminating buyers became a proportionally smaller part of the mbs market the folks building cdos of mbss did n't know very much about the mortgage business itself instead they tended to rely on statistical default models provided by the ratings agencies that predicted the probability of mortgage default based on quantitative variables such as borrowers credit scores loan to value ratios etc    the problem is that these models used historical data that was collected back when the discriminating institutional investors kept the agency problems in the mbs market in check the growth of the cdo market spurred even more mortgage securitization which led lending standards to deteriorate because firms like countrywide knew that the cdo buyers only cared about credit scores ltv ratios etc however buyers of mbs were unable to detect these changes in default risk because the models they were using to see those changes were becoming invalidated by the growth of the cdo market itself   if you want to read more about this i 'd highly recommend 's 2011 paper in the american journal of sociology see here it 's a detailed historical account of the changes in valuation practices models used within the mbs and cdo markets and how these practices became invalidated as the cdo market grew in size   tl;dr the credit ratings created a ratings arbitrage that the banks took advantage of they are as much if not more at fault as the   for more info on the deterioration in mortgage quality in the check out    keys benjamin and 2008 did securitization lead to lax screening evidence from subprime loans   and 2008 the failure of models that predict failure distance incentives and defaults december   also the citation i mentioned above   p. 2005 the pooling and of securities a model of informed review of economic studies 35 2005

you 're missing the strategy for the tactics the whole point of capitalism is the improved efficiency possible through the price system of value the price system of value only delivers this efficiency when free markets exist when markets are not free then capitalism becomes very inefficient and you get unemployment inequality and other poor outcomes in response to this people demand socialist policies and if they do n't get them eventually you get against the rich communism etc   as far as your attempts to defend david siegel 's ethics i just do n't see where you 're coming from what if he does n't feel inclined to take my offer is he also responsible for my death but more importantly why are you defending bottom feeding pond scum like siegel

technically it 's only when you need to pass money through however consider that the length the account has been open builds history with the financial institution so i 'd open asap longer history with the bank can help with getting approved for things like business credit lines business cards and other perks though if you 're not making money with that business seek out a bank that does not charge money to have a business account open with them

market capitalization is the product of the current share price the last time someone sold a share of the stock how much times the number of outstanding shares of stock summed up over all of the stock categories assuming the efficient market hypothesis and a liquid market this gives the current total value of the companies assets both tangible and intangible both the emh and perfect liquidity may not hold at all times beyond those theoretical problems in practice someone trying to buy or sell the company at that price is going to be in for a surprise the fact that someone wants to sell that many stocks or buy that many stocks will move the price of the company stock

401ks and iras are types of retirement accounts they have rules regarding maximum amount of investments per year who can invest and the tax treatment of the growth   stock bonds mutual funds etfs are all types of investments that can exist either inside or outside of the retirement account some 401ks restrict the type of investments you can have others allow you to own almost anything any investment is a risk and there is no guarantee that it will grow   look around the site for beginning investment advice you should start with the 401 k offered by your company especially if they have matching funds that is free money many suggest you invest enough to get the match then invest with an ira look into iras because under us tax law you can still make a 2013 investment up until tax day 2014 take the time before tax day to decide on roth or regular ira    the more exotic investments take more time to understand and should not be a concern until you have laid out your basic retirement accounts

i am only familiar with american banks but generally speaking they will work with you if you can demonstrate that you have an adequate average income over a period of time it is likely they will want a record of your income for at least the last 24 months more would be better the terms of the individual contracts i.e. termination clauses etc should n't be important as long as you have a demonstrated history of making a good income i 'd recommend finding a bank that performs manual underwriting i.e. they actually have someone on staff that will look at your credit history income debt ratios as opposed to them just generating an offer based on a computer model lending standards can vary quite a bit from bank to bank and you have not listed your average annual income so it is difficult to say whether they will offer you a mortgage or for what amount but you have a significant down payment however assuming that your numbers are good and that you can find someone intelligent to work with it 's unlikely that they will deny you simply because your income is uneven best of luck

most of the investors who have large holdings in a particular stock have pretty good exit strategies for those positions to ensure they are getting the best price they can by selling gradually into the volume over time putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason let 's say you have 100,000 shares of a stock and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them take your profits and ride off into the sunset   so you call your broker or log into your brokerage account and put them up for sale   he puts in an order somewhere the stock is sold and your account is credited seems simple right   well not so fast professionals i 'm keeping this simple so please do n't beat me up for it the way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as market makers   these are entities which sit between the markets and you and your broker and when you want to buy or sell a stock most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker   if you work with a large brokerage firm sometimes they 'll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts but that 's another story it is normal for there to be many sometimes hundreds of market makers who are all trading in the same equity   the bigger the stock the more market makers it attracts   they all compete with each other for business and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock google apple and microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks it is very competitive   the way the makers compete is on price   it might surprise you to know that it is the market makers not the markets that decide what a stock will buy or sell for each market maker sets their own prices for what they 'll pay to buy from sellers for and what they 'll sell it to buyers for   this is called respectively the bid and the ask prices   so if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock   the prices you see for stocks are what are called the best bid and best ask prices   what that means is you are being shown the highest bid price what you can sell your shares for and the best ask price what you can buy those shares for because that 's what is required   that being said there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher   many times there will be a big of market makers all at the same bid ask or within fractions of a cent of each other all competing for business   trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can the point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at   they adjust those prices based among other factors on how much buying and selling volume they 're seeing   if they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then they 'll start marking down their bid prices   this keeps them from paying too much for shares they 're going to have to find a buyer for eventually and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell   conversely if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system they 'll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains since they 're selling you shares they bought from someone else presumably at a lower price   but they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades   sneaky eh depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company you 're selling and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the share 's price if the block is large enough then it 's possible it will not all sell to one market maker or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price this is a pretty complex subject as you can see and i 've cut a lot of corners and oversimplified much to keep it   but the short answer to your question is it depends hope this helps good luck

retail purchases are purchases made at retail i.e. as a consumer individual customer that would include any standard individual expenditure but may exclude wholesale sales or purchases from merchants who identify themselves as service providers to businesses specifics of these limitations really depend on your card issuer and you should inquire with the customer service at what are their specific eligibility requirements as an example here in the us many cards give high cash back for gasoline purchases but only at retail locations that excludes wholesale club sellers like costco for example

in principle the stock price should see no change in the days leading up to an earnings announcement and then at the moment of the announcement the stock price should move in the direction of the earnings surprise relative to the market 's belief of what earnings were going to be in practice stock prices tend to drift a little in the direction of the surprise shortly before the announcement and the associated price jump this could be because smart investors were able to replicate the computations to predict the announcement or because information gets illegally leaked ahead of the announcement   so i guess your bullet point b is a likely scenario note that hedging activity in the options market will not affect stock price one way or another   options transfer risk from one party to another but net to zero   intense hedging activity may be able to push up the price of options increasing the implied volatility but it should n't affect the price of a stock one way or the other for this reason bullet point a is not the case note that price behavior after the announcement is also interesting it seems to take some time to reach the correct price instead of jumping directly to it as economists would predict    this phenomenon is known as post earnings announcement drift

if the foreclosed property is sold for more than is owed then the borrower is entitled to the excess if sold for what is owed or less then the borrower gets nothing any money that you are entitled to would be determined by your contract with the mortgaged owner but the bank is the first lien holder they get made whole first and if there is excess then you may see some of your money back depending on your contract with the mortgaged owner since the bank owns the property until the mortgage is paid off you would have had to work with the bank in order to have legal ownership of a portion of the house and approving partial sale of a house is not something most banks would likely care to do a contract you worked up with the borrower does n't give you legal claim to the house in foreclosure at least due to the bank 's lien you 'd have to contact a lawyer for firm answers but it sounds bleak

this is a purely numerical statement that you should be able to check and you cpa friend should be able to prove if true   the general advice i think is that you should not use your retirement funds this way but general advice does not apply equally well to everyone    you did n't give enough information for us to compute the answer so you 're on your own there   if you do this or have the cpa do it make sure that it accounts for all pluses and minuses that you 'll have   on the minus side you get any direct penalties in addition to potential loss of right to contribute for a period of time so make sure you consider both aspects especially to any degree that you would lose an employer contribution or match   also consider the fact that the money already in is tax advantaged and you wo n't be able to replace that amount later   so there will be a compounding effect to what was lost this may or may not be balanced by a mortgage interest deduction down the road my guess is that it will not but again the details of your situation may dictate a different path   the mortgage interest deduction decreases each year as you pay more principal whereas the compounding from being tax deferred tends to increase each year

it used to be quite easy for students to get credit cards when i was in college in the early 1980s credit card companies set up tables in the student center and offered low limit cards along with free t shirts on an almost daily schedule the credit card act of 2009 made this much more difficult for banks if you have a bank or credit union account the first thing i would do is talk to them about getting a card some banks offer a visa student card specifically for college students my daughter was able to get one when she turned 18 just before starting college the credit limit is very low $ 200 for increasing each year until the limit is $ 500 during senior year after graduation it converts to a regular visa account with a limit that depends on post graduation income and the now established 4 years of credit history the visa web site has a list of banks offering this type of card now i will give you the same unsolicited advice i gave my daughter and the same advice i think most others here would give you for building credit this kind of card is excellent but you should still use it very sparingly and pay off the balance every month make it a hard rule to never pay interest on a credit card bill i told her to charge perhaps one or two purchases totaling no more than $ each month and pay them off as soon as the statement arrives this is much easier if you have a deposit account at the same bank since you will be able to pay the bill instantly on line have your employer direct deposit your paychecks into that bank account if at all possible

all the answers that show the equivalency of 401(k pre tax and roth 401(k post tax using equivalent contributions are correct assuming equivalent tax rates upon withdrawal there is some potential gain if your tax rate upon retirement is higher than your working tax rate but often people calculate a smaller percentage of their working income for their retirement income which may offset a higher tax rate anyway in my mind the primary advantage of a roth 401(k is that it effectively allows you to contribute more for retirement if you are currently maxing out your contributions in a regular 401(k and ira and want to contribute more doing so can be a big advantage when you are young and can benefit from those additional dollars being put into your retirement account early this is effectively what is illustrated by the fidelity calculation and is something to consider if you are of the mind to aggressively save early for retirement the reason roth allows you to contribute more is because traditional ira contributions are capped suppose the cap is $ 5500 suppose also you immediately rollover your traditional ira to a roth ira this is a post tax contribution and growth on that is tax free if you maxed out your employer pre tax 401(k to $ and maxed out your ira you have maxed out your retirement contributions to $ suppose two then the 401(k has grown to $ and the ira has grown to $ however the withdrawal from the 401(k is taxed so assuming 25 the total is $ after tax now suppose instead you maxed out your employer roth 401(k post tax instead so you have put in $ post tax and now also max out your ira now all of your $ grows tax free so upon two you walk away with $ this is because you maxed out your contribution post tax meaning it was as if you were allowed to contribute $ to your pre tax 401(k so if you intend to max out your retirement account contributions and are looking to contribute even more to retirement accounts one way is two change over to contributing into the employer roth 401(k

you raise several points 1 your citation on family income decline 2 i 'm not denying anything i just think that if one was going to say toy sales are down because people have less money then that argument also should hold for other non necessities like apps but that 's seemingly not the case idc december 2010 in 2010 these 300,000 + applications were downloaded billion times idc predicts that global downloads will reach billion in 2014 and will be worth us$ 35 billion research october 2011 predicts that there will be 29 billion apps downloaded in 2011 up from 9 billion in 2010 in q2 android apple in terms of app downloads with 44 percent of downloads compared to apple ’s 31 percent revenue from apps   june 2011 predicts that direct revenue from the sale of apps in app purchases and subscriptions across smartphones and tablets will be $ 7.3 billion in 2011 rising to $ billion by 2015 i could not specifically find data on game apps but given the overall rising tide of app sales it seems to follow that game apps would benefit from that too

i guess when the world finds out your missile shield is little more effective than a sanitary napkin .the tone changes   it seems obvious now that isis or what ever they call them now days are funded and supported by the israelis and americans    i think the giveaway was that the hardcore islamic fundamentalist terrorists bent upon the destruction of israel   could not find israel from syria

there are some circumstances in which it is a good idea chris w rea has already mentioned the case where you expect your marginal tax rate to decrease but there is also the case where lack of contributions might cause your marginal rate to increase assume your income is $ 20,000 over the 46 threshold and you normally contribute $ 20,000 to rrsp however this year you have only been able to contribute $ 10,000 if you wait until next year and contribute an extra $ 10,000 making $ 30,000 the extra $ 10,000 will only bring 35 tax back if you can borrow the money and make the contribution this year it will get 46 tax back that makes the loan worth taking making the contribution now can also get you a larger rebate this year you will have that money for twelve extra months and you can invest it that probably is n't enough to make it worthwhile alone but it certainly makes the damage less however i would always recommend taking out an rrsp loan for as short a time as possible my recommendation would always be to make the contribution as late in the period as possible apply for your tax refund as soon as you can and then pay off the loan with the refund you be able to get away with having the loan only for a couple of months

my recommendation is to pay off your student loans as quickly as possible it sounds like you 're already doing this but do n't incur any other large debts until you have this taken care of   i 'd also recommend not buying a car especially an expensive one on credit or lease either back during the dotcom boom i and many friends bought or leased expensive cars only to lose them or struggle paying for them when the bottom dropped out a car instantly depreciates and it 's quite rare for them to ever gain value again stick with reliable older used cars that you can purchase for cash if you do borrow for a car shop around for the best deal and avoid 3 + year terms if at all possible do n't lease unless you have a business structure where this might create a clear financial advantage avoid credit cards as much as possible although if you do plan to buy a house with a mortgage you 'll need to maintain some credit history if you have the discipline to keep your balance small and paid down you can use a credit card to build credit history however these things can quickly get out of hand and you 'll wonder why you suddenly owe $ 10 k $ 20 k or even more on them so be very careful with them as for the house speaking of us markets here save up for at least a 20 down payment if you can based on what you said this would be about $ 20 25k. this will give you a lot more flexibility to take advantage of deals that might come your way even if you do n't put it all into the house stretching to buy a house that 's too expensive can quickly lead to financial ruin as for house size i recommend purchasing a 4 bedroom house even if you are n't planning on kids right away it will resell better and you 'll appreciate having the extra space for storage home office hobbies etc also life has a way of changing your plans for having kids and such

the thing that makes me laugh is that sears got famous by innovating the mail order catalog   they then went to local stores and completely got caught out on same convention that they helped pioneer   simply putting images in peoples hands and letting them order the product   sears could still be around if it would have focused on a decent online distribution center

it 's not that they do n't understand email but that they do n't want to use it   it 's like the writer who still use old computers or typewriters because that 's what they feel comfortable with or who though is deeply involved in technology still does n't use a graphical browser   to a general how would email ever factor in on the as opposed to say radio systems

you question is a bit scary to me you show $ 2100 rent and let 's even assume that 's 100 i.e. never a vacancy rule of thumb is 10 vacancy depending on area a tenant may stay a year but when they leave you might need to have a bit of maintenance and miss 2 months rent you count the mortgage and taxes and are left with $ 500/mo where is the list of ongoing expenses i suggest you put that $ 500/mo into a separate account and let us know a year from now if anything is left to anthony 's point i agree 100 no one can tell you everything you need to know but whatever my answer or his other members with experience similar or different will add to this and in the end you 'll have a great overview the truth is that it 's easy for me to sit here and see what you may be missing by the way if you look at the rules of thumb they will make your head spin there are those who say the target is for the rent to be 2 of the value of the house but there are markets where this will never happen there 's another rule that says the expenses besides tax should be planned at 50 of the rent i.e. you should put aside $ 1000/mo for expenses over the long term the new house will be lower of course but in years past year 10 or so this number will start to look reasonable
