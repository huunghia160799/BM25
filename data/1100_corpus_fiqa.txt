you 're correct about the 401(k your employer 's contributions do n't count toward the $ 18k limit you 're incorrect about the iras though you can contribute a maximum of $ 5500 total across ira and roth ira not $ 5500 to each there are also limits once you reach higher levels of income from irs.gov retirement topics ira contribution limits for 2015 2016 and 2017 your total contributions to all of your traditional and roth iras can not be more than

your contribution limit to a 401(k is $ 18,000   your employer is allowed to contribute to your 401(k usually a matching contribution   that matching contribution comes from your employer so is not subject to your personal contribution limit a contribution to a regular 401(k is typically made with pre tax money i.e. you do n't pay payroll taxes on the money you contribute so you pay less taxes for the current tax year   however when you retire and you take money out you pay taxes on the money you take out   on one hand your tax rate may be lower when you have retired but on the other hand if your investments have appreciated over time the total amount of tax you pay would be higher if your company offers a roth 401(k plan you can contribute $ 18,000 of after tax money   this way you pay the tax on the $ 18,000 today as you would if you did not put the money in the 401(k but when you take the money out at retirement you would not have to pay tax   in my opinion that serves as a way to pay effectively more money into your 401(k some firms put vesting provisions on the amount that they match in your 401(k e.g. 4 years at 25 per year   so you have to work 1 full year to be entitled to 25 of their matching contribution 2 years for 50 and 4 years to receive all of it   check your company 's summary plan description of the 401(k to be sure you are not allowed to invest pre tax money into a traditional ira if you are already contributing to a 401(k plan and have reached the income limits $ agi for single head of household you are allowed to contribute post tax money to a traditional ira plan if you have already contributed to a 401(k which you can then roll over into a roth ira look up backdoor ira the ira contribution limit applies to all ira accounts over that calendar year   you could put some money in a traditional ira a roth ira another traditional ira etc so long as the total amount is not more than the contribution limit this gives you an upper limit of 5.5k + 18k = investments in retirement accounts note however once you reach age 50 these limits increase to ira + 24k 401(k   they also are adjusted periodically with the rate of inflation the following approach may be more efficient for building wealth this ordering is the subject of debate and people have different opinions there is a separate discussion of these priorities here   best way to start investing for a young person just starting their career note however a 401(k loan becomes payable if you leave your company and if not repaid is an distribution from your 401k and therefore subject to an additional 10 tax penalty you should also be careful putting money into an ira as you will be subject to an additional 10 tax penalty if you take out the money distribution before retirement unless one of the exceptions defined by the ira applies e.g. $ 10,000 for first time home purchase which could wipe out more than any gains you made by putting it in there in the first place your specific circumstances may vary so this approach may not be best for you   a registered financial advisor may be able to help ensure they are legitimate

the fact that he was even in reach was because amazon stock has been doing well lately up 36 in the past year though it should be noted that microsoft is up 30 in the same time period   the fact that it did n't last long was just because of daily fluctuations which were responsible for both randomly pushed him up over the threshold and pushing him back down again   it is still really close and he could easily swap places will bill gates several times over the next few weeks until longer term trends take over and start to push them a little further apart and one of them emerges the winner for now

well you you purchased the shares at a weighted average price of $ per share 350k at $ 2.00 and 50k at $ 1.50 the shares are now trading at $ 1.50 assuming the market has n't changed since you last purchased stock so you 're down $ share from the stock but you have received share in dividends you are down $ share which means on paper you have lost $ on your $ investment down of total investment so i 'd say the investment is not performing well no if a stock pays a dividend it usually should not dip 25 unless something is up with the business i can not think of any example where an investment can be said to be performing well while at the same time the stock price decreases unless you are shorting the stock

one thing that has not been pointed out as a disadvantage of using credit cards   people tend to spend more   you can see this study and this one plus about 500 others   on average people tend to spend about 17 more with credit cards then with cash   this amount any perks one gets by having a credit card    the safest way to use one is to only use them for purchases where you can not make a decision to spend more   one example would be for utility bills that do n't charge a fee or at the gas pump using them at amazon might have you upgrade your purchase or add some extra items   using them at restaurants might encourage you to order an extra drink or two   using them at the coffee shop might have you super size your coffee or add a    of course this extra spending could lead you into a debt cycle exacerbating the financial hit many struggle with   please tread carefully if you decide to use them

graphs are nothing but a representation of data every time a trade is made a point is plotted on the graph after points are plotted they are joined in order to represent the data in a graphical format   think about it this way   1 walmart shuts at 12 am is selling almonds at $ 10 a pound   3 walmart says that the price is going to reduce to $ 9 effective tomorrow 4 you are inside the store buying almonds at pm   5 till you make your way up to the counter it is already am so the store is technically shut 6 however they allow you to purchase the almonds since you were already in there   7 you purchase the almonds at $ 9 since the day has changed 8 so you have made a trade and it will reflect as a point on the graph 9 when those points are joined the curves on the graph will be created 10 the data source is walmart 's system as it reflects the sale to you in your case the nyse exchange records this trade made buying a stock is just like buying almonds there has to be a buyer there has to be a seller there has to be a price to which both agree as soon as all these conditions are met and the trade is made it is reflected on the graph the only difference between the graphs from 9 pm and 4 am is the time the trade has happened regardless and any other stock exchange has recorded it the graph is just made from that data cheers

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

i do n't even know where to begin you 're truly all over the place the number of upvotes on your post has absolutely zero relevance to the fact that you believe trump has caused this minuscule reduction in the deficit you literally said it yourself you posted an article and stated let 's discuss and then when it was discussed your argument was completely refuted in a heartbeat why did n't you respond to 's post he laid out a rational argument to refute your opinion however you unfortunately did n't have the facts or understanding on the subject to back your opinion so instead you stayed away from that comment argument because it did n't reflect your biased way of thinking this is the basis of which the shrinking pro trump base now stand they project their opinions then cherry pick the feedback that helps them feel good about their opinions while refusing to respond to any arguments that have factual information amp merit   i 'm going to give you some advise is n't a good place for you to learn about the basics of economics and i know you do not know the bare basics because anyone with any clue about how modern economics works knows that a president can not enact true economic growth or can significantly reduce a national budget deficit in 8 months while not introducing amp passing one piece of meaningful legislature or enacting any piece of their economic agenda which both sides of the aisle are fully aware amp accept that trump has n't been able to accomplish yet   now this is going to put you in a tough spot the s&amp;p under obama was up 30 after his first 8 months in office by your rational obama grew the overall wealth of the top 500 companies in the u.s. by 30 before he was able to enact any legislature but no obama could n't have done that because he only introduced destructive economic legislature from the get go therefore the president must have no control over economic success or failure within their first year of the presidency before they can make use of their economic agenda however that would go against your entire argument you set forward in this post puts you in a bit of a    sorry for the long response it 's just tough seeing someone make repeated simple basic economic mistakes in the subreddit feel free to pm me if you 're looking for some good books to get you started

johnfx and provide excellent answers researching prices others have paid being up front that you 'll go buy a junker car to hold you over if they wo n't meet your price and playing a few dealerships off of each other are all great tactics in addition i 've got a few points about timing your purchase if you 're not desperate for a car these can really help give you the upper hand in negotiations wait until the end of the month dealerships and individual salespeople usually have quotas that they 're trying to clear and the month is usually the standard cutoff the last time i bought a car the salesman made the mistake of mentioning i do n't usually work but i 'll be in this thursday thursday was the 31st i inferred from this information that he had n't made his quota for the month yet so i came back on the 31st to negotiate and managed to hammer out a pretty good deal wait until about an hour before the dealership closes to show up and shop this gives you enough time to not be obvious about the tactic but you 'll definitely be holding them past their normal quitting time if you do much negotiating the salesman will be   a little more inclined to make a deal so he can get home and have dinner bonus points if you can wait until a month that ends on a friday

sure user data is valuable but valuable enough to be their business model the math does n't add up   if the data is that valuable then why even charge users in the first place letting people in free would certainly generate even more data definitely more than what they would have gotten at their $ 10 price point if they get twice as many people to jump in at the free price level not a far fetched assumption then they would make enough additional money to justify giving it away   and after a certain point additional data stops being statistically significant while costs continue to mount paying for all those additional tickets   furthermore the ceo has already said that their business model is to share the additional revenue with the theaters   i 'm not saying that they wo n't mine their data they would be fools not to and they will definitely be able to monetize it but it 's not possible for that alone to be their business model how can it every time they send someone to a new movie it costs them the full ticket price

let me ask you something else if you knew about a company that makes $ 1 million of profit per year and growing with costs that are half that would you not be interested to have a stake in this company   of course you would and because the shares can be publicly bought you can i do n't think you 'd care if it 's an asset manager or some other company   an asset manager can do a lot with the capital it raises it could get bigger and better offices invest in a better computer system maybe get faster access to exchange information better information terminals have more money for marketing and road shows but the really big cash usually goes to acquire new talent you might not need that much money for support staff but a sales manager can be expensive and a good fund manager can easily cost a high 7 to 8 figure number per year

first piece of advice fire your agent    a pushy agent is a bad agent   from what you 've told us he 's actually given you poor advice regarding mortgage interest rates   rates are already at historic lows   that and the state of the world economy mean that further rate cuts are more likely in the near term second piece of advice while more information on the real estate market you 're in would help   going in at asking price is rarely a good idea    sale prices from the last few years are not relevant to what you should pay because the last few years include a financial crisis caused in large part by the bursting of a housing bubble   they could be even less relevant depending on your location because of a spike in foreclosures in certain areas of the u.s.   there was already a ton of housing inventory before so an increase due to foreclosures is going to depress prices further   now that banks are finally practicing the due diligence they should have been all along your ability to be pre approved for large mortgage amount puts you in a strong position    use a tool like zillow or to see what properties in that area have sold for over the past six months   you should also be able to see a history of what prices the particular property you 're interested in has been offered and/or sold at in the past   also check and see how long the particular property you 're interested in has been on the market   if it 's been on the market more than 60 90 days it 's priced too high

ira contributions are limited you can not dump the excess into a retirement account like an ira if the excess is more than $ 5500 furthermore as points out you need to have earned income technical term is compensation and it includes self employment income not just wages to contribute to an ira and the limit mentioned above is actually the lesser of your earned income and $ 5500 there are other limitations for people with high gross income but these likely will not affect you on the positive side if your earned income is small you can contribute your entire taxable earned income including the money withheld by your employer for social security and medicare tax and federal state and local income taxes to an ira not just your take home pay for example if your earned income is $ 5500 and take home pay after tax withholding is $ 5000 you are still entitled to contribute $ 5500 so where do you get that withheld money from so that it can be put into your ira well it can come from the student loan or interest earned from a bank or from the dividends and capital gains on your investments etc money is fungible it is not the case that only the cash received or deposited into your bank account as your take home pay can be contributed subject to other limitations mentioned your earned income can be contributed not just your take home pay

generally a one time thing is considered a gift for the donor this is obviously not a deductible expense except for some specific cases for example promotional gifts under $ 25 to vendors can be deducted if you 're a business or charitable contributions to a recognized charity however if this is a regular practice that would not be considered as a gift but rather as a tax fraud a criminal offense being attentive i would like to make a little gift or give some little    < 100 $ amount of money cash wire online for that why generally gift is exempt from income if no services were provided and the gift was made in good faith in the situation you describe this does n't hold when the gift is exempt from income to the receiver the donor pays the tax in this case below exemption the tax is zero if the gift is not exempt from income to the receiver it is no longer a gift and the receiver is paying income taxes not the donor the situation you describe is a classic tax evasion scheme if someone does it consistently and regularly as a receiver donor or both he would likely end up in jail

from investopedia a stock split is usually done by companies that have seen their share    price increase to levels that are either too high or are beyond the    price levels of similar companies in their sector the primary motive    is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though    the underlying value of the company has not changed from wikipedia it is often claimed that stock splits in and of themselves lead to    higher stock prices research however does not bear this out what    is true is that stock splits are usually initiated after a large run    up in share price stock splits do increase the liquidity of a stock    there are more buyers and sellers for 10 shares at $ 10 than 1 share at    $ 100 some companies have the opposite strategy by refusing to split    the stock and keeping the price high they reduce trading volume    berkshire hathaway is a notable example of this something more to on why warren buffett is against stock splits

i am not sure if this is the actual reason or not but all of the major credit cards visa mastercard amex discover provide damage insurance coverage on car rentals debit cards do not usually provide this coverage so if you use a credit card the car company knows it will be able to recover the cost of any damage to the car   of course this does n't explain some of the odd debit card policies out there for example will not let you use a debit card unless you provide proof of round trip travel like a plane or cruise ticket but you can use a credit card without having a travel ticket i 'm not sure how having a travel ticket makes debit card users less of a risk but apparently it does somehow

so it seems like a lot of people here are n't exactly sure about why this works and its financial implications    so what you are referring to is in finance something called funds transfer pricing or ftp often referred to as just transfer pricing like anything else ftp has its place most companies however do n't use it properly ftp theoretically has one primary purpose although it 's developed a second to properly allocate opportunity costs across divisions   let 's say company a produces widgets they sell these widgets for $ 200 at a total cost of $ 150 and book profits of $ 50 now to produce the widget division 1 makes a computer chip at a cost of $ 50 that it then sells to division 2 for $ 60 division 1 then books a profit of $ 10 division 2 then makes some plastic stuff and the device this is labor intensive so division 2 's costs are $ 100 company a sells the completed device for $ 150 division 2 subsequently books profits of $ 40 and appears much more profitable than division 1 on the surface   the problem arises when division 1 could sell the chip to the open market for $ 125 now it costs them $ 50 to produce and they could make a theoretical profit of $ 75 this is more than the company makes as a whole on the entire device by having division 2 pay effectively fair market price for that chip you realize that division 2 is really operating at a loss the opportunity cost of not selling the chip to market is greater than producing the completed device company a would be better off getting rid of division 2 and solely focusing on division 1 in a good ftp system division 2 would pay the fair market price of $ 125 if done properly management would   hopefully realize it should divest division 2   that 's the fundamental premise behind ftp in actuality things get much more complicated because of economics the company itself branding it operations management labor laws etc that s why most companies screw it up all that other stuff falls under what s called cost allocation accounting it gets very complex and entire masters courses are dedicated to it different methods etc    the other thing you can do with ftp is get crazy tax breaks due to various tax laws the simplified explanation is that divisions pay taxes on profits to the government that division is located in this works on the state level too btw ge does a lot of this and it 's a big part of why they pay almost no taxes again it gets more complicated when you involve audits as there 's some grey area legally    for simplicity assume tax rates are 40 in the us and 10 in india so let 's say ge makes an airplane engine in the us but finishes manufacturing in india these specific engines costs $ 5,000,000 for the us division to make up to a certain point   the us division can then sell the engine at a break even to india so india pays $ 5,000,000 for the engine the us division then books no profit india finishes the manufacturing with additional costs of $ 1,000,000 the india division then sells the engine to the open market for $ therefore the india division books a profit of $ and pays taxes of $ 300,000 now ge as a whole makes a profit of $ less taxes of $ 300,000 = net profit of $   further let 's say the fair market value of the engine as is when the us sells to india is $ that would mean us should book profits of $ 2,000,000 and india should book profits of $ 1,000,000 total taxes by ge are now $ 800,000 us + $ 100,000 india = $ 900,000 however what 's important is that net profit is now $ ge just saved $ 600,000 in taxes by doing the beauty of this is divisions are supposed to charge fair market value for products internationally however it 's really hard for the irs to say what the value of an unfinished product really is heck you could be offering bulk discounts etc   the fact is often us divisions have skilled labor that is difficult to replicate elsewhere they just show us divisions operating at losses to make the company as a whole better the problem again arises when top management do n't fully appreciate or understand the reasoning behind this stuff they end up making cuts to us labor because it 's unprofitable without thinking about the entire story    i know this is very long winded but hope it helps   tldr companies ftp to recognizes profitability and opportunity costs of divisions as well as use it for overseas tax breaks   side note politically speaking people who know how this works are pissed off about it in the u.s. do n't worry though most politicians on both sides do n't have a clue we have high corporate tax rates relative to other countries and irs loopholes allow this kind of thing lobbying $ $ it 's also why economically you ca n't just raise corporate tax rates to increase domestic tax as more companies will just implement this process it 's complicated to do properly also please do n't say 50 years ago tax rates were higher and raising taxes increased receipts the fact is most companies could n't even fathom doing this 50 years ago no less even 20   edit some clarification in wording

i will attempt to answer three separate questions here the standard answer is that an emergency fund should not be in an investment that can lose value   the safest course of action is to put it in a savings account or other very low risk investment somewhere this question becomes can a reasonable and low risk investment in sweden be comparable to or better than a low risk investment in brazil inflation in brazil has averaged a little less than 6 over the last 10 years with a recent spike up above 8   a cursory search indicates interest rates on savings accounts in brazil are outpacing inflation so you might still expect a positive return on money in a savings account there by contrast sweden 's inflation rate has been around 1 over the last 10 years and has around 0 or even deflation in recent years   swedish interest rates for savings accounts right now are very low nearly 0   putting money in a savings account in sweden would likely hold its value or lose a slight amount of value based on this you might be better off leaving your emergency fund invested in in brazil the answer to this a little unclear   the brazilian stock market has been all over the place in the last 10 years with a slight trend in recent years   in comparison sweden 's stock market has shown fairly consistent growth in spite of the big dip in 2008   given this it seems like the fairest comparison would your current 13 roi investment in brazil vs. a fund or etf that tracks the swedish stock market index if we assume a consistent 13 roi on your investment in brazil and a consistent inflation rate of 6 your adjusted roi there would be around 7 per year the etf that tracks the swedish 30 index has a 10 year annualized return of   if you subtract 0.8 inflation you get an adjusted roi 9 based on this sweden may be a safer place for longer term moderate risk investments right now

your question is very widely making it difficult to reply to but i can provide my thoughts on at least the following part of the question i have a 401k plan with t. rowe price should i use them for other investments too using your employer 's decision on which 401k provider they 've chosen as a basis for making your own decision on a broker for investing $ 100k when you do n't even know what kind of investments you want seems relatively unwise to me even if one of your focuses is simplicity   that is unless your $ 100k is tax advantaged e.g. an ira or other 401k and your drive for simplicity means you 'd be happy to add $ 100k to any of your existing 401k investments   in which case you should look into whether you can roll the $ 100k over into your employer 's 401k program for the rest of my answer i 'll assume the $ 100k is not tax advantaged i assume you 're suggesting this idea because of some perceived bundling of the relationship and ease of dealing with one company website   yes they may be able to combine both accounts into a single login and you may be able to interact with both accounts with the same basic interface but that 's about where the sharing will end   and even those benefits are n't guaranteed   for example i still have a separate site to manage my money in my employer 's 401k fidelity than i do for my brokerage banking accounts fidelity   the investment options are n't the same for the two types of accounts so the interface for making and monitoring investments is n't either and you wo n't be able to co mingle funds between the 401k and non tax advantaged money anyway so you 'll have two different accounts to deal with even if you have a single provider   given that you 'll have two different accounts you might as well pick a broker provider for the $ 100k that gives you the best investment options lowest fees and best ui experience for your chosen type goal of investments i would strongly recommend figuring out how you want to invest the $ 100k before trying to figure out which provider to use as a broker for doing the investment

well as you say the instructions for form w-2 for your employer to fill out say you must report all employer contributions including    an employee 's contributions through a cafeteria plan to    an hsa in box 12 of form w-2 with code w. employer    contributions to an hsa that are not from the    income of the employee also must be reported in boxes 1    3 and 5 however while it 's your employer 's job to fill out w-2 correctly it 's only your job to file your taxes correctly especially as you say your box income is correct this is n't too hard to do you should file form 8889 with your return and report the contributions on line 9 as employer contributions and as you say both what the employer contributed outright and what you had deducted from your pay are both employer contributions be sure to keep your final pay stub for the year or other documentation showing that your employer did contribute that amount just in case the irs does end up questioning it for some reason   if you really want to you could try calling the irs and letting them know that you have contributions that were n't reported on your w-2 to see if they want to follow up with your employer about correcting their documentation if your efforts have been fruitless there 's even a faq page on the irs site about how to contact them when your employer is n't giving you a correct w-2 and how to fill out a form instead of using the w-2 which i 'd recommend if the amount of income listed was wrong or if there were some other more major problem with the form most likely though since it 's not going to affect the amount of tax anybody will pay it 's not going to be at the top of their list i would worry more filling out the forms you need to fill out correctly rather than worrying about the forms your employer is n't filling out correctly

remember that balance transfers are rarely fee free as you state there is a fee associated with the balance transfer if your 0 rate is for 18 months and the fee is 3 you are really paying 2 per year on the amount you transferred the advantage is that you can redirect the debt you transferred is interest free and you can attack other debt with high interest on it this can save you in interest fees and allow you to direct more of your money towards debt the disadvantage is that your 0 interest will expire and become a much higher interest rate unless you pay off the transfer before the expiration you will have to pay off the debt at the higher interest how you decide to attack your debt reduction may need to factor in how long you expect to have debt and what other debt you have often times though the savings in interest is less important than simplifying the number of debt accounts you have the inspiration you receive from reducing your debt accounts is much more powerful you realize reducing debt accounts allows you to actually see an end in sight and provides the recurring positive feedback that you are making progressing this is why the advice to pay off your lowest balance credit cards first

for case 1 there is no tax due as you sold the book for less than your cost basis if you had sold for more than $ 100 then you would have had a profit for case 2 that depends on the value of the gift card with respect to the value of your fare most likely that gift card is less than the cost of the fare and in that case it would generally be treated as a reduction in the purchase price the same way that rebates and cash back on credit card are treated note if for some reason a 1099 was generated that would change the situation and you would need to consult a tax professional since that would indicate that the other party to the transaction had a different view of the situation

if you were making that large of a payment via a cashiers check or other    withdrawal means from a cash account    to a credit card would the payment    generate a cash transaction report probably yes if it does require the bank to make a ctr then is there any harm in    that or anything to be concerned about    like that transaction appearing    suspicious personal reporting    implications etc are there any    other reasons why one might want to    make sure payments to a credit card    are broken up made in amounts smaller    than $ 10 k you should be concerned if you can not explain the source of the money legally if you withdrew cash from your own account and paid your credit card with it in case of questions asked you can show the account statement with the matching withdrawal and you 're done the point in this report is to point at people who move around large amounts of cash usually people pay credit cards with checks or ach transactions but if you want cash it 's your right as long as the cash was obtained legally but if you 're paying your credit cards off with the cash you got as a bribe or by selling cocaine on the streets then you should be worried by the way breaking into smaller payments may not save you from being reported to the money laundering detection agencies the report is per transaction not per payment so if the credit card statement is $ 11 k and you pay $ 5 k and $ 6 k the transaction is still $ 11k. also the bank can file a report even if it is not required it was clarified in the other answer to the same question you 're referring to if the clerk thinks the transaction is suspicious this leaves the decision on filing a report solely on the banks common sense and internal policies which you do n't know so even paying $ 10 in cash may trigger a report if the bank suspects wrongdoing

if your goal is to have a 400 k net worth in 11 years and you invest the entire time you will need a rate of return of at least 6.4   this is assuming that you have zero net worth now and it does not consider your house   obviously the house will be worth some amount and the mortgage balance will go down   however it can not really be calculated with the details provided    it seems like your risk tolerance is low   you may want to head over to bogleheads.org and look into their asset allocation model   they typically site about a 7 compounded growth rate which will more than meet your goals   they probably have information for european investors that map to the funds that we use here in the us    keep in mind during this time you will likely receive raises if you start out assuming you will hit the 400 500k mark and stick to the plan you will likely blow that goal away    also keep in mind the three legs to wealth building   giving some spending some and investing some   your question is addressing the investing portion make sure you are also enjoying your money by spending some on yourself and others benefit from your prosperity   giving to causes you deem worthy is a key component to wealth building that is often overlooked by those interested in investing

ok this gives us something to start on i am owner of a company that our best selling product is government designed    your position is that there is no profit incentive if government invests in a company i know from first hand experience that is not true if government were funding your whole company and you as an owner had no skin in the game then yes that would be true however that is not what government does i have experience from receiving government grants for our own innovation as well as receiving the right to sell a government designed product    our company competes with a number of other companies that do the same this investment in our work has given our company a great boost which has lead to other ideas and inventions as well as growth and expansion the end user has gotten the benefit of that too as the government is n't really good at mass production and sales but we are however if the government had n't made this investment we would still be doing what we are doing it would have just taken us a little longer to get here    you other position is that they only listen to special interests who would like it if the project is as expensive as possible there is some truth to that and there are definitely projects where we have seen that but that is more the exception than the rule what usually happens is eventually these companies piss off an end user who receives the product which is the result of these bloated contracts when it gets bad enough people run to their representatives and there is a major investigation i know of a couple of people who have spent time in the federal including the owner of another small business in the city where my company is a lot of times these companies are banned or are moved to the fringe where they go into a death spiral    competition is the of capitalism and our company has grown and succeeded because we pick up business all the time from larger companies who bloat and laziness has caused them to be noncompetitive

why simply because it has been mandated as law and so you may have no choice in the matter whether to contribute or not quoting from gov.uk workplace pensions automatic   a new law means that every employer must automatically workers    into a workplace pension scheme if they next even if you think you will work until you die you can still access the money saved in the pension scheme when you attain the required minimum age for withdrawals under your scheme for instance that may be age 55 but it may also vary by scheme becoming fully retired as in stopping all work is not a requirement to access retirement income from your pension scheme in the eyes of a pension scheme retirement is typically when you elect to take your income benefits according to the established rules of the scheme quoting from working past state pension age continuing in work and your workplace pension   if you reached the age at which you can start claiming your workplace    pension scheme you do n't need to stop work in order to claim you have    a number of options including taking some of the pension you 've built    up while continuing to work for the same employer as to why things are set up this way while some younger folk may today expect to continue working until death for a variety of reasons that is n't always possible two typical such reasons are disability and involuntary unemployment i.e. willing and able but still ca n't land the next job moreover plans change young workers with health and vitality may expect they 'll always feel but end up learning otherwise over time and may come to appreciate the savings that were forced upon them the forced savings aspect of state and state sponsored pension schemes are meant to provide some safety net for those later years when it is a strong possibility that one ca n't continue to work the alternative is to be a 100 burden on family and/or society

have a bank account here you need to have a credit history that is wrong whoever informed you that you do n't need a credit history to open a bank account some banks allow you to open no frills accounts without a credit history i myself opened an account with barclays with my ni card job contract and probably my passport too and i from the eu also the bank that allowed me to open the account does n't allow me to wire transfer my money to another uk account and claims that ll the bank have the same policy for cash accounts is that true i mean is there an actual law that for some reason allow you to transfer your funds why did you read the t&cs chances are that other the account is with a different bank and it always is fishy atleast for banks because of heightened money laundering regulations for people opening accounts and starting to transfer money to accounts with other banks after you have banked with them for certain time you can ask them to upgrade you to a current account which allow these services secondly because it might be a no frills account and they are n't allowed to charge fees they might disallow transfers to other banks and banks generally do n't charge fees for no frills accounts so certain services are disallowed which cost them money i have had a cash account for 4 5 years with barclays and i used to transfer money to other banks but i probably never tried transferring money just after opening an account

a general rule of thumb is to avoid having more than 5 of your investments in any single stock to avoid excessive risk it 's usually even more risky if you 're talking company stock because an adverse event could result in an inferior stock price and you getting laid off under other circumstances the ideal amount of company stock is probably 0 but there are tax benefits to waiting as you 've noted and if you 're reasonably confident that the stock is n't likely to jerk around too much and you have a high risk tolerance i.e. lots of extra savings besides this and you 're comfortable the risk of losing some money it might make sense to hold onto the stock for a year but never any longer the real risk to holding a lot of company stock does n't depend on how often you buy it and sell it per se but having period purchases every month should make it easier for you to ladder the funds and regularly sell your old shares as you purchase new shares you might also consider a stop loss order on the stock at or near the price you purchased it at if the stock is at $ 100 then you buy at $ 85 and then the stock drops to $ 85 there are no more outstanding tax benefits and it makes no sense to have it as part of your portfolio instead of any other speculative instrument you probably get better diversification benefits with any other speculative instrument so your risk adjusted returns would be higher

the roth vs not debate is irrelevant to the question it does n't matter where your emergency fund is kept as long as it is liquid and safe i said it before in an answer to another question your emergency fund is not an investment it 's your safety net this answer also says it well an emergency fund is just that for emergencies not investment while it hurts not to have your emergency money making more money its more important to have quick access to it so at td ameritrade just park it in their fdic deposit account it will not earn any meaningful interest at least until rates rise but you 'll be able to have access to it when you need it note that i would caution against putting it in a money market mutual fund they 're safer than many other investments but they 're not fdic insured against loss and there is a potential for temporary loss of liquidity in late 2008 when the credit markets collapsed a lot of people suddenly became unemployed and needed access to their emergency funds when lehman brothers went bust in september the reserve primary fund with billions of dollars in their fund broke the buck they lowered the price of shares below $ 1 meaning investors lost principal the worst part is that investors were not as liquid as they wanted to be the fund froze and it was hard to get money out the lesson to take away from this is that one of the times you 're likely to need access to your emergency fund is during a macroeconomic crisis this is also the time when any investment that is n't guaranteed safe may potentially be at least temporarily unavailable or decline in value emergency funds should be 100 government insured when you have your roth funded to the point where there 's extra money beyond the emergency fund you can start investing in higher yielding vehicles stock or bond index etfs would be a good start but then that part of your roth starts to look like a retirement account and not an emergency fund if it were me i 'd open a roth at a stable local bank and just keep it in their fdic insured money market deposit account then if i wanted a slight boost i might put the upper half of my emergency fund into short term cds but even cds are n't worth much at the moment

i 'd like to make two points to focus on your test case of japan   you point out that about a third of them believe they 'll work until they die   that means more than a majority of them believe they 'll retire   in a democracy where a majority of people make decisions it is completely expected that the majority will dictate the policy   of course there is around that last statement because people who believe they 'll retire could very well be of the mindset that they 'll handle their retirement savings themselves rather than rely on government   similarly some people that expect to work until they die might realize that there 's a risk that they wo n't be able to to focus on the case of government run pensions   the pension program that a government runs is n't like a private savings plan where its purpose is to get you a good rate of return   at best it 's an insurance policy more accurately it 's just a tax and you should think of it this way   the reason you should think of it that way is several fold   one if the pension fund is ever short the government will make up the difference from the general fund   two the government can spend the money from the pension fund on other programs if the law changes which over the course of a lifetime is entirely possible   three no one has a legal right to withdraw their contributions directly   four the point of the program is to take care of old people so they are n't starving in the street   to do this they take the money of the young and give it to to old people   the money you pay in does n't go to investments of any sort it goes directly to the elderly   ultimately this is why you ca n't opt out and why you should think of those contributions as a tax and not as savings

in the united states the fair credit reporting act allows companies to buy your credit information for legitimate business needs the legitimate use of credit scores and credit reporting varies state to state but like it or not you can expect a lot more non lending use of your credit information in the future companies and individuals use credit reports as an assessment of general behavior because unfortunately they work you 've seen the disclaimers about past performance but unfortunately in this case past performance really has been shown to be a pretty reliable indicator of future behavior so

this sounds very like disguised employment you act like an employee of the company but your official relationship with them is as a contractor you gain none of the protection you get from being an employee and this may make you cheaper less risky and more desirable for the company who is hiring you   depending on your country you may also pay corporation tax rather than income tax which may represent a very significant saving also the company hiring you may not have to pay paye national insurance stakeholder pension etc this arrangement is normal and legal providing you genuinely are acting as a subcontractor however if you are behaving as an employee desk at the company company email have to work specific hours in a specific location no ability to subcontract etc you may be classified as a disguised employee in the uk it used to be common practice for highly paid employees to set up shell companies to avoid tax this will now get you into hot water google it sounds like your relationship in this case is directly with the recruiter you will have to consider if the recruiter is acting as your employer or if you remain a genuinely independent agent the duration of your contract with the recruiter will have a bearing on this in the uk there are a whole series of tests for disguised employment this is a good arrangement provided you go in with your eyes open and an awareness of the legislation   however you should absolutely check the rules that apply in your country before entering into this agreement you could potentially be very badly indeed

it 's called leverage here 's an example from real estate the underlying appreciation on a house in certain parts of america is something like 7 a year so if you bought the house all cash your return would be something like 7 a year actually a little more because of the rent you would be collecting or saving if you were the renter suppose you buy the same house 20 down 80 mortgage the rent pays for your mortgage taxes insurance etc like it is supposed to the house goes up the same 7 each year but now your rate of return is 35 that is your down payment you get the whole appreciation but put up only 20 of the money the bank and your renter did the rest

paying off your mortgage early being good is a myth   it is great for the chronic to have their mortgage paid off so when they rack up credit card bills and get behind well they still a place to stay but for those who are more logical with their money paying off your mortgage early in current conditions makes no sense   you can get a 30 year loan well below 4   discounting taxes for your average family you would have a rate floating below 3    so reasons that paying off your mortgage should be almost last given current low long term interest rates the first thing you should do is take care of any high interest debt   i would say that anything more than 7 8 including all credit card debt should be focus 1 putting money into your retirement savings is 1   you will earn way more than 3 over the long run   you can earn a higher return in the market   even with a very conservative portfolio you can clear 5 6 which will still clear more than 3 after taxes for those who say you ca n't be sure about the market well if the market did bad for 30 years in a row no one will have money and the house will also be worthless if a disaster happens to your house and you own it your money is gone   in many cases you would be able to declare bankruptcy and let the bank take the property as is    there are just too many examples but if you are paying off your house early you lose the flexible liquid money that you now have tied up in the house now the reasons for paying down your mortgage are really easy too you do n't trust your spending habits you want to move up in houses and you want to make sure that you have at least 20 down on future house to skip pmi

allen welcome to money se you 've stumbled into the issue of debt snowball which is the low balance method of paying off debt the other being high interest i absolutely agree that when one has a pile of cards say a dozen there is a psychological benefit to paying off the low balances and knocking off card after card i am not dismissive of that motivation personal finance has that first word personal and one size rarely fits all for those who are numbers oriented it 's worth doing the math a simple spreadsheet showing the cost of the ds vs paying by rate   if that cost is even a couple hundred dollars i 'll still concede that one less payment envelope stamp etc favors the ds method on the other hand there 's the debt so large that the best payoff is 2 or 3 years away during that time $ 10000 paid toward the 24 card is saving you $ vs the $ 500 if paid toward 5 debt hard core do n't even want to discuss the numbers strangely enough   in your case you do n't have a pile of anything the mortgage is n't even up for discussion you have just 2 car loans send the $ 11,000 to the $ 19 k loan carrying the 2.5 this will save you $ 500 over the next 2 years vs paying the zero loan down once you 've done that the remaining $ 8000 will become your lowest balance and you should flip to the debt snowball method which will keep you paying that debt off   ds is a tool that should be pulled out for the masses the radio audience that the david dave ramsey radio show host appeals to they may comprise the majority of those with high credit card debt and have greatest success using this method but you exhibit none of their symptoms and are best served by the math by bringing up the topic here you 've found yourself in the same situation as the guy who happens to order a white wine at a wedding and finds his cousin offering to take him to an aa meeting the next day   in past articles on this decision i 've referenced a spreadsheet one can download it offers an easy way to see your choice without writing your own excel doc for the situation described here the low balance total interest is $ vs $ for the higher interest not quite the $ 500 difference i estimated the $ 350 difference is low due to the small rate difference and relatively short payoffs in my opinion knowledge is power and you can decide either way what 's important is that if you pay off the zero interest first you can say i knew it was a $ 350 difference but i 'd rather have just one outstanding loan for the remain time my issue with ds is when it 's like a religion and followers are told to not even run the numbers i wrote an article thinking about dave ramsey a number of years back but the topic never gets old

i am going through this right now   we recently moved and learned the lesson of needing a good bit of wealth in easily accessible accounts   in our case for a down payment on a new house   so we have decided to increase our emergency fund to $ minimum   then throwing the rest in retirement accounts seems like a safe bet so my rule of thumb is think of how much a 20 down payment would be on a new house if you needed to move   that way you can avoid pmi while also avoiding penalties for withdrawing from your retirement accounts

when he wrote this i think there may have been greater between workers workers were perfectly competitive if you will    i find that there is huge wage growth in certain industries and with certain skills this only impacts a limited number of people with the majority of workers in fields that are not heavily valued    another avenue would be to look at the real wage if wages are going up only 1 2 but inflation was at negative 3 4 then those workers wages were increasing at 4 6    i am not sure the gig economy is to blame the gig economy would suggest that we are nowhere near full employment how can people have time to have these gigs if they were gainfully employed already    another scenario is that we are not near full employment at all that you have a large number of people who are part time their income with other jobs to make ends meet    and i am sure that were milton friedman alive today he would change his assumption to match reality i wonder what wisdom he would have for us today

since the last time savings account interest rates were meaningful banks have made relationships much stick by that i mean that the online services and all the auto pay systems in place put up a significant barrier for people to leave their bank this results in people no longer shopping their banking business around to the bank with the best account interest rates so no cartel or other behavior from banks but rather just customer apathy as you pointed out was an option

yes you can insure against the fall in price of stock by purchasing a put option   you pay for a put and if the price of the share falls below the strike price of the put then you can exercise the put   on exercise the person who sold you the put contract agrees to buy the stock for the strike price even though that strike price is higher than the market price   you can adjust the level of insurance by buying put options at higher or lower prices or buying fewer put options than shares you own leaving some shares uninsured alternatively you can minimize your risk exposure by investing in an index or other fund which gives you partial ownership in a large number of shares   that means on any given day lots of shares do worse and lots of shares do better   you can reduce the need for insurance by purchasing a lower risk lower growth financial product

governments borrowing money does n't create new money when banks borrow money i.e. take deposits it does effectively create money because the depositor expects to be able to get the money back at any time but the bank assumes that most wo n't actually do this and lends out most of the money to other people if everyone did actually ask for their money back at once the illusion of the extra money created by this process would collapse and the bank would go bust in contrast when governments borrow money the loan is n't on demand it has a fixed maturity and the money is only repaid at the end of that period plus interest at defined points during the period so holders of government debt do n't have money they can spend they can turn it into money they can spend but only by finding someone else to buy it so government debt does n't create inflation in itself if they printed money then they 'd be devaluing the money of everyone who had saved or invested whereas if they borrow money and use taxes to repay it the burden falls more evenly across the economy and does n't disproportionately penalise certain sets of people

first you need to understand the difference in discussing types of investments and types of accounts certificate of deposits cds money market accounts mutual funds and stocks are all examples of types of investments 401(k ira roth ira and taxable accounts are all examples of types of accounts in general those are separate decisions to make   you can invest in any type of investment inside any type of account   so your question really has two different parts    tax advantaged retirement accounts vs. standard taxable accounts fdic insured cds vs. at risk investments such as stock mutual funds retirement accounts are special accounts allowed by the federal government that allow you to delay or in some cases completely avoid paying taxes on your investment   the trade off for these accounts is that in general you can not access any of the money that you put into these accounts until you get to retirement age without paying a steep penalty   these accounts exist to encourage citizens to save for their own retirement   examples of retirement accounts include 401(k and iras standard taxable accounts have no tax advantages but no restrictions either   you can put money in and take money out whenever you like   however anything that your investment earns is taxable each year inside any of these accounts you can invest in fdic insured bank accounts such as savings accounts or cds or you can invest in any number of non insured investments including money market accounts bonds mutual funds stocks precious metals etc something you need to understand about investing in general is that your potential returns are directly related to the amount of risk that you take on   investing in an insured investment which is guaranteed by the government to never lose its value will result in the lowest potential investment returns that you can get interest bearing savings accounts are currently paying less than 1 interest   a cd will get you a slightly higher interest rate in exchange for you agreeing not to withdraw your money for a period of time however it takes a long time for your investments to grow with these investments   if you are earning 1 it takes 72 years for your investment to double if you are willing to take some risk you can earn much more with your investments   bonds are often considered quite safe with a bond you loan money to a government or corporation and they pay you back with interest   the risk comes from the possibility that the government or corporation wo n't pay you back so it is important to choose a bond from an entity that you trust stocks are shares in for profit companies   your potential investment gain is unlimited but it is risky as stocks can go down in value and companies can close   however it is important to note that if you take the largest 500 stocks together s&p 500 the average value has consistently gone up over the long term   in the last 35 years this average value has gone up about 11   at this rate your investment would double in less than 7 years to avoid the risk of picking a losing stock you can invest in a mutual fund which is a collection of stocks bonds or other investments   the idea is that you can with one investment invest in many stocks essentially earning the average performance of all the stocks   there is still risk as the market can be down as a whole but you are insulated from any one stock being bad because you are diversified if you are investing for something in the long term future such as retirement stock mutual funds provide a good rate of return at an low level of risk in my opinion

you should call your plan administrator and ask few plans allow people to take a hardship withdraw after leaving because their is no way to pay the funds back since you are no longer working there the repayment process is done via payroll deduction usually also you will most likely be required to withhold 20 for taxes from the 401k there is no way to defer the taxation unless you take it   next calendar year you may want to consider doing a rollover into an ira and taking the w d and you can do a 60 day rollover you only get 1 per rolling 12 months now rather than account do to a change in the rule ira 's not 401k do give you flexible withholding so you do n't have to pay taxes today though they would still be in the tax year based on the calendar date taken out so if you take it out in 2015 your going to be paying them at the end of this year when you file in april of 2016 your question seems to be mixing characteristics of both 401k and ira and while they are similar they do operate very differently

two things you should consider about paying off student loans ahead of the 10 year amortization schedule what interest rate are you paying on your loans what are you earning on your investments in a balanced mutual fund when you pay off your student loans you are essentially guaranteed a return of the interest rate on your loan future interest you would have had to pay however if you are investing well and getting a good return on your investments you will get a greater return ex half of my student loans are at 6.8 other half are at 2.5 i make the minimum payments on the loans at 2.5 and invest my money in tax sheltered retirement accounts the return on these funds has been 8 and that is on per tax dollars so really closer to 11 now there is also downside risk when you invest in the market but 2.5 guaranteed i will for 11 in low risk return however my loans at 6.8 i repay in excess of the minimums because 6.8 guaranteed return is pretty good so this decision is based on your confidence in your investments and your own risk tolerance once you pay your bank on your student loans that money is gone out of your control if you need it in the future you may need to pay higher interest on an unsecured loan or you may not be able to borrow it when you want to make large purchases a car house that money you per paid on your loans is n't available to you as a down payment banks should want you to have some of your own skin in the game on these purchases and the lending standards keep getting tougher you are better off if you have money saved in your name rather than against the balance on your loan yes you ca n't bankrupt these loans but the money you repay on them does n't go toward housing you or paying your bills on a rainy day i went through the same feeling when i completed my mba with $ 50k in debt you want to pay it off as soon as possible but you need to step away and realize that it was an investment in your future and your future is long you need time to make a financial foundation for it and you will feel a lot more empowered when you have money saved and you can make the decision for how you want to deploy it to work for you ex i could pay down my student loans with the balance i have in the bank but i am going to use it to invest in myself and open my own business

assuming you 're talking about a property in the united states the answer generally would be no   you are n't actually paying any of the expenses for the property and yet you want to take the deductions for doing so   that 's a rather move i 'd say grin    it probably would lead to some real strife with your brother since he would have proper claim to those credit on the basis he 's the one footing the bills for the property   before you do anything like what you 're talking about it might be best to speak with him because both of you are running the very real risk of an audit and if that happens then i can guarantee the irs will slap the out of you for it   your brother i 'm sure is already claiming all of the deductions he can for what he 's putting into the property and on top of that you want to file for your half   what half are you referring to when your out of pocket is zero   so what you 're saying is you think that between you and your brother you should be able to take a credit of 150 of the actual deductions sounds like a recipe for disaster to me i strongly encourage you to talk to a tax professional but if you get a different answer to this than what i 've already given then i 'd be stunned    i hope this helps good luck

investing is good insurance when you have something to insure is good but using a single account for investing and insurance is not so good you need to determine how much you need to invest for retirement you also need to determine if you need life insurance as a single person you might determine that you do n't have a great need for life insurance if you get married or have kids your needs may grow so you will want to revisit your decisions every so often you may need to save for retirement or setup a college fund you may need to protect your spouse or children in case you die it does n't seem to make sense to invest and insure in a plan with complicated rules fees and schedules what happens if in 3 years you need to blow it up and start over what surrender charges will they hit you with

housing prices are set by different criteria it can become memoryless the same as the stock if the criteria used to set its price in the past is no longer valid for example take phoenix or las vegas in the past these were considered attractive investments because of the economical growth and the climate of the area while the climate has n't changed the economical growth stopped not only there but also in the places where people buying the houses lived which is all over the world really what happened to the housing market dropped sharply and stays flat for several years now at the bottom so it does n't really matter if the house was worth $ 300 k in phoenix 5 years ago you can only sell it now for k and that 's about it the prices have been flat low for several years and the house price was $ 50 k but does it mean its going to stay so no once economy gears up the prices will go up as well so its not exactly memory less but the stocks are not memory less as well there is correlation between the past and the future performance if the environment conditions are similar the performance is likely to be similar for stocks however there 's much more environment conditions than the housing market and its much harder to predict them but even with the housing people were burnt a lot on the misconception that the past performance correlates to the future it does n't necessarily

if this is in the united states there are laws governing business behavior when they have recorded expenses checks bills etc which are never withdrawn or deposited   a business is required to turn over these funds after a certain time frame to the state government as a part of their business tax cycle   one these laws vary in age by state and 13 years is a long time   you might still be out of luck for an amount so old there are even businesses which have up to search for lost money for a fee of course that your great uncle might have left behind and which now sits in a government holding account somewhere   it 's not necessary to go through the third parties though because the united states posts this information for the world to see   a good starting place is unclaimed money tool do as much legwork there as you can   you could even attempt to contact the former employer you said the business accounts still exist and in a very friendly non manner ask them what their procedures are and would have happened to your paycheck funds   as others have stated they are under no legal obligation whatsoever to fix your problem for you but who knows you could get lucky and they might voluntarily help you out   you 're looking for information not cash so patience and understanding are your tools if all else fails you could try one of these 3rd party services   here you run into diminishing returns as paying fees to search for money which might not exist just puts you further in the red

two typical responses to articles surveys making such claims   1 people use other forms of asset for emergency savings because interest rates are low clearly false   2 people use other forms of saving than a saving account therefore such surveys as the x% ca n't handle a $ 500 emergency are wrong on their face this is false the vast majority use a savings account   i 've chosen a topic that absolutely annoys the shit out of me every time it comes up how people save their money every time this topic comes up about x% of americans ca n't come up with $ y dollars in an emergency or have less than $ z in savings someone inevitably in with the linked response i have never seen anyone attempt to source their hand waving response beyond their own anecdote which is usually a thinly veiled brag about how financially savvy they are with their wealth perhaps people who have no assets or crippling debt do n't go out of their way to brag about it   i could link multiple reddit posts making a similar response which i address with my own stock response about once every 1 2 months instead i 've decided to expand with data from several other sources this is the good bad research problem if you 're asserting something but qualify your statement with sure we 'd find if we looked into then you 're doing it wrong a good researcher or journalist does n't put bullshit like that in their work because it 's their job to actually look for sources of data data which should exist with multiple government and independent groups so let 's get started all data as recent as i could find oldest source is for 2010   most americans do n't invest in the stock pubs   about of americans owned publicly traded stock directly or indirectly with a much smaller percent owning stock directly   pages 18 and 16 respectively it 's important to note the of indirect ownership which suggests this is mostly retirement accounts it 's entirely possible people are irresponsible with their emergency savings but i think it safe to say we should not expect people to dip into their retirement accounts for relatively minor emergency expenses the reason is obvious even if it covers the expense they now have to make up the shortfall for their retirement savings this is further supported by the same source   gt;"the value of assets held within iras and dc plans are among the most significant of many balance sheets and are a significant determinant of their future retirement security   page 20 pdf page 20 of 41   there is also a break down of holdings by asset type on page 16 pdf page 16 of 41   this data is skewed by the top 10 who keep more of their wealth in different asset power for a breakdown between the 1st 10th and percentiles see table 3   so far it seems pretty hard to maintain a large percent of americans have their wealth stored outside of savings accounts mattresses aside   here 's my original reply as to the breakdown of americans assets by type and percent a note this assumes people have assets source for images people wealth data   most people use savings accounts with runner up falling to checking accounts this will into our next topic which is the problem of unbanked underbanked households   a large number of individuals have no assets breaking down by asset types assumes people have assets in the first   to quote the fdic   from the 2015 survey indicate that percent of households in the united states were unbanked in 2015 this proportion represents approximately million households an additional 19.9 percent of u.s. households million were underbanked meaning that the household had a checking or savings account but also obtained financial products and services outside of the banking system   that 's right there are millions of households so finance savvy they do n't even have banks accounts obviously it 's because of low interest rates also most people have a checking account as well as savings account the percent with checking and savings was while those with checking only were page 25 pdf page 31 of 88 it 's possible in some surveys people keep all their money in checking but given other data sources and the original claim this fails to hold up if the concern was interest rates it makes no sense to keep money in checking which seldom pays interest   this survey also directly addresses the issue of emergency savings   gt overall percent of households saved for unexpected   expenses or emergencies in the past 12 months page 37 pdf page 43 of 88   furthermore   7.2 shows that among all households that saved for   unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts   were the most used savings method followed by checking   accounts more than four in five percent kept savings   in one of these accounts about one in ten 10.5 percent   households that saved maintained savings in the home or   with family or friends    emphasis added   why do n't people have wealth in different asset classes well they do n't save wp content rates by wealth   this is further supported by the oecd data   americans currency and deposits are 13 vs 5.8 for securities and other shares as of total financial household financial   additionally   interest earning checking accounts of american households second a   among all households that saved for unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts were the most used   savings method followed by checking accounts page 7 pdf page 13 of   saved for an emergency with a savings account vs who used checking   in fairness the fdic link does state banked americans were more likely to hold checking accounts than savings accounts 98 vs respectively but that does n't mean they 're earning interest in their checking account it 's also worth noting median transaction account value was for 2013 this is the federal reserve data $ 4100

you should not seek a kind of debt just for it 's appearance on your credit report   if you do n't need an auto loan do n't get an auto loan getting a credit card for the purpose of building credit is a little bit of a different animal because you can use a credit card such that you never pay any interest or fees   with a loan you will pay interest   altering your score by paying interest does n't provide you with a net benefit with that said depending on the auto loan rate you may want to accept the loan just to fee up your capital   some promotional rates are so low you may even make money leaving the cash in a regular savings account   but do n't let your credit score wag the dog

it seems this will be very much driven by price discrimination   if there are some customers who will pay up to $ 100 sell at that and if there are others who 'll pay $ 1 sell at that price for instance you see computer games which have zero marginal cost of production sold at normal new release prices at premium prices with a special box or dad and at discount prices once the game is a bit old

most likely this will not work they way you think first things first to get a loan the bank needs to accept your collateral note that this is not directly related to the question what you plan to do with the loan example you have a portfolio of stocks and bonds worth usd 2 million the bank decides to give you a loan of usd 1 million against that collateral the bank does n't care if you will use the loan to invest in foreign re or use it up in a casino it has your collateral as safety so from the way you describe it i take it you do n't have the necessary local collateral but you wish to use your foreign investments as such in this case it really does n't matter where you live or where you incorporate a company the bank will only give you the loan if it accepts the foreign collateral from professional experience with this exact question i can tell you there are very few banks that will lend against foreign property and there are even less banks if any that will lend against foreign projects to sum it up just forget banks you might find a private lender to help you out but it will cost you dearly the best option you have is to find a strategic partner who can cough up the money you need but since he is taking the bigger risk he will also take the bigger profit share

it does n't make much difference in the end imagine you have $ 100 of revenue in your company you can either pay it to yourself as salary meaning that you do n't pay corporate tax on it or you can keep it in the company pay corporate tax on it then pay yourself a dividend of what is left while that dividend will be treated better than salary remember that the company already paid tax on it you paying less on what 's left does n't equate to paying less overall go ahead and run the numbers using your actual corporate tax rate and your personal income tax rate try doing your whole salary as dividends not dollar for dollar but as how much the company would have as profit to give you a dividend if it did n't spend and deduct salary money on you you are unlikely to see any difference at all the net final money in your pocket and the amount that went to the government will probably be the same if paying dividends keeps your earned income low you may find that you ca n't use rrsp or childcare deductions you are also not getting cpp credit that 's an argument for salary or at least a certain minimum amount of salary you have to deduct taxes at source on salary and send it along to the government which is an argument for dividends if you feel you could invest that money and use it well before the taxes get around to being due possibly you may discover an edge case where you move a few thousand from one marginal tax rate to another and clear a few hundred extra as a result i do n't discourage you from doing the math i just point out that the various percentages tax rates deductions etc have all been carefully chosen so that it pretty much works out the same or gives a small preference to salary we give excess money to ourselves as bonus rather than dividend having run the numbers a few times there 's no secret trick here

yes sir i 'm working on compiling your precise evidence and i 'll have it printed and bound for you on the double   in the meantime you can look here as a starting point and try to find the part where the fed has allowed interest rates to adjust freely and maybe you can learn why rates are artificial       as for cahoots and independent banks and whatever other off topic nonsense you 're about there was nothing said about cahoots or independent banks   the interest rates paid for and to us banks are affected by the monetary policy of the fed   there is no collusion or cahoots required for them to follow a common policy of artificially low interest rates which was the point of the earlier post

by your logic if a loan of £ 100 is new money dilutes your purchasing power then the repayment of £ 110 is a reduction of the money supply that increases your purchasing power   indeed ultimately the increase in purchasing power upon repayment is greater than the initial reduction so you are better off every time a loan is made and successfully repaid the effect on you is tiny but the collective benefit you get from all the loans being repaid with interest is more or less equivalent to the purchasing power reduction of the loans that are never repaid   therefore you do not lose out and are indeed compensated in a tiny way for the tiny risk you incurred the bank incurs a substantial risk and is thus compensated in a substantial way

of course cds are worth it compared to the stock market in fact most institutional investors are of the cds you have access to as an individual investor that are unavailable to them you just need to be competent enough to shop around for the best rates and understand your time horizon there are several concepts to understand here banks give out cds with competitive rates projecting future interest rates so while the federal funds rate is currently extremely low banks know that in order to get any takers on their cds they have to factor in the public expectation that rates will rise so if you lock in a longer term cd you get a competitive rate institutional investors do not have access to fdic insured cds and the closest analog they participate in are the auctions and secondary markets of us treasuries these two types of assets have equivalent default if held to maturity backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. here are the current rates as of question 's date taken from vanguard that i can get on cds versus treasuries as an individual investor notice that cds outperform treasuries across any maturity timescale for fixed income and bond allocations institutional investors are lining up for buying treasuries and yet here you are saying cds are not worth it might want to rethink that now going into the stock market as an investor with expectations of those high returns you quote means you 're willing to stay there for the long term at least a decade and stay the course during volatility to actually have any hope of coming up with the average rate of return even then there 's the potential downside of risk that you still lose principal after that duration so given that assumption it 's only fair to compare against > = 10 year cds which are currently rated at 2 percent apy in addition cds can be laddered allowing you to lock in newer and potentially higher rates as they become available you essentially your into these investments and either reinvest upon the maturity dates or use as income also keep in mind that while personal emergencies requiring quick access to cash can happen at any time the most common scenario is during the sudden change from a bull market into a recession the time when stocks plummet if you need money right away selling your stocks at these times would lock in severe losses whereas with cds you still wo n't lose principal with an early exit and the only penalty is usually a sacrifice of a few months of potential interest it 's easy to think of the high yields during a protracted bull market such as now but personal finance has a huge behavioral component to it that is largely ignored until it 's too late one risk that is n't taken care of by either cds or treasuries is inflation risk all the rates here and in the original question are nominal rates and the real return will depend on inflation or deflation there are other options here besides cds treasuries and the stock market to outpace inflation if you 'd like to hedge that risk with inflation protection series i savings bonds and tips

some things you should consider from your observations   1 those few units available to rent at the mall they 're available for a reason namely nobody else thinks they have a business idea that can work out at that location malls are suffering all over the country and the more empty units there are at a mall the less people want to go there   2 you are right to be concerned about copyright trademark from amateur etsy creators but there 's another serious problem what do you do with the leftover inventory when harry potter is less cool or the particular etsy product does n't sell as much as you expect are you are taking all the risk   the gamestop in my area is already selling pop barnes and noble does too lots of places if an etsy creator is able to provide their product in volume they are going to want to deal with an established distributor retailer why would they go with some unknown startup single location retailer   now do n't get me wrong you see these kind of idiosyncratic kinds of retailers all over the place selling cards and comic books and other random but it is n't a sure thing and i suspect even the successful ones are not making their owners much of a profit but if it is fun and keeps you busy and gives you enough money to live and save a bit for the future that 's good enough

as long as there is nothing more to this story you are n't sharing you can expect those bills you paid to come back you will have to pay them again later you can be pretty certain that the name he gave you was fake and that the bank account you paid your bills with was not his i would not try to do anything at all with the information he gave you because first it is not his and second your name is already tied to this bank account via your utility bills in other words that would be illegal and you are already on the list of suspects    i would say that if you do n't call the police they probably wo n't call you the police often times do not even waste their time when somebody 's light bill was paid with fraudulent financial information or whatever i have actually seen similar situations play out a number of times and the police have never gotten involved disclaimer i probably do n't live where you live and i 'm not an attorney   but i do know what i am talking about so here 's my advice i know you did n't ask for advice but you probably might benefit from it let that money go sometimes people get you take it as a lesson and move on   if you do end up having to have contact with the police and you do n't already know they will lie to you and try to trick you into acting in a way that is not in your self interest but then you kind of look guilty if you wo n't even talk to them and in this case you did not do anything illegal so if i was you i would probably just think of where i might be myself by telling the truth if there were any parts of my story that would raise any flags and think of how i would smooth those out ahead of time    also for your personal information you do not need to have a sophisticated understanding of computers to do anything you described if you are familiar with operating a web browser you can do all types of stuff with paypal most people that give off the vibe criminal are not going to be able to make any money people and would probably have given it up before they got to you the information you have is not like the most valuable stuff ever but somebody that knew what they were doing could use it to take money out of your account and if they had that and then could get a few other pieces they could really mess up   your life so that 's part of why they say to be careful any one piece is maybe not so valuable but if you are loose with everything you will probably have a shitty few weeks at some points in the future no aa lol

thank you for the informed post cat was planning on opening a new plant before the earthquake they needed more capacity and were formerly exporting some from japan to the north american market they were considering expanding that plant and they also looked at sites in canada the us and mexico i guess they decided to keep that plant open but just focus it on other markets article is an article but it is short on details   article is an example of cat closing a plant in canada after the labor union locked themselves out they are moving jobs to the us for roughly half price in this case the plant in canada was paying an average wage of $ 35 $ annually without overtime and they locked themselves out requesting more corporations try to maximize profit so by definition they are greedy but this is a perfect example of unions being overly greedy as well that is well over a good middle class wage assuming they are in a somewhat rural or sparse suburban area where most manufacturing is located they had capacity elsewhere so they moved    ignoring the greed of the unions wo nt make things better for workers it will only end in more situations like the one in canada

aside from the fact that everyone absolutely everyone from the level of the individual to the government as a whole treats free money frivolously wastes it it etc   i do see one benefit to something like this    the whole idea of the stock market is n't millisecond trading to game the casino that is wall street   you purchase stocks as a long term investment in companies to enable their continued growth and stability they make profits they pass along these profits to you and everyone benefits   suppressing this sort of roulette wheel speculation constant changing of hands fractional gains and the like seems like it would stabilize markets improve growth stop the damn ceo 's and their golden parachute tactics in killing companies and all that jazz   joe is n't going to care about a tax like this he buys into whatever he wants and usually on to it for the long term   i 'm a layman and admittedly a damned rusty one at economics so give me a little slack if i 'm wrong or just misguided altogether

the way the wash sale works is your loss is added to your cost basis of the buy   so suppose your original cost basis is $ 10,000   you then sell the stock for $ 9,000 which accounts for your $ 1,000 loss   you then buy the stock again say for $   and sell it for $ 9,000   since your loss of $ 1,000 is added to your cost basis you actually still have a net loss of $ 500 you then buy the stock again for say $ 10,500   then sell it for $ 9,500   your $ 500 loss is added to your cost basis   and you have a net loss of $ 1,500 since you never had a net gain you will not owe any tax for these transactions

there is no simple answer to that because no one knows exactly what the probability distribution of s&p 500 returns is here is a sketch of one possible way to proceed do n't forget step 4   the problem is that the stock market is full of surprises so this kind of backtesting can only reliably tell you about what already happened not what will happen in the future   people argue about how much you can learn from this kind of analysis   however it is at the least a clearly defined and objective process   i would n't advise investing your whole nest egg in anything based just on this but i do think that it is relevant information

i second or fifth the answers of the other users in that this should have been foreseen and discussed prior to entering the partnership   but to offer a potential solution if the mortgage company allows you to assume the whole mortgage big if you could buy the other partner out to determine what a fair buyout would be take the current value of the house less the remaining mortgage to get the current equity half that is each partner 's current gain or potentially loss and could be considered a fair buyout at this point the partner realizes any gains made in the last 5 years and from now on the whole house and any future gains or losses will be yours alternatively your partner could remain a full partner if s he so desires until the house sells you would see the house as a separate business split the cost as you have and you would pay fair market rent each month half of which would come back to you a third option would be to refinance the house with you as a sole mortgage holder to factor in how much your partner should receive out of the transaction you can take his her current equity and subtract half of the costs associated with the refi i would also recommend both of you seek out the help of a real estate lawyer at this point to help you draft an agreement it sounds like you 're still on good terms so you could see a lawyer together this would be helpful because they should know all the things you should look out for in a situation like this good luck

leverage increase returns but also risks ie the least you can pay the greater the opportunity to profit but also the greater the chance you will be underwater leverage is given by the value of your asset the house over the equity you put down so for example if the house is worth 100k and you put down 20k then the leverage is 5 another way to look at it is to see that the leverage is the inverse of the margin or percentage down payment so = 5 the return on your investment will be magnified by the amount of your leverage suppose the value of your house goes up by 10 had you paid your house in full your return would be 10 or however if you had borrowed 80 dollars and your leverage was 5 as above a 10 increase in the value of your house means you made a profit of 10k on a 20k investment a return of 50 or as i said your return was magnified by the amount of your leverage that is 10 return on the asset times your leverage of 5 = 50 this is because all the profit of the house price appreciation goes to you as the value of your debt does not depend on the value of the house what you borrowed from the bank remains the same regardless of whether the price of the house changed the problem is that the mechanism also works in reverse if the price of the house falls by 10 it means now you only have 10k equity if the price falls enough your equity is wiped out and you are underwater giving you an incentive to default on your loan in summary borrowing tends to be a really good deal heads you win tails the bank loses or as happened in the us the taxpayer loses

thanks for the writeup it was a really informative read i 've been aware for a while now that reagan and were in a large way the start of most of the current problems in the economic and political landscape but you filled in a few gaps that were really useful for me   so i guess ultimately a lot of conservatives see it as a kind of necessary evil in order to bring about the success story that the current economy needs right now unfortunately their strategy is totally wrong that kind of makes sense with my observation that rather than supporting the cronyism and corruption they turn a blind eye to it because they think it 's necessary   my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value the modern banking crisis was a great example of the ability to generate wealth while in fact destroying real value

there are a lot of false claims around the internet about this concept the fact of the matter is you are giving yourself the ability to have money in a tax favored environment with consistent steady growth as well as the ability to access it whenever you want   compare this to a 401k plan for example money is completely at risk you ca n't touch it and you 're penalized if you do n't follow the government 's rules as far as commissions to the agent an agent will cut his commission in half by selling you an infinite banking style policy as opposed to a traditional whole life policy @duffbeer703 clearly does n't understand life insurance in the slightest when he says that the first three years of your premium will go to the agents pocket   and as usual offers no alternative except pick some high yielding stocks and mlps someone needs to wake up from the dave ramsey and realize that there is no such thing as a 12 mutual fund do your research on the stock market research   do n't just listen to dave who still thinking getting 12 15 year in and year out is possible it 's frustrating to listen to people who are so uneducated on the subject remember the internet has turned everyone into experts if you want real advice talk to a legitimate expert that understands life insurance and how it actually works

i assume you 're talking about a sell order not a buy order when you place a limit sell order your order is guaranteed to be placed at that price or higher   if the market is currently trading much higher than the price of your sell order then your mistakenly low limit order will be essentially a market order and will be filled at   the current bid price so the only way this is a problem is if you want to place a limit sell that is much higher than the current market but mistakenly place a limit lower than the current market

since you already have twice your target in that emergency fund putting that overage to work is a good idea the impression that i get is that you 'd still like to stay on the safe side what you 're looking for is a balanced fund   in a balanced fund the managers invest in both stocks and bonds and cash since you have that diversification between those two asset classes their returns tend to be much less volatile than other funds also because of their intended audience and the traditions from that class of funds long history they tend to invest somewhat more conservatively in both asset classes   there are two general types of balanced funds conservative allocation funds and moderate allocation funds conservative allocation funds invest in more fixed income than equity the classic mix is 60 bonds 40 stocks moderate allocation funds invest in more equity than fixed income classic mix 40 bonds 60 stocks a good pair of funds that are similar but the difference between conservative allocation and moderate allocation are vanguard 's income fund for the former and vanguard 's wellington fund for the latter disclaimer though both funds are broadly considered excellent this is not a recommendation good luck sorting this out

i could be wrong but i doubt that bernie started out with any intention of defrauding anyone really   i suspect it began the first time he hit a quarter when his returns were lower than everyone else 's or at least not as high as he 'd promised his investors they 'd be so he the numbers and lied to get past the moment thinking he 'd just make up for it the next quarter   only that never happened and so the lie carried forward and maybe grew as things did n't improve as he expected it only turned into a ponzi because he was n't as successful at investing as he was telling his investors he was and telling the truth would have meant the probability that he would have lost most of his clients as they went elsewhere   bernie could n't admit the truth so he had to keep up the fiction by actually paying out returns that did n't exist which required constantly finding new money to cover what he was paying out   the source of that money turned out to be new investors who were in by people already investing with bernie who told them how great he was as a financial wizard and they had the checks to prove it i think this got so far out of hand and it gradually dragged more and more people in because such things turn into black holes swallowing up everything that gets close had the 2008 financial crisis not hit then bernie might still be at it   the rapid downturns in the markets hit many of bernie 's investors with margin calls in other investments they held so they requested redemptions from him to cover their calls expecting that all of the money he 'd convinced to leave with him really existed   when he realized he could n't meet the flood of redemptions that was when he up and the bubble burst could he have succeeded by simple investing in berkshire   probably   but then how many people say that in hindsight about them or amazon or google or any number of other stocks that turned out similarly grin   taking people 's money and parking it all in one stock does n't make you a genius and that 's how bernie wanted to be viewed   to accomplish that he needed to find the opportunities nobody else saw and be the one to get there first   unfortunately his personal crystal ball was wrong and rather than taking his by admitting it to his investors his pride and ego led him down a path of deception that i 'm sure he had every intention of making right if he could   the problem was that moment never came keep in mind one thing   the $ 64 billion figure everyone cites is n't money that really existed in the first place   that number is what bernie claimed his fund was worth and it is not the amount he actually defrauded people out of   his actual cash intake was probably somewhere in the $ 20 billion range over that time   everything else beyond that was nothing more than the returns he was claiming to get for his clients   it 's what they thought they had in the bank with him rather than what was really there

you do not have to pay tax on any earnings inside a tfsa quoting wikipedia 's article investment income including capital gains and dividends earned in a tfsa is not taxed even when withdrawn this is backed up by the official tfsa government site which states investment income earned in a tfsa is tax free this makes the tfsa an appropriate vehicle to store investments which produce dividends for example if you invest $ 5500 and receive a total of $ 500 in dividends this year you will not pay tax on that $ 500 either in this tax year or even subsequently when you withdraw money out of your tfsa of course tfsas are n't meant to be used for regular withdrawals if you are planning on investing $ 5500 this year and withdrawing the dividends i 'd urge you to be careful and consider if this is actually the best sort of savings vehicle for you but that 's really just a general warning nothing specific to dividends it is possible to do this indeed withdrawing $ 500 in dividends this year will increase your available contribution room in the next tax year not in this tax year for example you contribute $ 5500 at the beginning of this year by the end of november you have accumulated $ 500 in dividends you withdraw these in december in the following tax year you can this $ 500 in addition to the standard $ 5500 contribution room so you could contribute $ 6000 just be careful with your calculations i messed mine up and ended up paying a rather substantial penalty for my overcontribution

well this relates to how you interpret something 's value we can use that magazine and restaurant as an example for you the extra $ more on a decent meal or wine is worth it while $ 5 for a magazine entertainment on a train ride might not be this is how all markets work people make decisions about how they value something and hence choose to spend or not if you 're asking should i value certain things the way i do well that 's a different story   e.g. should i keep that picture frame for years in the attic to sell it for $ 3 on ebay later probably not worth it but again you are making that decision based on how you choose to value it so to answer your question how can i possibly care about this when my stock portfolio is losing or gaining $ 1000 a day and is it normal yes it is normal and we all care everyone makes these decisions throughout each day people will vary as to what they value something to be but all in all everyone does just what you explained here is something that you may find interesting it is about how we value money what color is your money if the pdf does n't work for you then try this link what color is your money alt link

the fundamental issue with leverage of any sort really is that the amplified downsides are extremely likely to more than cancel out amplified equivalent upsides example without using a major swing 2x leverage on a 5 decline so a 10 decline   the 5 decline needs a increase to get back level   however the 2x leverage needs an increase to get back   so a cycle for the unleveraged returns of -5 + 5.4 would see the unleveraged asset go up by a net + but 2x leverage would leave you at   conversely imagine leverage it 's easy to do that 50 cash allocation after an underlying -5 the leverage needs only + to reach par   this is basically the argument for low volatility funds of course if you can leverage an asset that does n't go down then the leverage is great   and for an asset with an overall positive compound return a little leverage is probably not going to hurt simply because there are likely to be enough upsides to cancel out downsides

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

looking at the list of bonds you listed many of them are long dated in short in a rate rising environment it 's not like rates can go much lower in the foreseeable future these bond prices will drop in general in addition to any company specific events occurred to these names so be prepared for some paper losses   just because a bond is rated highly by credit agencies like s&p or moody 's does not automatically mean their prices do not fluctuate yes there is always a demand for highly rated bonds from pension funds mutual funds etc because of their investment mandates but i would suggest looking beyond credit ratings and yield and look further into whether these bonds are secured unsecured and if secured by what keep in mind in recent financial crisis prices of those cdos clos ended up even though they were given aaa ratings by rating agencies because some were backed by housing properties that were over valued and loans made to borrowers having difficulties to make repayments hence these type of bonds have greater default risks and traded at huge discounts most of them are also callable so you may not enjoy the seemingly high yield till their maturity date like others mentioned buying bonds outright is usually a big ticket item i would also suggest reviewing your cash liquidity and opportunity cost as oppose to investing in other asset classes and instruments

is this right the example is slightly off google would be running a cafeteria that can be subsidized employees pay an amount to buy food not every one spends the same amount or eats the same amount of food if someone does n't use cafeteria he does n't get more money for example suppose john doe makes $ 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20 for a take home pay of $ 80,000 he spends $ 10,000 on food his employer corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense costing them $ 10,000 but now they can pay john doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $ 10,000 $ the company is now spending $ employing john doe for a savings of $ if a scheme is devised specifically to evade taxes then it is invalid in this case bill may buy groceries worth only $ 5000 so keep track of which employee buys how much groceries in added cost of google plus one ca n't really call it a business expense

i would say yes it 's worth building additional retirement savings on top of a defined benefit pension plan plans that pay set annual income   here are a couple of reasons do n't put all your eggs in one basket   while is probably in good shape things can and do happen to pension plans   while there is a provincial system in place to guarantee some of your pension income $ 1000/mo if your plan goes bust your benefits are not 100 guaranteed defined benefit pension plans are designed to provide recurring annual income like your paycheck when you are employed   you ca n't take more out from your defined benefit pension plan when an emergency comes up   whereas your rrsp and eventually in retirement are accounts from which you can take out extra in any given year if necessary that being said canada revenue agency cra wo n't let you save as much in your rrsp as other people who do n't have pension plans normally individuals in canada are entitled to save 18 of their earned income up to a limit $ in 2009 in an rrsp each year   however to level the playing field individuals who are in a pension plan get a pension adjustment pa number on their t4 which reduces their available rrsp contribution room   otherwise they 'd be able to tax shelter more income for retirement than others so i would suggest if you have the rrsp room consider using it   i 'd also suggest you look at a tax free savings account tfsa especially if you do n't have much rrsp room due to the pension adjustment   if you 're not sure whether to use an rrsp or a tfsa consider both

i fell into a similar situation as you   i spent a lot of time trying to understand this and the instructions leave a lot to be desired   what follows is my ultimate decisions and my rationale   my taxes have already been filed so i will let you know if i get audited 1   so in cases like this i try to understand the intent   in this case section iii is trying to understand if pre tax money was added to your hsa that you were not entitled too   as you describe this does not apply to you   i would think you should be ok not including section iii i did n't however i am not a tax lawyer or even a lawyer    2 i do not believe these are medical distributions from the 8889 doc    qualified hsa distribution    this is a distribution from a health flexible spending arrangement fsa or health reimbursement arrangement that is contributed by your employer directly to your hsa this is a one time distribution from any of these arrangements the distribution is treated as a rollover contribution to the hsa and is subject to the testing period rules shown below see pub 969 for more information    so i do n't think you have anything to report here    3 as you have no excess this line can just be zero    4 from the 8889 doc this is a distribution from your traditional ira or roth ira to your hsa in a direct trustee to trustee transfer    again i do n't think this applies to you so you can enter zero 5 this one is the easiest   you can always get this money tax free if you use it for qualified medical expenses from the 8889    distributions from an hsa used exclusively to pay qualified medical expenses of the account beneficiary spouse or dependents are from gross income see the line 15 instructions for information on medical expenses of dependents not claimed on your return you can receive distributions from an hsa even if you are not currently eligible to have contributions made to the hsa however any part of a distribution not used to pay qualified medical expenses is includible in gross income and is subject to an additional 20 tax unless an exception applies    i hope this helps

if the strike price closest to the underlying has high open interest the options expiration is a bigger event    for instance   stock is at $ 20 w/ average volume of 100,000 shares per day     20 strike has 1000 open interest    in this example the stock will most likely pin at 20 if we were expiring tomorrow      as u prob know long calls at close turn into stock long puts at turn into short stock    option pros high of volume do nt want to be short or long after expiration    long call holders will sell above 20 to hedge and long put holders will buy below 20    1000 open interest is equivalent to 100,000 shares    that 's the same amount as the average volume    stock ca n't really move until after expiration    if i am long 10 $ 20 calls and short 1000 shares i am flat going into expiration unless the stock gets smoked and now i am synthetically long a put short stock + long long put then watch out cause it was artificially locked down

if your fiancée took a title loan out on your truck you wo n't be able to trade it in for another vehicle until you pay the loan the dealer will likely take your slightly newer truck back because you wo n't be able to produce the title for the trade until the other debt is settled title loans are a terrible idea you should probably try to pay that loan off as quickly as possible regardless because interest rates are terrible on these loans   i will update this answer if you add details about the circumstances of the current loan on your truck

i do n't know any clever way to do what you 're describing   and in a sense you can see why there might not be one   a mortgage is n't just a magical way to reduce your housing expenses it 's a tradeoff in which you agree to a long term commitment in exchange for fixed costs or at least costs with a structure over that long term   if you 're unwilling to accept the obligation of paying for and maintaining the property over a long period you ca n't really expect to reap the benefits of lowered costs   part of the reason people say buying is better is because people often do live in the same place for a long time in which case if they rent they might miss out on savings they could have had if they bought instead   if you 're not going to live in the same place for a long time buying may not actually be better for you

firstly it is completely legal for a company to buy its own shares i do n't believe it would be legal to do so secretly it would also be very difficult to do that secretly    so hypothetically we have a company inc. it does n't have any assets other than $ 100 in a bank account and there are 100 shares each owned by a different person each share would be worth $ 1 so the company decides to buy one share now there is $ 99 in the account and 99 shares each share is still worth $ 1 so the company continues to buy shares until there is only one share left and $ 1 in the account if the company buys that last share it will no longer have any assets and will cease to exist effectively dissolving the company   tl dr it is called dissolving the company or dissolution and it happens fairly often with limited liability corporations

the advice i have is short and sweet be an investor not a speculator adopt the philosophy of warren buffet which is the buy and hold philosophy avoid individual stocks and buy mutual funds or etfs pick something that pays dividends and reinvest those dividends do n't become a speculator meaning avoid the buy low sell high philosophy   edit for some reason i can not add a comment so i am putting my response here   the buy low sell high approach makes money for the stock broker not necessarily you as we learn in the movie trading places each buy or sell creates a commission for the broker it is those commission expenses that eat away at your just do n't sell if a security is trading at $ 10 a share and pays $ 0.25 a share each quarter then you are getting 10 roi if you buy that security and if it continues to pay $ 0.25 a share each quarter if the price goes up then the roi for new buyers will go down but your roi will still be the same you will continue to get 10 for as long as you hold that security a mutual fund buys the individual stocks for you the value of the fund is only calculated at the end of the day an etf is like a mutual fund but the value of the etf is calculated moment by moment

how is it possible that long term treasury bonds which the government has never defaulted on can hold more risk as an etf then the stock market index the risk from long term bonds is n't that the government defaults but that interest rates go up before you get paid so investors want bonds issued more recently at higher interest rates rather than your older bonds that pay at a lower rate so the price for your bonds goes down this is usually caused by higher inflation rates which reduce the value of the interest that you will be paid do you assume more risk investing in bond etfs than you would investing in individual bonds if you are choosing the right etfs there should be a lower amount of risk because the etfs are taking care of the difficult work of buying a variety of bonds   are bond etfs an appropriate investment vehicle for risk diversification yes if you are investing in bonds exchange traded funds are an appropriate way to buy them the markets for etfs are usually very liquid

but their economy is based on built upon the very concept of debt just like the u.s. and most other advanced economies on the planet debt itself is n't the problem having to borrow to get capital and then service the debt is where the problems appear because whilst one group in the economy continues this old pattern of issuing debt and expecting payback with interest another prominent group has been undercutting the ability of debtors to service their debt by shifting how products and services develop and are used by the public it 's the old watch this hand trick with the other hand stabbing you when you 're not looking   simply put you ca n't have an economy based upon the debt return on interest model while at the very same time having an economy based on make everything in china india production service model if you make people have to borrow money to have money then you must give them a way to service that debt otherwise you 're just a bastard who refuses to acknowledge that adding two and two returns four an imbecile who insists that he can indeed have his cake and eat it too i could go on but the point is made

all transactions within an ira are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the   distributions from the ira are concerned you can only take cash from an ira and a cash distribution from a traditional ira is taxable as ordinary income same as interest from a bank say without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the ira from sales of stock etc in short just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to las vegas what happens within the ira stays within the ira note some ira custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you so that ownership of the 100 shares of ge say that you hold within your ira is transferred to you in your personal non ira brokerage account but as far as the irs is concerned your ira custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution gave you the cash and you promptly bought the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the ira it is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of ge stock inside the ira and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of ge stock in your personal brokerage account your basis in the 100 shares of ge stock is the cash that you received as a distribution from the ira so that when you sell the shares at some future time your capital gains or losses will be with respect to this basis the capital gains that occurred within the ira when the shares were sold by your ira custodian remain within the ira and you do n't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates that being said i would like to add to what told you in his answer your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old so 54 or 55 in 2011 it is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away and so she likely had started taking required minimum distributions from her ira before her death so you should have been taking rmds from the inherited ira starting with year 2012 the rmd for 2011 if not taken already by your mother before    she passed away should have been taken by her estate and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will or if she died in accordance with state law and/or probate court there would    not have been any 10 penalty tax due on the rmds taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet that rule applies to owners your mom in this case and not to beneficiaries you in this case so have you taken the rmds for 2012 2016 or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10 penalty for early   the penalty for not taking a rmd is 50 of the amount not distributed yes 50 if you did n't take rmds from the inherited ira for years 2012 2016 i recommend that you consult a cpa with expertise in tax law ask the cpa if he she is an enrolled agent with the irs enrolled agents have to pass an exam administered by the irs to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke and can represent you in front of the irs in cases of audit etc

a dividend is a cash disbursement from the company   the value of the company goes down the same amount of the dividend so it is analogous to having money in a savings account and taking a withdrawal every month   obviously you are going to have less in the end than if you just kept the money in the account suppose that i own 10 different stocks and do n't reinvest dividends but keep them on account and each month or two as i add more money to invest either in one of my existing stocks or perhaps something new i add whichever dividend amount is currently available in cash to my new purchase would this strategy provide the same results roughly yes   reinvesting dividends is essentially buying more stock at the lower price which is a net zero effect in total balance   so if you invested in the same stocks yes you 'd be in the same place   if you invested in different stocks then you would have a performance difference depending on what you invested in the risk is the temptation to take the cash dividend and not reinvest it but take it in cash thereby reducing your earning power that is is there some particular reason that the brokers are recommending automatically reinvesting dividends as opposed to reinvesting them manually perhaps not always in the same item i 'd like to think that they 're looking after your best interest and they might be but the cynical part of me thinks that they 're either trying to keep your business by increasing your returns or there 's some uk regulation i 'm not aware of that requires them to disclose the effect of reinvesting dividends     £ 100 invested in the uk stock market since would have grown into just £ after adjusting for inflation this figure seems ludicrous to me   i have n't actually measured what the historical returns on the uk market are but that would mean an annualized return adjusted for inflation of just 0.5   either uk stocks pay a ridiculous amount of dividends or there 's something wrong with the math edit i still have not found a definitive source for the real uk market return but according to this inflation calculator £ 100 in would equate to almost £ 12,000 today for an average inflation rate of percent which would put the cagr of the uk market at about 4.9 which seems reasonable   the cagr with dividend reinvestment would then be about making dividend reinvestment a no brainer in the uk market at least

i have a slightly different take on this compared to the other answers in general i think your emergency fund should always be at least 3 k especially if you own a used car that is out of warranty any number of unlucky auto repairs could easily cost over so if you have 7 k in savings i would personally buy a car that is 4 k or less or finance any amount of the car over 4 k if you can get a relatively low interest rate then i would pay down the financed portion of the car as quickly as possible while maintaining at least a 3 k emergency fund that being said notice i mentioned in general your situation may actually be quite different if you do n't have much debt with your income you might be able to build up a couple of thousand in savings in a single month and if so the above does n't really apply even if you spent the entire 7 k on a car you 'd likely have at least 3 k in your emergency fund within 60 90 days as for what 's responsible there are too many factors to dictate that if you do n't have many other expenses you could possibly afford a $ 40 k car and i do n't think anyone here could fairly call that irresponsible if you spent that much though surely no one would call it responsible either perhaps the best advice is to buy the least expensive car you will be happy with many people regret overspending on a vehicle but few regret unless they got a lemon that requires lots of repairs finally you could also consider another option you could get a very cheap car for 1 k or less and drive it for a year by then you may have closer to 20 k saved up for a much nicer car than you can afford today

i 've been budgeting with ms money since 2004 and was pretty disappointed to hear it 's being discontinued budgeting is actually a stress hobby for me and i can be a bit of a control freak when it comes to finances so i decided to start early looking for a replacement rather than waiting until ms money can no longer download transactions here are the pros and cons of the ones i 've tried updated you need a budget pro ynab based on the old envelopes system ynab has you money from each paycheck to a specific budget category envelope it encourages you to live on last money 's income and if you have trouble with overspending that can be a great plan personally i 'm a big believer in the envelope concept so that 's the biggest pro i found also it 's a downloaded software so once i 've bought it for about $ 50 it 's mine without forced upgrades as far as i 've seen the big con for me was that it does not automatically download transactions i would have to sign on to each institution 's website and manually download to the program also coming from money i 'm used to having features that ynab does n't offer like the ability to store information about my accounts overall it 's forward thinking and a good budgeting system but will take some extra time to download transactions and is n't really a comprehensive management tool for all my financial needs you can try it out with their free trial mint this is a free online program the free part was a major pro it also looks pretty if that 's important to you updating is automatic once you 've got it all set up so that 's a pro mint 's budgeting tools are so so basically you choose a category and tell it your limit it at you by text or email when you cross the line but does n't seem to offer any other incentive to stay on budget   when i first looked at mint it did not connect with my credit union but it currently connects to all my banks and all but one of my student loan institutions   another recent improvement is that mint now allows you to manually add transactions including pending checks and cash transactions   the cons for me are that it does not give me a good end of the month report does n't allow me to enter details of my paychecks and does n't give me any cash flow forecasting overall mint is a good casual retrospective free online tool but does n't allow for much planning ahead mvelopes here 's another online option but this one is subscription based again we find the old envelopes system which i think is smart so that 's a pro for me it 's online so it downloads transactions automatically but also allows you to manually add transactions so another pro the big con on this one is the cost depending on how you far ahead you choose to pay quarterly yearly or you 're paying $ to $ 12 per month they do offer a free trial for 14 days plus another 14 days offered when you try to cancel another con is that they do n't provide meaningful reports overall a good concept but not worth the cost for me quicken i had n't tried quicken earlier because they do n't offer a free trial but after the last few fell short i landed with quicken 2009 pro for quicken as an ms money user is that it is remarkably similar in format and options the registers and reports are nearly identical one frustration i 'd had with money was that it was ridiculously slow at start up and after a year or so of entering data quicken is dragging con for quicken again as an ms money user is that it 's budgeting is not as detailed as i would like   also it does not download transactions smoothly now that my banks all ask security questions as part of sign in   i have to sign in to my bank 's website and manually download   quicken 2011 is out now but i have n't tried it yet   hopefully they 've solved the problem of security questions   quicken 2011 promises an improved cash flow forecast which sounds promising and was a feature of ms money that i have very much missed   have n't decided yet if it 's worth the $ 50 to upgrade to 2011

think about how loans work for you personally   when you charge a $ 50 dinner for two to your visa card you did not earn $ 50 in income   you did not pay income tax on that $ 50   the money you use to pay back that $ 50 at the end of the month is not tax deductible     interest on a loan is a business expense     repayment of principal is not a business expense just as receiving the loan in the first place is not business income    effectively this means the llc repays the loan with after tax dollars   just like you do with your visa card   when i do corporate accounting payment of loan interest shows up on the expense side of the profit loss statement and it makes the balance sheet net assets go down    however payment of loan principal is effectively null   it does n't appear on the profit loss at all and it 's a wash on the balance sheet as both assets and liabilities fall by the same amount

it depends on what your investment goals are   are you investing for the short term or the long term   what was your reason for investing in these stocks in the first place   timing short term fluctuations in the market is very difficult so if that 's your goal i would n't count on being able to sell and buy back in at exactly the right time   rather i think you should think about what your investment rationale was in the first place and whether or not that rationale still holds   if it does then hold on to the stocks   if it does n't then sell

gt;i think you mean 60 of all mortgages on homes in nevada are underwater not every home has a mortgage so it 's not 60 of the homes it 's 60 of the mortgages   spot on in the us typically somewhere around 30 to 40 of homes have no mortgage at all i.e. 100 equity by the owners   so if nevada follows the us average which it may not having a lot of new developments then 60 of would be somewhere between 36 to 42 of homes   that of course is still huge if even 10 of homes in a locale are distressed sales it is enough to drive prices down   but another caveat is that just because a place is underwater does not mean that it has a high negative equity point of fact is that any home bought with an ltv mortgage or a really low down payment i.e. 0 to 10 down payment is probably underwater from day one and remains pretty close to that for the first couple of years    why because typical realtor fees are around 6 and closing costs are easily another couple of percent add in that with a self amortizing loan that very little equity is built up in the first few years and any loss for aging and owner cash out equity can easily be near zero or negative   that 's one of the reasons you should n't buy unless you are planning on living somewhere for at least 5 years because it takes that long to recoup the realtor amp closing costs ergo the whole flipping is in and of itself a sign that a market is in a speculative bubble

i got started by reading the following two books you could probably get by with just the first of those two i have n't been a big fan of the for dummies series in the past but i found both of these were quite good particularly for people who have little understanding of investing i also rather like the site canadian couch potato that has a wealth of information on passive investing using mutual funds and etfs it 's a good next step after reading one or the other of the books above in your specific case you are investing for the fairly short term and your tolerance for risk seems to be quite low gold is a high risk investment and in my opinion is ill suited to your investment goals i 'd say you are looking at a money market account very low risk low return such as e.g. the td canadian money market fund you may also want to take a look at e.g. the td canadian bond index which is only slightly higher risk however for someone just starting out and without a whack of knowledge i rather like pointing people at the ing direct funds they offer three options balancing risk vs reward you can fill in their online fund and it 'll point you in the right direction you can pay less by buying individual stock and bond funds through your bank following e.g. one of the canadian couch potato 's model portfolios but ing direct makes things nice and simple and is a good option for people who do n't care to spend a lot of time on this note that i am not a financial adviser and i have only a limited understanding of your needs you may want to consult one though you 'll want to be careful when doing so to avoid just talking to a salesperson also note that i am biased toward passive index investing other people may recommend that you invest in gold or real estate or specific stocks i think that 's a bad idea and believe i have the science to back this up but i may be wrong

my broker the order book by price and marketplace displaying the number of shares available at each level sorted as in victor 's you can glean information from not just a snapshot of the order book but also by watching how it changes over time although it 's not always a complete picture many brokers hold limit orders internally until the market is close at which point they 'll route to an exchange or trade internally and of course skilled market participants know that there 's people out there looking to glean information from the order book and will act to confuse the picture the order book can show you combined with a list of trades price size and whether it was a buy or sell you can get a much more complete picture of what 's going on with a stock than by looking at charts alone

it bothers me how your being downvoted in a goddamn business sub like i get people like tesla and think it 's going to be a good company but as of right now this company does n't make money and is n't that the whole point of a business sure it might have huge and amazing potential but that 's all it is potential i like tesla as much as the next guy i 'm kicking myself for not buying the stock when i first saw it mentioned on reddit and i considered buying it that was at like $ 70    but there is a simple fact that the company may be overvalued it 's valued like a tech company when it 's currently operating like a car company sure you can argue they are really a tech company or will be in the future when if they dominate the battery market but then that means news like this should n't even make a dent on their price    you gave your simple and valid reasons for why you would n't buy tesla but obviously people do n't want to hear it and will downvote it instead of actually making a discussion from it     sometimes i think that marketing team has reddit completely figured out and is just abusing it

forms 1099 and w2 are mutually exclusive employers file both not the employees 1099 is filed for contractors w2 is filed for employees these terms are defined in the tax code and you may very well be employee even though your employer pays you as a contractor and issues 1099 you may complain to the irs if this is the case and have them explain the difference to the employer at the employer 's expense through fines and penalties employers usually do this to avoid providing benefits and by the way also avoid paying payroll taxes if you 're working as a contractor lets check your follow up questions where do i pay my taxes on my hourly that means does the irs have a    payment center for the tax i pay if you 're an independent contractor 1099 you 're supposed to pay your own taxes on a quarterly basis using the form 1040-es check this page for more information on your quarterly payments and follow the links if you 're a salaried employee elsewhere i.e. receive w2 from a different employer then instead of doing the quarterly estimates you can adjust your salary withholding at that other place of work to cover for your additional income to do that you submit an updated form w4 there check with the payroll department on details is this a hobby tax no such thing hobby income is taxed as ordinary income the difference is that hobby can not be at loss while regular business activity can if you 're a contractor it is likely that you 're not working at loss so it is irrelevant what tax do i pay the city does this require a sole proprietor    license this really depends on your local laws and the type of work you 're doing and where you 're doing it most likely if you 're working from your employer 's office you do n't need any business license from the city unless you have to be licensed to do the job if you 're working from home you might need a license check with the local government these are very general answers to very general questions you should seek a proper advice from a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state for your specific case

what a coincidence this was an exam question for my business law class   the main reason why individuals are not allowed to deduct expenses is because income tax revenue would be zero   the reason being if an individual is allowed to deduct expenses he she would spend 100 of their income and deduct it all on their tax returns which would mean he she would pay virtually no income tax this is bad for the gov't and the economy   it 's bad for the gov't because they loose tax revenue and it 's bad for the economy because people would not have any savings for tough times which can send the economy into a negative spiral

the problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow if we want to apply this approach to short selling we should look at the trade from another perspective we buy money and pay for this money with stock our investment to buy 50 $ in your example is 1 share   when closing the short position we effectively sell back our money 50 $ and receive 2 shares our profit on this position is obviously 1 share setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100    in reality we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share this is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit

you can make a rough calculation of the annual turnover rate of stocks by calculating the institutional investors holding of that stock institutional investors are the only firms that are required to provide such data the good this is they usually make the lion share of trading activity on the other hand this task might proof    a different ratio that could be used as a substitute share turnover which is calculated as   share turnover gives the number of shares traded as a fraction of the number of shares outstanding for example if you compare the results of stock turnover for three companies and the results came as follows   company a share turnover 1.5 times company b share turnover 3 times company c share turnover 0.3 times from the results we can conclude that for a particular period company c had the least activity and the number of shares traded for that period was only a small fraction of the shares outstanding while other traders of company c hold most shares and never trade them if you make a cross analysis of a list of businesses you intend to invest in you could figure which one has the least number of in the shares traded

$ 1000 is not that much and i think the best you can do with them is keeping them in a high yield savings account look at the online savings accounts that give 1 and more not the regular bank savings accounts which are worthless if you need money all of a sudden for a school book or rent or bills or some other emergency expense you do n't want to deal with selling stocks or funds which may be at loss or breaking into your cd 's it is usually considered a good practice to keep cash that would keep you afloat for 5 6 months in savings or some cash equivalent as an emergency fund

fair enough either way if your skills are at the minimum wage level you should not be supporting a kid and a women man how can you expect to provide a decent life if you are making that much no the government should n't force businesses to pay more you should be earning more if you want to raise a kid and a significant other i 'm not comparing it to basic needs i 'm saying you have a choice you can choose to bring a kid into your life or not and if you are on minimum wage it does no good for anyone not the person earning not the kid not the business no one    is that so hard to understand it 's economics 101 increasing the minimum wage leads to only negative consequences and in this digital age they will be coming sooner rather than later

well if the bond notes are the only currency around then the electric company will have to choose from at least one of the money supplies to accept as payment bonds will be the cash   whichever firm they choose will just see their money demand go up     second it will most likely be implied that those people choosing to go into a certain money supply will want to look for a produced good or service in the economy from that firm before taking on it 's notes   if the supply has too much inflation for everyone than they can all move to another one that ensures their capital value     the idea of these systems is also to facilitate productive decision making which is one of the things are education system should do more of these days   this will be more possible when government is more limited to and more focused on the role of researcher and developer

you 're looking at a used car which is good but i think you can still be much wiser with the type of car you 're looking to purchase maybe i 'm such a because i did n't own a car until i was 25 but let 's break this down with a small comparison if you drive 1,000 miles per month with gas at $ which is absurdly conservative i think for five years then you 're looking at an extra $ for just gas and probably twice the payment compared with a perfectly reliable but more fuel efficient car from the same year   disclosure   i own a 2004 corolla and love it   i got mine in 2007 for under $ 10k and i paid cash $ 300/month or so is a good chunk of change no   i 'd do even more and pay that loan off which will almost certainly be less than $ 500/month faster by throwing $ 500/month at it   you 'll save hundreds of dollars in interest edit based on your additions there 's one thing that you do n't see yet that i have   it 's only because you 're in your early 20s and i 'm pushing 40 it is far easier to sock money away when you 're single and do n't have a family to take care of i 'm assuming you 're not married yet and that you do n't have kids   hopefully it 's not a poor assumption i would be saving like crazy now if i were in your position   you have a great job for fresh out of college   my first job started ten years ago after grad school at the same salary you 're making   man it was so easy to save money back then   now that i 'm married with a daughter a lot of that cushion goes away   i would n't trade it for the world but that 's the price of being head of household if you have any intentions of not being a for the rest of your life and i hope you do then you 'd be wise to save as much as you can now

the trouble is not enough americans today are willing to do hard physical work for low pay at the same time americans are n't willing to pay more for things like landscaping and fruits and veggies i would be delighted if we fixed our broken legal immigration system but since we ca n't seem to do that we get illegal immigrants and every day both you and i use products they produced

not sure that political leadership ever has been a strength in the u.s.    and seem to have had as much to do with anything the federal government has accomplished for which any politician could take credit   or as so famously said you can always count on americans to do the right thing after they 've tried everything else    with all of 's decisions even congress 's weak attempts at limiting campaign contributions we 've developed the federal government we deserve an one whose members all of whom spend more time fundraising than governing are more concerned about furthering their own careers than what 's good for the nation   they come into office as promising lie after lie   and they serve only their own self focused interests   whoever can give them the most money wins   no matter what they tell us

it does n't matter if the buyer breaches the contract during the due diligence period because most due diligence periods allow the buyer to breach the agreement without cause   unless there is due diligence money added to the contract different from earnest money then breaching the contract costs nothing to the buyer this happened to me   i learned the hard way   until the due diligence period is over the buyer can without consequences   it 's one of the risks of being a seller

i disagree the us has secret no one knows who you vote for unless you tell them this board member publicly supported and for a candidate that potentially has interests hostile to companies the board member is associated with i do n't see it as remarkable or even particularly newsworthy really that another member calls him out on it

or am missing something   yes the rate of is illustration there is no guarantee that the rate will be applicable my yearly premium is rs on this amount i will save tax of rs so net premium is rs the other way to look at this is invest rs or actually less of eq term deposit premium if you invest into eq term deposit lock in for 6 years with tax benefits your numbers are going to be very different and definitely better than returns edits

people know there are lots of good colleges where you can get a 4 year degree for under $ 45 50 k in tuition right it is a choice to go to a school where you will be $ 120 k in debt the gap between what people make who graduate college with a degree and those who only have a hs degree continues to widen does it not since graduating 4 years ago i 've never worked at a company who will hire a person without a degree

for simplicity let 's start by just considering cash back in general cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable but for business use it is taxable sort of i 'll explain later the reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars you typically are n't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income so if you purchase something that costs $ 100 and you receive $ 2 back from the cc company effectively you have paid $ 98 for that item but that would n't affect your tax bill however since businesses typically deduct most expenses that same $ 100 deduction would have only been a $ 98 deduction for business tax purposes so in this case the $ 2 should be accounted for note you should not consider that $ 2 as income though that would artificially inflate your revenue it should be treated as a negative expense similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a cc refund now for your specific questions part 1 as a small business owner i wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business i have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare hotel and rental car will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt effectively no these expenses are not deductible if you deduct them they will be completely counter acted by the refund you receive for the payments part 2 does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card rather than a business credit card this is where it gets hairy suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement in this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards points cashback the trick is as the employee you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a do n't ask do n't tell rule that the irs is ok with it works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income however i would not go out of my way to abuse this loophole typically things like travel airfare hotel car rental meals are expected but i would n't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you the company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received or more realistically negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check part 3 would there be any difference between credit card points and brand loyalty points if the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company 's loyalty system not a cc would that yield a different result there is no difference perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur in other words the expense should show up on a bank or cc statement this is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity you ca n't call that a donation of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them but it ends up being a wash

the good thing is that as luck would have it the jews do n't control the military because the jews do n't like an enemy that can fight back and like to kill unarmed civilians in palestine   so it seems that while the government and the economy have all fallen into the hands of israeli agents we can still look to our military to save us
