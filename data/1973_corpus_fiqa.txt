the short answer is yes losses get passed through to members limits percentages do apply primarily based on your share in the business check out the final post in this thread     it 's not a bad little summary of the profit loss pass through   regarding your k example the amount of money you earn in your day job will impact how much loss you can claim unfortunately i ca n't find anything more recent at the irs or but see this from 2004 40 k was the limit before the amount you could claim against started to be mitigated hth

money market accounts insured in the same way as other deposits are strange hybrids of traditional bank deposits and bond mutual funds because of the high inflation of the 1970s banks were starved of deposits and could not produce loans at sufficient rates   for this reason they desired a way to fund loans and congress enacted the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act which permitted a new form of account that retained the functionality of a deposit account such as checking and now electronic transfers yet transferred the risk to the account thus most of the profit   this allowed banks to fund each others new loans through packaging them into asset backed securities to be held in these special accounts as an added protection they are not permitted to carry a market value less than what 's owed to depositors and are forcibly liquidated and paid in such event   this is a rare occurrence because of the nature of the assets held credit assets such as commercial paper mortgages and corporate bonds   this is the opposite case of deposits because so long as a bank can maintain payments on its liabilities and satisfy a few other regulatory requirements non regulation satisfying assets could theoretically carry a zero balance meaning that a bank could owe depositors more than what could be paid by liquidating all assets money market accounts will typically pay a higher rate because of their structure   while inflation is low and immediate term interest rates set by the central bank are also low the net figure will not appear high but the ratio will be fantastic usually something like 3x the one downside to money market accounts is that withdrawals are restricted by frequency   this is not such a problem as before since brokerages are now issuing debit cards tied to brokerage accounts and excess money can be swept into money market accounts bypassing the regulatory restriction in short money market accounts are currently a far better choice than traditional checking accounts but pay less than savings accounts

the card holder agreement does not explicitly specify a minimum spending requirement it does though have the following catch all clause for closing the account we may    cancel your account    suspend the ability to make charges    cancel or suspend any feature on your account and    notify merchants that your account has been    cancelled or suspended    if we do any of these you must still pay us for all    charges under the terms of this agreement we may do any of these things at our discretion even if you pay on    time and your account is not in default if your account is cancelled    you must destroy your cards we may agree to reinstate your account    after a cancellation if we do this we may reinstate any    additional cards issued on your account charge you any applicable    annual fees and charge you a fee for the account one would suspect that american express would happily collect the fee from anyone who holds the card but is not using it in any way someone though that is n't spending the expected amount of money but is availing themselves of the 24 hour concierge service etc would probably find their privileges revoked and/or their card canceled

there are still ways that the default values on the w4 can lead you to get a refund or owe the irs if there was a big delta in your paychecks it can lead to problems if you make and get 26 paychecks that means each check had a gross of 10,000 your company will withhold the same amount from each check but if you earned a big bonus then the smaller regular paychecks may not have been withholding enough   when bonus checks are involved the payroll office has to treat them as irregular pay to be able to make it work out some companies do n't do this so you may under or over pay during the year if you changed companies during the year this can lead to under or over payment the lower paying company would not know about the higher rate of pay at the other company so at one you would under pay and the other you would over pay there are also social security issues with more than one employer

you are not actually entitled to any raise at all unless you had something contractually legally binding which made that so i 'm answering this from the uk but it has been common practice for people over the last 10 years or so to receive no yearly raise in some sectors this is what i would consider a bad raise if wages are not kept in line with inflation you are effectively earning less every year in this regard i would not work for any employer who did not offer an annual raise that was at the very least covering the rate of inflation these rates are easy to find in your country by googling it in terms of a standard raise i would argue there is no such thing this depends on the industry sector you work in your employers opinion of your performance note i 've used the word opinion because sometimes you may think the effort you put in is different to what they think be prepared to give evidence of what you 've achieved for them with things to back it up a good raise is anything which is way above a standard raise since there is no concise of a standard raise this is also hard to quantify as others have mentioned do not stay in a role where you are not being given a raise that covers inflation because it means every year you have less purchasing power which is akin to your salary going down it 's very easy to justify to an employer you 're leaving and indeed one you 're going to why you 're making the move under these conditions

an addition to the other answers more than a real answer i suspect note that fees are not the only way that you pay for foreign exchange where no foreign exchange fee is charged the issuer makes it back by giving an appalling spread on the rate be very careful not to go for a card that has no fees but an exorbitant spread i personally would open a cad denominated account in canada and convert a larger amount into that account when cad is historically weak the spreads will be better that way but do n't attempt to use it to mitigate exchange rate risk or to trade the two currencies for profit as that way madness and lie

as others mentioned the only clear reason to remain in debt is if you can find an investment that yields more than what you 're paying to maintain the debt this can happen if a debt was established during low rate period and you 're in a high rate period not what is happening now a speculative reason to keep debt is as an inflation bet if you believe money will shortly lose value you are better off repayment until the drop occurs however you 're not likely to be able to make these bets successfully hope this helps

it makes sense if the npv is positive but what rate should you use at determining the npv a textbook might say market rate and by definition the market rate to use in bond calculations like yours will mean that your npv will be zero   how can this be well it 's a bit of a circular definition you take less capital to earn a higher return the value of your capital spread over the period of the bond 's maturity is the net difference but the money in your pocket from selling the bond and not purchasing also has value banks and traders do this exact swap every day many many times the rate at which you can execute this swap is what defines the market rate therefore by definition the npv will be zero now this does n't mean it 's a bad idea for you you can on your own accord decide the value you place on the capital versus the yield and make the decision do you expect rates to rise or fall do you expect higher or lower inflation in reality you can form whatever opinion you like for your own circumstance but the market is the net aggregation of opinion you only get to decide whether or not you agree with the market

if you had n't done it already cut up the cards do n't close the accounts because it could hurt your credit score even more switching some or all of the cc debt onto low rate cards or a debt consolidation loan is a way that some people use to reduce their credit card payments   the biggest risk is that you become less aggressive with the loan payback if you were planning on paying $ 800 in minimum payments plus $ 200 extra each month then still pay $ 1000 with the new loan and remaining credit cards   another risk is that you start the credit card again because you have available credit on the card that was paid off with the loan the third risk which you have n't proposed occurs when people switch unsecured credit card dept to a secured 2nd mortgage debt this then puts the family home at risk

this is a complicated subject because professional traders do n't rely on brokers for stock quotes   they have access to market data using level ii terminals which show them all of the prices buy and sell for a given stock    every publicly traded stock at least in the u.s. relies on firms called market makers   market makers are the ones who ultimately actually buy and sell the shares of companies making their money on the difference between what they bought the stock at and what they can sell it for   sometimes those margins can be in hundreds of a cent per share but if you trade enough shares well it adds up the most widely traded stocks apple microsoft bp etc may have hundreds of market makers who are willing to handle share trades   each market maker sets their own price on what they 'll pay the bid to buy someone 's stock who wants to sell and what they 'll sell the ask that share for to someone who wants to buy it    when a market maker wants to be competitive he may price his bid ask pretty aggressively because automated trading systems are designed to seek out the best bid ask prices for their trade   as such you might get a huge chunk of market makers in a popular stock to all set their prices almost identically to one another   other market makers who are n't as enthusiastic will set less competitive prices so they do n't get much maybe no business   in any case what you see when you pull up a stock quote is called the best bid ask price   in other words you 're seeing the highest price a market maker will pay to buy that stock and the lowest price that a market maker will sell that stock   you may get a best bid from one market maker and a best ask from a different one   in any case consumers must be given best bid ask prices market makers actually control the prices of shares   they can see what 's out there in terms of what people want to buy or sell and they modify their prices accordingly   if they see a bunch of sell orders coming into the system they 'll start dropping prices and if people are in a buying mood then they 'll raise prices market makers can actually ignore requests for trades whether buy or sell if they choose to and sometimes they do which is why a limit order a request to buy sell a stock at a specific price regardless of its current actual price that someone places may go unfilled and die at the end of the trading session   no market maker is willing to fill the order nowadays these systems are largely automated so they operate according to complex rules defined by their owners   very few trades actually involve human intervention because people ca n't digest the information at a fast enough pace to keep up with automated platforms so that 's the basics of how share prices work   i hope this answered your question without being too confusing good luck

obvious answer but the limit order should be set at the price that you are willing to pay more if you want a decent chance of the order filling in short notice you should place the order one price tick above the current highest buyer bid price as long as high frequency trading remains alive i would advise against ever using market orders these algorithmic trades can occasionally severely distort the price of a security in a fraction of a second so if your market order happens to fill in during such a distortion you might end up massively overpaying

if wire transfer through your bank does not work then perhaps one of the more popular money transfer services may be what you are looking for such as moneygram or western union now these rely on a trusted registered third party to do the money transfer so you need to make sure that you are working with a legitimate broker each money transfer service has a site that allows you to perform the search on registered parties around your area there are certain fees that are sometimes applied due to the amount being transferred all of these you will want to do some detailed research on before you make the transfer so that you do not get scammed    i would suggest doing a lot of research and asking people that you trust to recommend a trusted broker   i have not personally used the services but doing a quick search brought many options with different competitive conversion rates as well as fees good luck

do n't put money in things that you do n't understand etfs wo n't kill you ignorance will the leveraged ultra long short etfs hold swaps that are essentially bets on the daily performance of the market there is no guarantee that they will perform as designed at all and they frequently do not iirc in most cases you should n't even be holding these things overnight there are n't any hidden fees but derivative risk can wipe out portions of the portfolio and since the main asset in an ultra long short etf are swaps you 're also subject to counterparty risk if the investment bank the fund made its bet with can not meet it 's obligation you 're   may lost alot of money you need to read the prospectus carefully the re strategy the fund seeks daily investment results before fees and expenses that correspond to twice the inverse of the daily performance of the index the fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day the prospectus re risk because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day ’s return over time the return of the fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day ’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from twice the inverse of the return of the index over the same period a fund will lose money if the index performance is flat over time and it is possible that the fund will lose money over time even if the index ’s performance decreases as a result of daily rebalancing the index ’s volatility and the effects of compounding see principal risks if you want to hedge your investments over a longer period of time you should look at more traditional strategies like options if you do n't have the money to make an option strategy work you probably ca n't afford to speculate with leveraged etfs either

i believe the law was originally introduced to preserve competition in the market smaller companies with very good products ca n't compete with someone who can leverage their monopolist position in other markets (= high market share unrelated to the number of competitors in promoting possibly inferior products in other markets google has hundreds of millions of their search engine users in the eu alone   it should not affect normal competition since the law only applies across different markets

great so we agree it 's not a fraud and the title of the bloomberg article is grossly misleading   even still to call it a bubble you 'd need to first agree to what the non bubble valuation of bitcoin would be the consensus among those who use the word tulip frequently when talking about bitcoin is that the non bubble valuation of bitcoin is zero 0   this of course means that bitcoin has been in a bubble ever since the first exchange of good was made with it which tells us was a purchase of 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins establishing a price of under $ 0.01 per bitcoin ever since for the past 7 years bitcoin has been in a bubble    furthermore for as long as bitcoin 's market value remains at or above $ 0.01 per bitcoin it will still be in a bubble if me and a few hundred thousand of my closest friends have anything to say about it that will never happen and therefore bitcoin will remain in a bubble indefinitely   now that to me seems like a very unusual bubble if that strikes you as a stretch of the concept too then maybe we need to revisit an assumption or two here   for one is the non bubble valuation of bitcoin really zero is there perhaps something about bitcoin that might give it some intrinsic value that say tulips or babies may not have and if there is is there a way to estimate what that value may be does that value change over time is it perhaps possible that the value of bitcoin correlates in some fashion with its reach and its network effect    those are harder questions to answer and their answers is certainly not as neat and precise as zero or bubble but maybe it 's useful to think about them when trying to reason about what bitcoin is and is n't

gt you are the one using false equivalency   no i am using a rather simple parallel to show that consent is socially created and can exist non explicitly   your response is simply to assert your own opinion that you have not consented to the state without any reason to take that view seriously you grew up under the rule of your state you were educated about the implications of that long before you were expected to start paying taxes and there is nothing preventing you from leaving the state 's jurisdiction at any time your opinion that this does not indicate consent is irrelevant because the whole rest of society thinks that it does if arbitrarily asserting that you have n't consented to things was an argument literally anything can be oppressive i can walk into your home and set up camp in your living room and say i did n't consent to this being your house all social rules are instantly out the window is that how society works   i 've jumped through these hoops before i know how you people try and pull this off it does n't work your position is not it 's just a series of language tricks that people who have n't thought it all the way through   you 're either a charlatan or you 've been deceived by one and i do n't really care to learn which   quoting myself from weeks ago   gt gt gt gt i 'd like to know how exactly i opt into paying    gt gt gt by choosing to occupy the territory ruled by your state despite being fully informed about the implications of doing so and having been made informed well before you had an obligation to start paying    gt gt that 's not an agreement    gt let 's say i walk into a shop say i 'll have a medium coke please they hand me one i walk out of the building am i stealing well i did n't specifically agree to pay for it did i but that argument would n't hold much weight in an actual legal dispute because obviously i understand that when you ask for an item in a shop you 're implicitly agreeing to pay for it at some point   gt   gt but what about some less obvious cases if a put a small sign near the that said entry fee ten dollars entering the store constitutes agreement to pay you could reasonably argue this is invalid because you walked into the store without noticing the sign and the practice is quite unusual but if instead of a shop it were a theater performance you walked into maybe that argument would n't hold up because you should be expected to understand there 's an entry fee at a theater and maybe if you were from a country that does n't have theaters and you were thus genuinely unaware of this particular social custom they would make an exception and you 'd get away with it this is the kind of problem a judicial system exists for to take social context into account   gt   gt the point is whether something constitutes agreement or not and thus what are the legal repercussions to your actions is a matter of opinion and in this case i do n't see any particular reason to think that your opinion about the government ought to overrule that of the rest of society your actions are interpreted as indicating consent for the system you 're acting in and this being so if you took the government to court on the charge that it 's stealing from you you would obviously lose so how is it an argument to just say but that 's not an agreement in my opinion that 's as irrelevant as me saying but i did n't agree to pay for this food i just ate officer i just walked in and asked for food and they gave it to me and i ate it that 's not an agreement in my opinion   gt

realization is literally when something is made real for example let 's say that you own some stock   you bought the stock for $ 1000 and after many years the stock is worth $ 10,000   your investment has gained $ 9,000   however you do n't actually have this $ 10,000 you just own stock that is supposedly worth $ 10,000 on paper   tomorrow the value of the stock could plummet and only be worth $ 8,000   but if you sell your stock today and obtain this $ 10,000 the gain has now become real   you have realized a $ 9,000 gain in investing realization of a gain or loss occurs when an asset that you own has been sold for more or less than what you purchased it for   before the asset is sold you only have a theoretical gain or loss based on what you might receive if you sold the asset today   and tomorrow that theoretical gain or loss could change

as to where the interest comes from the same place it comes from in other kinds of savings accounts the bank takes the money you deposit and invests it elsewhere traditionally by lending it out to others hence the concept of a savings and loan bank they make a profit as long as the interest they give for borrowing from you plus the cost of administering the savings accounts and loans is less than the interest they charge for lending to others no they do n't have to pay you interest but if they did n't you 'd be likely to deposit your funds at another bank which did their ideal goal is to pay as little as possible without losing depositors while charging as much as possible without losing borrowers yeah i know typo corrected why do they get higher interest rate than they pay you mostly because your deposits and interest are essentially guaranteed whereas the folks they 're lending to may be late paying or default on those loans as with any kind of investment higher return requires more work and/or higher risk plus larger reserves so you can afford to ride out any losses that do occur

cd laddering is a process of buying multiple cds at longer terms to take advantage of better interest rates while still having liquidity the benefit of a cd ladder is based on this assumption   without higher rates for longer terms i would n't ladder cds   so let 's assume you have $ 10,000 to invest    and let 's say you have a 12 month cd at 1 and a 24 month cd at 2 available to purchase you could lock all of your money up for 2 years and buy the 24 month cd at 2    this is a good rate of return but locks up your money for longer than you might otherwise have planned the laddering approach is to buy longer term cds over a regular interval    in this case we could buy a 2 year cd at 2 every 6 months    your ladder would look like this this gives you the 2 year rate 2 but you are always less than 6 months until your next cd matures giving you some liquidity when each cd matures you then purchase another 2 year cd at the more beneficial rate   you 'll always have something maturing every 6 months now if you want to start with your money immediately you can seed your ladder by buying partial terms like this the two year time maturity time frame and the interest rates are all examples   you could have 12 cds with one maturing every month one maturing every quarter etc the benefits of cd laddering are that a portion of your money is never far from maturity and that your interest rate is better than it otherwise would be the risks of cd laddering are the same as the risks of buying cds   if you think cds are a good investment cd laddering is a good way to invest at higher rates

remind yourself that markets recover usually within a few years if you believe this and can remind yourself of this you will be able to see the down cycles of the market as an opportunity to buy stock on sale no one knows the future so many people have found investing on a regular schedule to be helpful by putting in the same amount of money each period you will end up buying fewer shares when the market is up and more when it is down as long as your time horizon is appropriate you should be able to wait out the ups and downs stocks are volatile by their very nature so if you find that you are very concerned by this you might want to consider whether you should adjust the amount of risk in your investments since over time most people lose money by trying to time the market however if your investment goals and requirements have n't changed there likely is n't any need to change the types of assets you are investing in as what you are choosing to invest in should depend on your personal situation edit i am assuming you want to be a long term investor and owner making money by owning a portion of companies profits and not by trading stocks and/or speculation

first as @littleadv mentions and as i 've pointed out before anyone who participates in a market using limit orders which by the way should be every non professional investor is by definition a market maker   so i will assume that your question pertains both to official market makers and to retail investors using limit orders when you remark that there are such tight spreads in liquid assets what you are really saying is wow look at all the market makers in these products   that 's the benefit of electronic trading and algorithmic traders millions of participants each with their own opinion of the value of a financial instrument trying to find people who have very specifically opposing opinions of the value of that same instrument   this is called price discovery and is the entire point of financial markets so you ask why are there all these market makers present to create such tight spreads in assets like spy   answer because they can make money in these markets imagine towards a contradiction that market makers thought they could n't make money by offering tight spreads in spy and so spy had a wider spread than it actually does   for example say the highest bid for spy was $ and the lowest ask was $ 100.01   now imagine that a market maker with perfect knowledge of the future came along knowing that he would be able to sell spy for $ 100.01 in 5 minutes   then he would load up as many buy orders as he could for $ 100.00 or lower   he would n't bid $ 100.01 or higher because those trades would not be profitable according to his information at least not 5 minutes from now   so the spread had previously been $ 0.03 and then suddenly it was $ 0.01 all because a market maker with better information came along and realized he could make money by creating a tighter market now nobody has perfect knowledge of the future which is why markets are never infinitely tight or infinitely liquid   each market maker has to weigh possible profits against the probability that those profits will actually turn into losses   but if one market maker decides not to participate in a particular instrument there 's bound to be another market maker who will happily take his place   so the very fact that there are so many market participants with resting buy sell orders for spy right now is proof that there are market makers able to make money doing so   if they could not make money they would n't be there and the spread would be wider 10 15 years ago before electronic trading and algorithmic trading the number of market participants was far lower and the spreads were far wider meaning retail investors like you and me had a much harder time making money   the only people making money were the institutional investors the brokers and the exchanges   now that all these new millions of players are present in the market retail investors like you and me get to participate and make money too

there was an npr i think story a couple of years ago about the cost of college they found that while sticker prices were going up the price most people paid was n't actually rising that fast this was at least true in top tier schools i think some state schools have other issues like the state cutting back on funding so raising tuitions and/or cutting back on scholarships and grants   the weird thing i learned from the piece was that raising prices was a way to appear more attractive to top students apparently the psychological factors around getting a $ 10k scholarship to a $ 15k school or a $ 30k scholarship to a $ 35k school make the more expensive one look better

earned income is earned income   you can put your bonus in a tax advantaged account or not just like you can put your salary in a tax advantaged account or not   if you do n't it 's taxed as ordinary income now it may look like they 're taking a ton out of your paycheck but part of what may be happening is that for that paycheck it looks like you 're making a whole lot more so they 're withholding a whole lot more based on a probably conservative formula that will make sure you and they do n't get in trouble with the irs for   so if they 're taking out too much with this paycheck you 'll get it back when you file your taxes   or you can change your withholding yourself to account for this

are all bonds priced in such a way so that they all return the same amount on average after accounting for risk in other words do risk premiums only compensate for the amount investors might lose no ge might be able to issue a bond with lower yield than say a company from china with no previous records of its presence in the u.s. markets a bond price not only contains the risk of default but also encompasses the of the bond by the issuer with a specific stream of income location of main business any specific terms and conditions in the prospectus or not insurances against default etc else for the same payoff why would you take a higher risk the payoff of a higher risk not only default but term structure e.g. 5 years or 10 years coupon payments bond is more to compensate for the extra risk it entails for the bondholder the yield of a high risk bond will always be higher than a bond with lower risk if you travel back in time to 2011 2012 you would see the yields on greek bonds were in the range of 25 30 to reflect the high risk of a greek default some hedge funds made a killing by buying greek bonds during the eurozone crisis if you go through the efficient frontier theory your argument is a counter statement to it same with individual bonds or a portfolio of bonds you always want to be compensated for the risk you take the higher the risk the higher the compensation and vice versa when investors buy the bond at this price they are essentially buying a risk free bond logically yes but no it is n't and you should n't make that assumption

they already do it is just sneaky how it is done   they have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country   they do this by setting up particular legislation and shutting down public options and anything else that might cut out administration and executive profits   they do n't need to directly tax us in order to keep an unreasonable amount of money flowing to corporate executives and wealthy share holders   that is without even getting into and prohibition legislation   one way they could easily keep money flowing to hollywood would be an additional tax refund that applies to legitimate entertainment costs   or perhaps doing as canada does and adding taxes to storage media   they can also continue to cut web freedom options and bandwidth   every bit of legislation i see come down the pipe with only a couple of notable exceptions such as has been about protecting profits for the top of the economic pile at the expense of everyone else   edit   i would also like to mention that our taxes already fund healthcare and in fact we pay so much that we could have a universal system already just with the money we spend via taxes   it is so hyper inflated because of the vast amount of profit built into the system at all levels     we have to cut out admin and profits to the hyper wealthy if we wish to have a reasonable healthcare system   this chart in particular shows the problem     this was just in 2008 costs have increased since then at the accelerated rate   so yes the oligarchy has ways of making us pay without introducing specific new taxation

credit is very important even if you are wealthy one thing you may not realize is that rich people typically have comparatively little cash on hand   if they 're smart most of their assets are not liquid they 're tied up in safe long term investments   they use credit for their day to day expenses and pay it off from the dividends on their investments which might only come in once a quarter there are also tax advantages to using credit   if a rich person wanted a new car he 'd be smarter leasing it for his business immediate write off of the lease payments on taxes versus buying it depreciation over several years plus property tax liability in some states   there are more elaborate tax but the point is that buying a car outright is the worst option in terms of tax avoidance another way the rich mis use credit is so that they do n't risk their own money on business ventures   let 's say i have $ 1,000,000 in my personal bank account and i want to buy a business that costs $ 1m.   if i am dumb i clean out my bank account and put all my money in the business   i get 100 of the profits but i also bear 100 of the risk   if i 'm smart i loan 200 k of my own money in the business and put the rest someplace safe and get a loan from a bank for the other   if the business succeeds the bank gets their money back plus interest   if it fails the business declares bankruptcy and the bank eats the 800k loss if i structured the debt right my personal loan to the failed business gets paid back first when the company is liquidated and the bank gets whatever is left over if anything   the most of my own money i can possibly lose is 200k and probably it 's closer to zero if i have a good accountant

some details in case you are interested being a defined benefit kind of pension plan the formula for your social security benefits is n't tied directly to fica contributions and i 'm not aware of any calculator that performs an roi based on fica contributions rather how much you 'll get in retirement is based on your average indexed monthly earnings   here 's some information on the social security calculation from the social security administration primary insurance amount for an individual who first becomes eligible for old age insurance    benefits or disability insurance benefits in 2013 or who dies in 2013    before becoming eligible for benefits his her will be the sum of        a 90 percent of the first $ of his her average indexed monthly earnings plus        b 32 percent of his her average indexed monthly earnings over $ and through $ plus        c 15 percent of his her average indexed monthly earnings over $ here 's an example   of course to calculate a benefit in the future you 'll need to calculate projected average indexed monthly earnings more details here   you 'll also need to make assumptions about what those bend points might be in the future   the average wage indexing values for calculating the are available from the social security administration 's site but future indexing values will also need to be projected based on an assumption about their inflation   you 'll also need to project the contribution and benefit base which limits the earnings used to calculate contributions and benefits also the calculation assumes benefits are taken at the normal retirement age   calculating an early or late retirement factor is required to adjust benefits for another age   then whatever benefits you get will increase each year because the benefit is increased based on annual changes in the cost of living performing the series of calculations by hand is n't my idea of fun but implementing it as a spreadsheet or a web page and adding in some roi based on fica contributions calculations might be an interesting exercise if you are so inclined for completeness sake i 'll mention that the ssa also provides source code for a social security benefit calculator

real interest rates are so low because governments want people to use their money to improve the economy by spending or investing rather than saving their idea is that by consuming or investing you will help to create jobs that will employ people who will spend or invest their pay and so on if you want to keep this money for the future you do n't want to spend it and interest rates make saving therefore you ought to invest that was the why now the how inflation protected securities mentioned in another answer are the least risk way to do this these are government guaranteed and very unlikely to default on the other hand deflation will cause bigger problems for you and the returns will be pitiful compared with historical interest rates so what else can be done investing in companies is one way of improving returns but risk starts to increase so you need to decide what risk profile is right for you   investing in companies does not mean having to put money into the stock market either directly or indirectly through funds although index tracker funds have good returns and low risk the corporate bond market is lower risk for a lesser reward than the stock market but with better returns than current interest rates investment grade bonds are very low risk especially in the current economic climate and there are exchange traded funds etfs to diversify more risk away since you do n't mention willingness to take risk or the kind of amounts that you have to save i 've tried to give some low risk options beyond buy something inflation linked but you need to take care to understand the risks   of any product you buy or use be they a bank account tips bond investments or whatever avoid anything that you do n't fully understand

why must terms must be mutually exclusive   this false dichotomy is what seems to cause the most debate   it is the single event outcome that defines gambling gambling will involve an contract that is the outcome is specifically tied to a single event that determines profit loss this could be the outcome of a race or the roll of a dice but should involve chance   this is why gambling is often in the context of a game but i would make the argument that some investment tools fall into this category the price of a stock at a certain date for example this may also be called betting which opens up a whole other discussion investing has no such implication and as such it is the broader term   investing is to put something money to work to return a profit some forms of gambling could fall under this umbrella some would say that is a bad investment and even if they are right it may still be the desire and intent of the investor to make a profit   not all gambling falls under investing you can gamble for pleasure   the profit loss of most investments are not contractually tied to a specific event or outcome e.g. the price of a stock over 10 years is the result of many events affecting its market value such an investment would not be considered gambling

there is some magic involved in that calculation because what health insurance is worth to you is not necessarily the same it is worth for the employer two examples that illustrate the extreme ends of the spectrum let 's say you or a family member have a chronic or a serious illness especially if it is a preexisting condition for instance cancer in that case health insurance can be worth literally millions of dollars to you even if you are a the value of health insurance can be substantial sometimes it could even make financial sense in that case to accept a very low paying job on the other extreme of the scale if you are very young and healthy many people decide to forego insurance in that case the value of health insurance can be as little as the penalty usually 2 of your taxable income i believe

well futures do n't have a strike like an option the price represents how much you 're obligated to buy sell the index for at a specified date in the future   you are correct that there 's no cost to enter a contract though there may be broker fees and margin payments   any difference between the contract price and the price of the index at settlement is what is exchanged at settlement    it 's analogous to the bid ask on a stock the bid price represents the price at which someone is willing to buy a futures contract meaning enter into a long position and the ask is how much someone is willing to sell a contract so if you want to take a long position on s&p500 mini futures you 'd have to enter in at the ask price   if the index is above your contract price on the future expiry date you 'll make a profit if it is below the contract price you 'll take a loss

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

i was thinking more of a limit on the total of patents something fairly small like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal benefit by being allowed patent status   if you want to take the government mostly out of the picture then maybe use an auction format when a valid patent slot becomes available due to a previously granted patent expiring or being invalidated due to court challenge then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an auction for that slot   then the people who want to own the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting   this will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the due diligence on each patent application instead of depending on the patent since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea only to have that patent 's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court   if you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application this way you get the best of both worlds the inventor gets compensated handsomely in most cases for their good idea and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale

this seems to depend on what kind of corporation you have set up if you 're set up as a sole proprietor then the solo 401k contributions whether employee or employer will be deducted from your gross income   thus they do n't reduce it if you 're set up as an s corp then the employer contributions similar to large employer contributions will be deducted from wages and wo n't show up in box 1 on your w-2 so they would reduce your gross income   note employee contributions also would go away from box 1 but would still be in box 3 and 5 for fica payroll tax purposes this is nicely discussed in detail here the irs page that discusses this in more harder to understand detail is here separately i think a discussion of gross income is as it has a special definition for sole proprietorships the irs defines it in publication 501 as gross income     gross income is all income you receive in the form of money goods property and services that is not exempt from tax if you are married and live with your spouse in a community property state half of any income defined by state law as community income may be considered yours for a list of community property states see community property states under married filing separately later self employed persons     if you are self employed in a business that provides services where products are not a factor your gross income from that business is the gross receipts if you are self employed in a business involving manufacturing merchandising or mining your gross income from that business is the total sales minus the cost of goods sold in either case you must add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources so i think that regardless of 401(k contributions your gross income is your gross receipts if you 're a contractor it 's probably the total listed on your

in all probability having lower coverage levels will result in higher premiums as my insurance agent explained to me the higher your coverages the lower the insurance company believes your risk to be because you think about insurance smartly you 're less likely to make spurious claims i have my coverages run at various levels every 18 24 months and it is almost always true that higher coverages result in lower premiums also there is no guarantee you 'll still be employed by the same company if an injury happens or that they 'll continue to offer the same plans every year insurance is a calculated risk on the part of the insurer and a means of sharing risk at a cost known as your premium on the part of the insured even if your premiums are slightly higher on the order of a couple dollars per month for example do you really want to save a couple dollars and then be surprised when your health insurance company does n't want to cover something

its called a grace period and you are not paying interest on the 0 bt you are paying interest on the amount you spent in purchases if you do not pay your balance in full by the due date your grace period ends this means that you have to pay interest on the purchased amount from the day it is made this is why when you do a balance transfer the card should be put in the sock drawer until the bt is paid off in order to restore the grace period you must pay the balance in full and the grace period will start during the next payment cycle lets assume statement cuts on the 1st and due date is the 20th you make the minimum payment of $ 10 balance now is $ 100 since you have a balance of $ 100 from the previous statement and a new purchase of $ 50.00 when the next statement cuts you will have to pay interest according to the terms on the $ 50.00 portion in order to get the grace period back you will have to pay in full and wait for the next cycle in case i did not explain it well here is a quote from dot com website the cost of carrying a balance    this is because carrying a balance of    any size into the next billing cycle means there is no grace period on    your purchases during that cycle the card company will begin charging    interest on your purchases the day you make them so leaving even $ 1    in unpaid balance on your card will cost you considerably more than    the measly finance charges on that dollar to see how this works let 's consider an imaginary card user named    sally she 's so happy she got a new credit card that she charges    $ 1,500 in purchases on the first day of her monthly billing cycle    after the cycle ends sally pays off the entire $ 1,500 by the due    date wiping her balance to zero as a result her purchases during    the second month are also free of interest she has used her grace    period wisely to avoid finance charges what happens if sally leaves just $ 1 of her balance from the first    month unpaid that $ 1 begins to accrue interest starting the first day    of the billing cycle it 's just $ 1 so the interest is not a big deal    but because she used up her grace period without paying off her entire debt her new purchases during the second month also start to    get hit with interest charges immediately starting the day of the    transaction assuming she makes another $ 1,500 in purchases at the    average annual interest rate of about 13 percent that means $ 16 in    finance charges for the month if sally repeats this pattern the    interest costs add up to $ 190 over the course of a year

gt;the question is more like do we want it   i agree that 's the issue and without doing more research i think it would be a good thing currently it makes almost no sense to hire a woman over a man other things equal due to pregnancy risk reducing some of maternity leave and making some paternity leave mandatory would reduce the disparity between obviously women can breast feed and are more crucial to baby than men in most cases so they should still have more leave time but men can play a part sometime after pregnancy   men taking leave currently does n't make as much sense since they generally make more than women however making leave mandatory can also help reduce wage disparity if it exists which is debated nonetheless i do n't see a way in which it can possible increase disparity    increasing equality is n't done just for the sake of equality it is actually beneficial for the economy women are probably in the work force and eliminating biological differences makes the other factors much more important for them intelligence competence etc in addition women may focus more on their careers if they know a pregnancy does n't completely stall them relative to men and that they are less expected to be primary children this creates a more competitive and productive workforce as a whole   however making men take time off obviously reduces productivity a certain amount as they ca n't work so you would have to weigh the pros and cons here carefully which would be quite difficult in addition it would be quite lame to force a healthy willing individual to stop working simply because his spouse has a child even if his spouse wants to be the primary caregiver that too can be harmful for mens careers and may possibly reduce the imagine a ceo or manager having to take forced paternity leave when his wife has a baby that can be a career killer in upper management

to answer length validity and security implications of draft checks issued and negotiated within the united states i am heavily addressing the common erroneous assumptions of where the funds sit while they 're in a draft check and how to get them out tl;dr the existing answers are incomplete and in some ways dangerously misleading jerry can still be potentially defrauded by tom and even if the check is legitimately drawn and negotiable jerry may still experience delayed access to the funds the funds sit in an account held by the issuing bank as long as the bank has sufficient funds the check does however there are significantly more factors that go into whether a check will be returned unpaid bounce if i hand you $ 5000 in cash will you give me $ 5000 in cash probably and you 'd probably be pretty safe how about i give you a $ 5000 draft check will you give me $ 5000 in cash without doing anything except looking at it to verify the check i hope not cash america sure would n't but people sell expensive goods with the same as cash attitude remember the only non cash form of payment which can not somehow be held reversed or returned unpaid in the u.s. without consent of the receiving party is a payment order a.k.a wire transfer the draft check is as good as cash in the sense that the money for a draft check is withdrawn from your account before the check is negotiated deposited this does not mean that a draft check will not bounce so jerry is not as secure in handing the goods to tom as if tom had handed him cash as it is still a check jerry 's bank will not receive the funds for tom 's draft check for an average 3 to 5 business days same as a personal check jerry will probably have access to the first $ 5000 within two business days provided that he deposits the draft check in person at his bank 's branch or in a bank owned atm in the united states regulation cc governs funds availability regarding official draft or tellers checks if the customer desires next day availability of funds from these checks your bank may require use of a special deposit slip   mobile deposit availability in the u.s. is not regulated in this way and will likely be subject to a longer hold on more if not all of the check draft checks do n't as a habit bounce in the sense of returned for insufficient funds this is because they are prepaid and drawn upon a financial institution 's account banks are insolvent far less frequently than other businesses or individuals draft checks tellers checks official checks bank checks etc can however be returned unpaid if one of the following is true as an aside an institution is not obligated to honor a stale dated check but may do so at its discretion if you have a personal check outstanding for over 6 months it may still clear and potentially overdraw your account in this case contact your bank asap to process a reversal the depositing bank mis scans the check and the issuing bank refuses the resulting data i have seen systems mis read which data field is which or its contents also there is the possibility the image if the check will be to the issuing bank the draft check has been cancelled stop paid this can happen if   a the check was fraudulently bought from the issuing bank using tom 's account   b tom has completed an agreement that the check was lost or otherwise not used for its intended purpose without fraud having occurred against tom c the draft check is paid to the state as unclaimed property this case is a subset of case 1 but will lead to a different return reason stamped on the image replacement document of the check the draft check was never any good in the first place because of the perception that draft checks are as good as cash they 're not but are a lot better than personal checks forgery and attempted fraud is shockingly common these are n't actually underwritten by a real bank even if they appear to be the only money in them is what the fraudster can get out of you jerry did not properly endorse the check before presenting it for deposit or otherwise negotiating it in my time in banking i most commonly saw cases 3 and 4 unlike most counterfeit cash case 3 will fool jerry and jerry 's teller tom gets an immediate payout a car a wire transfer a payday loan etc and jerry 's bank does n't know the check is n't valid until they call the alleged issuing bank to verify its or in the case of smaller checks into lower risk accounts it is simply returned unpaid as fraudulently drawn to conclude call the alleged issuing bank 's verification line before handing over the goods always properly endorse your deposits and address what happens if one does not receive or collect on prompt payment in your contracts

in the us pension benefits promised by employers are tightly regulated by a law called erisa one of the requirements is that money be deposited in a trust that is out of the reach of the employer and the employer 's creditors so even if the employer falls on hard times or goes bankrupt the money to pay the pensions is still there in addition the benefits are guaranteed by the federal government through the pension benefit guaranty corporation usually called the pbgc relative to most investments pensions are a safe bet

obviously the only way to have good credit is by owing money and making payments as scheduled to do this i would do everything i could to place all of your required expenses on a credit card this can include paying rent food transportation etc   these are all payments that you already make but simply move then through a different payment vehicle it sounds like at this time you may not have a credit card that allows you to do this but i would watch out for those cards that come in via mail with all kinds of special deals while you have not mentioned if you have any of this make sure that you keep up with your past debt and negotiate repayment if needed once your credit improves you should begin to see doors opening that are problems now

using your uber vs. medallion taxi driver as an example   the problem in the sharing economy is an individual working as an independent contractor takes on all the risk and diminishing rewards while the profit of the company to which the individual is contracted increases significantly    case in point with uber let 's say you decide you want to drive for you lease a prius and thus are on the hook financially for $ 350/month + $ 100/month insurance + $ 300/month gas and other car expenses and you 'll have that for three years that 's a $ 750 nut    your nut remains the same but you have very little protection to ensure that your earnings are going to continue to come in especially if you look at it long term i am most familiar with the ridesharing market here in seattle and just in the last two years the number of ridesharing drivers lyft sidecar has exceeded an estimated 3,000 sure the customer base grows but there is also a continuing influx of additional drivers competing for those fares with the medallion system there is some level of protection to ensure that the industry remains viable for those who carry a medallion i am not advocating completely for this system and realize that the the government protection gave to the taxi industry led to customer service quality issues    so back to uber as uber fights for market share both capturing from the taxi industry but also competing against lyft and people driving their own cars they lower prices in some cases these lower prices have been in the form of discounts in some cases lower fares in seattle currently the minimum fare for an ride is $ 4 it was $ 6 a year ago uber takes a 20 percent cut from drivers and also charges drivers $ 10 a week to use their service if a driver makes $ 1000 a week in fares they pull down $ 800 of that after taxes let 's call it $ 600 so over the course of a month you 're looking at $ 2400 minus your nut including phone rental let 's call it $ 1600 take home pay    these people are n't getting rich to begin with and are at a huge risk for when uber or lyft or task rabbit or whoever decides to cut their prices again these services are beyond great for the consumer but are a temporary for anyone relying on them for work the big problem here is that companies like uber are advertising heavily that you can make $ on their service enticing people to make investments in things like cars to drive with them but at the end of the day you 're an independent contractor and uber owes you nothing    i believe uber i single them out because i think lyft is a little better at this on the ignorance of potential drivers to lure them into the system

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets the major reason for the market is the uncertainty regarding the us dollar if the us credit rating drops that will have an inflationary effect on the currency as it will push up the cost of us treasuries and reduce confidence in the usd if this continues the loss of usd confidence could bring an end to the usd as the world 's reserve currency which could also create inflation as world banks could reduce their usd reserves this can make us assets appear overvalued why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating s&p is a large trusted rating agency so the market will respond to their analysis much like how a bank would respond to any change in your rating by transunion consumer credit bureau does this have any major implications    for the us stock markets today in the    short term and in july if you are a day trader i 'm sure it does there will be minor fluctuations in the market as soon as news comes out either of its extension or any expected delays in passing that extension what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached since the us is in a deficit spending situation it needs to borrow more to satisfy its existing obligations in short it pays its debt with more debt as a result if the debt ceiling is n't raised then eventually the us will be unable to pay its existing obligations we would be in a default situation which could have devastating affects on the value of the usd how hard the hit will depend on how long the default situation lasts the longer we go without an increased ceiling after the exhaustion point the more we default on in reality congress will approve a raise but they will drag it out to the last possible minute they want to appear as if they are against it but they understand the catastrophic effects of not doing so

the dealership is getting a kickback for having you use a particular bank to finance through the bank assumes you will take the full term of the loan to pay back and will hopefully be a repeat customer this tactic is n't new and although it maybe does n't make sense to you the consumer in the long run it benefits the bank and the dealership they would n't do it otherwise these guys have a lot of smart people running s for them be sure to read the specifics of the loan contract there may be a penalty for paying it off early most customers wo n't be able to pay that much in cash so the bank makes a deal with the dealership to send clients their way they will lose money on a small percentage of clients but make more off of the rest of the clients if there 's no penalty for paying it off early you may just want to take the financing offer and pay it off asap if you truly can only finance $ 2500 for 6 mos and get the full discount then that might work as well the bank had to set a minimum for the dealership in order to qualify as a loan that earns the discount sounds like that 's it bonus info here 's a screenshot of blue book for that car car dealers get me up always have always will so i like doing this kind of research for people to make sure they get the right price fair price range is $ $ first time car buyers are a dealers dream come true do n't let them beat you down   and here 's more specific data about the florida area relating to recent purchases

late to the party but it 's just improving your cost basis in a defined risk trade even further if you want to put up less risk capital but want to test the waters this can be one way to do it another could be buying cheap otm or financing a further otm option with the basis reduction from the debit spread if you want to gamble a bit further and venture into 15 20 delta positions usually i am doing debit spreads with a buying atm and selling a couple strikes further otm or at least at the most liquid strikes but if it 's a high flier it can be disappointing but a good trade if you 're more of a contrarian in where you buy your calls puts it 's absolutely a good way to lessen your risk on a calculated bet

when has walmart fairly compensated someone   edit   the question is do i think walmart fairly pays their employees the answer is no because they do n't have health care and they use up government subsidies   well do you know how much walmart would need to raise each product for $ 12 min wage it would cost walmart to raise there all products by 1.1 that would be from 2015 min wage of $ 7.25 which roughly around 65 in increase wage so how much would $ 15 min wage cost in raise prices it would cost walmart around 1.3 to 1.4 in product pricing increase   but let 's not forget they only have 30,000 of 1.4 million employees have health insurance guess where tax dollars are going if they do n't have health insurance to obamacare and medicaid what even is the purposely make sure to schedule people under 32 or 34 hours week so they are part time so they do n't have to provide health insurance   then employees from walmart are on welfare costing the taxes payers over $ 6 billion a year on average each walmart superstore that is open cost tax payer $ 900k to $ 1.5 million a year    we talk socialism is at the door step of this country but already lives here it is thanks to corporation like walmart corporate welfare is okay but asking a company to pull their weight when they cost the tax payer so much damn money is too much to ask for

on 1 one way to make it less painful is to split your raises between yourself and your 401k that is if you get a 2 raise increase your contribution to the 401 k by 1 and keep the other 1 keep doing this until you are maxed out you wo n't miss money you never had nearly as much as money you were used to living on on 2 yes go with the roth another consideration if you are ever going to max out your 401 k it is best to do it early even if you have to cut back later than to wait take advantage of the extra investment time while you are young

the point here is actually about banks or is in reference to banks they expect you know how a savings account at a bank works but not mutual funds and so are trying to an erroneous notion that you might have that the will insure your investment in the fund   banks work by taking in deposits and lending that money out via mortgages the mortgages can last up to 30 years but the deposits are on demand which means you can pull your money out at any time   see the problem they 're maintaining a fiction that that money is there safe and sound in the bank vault ready to be returned whenever you want it when in fact it 's been loaned out and ca n't be called back quickly either they know only a little bit of that money will be demanded by depositors at any given time so they keep a percentage called a reserve to satisfy that er demand   the rest again is loaned out gone   and usually that works out just fine except sometimes it does n't when people get scared they might not get their money back and they all go to the bank at the same time to demand their on demand deposits back this is called a run on the bank and when that happens the bank fails 'cause it ai n't got the money   what 's failing in fact is the fiction that your money is there whenever you want it and that 's really bad because when that happens to you at your bank your friends the customers of other banks start worrying about their money and run on their banks which fail which cause more people to worry and try to get their cash out lather rinse repeat until the whole economy crashes see the great depression   so various governments introduced deposit insurance where the government will step in with the cash so when you panic and pull all your money out of the bank you can go home happy cash in hand and do n't freak all your friends out therefore the fear that your money might not really be there is and it does n't spread like a mental everyone can comfortably go back to believing the fiction and the economy goes back to chugging along   meanwhile with mutual funds etfs everyone understands the money you put in them is invested and not sitting in a gigantic vault and so there 's no need for government insurance to maintain the fiction   and that 's the point they 're trying to make   poorly i might add where their wording is concerned

if you intend to flip this property you might consider either a construction loan or private money a construction loan allows you to borrow from a bank against the value of the finished house a little at a time as each stage of the construction repairs are completed the bank releases more funds to you interest accrues during the construction but no payments need to be made until the construction repairs are complete   private money works in a similar manner but the full amount can be released to you at once so you can get the repairs done more quickly the interest rate will be higher if you are flipping then this higher interest rate is simply a cost of doing business since it 's a private loan you ca structure the deal any way you want perhaps accruing interest until the property is sold and then paying it back as a single balloon payment on sale of the property to find private money contact a mortgage broker and tell them what you have in mind   if you 're intending to keep the property for yourself private money is still an option once the repairs are complete have the bank reassess the property value and refinance based on the new amount pay back the private loan with equity pulled from the house and all the shiny new repairs

the principle behind the advice to not throw good money after bad is better restated in economics terms sunk costs are sunk and irrelevant to today 's decisions    money lost on a stock is sunk and should not affect our decisions today one way or the other   similarly the stock going up should not affect our decisions today one way or the other   any advice other than this is assuming some kind of mispricing or predictability in the market   in general can not be reliably identified and stock returns are not normally predictable the only valid efficient markets reason i know of to allow money you have lost or made on a stock to affect your decision today is the tax implications you may want to lock in gains if your tax rate is temporarily low or vice versa

it depends on how immediately you think you 'll need your emergency fund cash if you anticipate running into problems where you need cash right away e.g. you live paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down a lot put it into a checking or money market account if you do n't think your emergencies will require immediate access to cash e.g. unemployment then put it in a savings account or cd if there is a lot of money in your accounts that goes unused and you want a bigger safety net then consider investing it though it 's generally a better idea to pay off debts at this point i think the best idea is to split your emergency fund between your checking and savings maybe 20 checking and 80 savings that way you have some extra cash on hand when you need it while most of your money is growing in savings

there are 2 basic ways to have someone buy partial ownership of your company or if they buy shares that you already own then their shares will have the same rights as yours same voting rights same dividend rights etc if they buy shares newly created from the company they could be either identical shares to what you already own or they could be a new class of shares you may need to adjust the articles of incorporation if you did not plan ahead with multiple share classes you really need to talk to a lawyer tax accountant about this there are a lot of questions you need to consider here for example do you want to use the money in the business or would you rather have it personally are you concerned about losing some control of how the business is run what are the short term and long term tax consequences of each method what does your new partner want in terms of their share class the answers to these questions will be highly valuable and likely worth much more than the fees you will need to pay at the very least you will likely need a lawyer and accountant anyway to ensure the filings taxes are done correctly so better to involve them now rather than later there are many other situations to consider here and an online forum is not the best place to get advice that might put you in a sticky legal situation later on

what other pieces of info should i consider if you do n't have liquid case available for unexpected repairs then you probably do n't want to use this money for either option   the 7 return on the stocks is absolutely not guaranteed there is a good amount of risk involved with any stock investment paying down the mortgage by contrast has a much lower risk in the case of the mortgage you know you 'll get a 2.1 annual return until it adjusts and then you can put some constraints on the return you 'll get after it adjusts in the case of stocks it 's reasonable to guess that it will return more than 2.1 annually if you hold it long enough but there will be huge swings from month to month and from year to year the sooner you need it the more guaranteed you will want the return to be if you have few or no stock or assets then nearly all of your wealth is in your house and that is independent of the remaining balance on your mortgage if you are going to sell the house soon then you will want to diversify your assets to protect you against a drop in home value if you are going to stay in the house forever then you will eventually need non house assets to consume ultimately neither option is inherently better it really depends on what you need

i do n't know about that but i do know that organized labor is dying a natural death due to automation the transition is gaining speed over time and it is inevitable this with the old patterns is what is fundamentally wrong with progressives going back to what worked a century ago is n't going to address the problems we face now better that progressives go to fundamentals like defining societal values to be achieved and engineering new methods to get there instead of insisting that society as a whole wear old ill fitting shoes so for example instead of betting the farm on labor unions look to basic income fixes along with population growth controls labor unions might still play a small part but that will diminish over time   as concerns the democrats and labor in the 1970s labor unions screwed themselves for a generation with the over bearing strikes of the 1970s personally i think labor unions in the u.s. chose the wrong path when they decided that striking was the best way to deal with ownership wealth sharing problems they should have gone the collective buyout and ownership by worker methods of dealing with the crony capitalists the world would be a different place now

checks in the us anyway are only good for six months after they have been written after that under the us uniform code they are considered stale checks and banks need not accept them my experience is that they generally wo n't but you probably should n't count on that either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks the check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued its value for that purpose may be limited you can try depositing it and see what happens if that does n't work or you do n't want to bother trying it you can contact the retirement plan point out that this check went uncashed and ask them to send you a replacement if they have n't already done so you might want to check your own records for that there should n't be any problem with this note many business checks have a statement printed on them that they 're only good for 90 days or so if yours does you can skip trying to cash it just contact the retirement plan offices

the common advice you mentioned is just a guideline and has little to do with how your portfolio would look like when you construct it in order to diversify you would be using correlations and some common sense recall the recent global financial crisis ones of the first to crash were aaa rated cdo 's stocks and so on because correlation is a statistical measure this can work fine when the economy is stable but it does n't account for real life especially when population is affected once consumers are affected this spans to the entire economy so that sectors that previously seemed unrelated have now been tied together by the fall in demand or reduced ability to pay off i always find it funny how us advisers tell you to hold 80 of us stocks and bonds while uk ones tell you to stick to the uk securities the same happens all over the world i would assume the safest portfolio is a global market portfolio obviously i would n't be getting say bonds if such exist at all but there are plenty of markets to choose from a chance of all of them crashing simultaneously is significantly lower why do n't people include derivatives in their portfolios could be because these are mainly short term while most of the portfolios are being held for a significant amount of time thus capital and money markets are the key components derivatives are used to hedge these portfolios as for the currencies by having foreign stocks and bonds you are already exposed to fx risk so you again could be using it as a hedging instrument

someone 's or a bank 's exposure to equities refers to the amount of value which has a risk that fluctuates with the equities market ie the stock market in very broad terms i think it might make sense to say that exposure to equities could mean for example owning many rental properties if the rental market was highly correlated with the equities market that is if house prices go down when the equities market goes down and if that relationship is very strong then owning a house means you are exposed to the equities market   however in the sense it is used there it seems to mean direct exposure to equities ie owning stocks and stock based funds

having gone though this type of event a few times it wo n't be a problem on a specific date they will freeze your accounts then they will transfer the funds from custodian x to custodian y. it should only take a day or two and they will work it around the so that by the time the next paycheck is released everything is established in the new custodian   long before the switch over they will announce the investment options in the new company they will provide descriptions of the options and a default mapping s&p 500 old company to s&p 500 new company international fund old company to international fund new company   if you do nothing then on the they will execute the mapped switches if you want to take this an an opportunity to rebalance you can make the changes to the funds you invest in prior to the switch or after the switch how you contributions are invested will follow the same mapping rules but the percentage of income wo n't change again you can change how you want to invest your contributions or matching funds by altering the contribution forms but if you do n't do anything they will just follow the mapping procedures they have defined   loans terms should n't change   company stock will not be impacted the only hiccup that i would worry about is if the old custodian had a way for you to transfer funds into any fund in their family or to purchase any individual stock the question would be does the new custodian have the same options if you have more questions ask hr or look on the company benefits website all your funds will be moved to the new company and none of these transfers will be a taxable event edit february 2014 based on this question what are the laws or rules on 401(k loans and switching providers i reviewed the documents for the most recent change february 2014 the documents from the employer and the new 401 k company say there are no changes to the loan balances terms and payment amounts although there is a 2 week window when no new loans can be created all employees received notice 60 days prior to the regarding new investments options blackout periods

black scholes is close enough for american options since there are n't usually reasons to exercise early so the ability to do so does n't matter which is good since it 's tough to model mathematically i 've read early exercise would usually be caused by a weird mispricing for some technical market action reason where the theoretical option valuations are messed up if you sell a call that 's far in the money and do n't get any time value after the spread for example you probably sold the call to an who 's just going to exercise it but unusual stuff like this does n't change the big picture much

short answer   no longer answer   the only reason to move would be to get out of the condo and into a of equal cost because condos can be quite difficult to sell and you do n't really want that potential burden later on   moving is expensive though and you ca n't afford to spend more when you are already living on the financial edge speaking of living on the edge that 's a recipe for disaster   i make ratio wise a similar sort of income   even accounting for the generous college tuition you should be able to save at least $ 20 k per year at a bare minimum   and if you were careful i figure you should be able to save $ 40k year   you need to figure out where you are dumping all of your money and cut way back on spending and focus entirely on saving money 1   stop eating out   make your own meals   i average about $ 2 per meal per person no junk food   eating out is 6 to 30 times as expensive as making meals at home   do the math   $ 10 2 people number of times you eat out per week 52 $ per year for each time week vs $ 2 2 people 21 3 meals per day 52 $ per year for both of you maximum   now i know some meals are more expensive to prepare but the math is not unrealistic i spend about $ 140 per month on groceries and make the bulk of my own food   eating out is sticker shock for me   the food i prepare is balanced and complete   now i 'm not a complete health nut   i love the occasional deep fried treat or hamburger but those are once every couple of months sort of things which makes them special 2   stop going to starbucks or wherever you go   it takes fuel to get there   it 's also expensive when you get there   bring your own drink if you are hanging out with friends 3   drop golf   or whatever expensive sport you are sinking money into   invest in some cheap running clothes and focus on based   heart health is more important than anything else   if you ca n't live without your sport then find an alternate sport that is equal ish in challenge but a ton cheaper to play   for example if you like playing golf play instead most cities have courses there 's no cost beyond a couple of discs and the challenge is still there 4   drop entertainment   movies at the theater are expensive   drop your cable subscription you are getting financially raped for $   get a netflix subscription and find shows via free online streaming services   buy some dominoes card games and a couple of classic board games   keep entertainment simple and cheap 5   drop your cell phone 's data plan   republic wireless is the only decent cellular provider and even their $ plan is living a luxury lifestyle   if you spend more than $ 10/month person for phone service you are spending too much 6   stop driving everywhere   gas is expensive   cars are expensive   if you have more than two cars sell the extras   if your car is worth more than $ 20,000 sell it and get something cheaper 7   stop drinking alcohol   alcohol impairs mental functions is addictive smells terrible and is ridiculously expensive   there 's no actual need to consume it either by the way do n't go and make major financial changes without the wife 's sign off   finances are the 1 reason for divorce   so get her ok on this stuff   hopefully you already knew that   the above are just some common financial pitfalls where people sink thousands and thousand of dollars and gain nothing   you can still have a full and complete life with just a minimum of the above there is no excuse for living on the edge financially   your story is one i 'm going to share with those who give me the same excuse because they are poor   you are i want to punch you in the face wealthy and you spend every last penny because you think that 's how money works   you are wrong one final piece of advice   find a financial adviser   it is clear to me that you 've been managing money wrong your whole life   a financial adviser will look at your situation and help you far more than someone on the internet ever can   if you attend a church many churches have the excellent crown financial program available which teaches sound financial management principles   the education system does n't show people how to manage money but that 's not an excuse either   once you dig yourself out of the financial hole you 've dug for yourself you can pass the knowledge on how to correctly manage money onto other people

scenario 2 is most likely will generate the best long term financial outcome if your friends emergency fund is truly excessive and can afford to be reduced by the amount required to payoff the vehicle loan then that will save a few dollars scenario 3 is not an approach i would recommend however if your friend has to choose between paying off the loan or maxing his roth making a few assumptions regarding the loan i figure it is probably a 4 year $ which means he is paying somewhere below $ 40 a month in interest   as speaks to people often over estimate the spread they can make with another investment compared to the interest rate on a loan however the effect of compounded tax free returns can not be ignored when you are discussing a 22 year old person contributing to a roth ira   doing some calculations assuming the car is being paid off on the first payment your friend will save just under $ 1000 the total interest that would have been paid over the life of the loan if your friend adds $ 3600 approximately one year of payments to their roth ira contributions just once assuming a 3.5 avg return and a retirement age of 65 the $ 3600 will be worth just south of $ 16k a $ return using the same investment return and tax assumptions and simplifying the $ 1000 savings as if it was all realized as a lump sum at the time of paying off the loan that $ 1000 invested in a non tax advantaged investment because the whole discussion is based on if the friend had to pick and lose the opportunity for the one year to make the additional roth ira contribution would return $

keep in mind that the federal reserve chairman needs to be very careful with his use of words   here 's what he said it is arguable that interest rates are too high that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates ca n't go below zero we have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce we have an economy where the amount of investment in durable goods spending is far less than the capacity of the economy to produce that suggests that interest rates in some sense should be lower rather than higher we ca n't make interest rates lower of course they only can go down to zero and again i would argue that a healthy economy with good returns is the best way to get returns to savers so what does that mean when he says that we ca n't make interest rates lower that does n't mean that it is n't possible he 's saying that our demand for goods is lower than our ability to produce them negative interest would actually make that problem worse if i know that things will cost less in a month i 'm not going to buy anything the fed is incentivizing spending by lowering the cost of capital to zero by continuing this policy they are eventually going to bring on inflation which will reduce the value of the currency which gives people and companies that are sitting on money an dis incentive to continue hoarding it

gt the logic behind qe is as follows a central bank which alone has the power to create and print money wants to spur inflation so that companies will be encouraged to borrow money and invest it creating jobs   that is not the logic of qe   the logic is that assets must remain inflated enough for banks to survive and the rich with the trading profits   made by trading ahead of central banks qe will pump up other assets with their cashflow and support banking solvency and profitability as they participate directly in the bond profits and indirectly by having their loans secured by general assets paid back due to asset inflation and stability   there was absolutely no honest hope of qe trickling down to the productive economy   no reason for new production as its only effect is a few at the top that can afford bigger cars and homes   bank stability helps jobs much better than bank failures but its more about keeping investment loan flowing than about increasing production investment demand

yes you will need to deposit the funds into your hsa then withdraw them to reimburse yourself for the expenses the tax deduction comes when you contribute deposit to your hsa   if you do not deposit the money there you will not be able to claim the deduction   your hsa provider reports the amount of your contributions to the irs so the amount you say you contribute to your hsa on your tax return has to match what your hsa provider reports when you deposit the money to your hsa you need to explicitly tell your provider that the contribution is for tax year 2014   the reason is that you want to make sure that they report the amount of your 2014 contributions to the irs correctly after you 've deposited the amount into your hsa you can withdraw it to reimburse yourself for an eligible medical expense   in order to be eligible it needs to be an expense that was incurred while you had the hsa in place   if you had your hsa account in place before you paid the expense no problem   but if you set up the hsa account after you paid for the expense you might be out of luck the distribution withdrawal will be a part of tax year 2015 and you 'll see this amount included as part of the gross distributions on your 1099-sa form next year when i first set up my hsa i did n't have any extra money to fund the hsa so i handled it just like you are talking about   i would wait until i had a medical bill then deposit the amount i needed into my hsa and withdraw it back out to pay the bill

for reporting purposes i would treat the purchase and sale of gold like a purchase and sale of a stock the place to do so is schedule d. and if it 's the wrong form but you reported it there is might not be a penalty whereas there is a penalty for not reporting the long term gain would be at capital gains rates the short term gain would be at ordinary income rates and if you have two coins bought at two different times you get to choose which one to report as long as you report the other one when you sell the second coin

of course there is no way for us to know whether or not the clerk is trying to rip you off $ at a time but i ca n't understand the possible motivation for doing so   i would imagine that most people would catch this at some point so for a store to consistently overcharge for something like this is really bad for business they would be risking upsetting a customer all for the potential gain of $ i have to assume that it is not malice but incompetence   we do n't know what caused the clerk to be confused but it is not really our concern from what i can tell you 've gotten the right price in the end   you were ultimately charged for two drinks and the extra $ that you were charged was refunded since it happened three times you have to decide how badly you want these drinks in the future   if you choose to return you 'll just have to expect the possibility that it will ring up incorrectly and you 'll have to get it fixed   if that seems like too much hassle then do n't return to this store

i think the $ 500 mm number was bullshit a common trick is that a private company will raise $ 50 mm for 10 of the company and say they 're worth $ 500 mm but then it turns out that the new investors get like they 're guaranteed to be paid back first if the company goes bankrupt or they 're guaranteed to get back the first $ 100 mm of an ipo since the company really sold 10 of itself plus other stuff they are worth less than $ 500 mm    therefore i find 's claim that reddit was worth $ 250 mm in 2015 credible it is also why i 'm suspicious about the $ number today

it depends solely on the risk your willing to take for example few years back one of the leading banks in my country was offering 25 interest rate for 5 year fixed deposits and the lending rate in the market was around 12 so people borrowed money from other banks and invested in the high return fixed deposits after 6 months the bank filed for bankruptcy and people lost their money later investigations revealed that abnormal high return was offered because the bank had a major liquidity problem so all depends on the risk associated with return on your investment higher the risk higher the return

should i use the profit to pay down student loans or just roll it into my next house in order to have a lower mortgage amount calculate the amount of interest in each scenario where the two scenarios are use extra cash to pay down student loans take out a full mortgage use extra cash to make a big down payment on the next house keep paying down student loans at normal rate in both scenarios the student loan rate will   stay the same however in the second scenario you may get a lower interest rate from making a larger down payment so then calculate the total interest resulting from each scenario student loan student loan balance = student loan interest   new mortgage mortgage balance = mortgage interest scenario 1 interest = student loan interest student loan loan balance = student loan interest   new mortgage rate with large down mortgage balance after large down payment = mortgage interest scenario 2 interest = student loan interest whichever scenario 's interest is lower will save money

there are a couple of things you could do but it may depend partly on the type of orders your broker has available to you firstly if you are putting your limit order the night before after close of market at the top of the bids you may be risking missing out if bid offer prices increase by the time the market opens the next day on the other hand if bid offer prices fall at the open of the next day you should get your order filled at or below your limit price secondly you could be available at the market open to see if prices are going up or down and then work out the price you want to buy at then and work out the quantity you can buy at that price i personally do n't like this method because you usually get too emotional start chasing the market if prices start rising or start regretting buying at a price and prices fall straight afterwards my preferred method is this third option if your broker provides stop orders you can use these to both get into and out of the market how they work when trying to get into the market is that once you have done your analysis and picked a price that you would want to purchase at you put a stop buy order in for example the price closed at $ 9.90 the previous day and there has been resistance at $ 10.00 so you would put a stop buy trigger if the price goes over $ 10 say $ 10.01 if your stop buy order gets triggered you can have either a buy market order or a limit order above $ 10.01 say $ the market order would go through immediately whilst the limit order would only go through if the price continues going to $ or above the advantage of this is that you do n't get emotional trying to buy your securities whilst sitting in front of the screen you do your analysis and set your prices whilst the market is closed you only buy when the security is rising not falling as your aim is to be in long term you should n't be concerned about buying a little bit higher than the previous days close on the other hand if you try and buy when the price is falling you do n't know when it will stop falling it is better to buy when the price shows signs of rising rather than falling always follow the trend

to quote adam smith everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it in this case that means the value of a stock is equal to the price that someone will pay for it if you buy shares in a company the number of people who want shares in that company has just gone up by 1 if you buy shares in companies profiting from the dapl you are increasing demand for those shares you are actually making those shares more valuable not less if you bought all those shares then you could simply shut the pipeline down but that means you 'd be spending billions of dollars to do so and that money would go to the people who own the company now the concept of shareholder activism that you refer to is actually more that an individual who owns a substantial number of shares usually in the 10 ballpark will become on the direction of the company and attempt to elect board members who will take action to suit their liking this is done to increase the profits of the company so that the shareholder can make more money off of their investment it is very expensive and not generally done for reasons of ethics unless those ethics align with a view to long term profit in this case you 'd need at least $ to buy enough of a stake in the dapl to make a difference what you may instead want to consider is ethical investing this refers to the concept that you should only put your investments in companies which act ethically for example you could buy shares in a solar company if you felt that was an ethical industry in this way you drive up demand for those types of companies and reward the business owners who act in that fashion

nowhere to back up a bit mutual funds are the stock market and the bond market that is when you invest in a mutual fund your money is ultimately buying stocks on the open market some of it might be buying bonds the exact mix of stocks and bonds depends on the mutual fund but a mutual fund is just a basket of stocks and/or bonds and/or other more exotic investments at 25 you probably should just be investing your roth ira in index stock mutual funds and index bond mutual funds you probably should n't even be doing peer to peer lending unless you 're willing to think of any losses as the cost of a hobby the higher interest rate you 're getting is a reflection of the risk that your borrowers will default i 'm not even sure if peer to peer lending is allowed in roth ira 's   investing in just stocks bonds and cast is boring but these are easy investments to understand the harder the investment is to understand the easier it is for it to be a scam or just a bad investment there 's not necessarily anything wrong with boring

banks are not your friends they are not performing services for you because they like you they are a business and they make money by borrowing money from you at low interest and loaning it out at higher interest they are trying to persuade you to deposit more money however briefly in their bank so they can loan out more money they are probably also counting on the fact that most folks wo n't go to the trouble of setting up accounts at multiple banks with the automatic transfers in order to meet the required deposit threshold that lets them save on the interest payments to consumers that are individually tiny but significant in the aggregate

in a quote driven market must every investor trade with a market         maker in other words two parties that are both not market makers         can not trade between themselves directly in a way yes all trades go through a market maker but those trades can be orders put in place by a person ie you or me does a quote driven market only display the best bid and ask         prices proposed by the market makers in other words only the         highest bid price among all the market makers is displayed and         other lower bid prices by other market makers are not similarly         only the lowest ask price over all market makers is displayed and         other higher ask prices by other market makers are not no you can see other lower bid and higher ask prices in a order driven market is it meaningful to talk about the current stock price which is the price of last transaction well that 's kind of an opinion information is information so it wo n't be bad to know it personally i would say the bid and ask price is more important however in the real world these prices are changing constantly and quickly so realistically it is easier to keep track of the quote price and most likely the bid ask spread is small and the quote will fall in between the less liquid a security is the more important the bid ask is this goes for all market types for a specific asset will there be several transactions happened at     the same time but with different prices today with electronic markets trades can happen so quickly it 's difficult to say in the us stock market trades happen one at a time but there is no set time limit between each trade so within 1 second you can have a trade be $ 50 or $ however it will only go to $ when the lower ask prices have been exhausted    does an order driven market have market makers   by definition no what are some examples of quote driven and order driven financial markets in which investors are commonly trading stocks and derivatives especially in u.s. quote driven market bond market forex order driven market nyse comes from an order driven market but now would be better classified as a market conclusion if you are asking in order to better understand today 's stock markets then these old definitions of quote market or order market may not work the big markets in the real world are neither ie nasdaq nyse the nyse and nasdaq are better classified as a market as they use more then a single tactic from both market types to insure market liquidity and transparency markets these days are strongly electronic fast and fairly liquid in most cases here are some resources to better understand these markets an introduction to securities markets the nyse and nasdaq how they work understanding order execution

once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the irs cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account the taxes due will be based on your mom 's tax rate as a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf also legally that money currently belongs to her any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such a better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name this way the money is still yours you just do n't have control of it until you turn 18 while probably not an issue here the transferring of money between you and your mom and then back is considered a gift by the irs if the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion based on the clarification that the question is in reference to india while i do n't know the particulars of the law in india my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains the main difference that i would see been india and the us would be the gift tax exclusions unless someone else knows otherwise i would still expect the law in india to see the current account as being the property of the mother

in my mind these are quite different though maybe there is some vague analogy in meta space that is escaping me   this is n't about manipulating scarcity or demand it 's about manipulating pricing i guess the common thread is that it 's about manipulating   the motivation is to skirt the commercial code requirement that you ca n't charge people by ability to pay by dividing the market into a high end and a low end and giving the people who ca n't pay as much a less desirable product   in this case producing the high end product is easily possible to do for everyone but if you put it at the high price you 'd get too few buyers and if you put it at the low price you 'd leave money on the table   similar schemes have been used in airlines to charge businesses more by assuming they have to plan things last minute and making the high price be around of tickets and assuming vacations are planned longer out and are really being sold to a market of people with less money to spend   by controlling the character of the sale in a situation where delivery of the product costs about the same you maximize the revenue   it used to be though no longer is that phone calls were done this way too   you got better pricing off hours even though the phone lines were there 24/7 because it was assumed that the only people who must have phone calls especially long distance were businesses who could afford steeper prices   by calling off hours calling a different product you could charge less for it and thus do the only thing you really wanted which is to get maximal amounts of money out of business and non business people based on their ability to pay but by a dodge that caused the products to be differentiated so that it could n't be said you were charging based on ability to pay

in the united states when key people in a company buy or sell shares there are reporting requirements   the definition of key people includes people like the ceo and large shareholders there are also rules that can lock out their ability to buy and sell shares during periods where their insider knowledge would give them an advantage these reporting rules are to level the playing field regarding news that will impact the stock price   these rules are different than the reporting rules that the irs has to be able to tax capital gains these are also separate than the registration rules for the shares so that you get all the benefits of owning the stock dividends voting at the annual meeting voting on a merger or acquisition

johnny   i recently bought my first home as well and i have worked in the credit business not mortgage so i think i can answer some of your questions   disclaimer first that i 'm in ny and home buying does vary from state to state in my experience pre qual is not too different from pre approval   neither represents any real on the part of the bank i.e. they can still deny approval at any point and both are based on pulling your credit bureau and calculating ratios based on your stated probably not documented financial information   it 's theoretically possible that a seller would choose a pre approved buyer over a pre qualified buyer all other things being equal but all other things are seldom equal remember also that you do n't need to ultimately get a mortgage from the same bank that you use for the pre qual   the pre qual just shows that you are probably credit worthy and serves to give you some credibility with sellers   once you have an accepted offer and need to find a real mortgage you can shop around for the best rate and best loan structure   banks do n't need to have pulled your credit to quote rates but they will need to have a general idea of your fico range   once you find the bank you like with the best rate and actually apply for the loan they will pull a hard bureau and if your scores are different from what you said before the rate may change but within the same range you 'll generally be ok   also banks do not necessarily pull all 3 bureaus they may only pull 1 as it costs them for each pull 2 potential downsides to this approach also make sure you have a mortgage funding clause in your contract as banks are unpredictable and make sure you have a great real estate lawyer not a legal factory the extra few hundred $ are worth it do n't this credit stuff too much   find a good house for a good price and get a no nonsense mortgage that you fully understand no exotic stuff   good luck

the random walk that you describe reflects the nature of the information flow about the value of a stock   if the flow is just little bits of relatively unimportant information including information about the broader market and the investor pool you will get small and seemingly random moves which may look like a   if an important bit of information comes out like a merger you will see a large and immediate move which may not look as random however the idea that small moves are a of search and discovery and large moves are immediate agreements is incorrect   both small moves and large moves are instantaneous agreements about the value of a stock in the form of a demand supply equilibrium   as a rule neither is predictable from the point of view of a single investor but they are not actually random   they look different from each other only because of the size of the movement not because of an underlying difference in how the consensus price is reached

so my questions are payment cards provide sufficient security now yes if so how is that achieved depending on your country 's laws of course in most places the us and eu notably there 's a statutory limit on liability for fraudulent charges for transactions when the card is not present proving that the charge is not fraudulent is merchants task why do online services ask for all those cvv codes and expiration date    information if whenever you poke the card out of your wallet all of    its information becomes visible to everyone in the close area what    can i do to secure myself is it try to copy someones credit card info next time you 're in the line at the local grocery store btw some of my friends tend to rub off the cvv code from the cards    they get immediately after receiving nevertheless it could have    already been written down by some unfair bank employee rubbish

you could but the bank wo n't let you if you 're a sole proprietor then you could probably open a personal account and just use it and never tell them that is actually a business however depending on your volume of operations they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions for corporations you can not use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds also you 're generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection which is why you have the corporation to begin with generally business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts and it costs more for the banks to run them in the us some banks offer free or very low cost business accounts for small businesses that do n't need too many transactions i 'm sure if you shop around you 'll find those in canada as well

there are two ways to handle this the first is that the better brokers such as charles schwab will produce summaries of your gains and losses using historical cost information as well as your trades on a monthly and annual basis these summaries are ready made for the irs more brokers will provide these summaries come 2011 the second is that if you are a frequent trader see irs rulings for what constitutes one then they 'll allow you to use the net worth method of accounting that is you take the account balance at the end of the year subtract the beginning balance adjust the value up for withdrawals and down for and the summary is your gain or loss a third way is to do all your trading in say an ira which is taxed on distribution not on stock sales

michael 's answer is correct the hdhp is like conventional insurance it is not like a health care plan that we 're all used to i.e. you do n't want to have it pay out if it pays out something bad has happened to you just like you hope to never make a claim on your homeowner 's disability or insurance that means something bad happened to you there are minor exceptions some may cover preventive care etc to some extent the bonus in the case of the hdhp is that you get to put money to cover the deductible into a tax deferred account the hsa is effectively a self insurance fund with the hdhp as backup here 's a concrete example say you have an hdhp with a $ 2500 deductible the monthly premium is $ 500 you put $ 3000 into your hsa scenario 1 you remain mostly healthy throughout the year you have a single doctor 's visit the doctor 's office submits a claim to your insurance the insurance does n't pay because you have n't met your deductible and you get a bill for $ 150 you write the doctor a check for $ 150 out of your hsa here you 've spent $ 6000 on your hdhp premiums contributed $ 3000 to your hsa and spent $ 150 of that on health care at the end of the year your hsa balance is $ in the following year assume you plan to contribute another $ 3000 to your hsa you can increase your deductible on the hdhp to $ 5000 since you 'll have $ 6000 in your hsa to cover out of pocket costs and your monthly premium might go down to $ 400 scenario 2 you are hospitalized for a week the hospital submits a $ 15000 claim to your insurance the insurance pays $ since your deductible is met after $ 2500 the hospital sends you a bill for $ 2500 for the balance you write a check to the hospital out of your hsa again you 've spent $ 6000 on your hdhp premiums and contributed $ 3000 to your hsa at the end of the year your hsa balance is $ 500 scenario 3 you are hospitalized for two days in december 2011 and then again for two days in january 2012 your deductible reset on january 1 2012 the hospital submits two claims to your insurance one in 2011 for $ 5000 and one in 2012 for $ 5000 the insurance company pays $ 2500 on the first one and you get a bill for the other $ 2500 same thing for the second one you 've got to meet the deductible all over again you write the hospital a check from your hsa to pay the first one then you 've only got $ 500 left in your hsa but you were planning to make another $ 3000 hsa contribution for 2012 anyway so you make the contribution write a $ 2500 check to pay the second bill and you 've now got a balance of $ 1000 in your hsa and since you 've met the deductible for 2012 you should have no more out of pocket expenses assuming your plan does n't have copays

the easiest and cheapest way i can think of is the online bill pay service that most banks use it 's free for both of you regardless of what the bank has to go through to get the payment to its destination they generally eat the costs you can use this to pay anyone from your rent to your electric company to your cousin however i do not think that a business checking account has this feature instead most corporate cash accounts typically have an ach service attached to them where for some small fixed fee like 25 to 50 cents per transaction they will accept transfer requests in an ach format this is how your electric company does auto debit if you let them and how banks do online bill pay to most corporate payees they and their bank account numbers would be verified by and kept on file with each bank that moved a substantial volume of money to this payee

you 're going to have a huge problem getting approved for anything as long as you have an unpaid bill on your report pay it and make sure its reported as paid in full asap once that settled your credit will start to improve slowly ca n't do anything about that it will take time you can make the situation improve a bit faster by lending money to yourself and having it reported regularly on your report how easy get a secured credit card what does it mean you put x amount of money in a cd and the bank will issue you a credit card secured by that cd your credit line will be based on the amount in that cd and you 'll probably pay some fees to the bank for the service shop around you might get lucky and find a secured card without fees if you look hard enough secured cards are reported as revolving credit just as any other credit card and are easy to get because the bank does n't take the risk you do   if you default on your payments your cd goes to cover the debt and the card gets cancelled but make absolutely sure that you do not default charge between 10 and 30 of the credit limit each month not more pay the balance shown on your credit card statement in full every month and by the due date shown on your monthly statement   it will take a while but you would typically start noticing the improvement within ~6 12 months stop applying for stuff not store cards not car loans you 're not going to get anything and will just keep dragging your scores down each time you have a pull on your report the score goes down a lot of pulls frequent pulls the score goes down a lot lenders can see when one is desperate and no one wants to lend money to desperate people   optimally lenders want to lend money to people who does n't need loans but in order to keep the business running they 'll settle for slightly less people who do n't usually need loans and pay the loans they do have on time you fail on both as you 're desperate for a loan and you have unpaid bills on your report

if markets are efficient which they are n't but anyways the frequency of dca investments should n't yield any meaningful difference in return   the one possible item to note is that if you 're able to invest more frequently you 'll have more money exposed to the effects of compounding for longer which may increase return however there are also transaction costs to consider which may render something like continuous dca ing ineffective    that same compounding effect also negates the potential benefits of dca altogether making it more logical to lump sum your investments    you may be conflating dca with simply making additional cash every week that 's available for investment if that 's the case again lump sum as early as possible should yield the best results   this is n't financial advice read the sidebar disclaimers

couple things i will admit i was wrong about the total graduates at each of those programs however numbers taper out the lower the program is down to about 250 300 a class also cut each of those numbers down to about 1/2 1/3 and you get the group that 's actually focused on finance many mbas do consulting marketing product development etc nowadays   also i 'm a bit offended by you saying i do n't understand the cfa could n't be more mistaken boss i 'm for l3 in june like you the requirement is only 2 years in an investment decision role this also means a lot of back office risk guys qualify that 's a pretty fungible qualification you do n't have to be a pm to qualify i have a buddy who qualified having done 2 years in fund accounting not exactly sell side er   i 'm also going to guess you 're a trader brokerage cap markets guy if you wanna throw titles around i 'm in a front office role at a bb too and worked at worked on buy side research at a value shop cfa is definitely more desired in sell side markets focused as opposed to ibd where an mba is more useful more strategy focused    the cfa is vital for up on quantitative skills an mba wo n't cover i 'll absolutely give you that but a lot of people fall into the trap of assuming a cfa is their ticket to bigger and better things if you 're working in back office risk management getting a cfa does n't immediately qualify you to do er which is a very common pitfall i see like an mba it teaches everyone how to do the same type of analysis too another reason   the title means less and less    last weekend i had a conversation with a friend of a friend about this very thing he 's sitting for l3 cfa works back office at a very notable hf and expects to be moved up without any indication that he will to research when he 's done i asked his opinions about things like the european situation fiscal cliff and a hard landing in china not only was he not familiar these concepts he did n't even know what hft was the cfa gives you the tools to analyze the impacts of pension liabilities on eps but it still takes a passion about the markets as well as creative analytical judgement to make it to er    my only point is an mba and cfa are very similar in many ways both tend to hold their noses way to high too it 's about what you chose to get out of it and too often people care more about the title than the process which is why they are still stuck in mediocrity after completing the designations    go through a list of the biggest pms in the business most do n't have either mbas or they achieved alpha by not following standard quantitative models but exploring creative and strategic avenues others undervalue while maintaining strict discipline a model is a tool to better describe behavior and understanding of markets it 's not a solution

0 furniture loans can hurt your credit rating i was told by a bank mortgage officer sorry i ca n't cite a document that credit rating algorithms consider consumer loans like 0 appliance loans and certain store specific credit cards as a negative factor lowering your overall score the rationalization given was that that taking that type of credit is an indicator that you have zero cash reserves the actual algorithms are proprietary so i do n't know how you could verify this if true it runs counter to the conventional wisdom that getting credit and then paying it off builds your credit score

pay off the credit cards   from now on pay off the credit cards monthly   under no circumstances should you borrow money   you have net worth but no external income   borrowing is useless to you    $ 200,000 in two bank accounts because if one bank collapses you want to have a spare while you wait for the government to pay off the guarantee   keep $ 50,000 in checking and another $ 50k in savings   the remainder put into cds   do n't expect interest income beyond inflation   real interest rates after inflation are often slightly negative    people ask why you might keep money in the bank rather than stocks bonds   the problem is that stocks bonds do n't always maintain their value much less go up   the bank money wo n't gain but it wo n't suddenly lose half its value either   it can easily take five years after a stock market crash for the market to recover   you do n't want to be withdrawing from losses    some people have suggested more bonds and fewer stocks   but putting some of the money in the bank is better than bonds   bonds sometimes lose money like stocks   instead park some of the money in the bank and pick a more aggressive stock bond mixture   that way you 're never desperate for money and you can survive market dips   and the stock bond part of the investment will return more at 70/30 than 60/40    $ 700,000 in stock mutual funds   $ 300,000 in bond mutual funds   look for broad indexes rather than high returns   you need this to grow by the inflation rate just to keep even   that 's $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 a year   keep the balance between 70/30 and   you can move half the excess beyond inflation to your bank accounts   that 's the money you have to spend each year   do n't withdraw money if you are n't keeping up with inflation    do n't try to time the market   much better informed people with better resources will be trying to do that and failing   play the odds instead   keep to a consistent strategy and let the market come back to you   if you chase it you are likely to lose money    if you do n't spend money this year you can save it for next year   anything beyond $ 200,000 in the bank accounts is available for spending   in an emergency you may have to draw down the $ 200,000   be careful   it 's not as big a cushion as it seems because you do n't have an external income to replace it    i live in southern california but would like to move overseas after establishing stable investments    i am not the type of person that would invest in mcdonald 's but would consider other less evil franchises maybe    these are contradictory goals as stated   a franchise meaning a local business of a national brand is not a stable investment   a franchise is something that you actively manage   at minimum you have to hire someone to run the franchise   and as a general rule they are n't as turnkey as they promise    how do you pick a good manager   how will you tell if they know how the business works   particularly if you do n't know   how will you tell that they are honest and wo n't just your money   or more honestly give you too much of the business revenues such that the business is not sustainable   or spend so much on the business that you ca n't recover it as revenue    some have suggested that you meant brand or stock rather than franchise   if so you can ignore the last few paragraphs   i would be careful about making moral judgments about companies   mcdonald 's pays its workers too little   google privacy   exxon is bad for the environment   chase collects fees from people desperate for money   tesla relies on government subsidies   every successful company has some way in which it can be considered evil   and unsuccessful companies are evil in that they go out of business leaving workers customers and investors i.e. you in the    regardless you should invest in broad index funds rather than individual stocks   if college is out of the question then so should be stock investing   it 's at least as much work and needs to be maintained    in terms of living overseas dip your toe in first   rent a small place for a few months   find out how much it costs to live there   remember to leave money for bigger expenses   you should be able to live on $ 20,000 or $ 25,000 a year now   then you can plan on spending $ 35,000 a year to do it for real including odd expenses that do n't happen every month   make sure that you have health insurance arranged    eventually you may buy a place   if you can find one that you can afford for something like $ 100,000   note that $ 100,000 would be low in california but sufficient even in many places in the us   think rural like the south or midwest   and of course that would be more money in many countries in south america africa or southern asia   even southern and eastern europe might be possible   you might even pay a bit more and rent part of the property   in the us this would be a duplex or a bed and breakfast   they may use different terms elsewhere    given your health do you need a maid cook   that would lean towards something like a bed and breakfast where the same person can clean for both you and the guests   same with cooking although that might be a second person or more   hire a bookkeeper accountant first as you 'll want help evaluating potential purchases   keep the business small enough that you can actively monitor it    part of the problem here is that a million dollars sounds like a lot of money but is n't   you are n't rich   this is about bare minimum for surviving with a middle class lifestyle in the united states and other first world countries   you ca n't live like a tourist    it 's true that many places overseas are cheaper   but many are n't including much of europe japan australia new zealand etc   and the ones that are n't may surprise you   and you also may find that some of the things that you personally want or need to buy are expensive elsewhere   dabble first and commit slowly be sure first   include rarer things like travel in your expenses    long term there will be currency rate worries overseas   if you move permanently you should certainly move your bank accounts there relatively soon perhaps keep part of one in the us for emergencies that may bring you back   and move your investments as well   your return may actually improve although some of that is likely to be eaten up by inflation   a 10 return in a country with 12 inflation is a negative real return    try to balance your investments by where your money gets spent   if you are eating imported food put some of the investment in the place from which you are importing   that way if exchange rates push your food costs up they will likely increase your investments at the same time   if you are buying stuff online from us vendors and having it shipped to you keep some of your investments in the us for the same reason   make currency fluctuations work with you rather than against you    i do n't know what your circumstances are in terms of health   if you can work you probably should   given twenty years your million could grow to enough to live off securely   as is you would be in trouble with another stock market crash   you 'd have to live off the bank account money while you waited for your stocks and bonds to recover

target date funds automatically change their diversification balance over time rebalancing and new contributions to become progressively more protective of what you 've already earned as opposed to other funds which continue to maintain the same balance of investments until you explicitly move the money around you can certainly make that same evolution manually we all used to do that before target funds were made available and many of us still do so i 'm still handling the relative allocations by hand but i 'm also close to my retirement target so a target fund would n't be changing that much more anyway and since i 'm already tracking the curve note that if you feel a bit or a bit more cautious than the average investor the target fund was designed for you can tweak the risk benefit curve of a target date fund by selecting a fund with a target date a bit later or earlier respectively than the date at which you intend to start pulling money back out of the fund

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

i 'll answer your question but first a comment about your intended strategy   buying government bonds in a retirement account is probably not a good idea   government bonds generally are tax advantaged themselves so they offer a lower interest rate than other types of bonds   at no tax or reduced tax many people will accept the lower interest rate because their effective return may be similar or better depending for example on their own marginal tax rate   in a tax advantaged retirement account however you 'll be getting the lower interest without any additional benefit because that account itself is already tax advantaged buying bonds generally may be a good idea or not i wo n't comment on that but choose a different category of bonds for the general question about the relationship between the fed rate and the bond rate they are positively correlated   there 's not direct causal relationship in the sense that the fed is not setting the bond rate directly but other interest bearing investment options are tied to the fed rate and many of those interest bearing options compete for the same investor dollars as the bonds that you 're reviewing   that 's at a whole market level   individual bonds however may not be so tightly coupled since the creditworthiness of the issuing entity matters a lot too so it could be that bond rates generally are going up but some specific bonds are going down based on something happening with the issuer just like the stock market might be generally going up even as specific stocks are dropping also keep in mind that many bonds trade as securities on a secondary market much like stocks   so i 've talked about the bond rate   the price of the bonds themselves on the secondary market generally move opposite to the rate   the reason is that for example if you buy a bond at less than face value you 're getting an effective interest rate that 's higher because you get the same sized incremental payments of interest but put less money into the investment   and vice versa

there is a significant tie between housing prices and mortgage rates   as such do n't assume low mortgage rates mean you will be financially better off if you buy now since housing prices are inversely correlated with mortgage rates   this is n't a huge correlation it 's r squared is a bit under 20 at a 1.5 2 year lag but there is a significant connection there   particularly in that era see chart at end of post for details in 1979 1982 there was a dramatic drop in housing price growth that with high interest rates there is a second major factor here though one that is likely much more important why the interest rates are at 10   interest rates are largely set to follow the federal funds rate the rate at which the federal reserve loans to banks   that rate is set higher for essentially one purpose to combat inflation   higher interest rates means less borrowing slower economic growth and most importantly a slower increase in the money supply all of which come together to prevent inflation those 10 and higher rates you heard about   those were in the 70 's and early 80 's   anyone remember the jimmy carter years   inflation in the period from 1979 to 1981 averaged over 10   inflation in the 70s from 1973 to 1982 averaged nearly 9 annually   that meant your dollar this year was worth only $ 0.90 next year which means inevitably a higher cost of borrowing    in addition to simply keeping pace with inflation the fed also uses the rate as a carrot stick to control us inflation   they were n't as good at that in the 70s they misread economic indicators in the late 1970s significantly lowering rates dramatically in 1975 from ~12 to ~5   this led to the dramatic double digit inflation of the 1979 1981 period requiring them to raise rates to levels nearly 20 at one point   yeah i hope nobody bought a house on a fixed rate mortgage from 1979 1981 the fed has gotten a lot more careful over the years alan greenspan largely was responsible for the shift in policy which seems to have been quite effective from the mid 1980s to the present though he 's long gone from his spot on the fed board   despite significant economic changes in both directions inflation has been kept largely under control since then and since 1991 have been keeping pretty steady around 6 or less   the current rate around 0 is unlikely to stay around forever that would lead to massive inflation eventually but it 's reasonable to say that prolonged periods over 10 are unlikely in the medium term    further if inflation did spike and with it your interest rates salaries tend to spike also   not quite as fast as inflation in fact that 's a major reason a small positive inflation around 2 3 is important to allow for wages to grow more slowly for poorer performers but still at 10 inflation the average wage will climb at a fairly similar pace   thus you 'd be able to buy more house or perhaps a better idea save more money for a house that you can then buy a few years down the road when rates drop ultimately the advice here is to not worry too much about interest rates buy a house when you 're ready and buy the house you 're ready for   interest rates may rise but if so it 's likely due to an increase in inflation and thus wage growth and it would take a major shift in the economy for rates to rise to the 10 11 level   if that did happen housing prices or at least growth in prices would likely drop significantly some further references

craig touched on it but let me expand on the point deposits by definition are withheld at your marginal rate and since you can choose roth vs traditional right till filing time you know with certainty the rate you are at each year   absent any other retirement income i.e. no pension and absent an incredibly major change to our tax code i know your starting rate zero the first $ 10 k or so per person is part of their standard deduction and exemption for a couple the next $ 18k is taxed at 10 and so on let me stop here to expand this important point this is $ for the couple and the tax on it is less than $ 1900 5 there is no 5 bracket of course it 's the first $ 20 k with zero tax and that first $ 18,000 taxed at 10 that $ takes nearly $ 1 m in pretax accounts to offer as an annual withdrawal the 15 bracket starts after this and applies to the next $ 57 k of withdrawals each year over $ 95 k in gross withdrawals of pretax money and you still are n't in the 25 bracket   this is why 100 in traditional or 100 in roth are n't either ideal i continue to offer the example i consider more optimizing using roth for income that would otherwise be taxed at 15 but going pretax when you hit 25 then at retirement you withdraw enough traditional to just stay at 10 or 15 and roth for the rest   it would be a shame to retire 100 roth and realize you paid 25 but now have no income to use up those lower brackets   oddly time value of money is n't part of my analysis it makes no difference and note the exact numbers do change a bit each year for inflation there 's a also a good chance the exemptions goes away in favor of a huge increased standard deduction

while the other people have tried to answer your question as thoroughly as possible i fear they are entirely incorrect in answering your question itself as it stands the answer is that there are no usual terms there are a handful of different options coming out now for this exact scheme examples include the uk governments help to buy scheme is offered at a normal rate and a small portion of the rent is set aside each month at the end of a fixed period that money becomes a deposit which the letter hands over to a mortgage provider who accepts it as a deposit this might well be a terminology thing since the other scenario which people described falls into the same name you 've used that scenario is where the investor who owns the property is considering sale of the property and is happy to negotiate a price up front for the next year usually the rent and price is higher than the market rate because if the market goes well over the next year they could end up out of pocket putting that into perspective over that year they are gaining their $ 1,000 a month or so but having $ 100,000 invested means a return of 12 if the property value is over $ 250,000 which i believe to be more likely they are achieving a return of i think 4.8 that 's not a bad rate by any means but realistically they are losing a bit more for maintenance and they could be making more from their money if the market were to go up in that time by more than 4.8 my house for instance increased in value by over 15 in the last 12 months they are making a substantial loss since you are getting a house at 15 below the market rate the total works out to a loss for them note that i do n't know the us housing market at all i 'm speaking mostly from my experience of the market here in the uk this is what i hear what i see and what i 've played to a bit make sure you check your terms before signing anything

yes timing does matter using a simple rate of change indicator over the past 100 days and out with a 50 day moving average i have plotted the s&p 500 since the start of 2007   the idea is to buy when the roc indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when the roc indicator crosses below the zero line i have compared the results below of timing the markets from the start of 2007 to dollar cost averaging starting from the start of 2007 and investing every 6 months $ 80k is invested in both cases   for the timing the market option $ 80k was invested at the start of 2007 then the total figure was sold out when a sell signal was given then the total amount reinvested when a new buy signal was given for the dca option $ 5000 was invested every 6 months starting from the start of 2007 until the last investment at the start of july 2014 the results are below   timing the markets results in more than double the returns not including dividends and brokerage edit it has been brought up that i have n't considered tax in my timing the market option so i have updated my timing the market spread sheet to take into account both long term and short term cgt in the usa for someone on the highest tax bracket the results are below   the result is still almost a 2x higher returns for the timing the markets option   also note that even with the dca option you will have to sell one day and pay cgt on any profits there however the real danger with the dca option is if you need to sell during a market downturn and not make any profits at all

it 's because trucks and suvs can have way better margins automakers might make a few hundred bucks on a sedan vs $ 10,000 on a truck    truck and suv price points are insane part of it can be blamed on the availability of credit

you could use bitcoin bitcoin is the fee killer i have n't used us and china exchanges but you can connect your us bank account to coinbase buy bitcoins transfer to and sell for cny there are many other options to convert from and to bitcoins but coinbase seems to be most practical and most widely used in the us and is the largest and probably most trusted exchange in china you can also use for both buying and selling but people on typically charge larger fees than exchanges though this may vary please read a bit about bitcoin before using it and be aware of the risks it 's still very new but revolutionary and very easy and fast to move internationally try with a small amount first to check it out your electronic wallet can be stolen and you 're exposed to certain risks of exchanges shutting down or government banks stepping over their boundaries one nice thing is that you probably wo n't be affected by volatility as you wo n't be holding bitcoins for long also be aware that the chinese do n't like capital leaving china and there is a possibility that china government will introduce further regulations on exchanges though they have stated that buying selling and owning bitcoins is legal you 're doing the opposite importing money into china but you 'll probably feel it in one way or the other p.s. approximate fast fee calculation coinbase has 1 transaction fee + $ 0.15 bank fee bitcoin transfer is free or in some cases with minimal btc fee a bit less than $ 0.01 currently has 0.3 trading fee and 0.5 cny withdrawal fee as you can see the main fees are exchange fees but still less than 3 and if you find a good exchange combination with low fees you 're golden or might even make money on transaction if btc price rises also check this reddit thread there are alternative china exchanges with lower fees found this blog post maybe a bit outdated but probably with better calculation than mine as it takes into account exchange prices

do not buy this car first i want to say i love bmw 's   there 's a reason why they call them ultimate driving machine and why other car manufacturers compare their new models to bmws   i own and i absolutely love it   every time you get into the car it just begs you to push and abuse it   everything from steering response to throttle to engine sound   awesome car   however 1 bmw is not known for their reliability   i 've had to do numerous things to this car and if i did n't do the work myself i like tinkering with cars it would be a pretty big money pit and actually still is   german parts are more expensive then regular cars   labor will run you if you take it for service   right now my car is on jack stands while i 'm fixing an oil leak replacing cooling system components which are known to fail and doing work with the cam timing system which uses bad seals 2 if you buy a used car which is 3 years old just remember all the items and everything that wants to break will break 3 years sooner on you   someone else already pre enjoyed your car 's maintenance free days   at things will start to go   ask me how i know   so you 'll start paying for maintenance way before your 5-year loan expires   compare this to the acura i used to have   acura aka honda had miles when i sold it and i never once got stranded with the acura 3 fuel economy is not that good and btw you have to use the most expensive gas 4 if you are really set on buying a bmw because you enjoy driving and wo n't drive like an old lady my apologies to those old ladies that drive at least the speed limit but you are not the majority then still do not by this one and check out auctions   i bought my 2003 in 2005 for when it cost over 40k new   you could probably find one with less than 20k miles on it my final advice is either a learn to at least do basic maintenance or b stick to always buying new cars which do n't have any issues in first 4 7 years then move on before you have to schedule your life around your cars on the bright side i doubt you 'll have to ever replace the exhaust and you can buy tail lights on e bay for roughly $ 60
