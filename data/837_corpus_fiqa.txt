the idea is old as dirt and some millions of people had it before you credit card cost you between 2.4 and 4.5 depending on the cards the provider and the amounts plus potentially a fixed small amount per swipe of course a 2 cash back card cost more than 2 to swipe and a 3 cash back card cost more than 3 to swipe those guys are not morons

this is basically a form of credit card kiting it 's not necessarily illegal but it can be it is however against the tos in pretty much every merchant agreement including paypal and square so you 'd most likely have your account suspended and the merchant could pursue legal action if they felt they could prove intent to deceive it 's not practical given actual fee structures but even if it were most merchants are quite good at detecting this sort of thing and quick to shut down accounts

first off the basics on hst gst    you do n't need to collect hst if you do n't want to until you hit 30k in a particular three month period assuming you 're not regularly passing $ 30k   you then need to collect on the sale that takes you over $ 30k plus all sales after that   see the h&r block page on gst hst for example goes through the roof generating more than $ 30,000 in one particular three month period in this case the day the sale goes through that took you over that $ 30,000 threshold becomes the day you cease to be a small supplier you must charge gst hst on the sale that put you over the $ 30,000 limit and on all sales after that even if you are not yet registered you now have 29 days to register with the government alternately if you hit 30k over four three month periods i.e. a year then you are exempt until the end of that fourth three month period after which you must register and collect hst the month after in excess of $ 30,000 during four or fewer previous consecutive three month periods you will be considered to be a small supplier for those four calendar three month periods plus the next month your first sale after that additional month and all sales thereafter will have to include gst hst you will have 29 days from the first day of the second month to register however many businesses do collect hst gst even under that limit in particular as it means you can collect tax refunds for your input hst gst paid   if you do so then you simply register from the start and then you do n't need to worry about it   you do need to remit those taxes collected though   if you do n't remit you wo n't be able to collect tax rebates for your input hst gst you decide to become a gst hst when you start your business you expect to exceed the $ 30,000 threshold at some time in the near future you also want to receive any gst hst paid back from the government on all expenditures especially those high startup costs and as grant recommends in most cases it ’s generally a good idea to register for gst hst as soon as your business is established provided that your business makes or will make taxable or zero rated supplies early registration ensures that gst hst paid on costs incurred is recoverable since tax paid prior to registration is generally not recoverable except on the purchase of inventory capital property and prepaid services still on hand at the time of registration be sure to register early because in many situations registering late can result in the loss of recoverable gst paid before registration

some of the other answers mention this but i want to highlight it with a personal anecdote i have a property in a mid sized college town in the us its current worth about what we paid for it 9 years ago but i do n't care at all because i will likely never sell it that house is worth about $ 110,000 but rents for $ 1500 per month it is a good investment if you take rental income and the increase in equity from paying down the mortgage subtracting maintenance the return on the down payment is very good i have n't mentioned the paper losses involved in depreciation as that 's fairly us specific the laws are different in other jurisdictions but for at least the first two years we showed losses while making money so there are tax advantages as well at least currently those laws also change over time there is a large difference between investing in a property for appreciation and investing for income even in those categories there are niches that can vary widely commercial vs residential trendy vacation tourist areas etc each has their place but ensure that you do n't confuse a truism meant for one type of real estate investing as being applicable to real estate investing in general

i do n't know australian law but i will give my us perspective here   the custom in the us is for officers and directors to be by the corporation and that llcs have an even broader power to even to remove the duty of loyalty   moreover directors will typically be able to purchase insurance to protect them from loss in the event of liability for us corporations not llcs the duty of care prudence requires that directors behave responsibly in weighing major decisions and consult experts and specialists before coming to rash decisions   it usually becomes a court case in the context of a large public company in the midst of an acquisition event   the only people with standing in the us are shareholders   if all the other shareholders are directors then it may be hard for them to blame you additionally if you are concerned about the of your actions there may be sources to rely on   first discussion with your fellow directors can be a helpful guide though will not usually you from any accusation of wrongdoing and disclosure tends to cure almost any accusation of breaching the duty of loyalty   second boards often secure the advice of legal counsel and sometimes bring on lawyers as members or will outright hire counsel for the board   third there may be services that will provide you with generic advice e.g. uk companies house and us based which might set you at ease a little bit i do n't know the details of australian law as i say   but my sense of common law countries is that like the us they are primarily concerned about negligence or neglecting to understand the business and make informed decisions fraudulently engaging in self interested transactions that either hurt the company or should have been offered to the company and not bothering to seek out information   as long as you are active informed engaged and not engaging in secret deals outside the company especially deals where either side is competing with the company then that would be more than sufficient under the us standard if you are concerned about liability then inquire into by the company in the us the company can usually pay all legal costs of directors insurance and legal counsel   i imagine your business partners are no more savvy than you are   my impression is you are to relatively rare and exotic expression of corporate law at least in the us but i 'll close by repeating that i do n't know australian corporate law

does this technically mean that she has to pay amt on $ 400,000 yes well not exactly 400,000 she paid $ 1 per share so and if so is 28 the amt for this sum 0.28 $ 400,000 = $    or does she have to include her salary on top of that before    calculating amt suppose in the fake example that her salary is    $ 100,000 after 401k all her income is included in calculating the amt minus the amt exemption amount the difference between the regular calculated tax and the calculated amt is then added to the regular tax note that some deductions allowed for the regular calculation are not allowed for the amt calculation how does california state tax come into play for this california has its own amt rules and in california any stock option exercise is subject to amt unless you sell the stock in the same year here 's a nice and easy to understand write up on the issue from the ftb when would she have to pay the taxes for this huge amt tax is due when income is received i.e. when you exercise the options however most people do n't actually pay the tax then but rather discover the huge tax liability when they prepare to submit their tax return on april 15th to avoid that i 'd suggest trying to estimate the tax and adjust your withholding using form w4 so that by the end of the year you have enough withheld suppose in the worst case the company goes completely under does she    get her massive amounts of tax back or if it 's tax credit where can    i find more info on this that would be capital loss and only up to $ 3 k a year of capital loss can be deducted from the general income so it will continue offsetting other capital gains or being deducted $ 3 k a year until it all clears out is there any way to avoid this tax can she file an election you asked and answered yes filing 83(b election is the way to go to avoid this situation this should be done within 30 days of the grant and submitted to the irs and a copy attached to the tax return of the grant year however if you 're considering exercise that ship has likely sailed a long time ago any advice for little susie on how she can even afford to pay that    much tax on something she ca n't even sell anytime soon do n't exercise the options should she    take out a loan e.g. i 've heard that in the extreme case you can    find angel investors who are willing to pay all your taxes strike    price but want 50 of your equity i 've also heard that you can sell    your illiquid shares on secondmarket is she likely to get audited by irs for pulling something like this you can take a loan secured by shares you own there 's nothing illegal in it if you transfer your shares the irs only cares about the taxes being paid however that may be illegal depending on the terms and the conditions of the grant you 'll need to talk to a lawyer about your situation i suggest talking to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about the specifics concerning your situation

my answer is specific to the us because you mentioned the federal reserve but a similar system is in place in most countries do interest rates increase based on what the market is doing or do they solely increase based on what the federal reserve sets them at there are actually two rates in question here the wikipedia article on the federal funds rate has a nice description that i 'll summarize here the interest rate that 's usually referred to is the federal funds rate and it 's the rate at which banks can lend money to each other through the federal reserve the nominal federal funds rate this is a target set by the board of governors of the federal reserve at each meeting of the federal open market committee fomc when you hear in the media that the fed is changing interest rates this is almost always what they 're referring to the actual federal funds rate through the trading desk of the new york federal reserve the fomc conducts open market operations to enforce the federal funds rate thus leading to the actual rate which is the rate determined by market forces as a result of the fed 's operations open market operations involve buying and selling short term securities in order to influence the rate as an example the current nominal federal funds rate is 0 in economic parlance this is known as the zero lower bound while the actual rate is approximately 25 basis points or 0.25 why is it assumed that interest rates are going to increase when the federal reserve ends qe3 i do n't understand why interest rates are going to increase in the united states quantitative easing is actually a little different from the usual open market operations the fed conducts open market operations usually involve the buying and selling of short term treasury securities in qe however especially the latest and ongoing round qe3 the fed has been purchasing longer term treasury securities and mortgage backed securities mbs by purchasing mbs the fed is trying to reduce the overall risk of the commercial housing debt market furthermore the demand created by these purchases drives up prices on the debt which drives down interest rates in the commercial housing market to clarify the debt market i 'm referring to is the market for mortgage backed securities and other debt derivatives cdo 's for instance i 'll use mbs as an example the actual mortgages are sold to companies that securitize them by pooling them and issuing securities based on the value of the pool this process may happen numerous times since derivatives can be created based on the value of the mbs themselves which in turn are based on housing debt in other words mbs are n't exactly the same thing as housing debt but they 're based on housing debt it 's these packaged securities the fed is purchasing not the mortgages themselves   once the fed draws down qe3 however this demand will probably decrease as the fed its balance sheet over several years and demand decreases throughout the market prices will fall and interest rates in the commercial housing market will fall ideally the fed will wait until the economy is healthy enough to absorb the unloading of these securities   just to be clear the interest rates that qe3 are targeting are different from the interest rates you usually hear about it 's possible for the fed to unwind qe3 while still keeping the interest rate i.e. the federal funds rate near zero although this is considered unlikely also the fed can target long term vs. short term interest rates as well which is once again slightly different from what i talked about above this was the goal of the operation twist program in 2011 and in the 1960 's gave a great description of the program in this answer but basically the fed purchased long term securities and sold short term securities with the goal of twisting the yield curve to lower long term interest rates relative to short term rates the goal is to encourage people and businesses to take on long term debt e.g. mortgages capital investments etc my main question that i 'm trying to understand is why interest rates are what they are is it more of an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it due to market activity hopefully i addressed much of this above but i 'll give a quick summary there are many interest rates in numerous different financial markets the rate most commonly talked about is the nominal federal funds rate that i mentioned above although it 's a target set by the board of governors it 's not arbitrary there 's a reason the federal reserve hires hundreds of research economists no central bank arbitrarily sets the interest rate it 's determined as part of an effort to reach certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future whatever those may be   in the us current fed policy maintains that the federal funds rate should be approximately zero until the economy the unemployment and inflation benchmarks set forth by the rule named after charles the president of the federal reserve bank of chicago who pushed for the rule the effective federal funds rate as well as other rates the fed has targeted like interest rates on commercial housing debt long term rates on treasury securities etc are market driven the fed may enter the market but the same forces of supply and demand are still at work although the fed 's actions are controversial the effects of their actions are still bound by market forces so the policies and their effects are anything but arbitrary

how long you need to keep tax records will depend on jurisdiction in general if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends it may create audit problems down the road ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts and you discard those receipts next year then you wo n't be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years generally how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments in your case us based the irs has straight forward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records period of limitations that apply to income tax returns keep records for 3 years if situations 4 5 and 6 below do not apply to you keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid whichever is later note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that for example you may be in a position to discover that you would like to a prior tax return because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you if you would have been eligible to in that period but no longer have documentation you are out of luck

if i had to guess i think chipotle 's queso is the way it is because chipotle is trying to maintain their wholesome quality ingredients approach to queso   but that 's the problem naturally made cheeses do n't melt into if anyone has worked in the pizza business for any period of time then they might know at least one thing about cheese melted cheese has a very high oil content   mix your cheese with a shit load of oil and it can melt beautifully want your cheese to stay in a liquid state at a lower temperature add more oil   so if you want to maintain wholesome arguably healthy ingredients and make queso at the same time then you 've got a problem because it 's damn hard to make liquid cheese without having it be the worst thing imaginable for your health   after trying chipotle 's queso last week i guessed that they were trying to make a not so miserable for your health version of queso so they made a queso without all of the added oil   but that 's the problem oil is fucking delicious pretty much anything that is high in fats like oil or sugars tastes amazing the higher the fat and/or sugar content the better it tastes but also the worse it is for your health generally   so chipotle has a queso that is n't for your health but it also tastes like it   i applaud chipotle 's willingness to experiment with new products and try new things but i 'm projecting that this queso wo n't have mass appeal because it does n't taste great a group of us bought a cup of it and we did n't finish it   sorry chipotle i like the effort but if i want chips amp queso my ass is across the street to to get some of that terrible for my health zero nutritional value yellow oil cheese product

how do i start what broker do i use we do n't make specific recommendations because in a few   years that might not be the best recommendation any more you are willing to do your own research so here are some things to look for when choosing a broker what criticism do you have for my plan seeking dividend paying stock is a sensible way to generate income but share prices can still be very volatile for a conservative investor a good strategy might be to invest in several broad market index and bond funds in a specific allocation for example you might choose 50 stocks and 50 bonds   then as the market moves your stocks might increase by 15 one year while bonds stay relatively flat so at the beginning of the next year you can sell some of your stocks and buy bonds so that you are back to a 50 50 allocation the next year there might be a stock market correction so you sell some of your bonds and buy stock until you are back to a 50 50 allocation this is called rebalancing and it does n't require you to look at the market daily just on a regular interval every 3 months 6 months or 1 year whatever interval you are comfortable with rebalancing will give you greater gains than a static portfolio and it can insulate you from losses when the stock market panics occasionally if you choose a conservative allocation

the us withholding tax applies to stocks etfs purchased on the nyse and other us based exchanges if you buy on the tse then you will not be charged this tax   your last sentence seems like you might be misunderstanding this tax though if the tax applied it would not cost you 15 on all your profits it only applies to dividend yields so if it pays you a 5 dividend the tax costs you 0.75 however if you buy at $ and sell at $ 26 then your capital gain is not subject to withholding taxes it is however subject to canadian income tax at 50 of the gain amount when it 's not sheltered in a tfsa or other registered account the tax on the gains could easily amount to 16 of your profits which is a much more significant cost therefore having to pay a 0.75 withholding cost certainly does not defeat the purpose of the tfsa which is to shelter from canadian income tax

here 's how i think about money there are only 3 categories contexts buckets that my earned money falls into savings is my emergency fund i keep 6 months of total expenses expenses are anything in the consumption bucket you can be as detailed as you want with this area but i tend to leave a fudge factor in other words if i estimate that i spend approximately $ 3,000 a month in consumption dollars then i 'll save $ 3,500 times 6 in the bank this money needs to be liquid some people use a heloc other people use their roth contributions in any case you need to put this money some place you can get access to it in case you go from accumulation income exceed expenses to mode expenses exceed income this money is distinct from consumption which i will cover in paragraph three investments are stocks bonds income producing real estate small businesses etc these dollars require a strategy the strategy can include some form of asset allocation but more importantly a timeline these are the dollars that are working for you each dollar placed here will multiply over time once you put a dollar here it should n't be taken out unless there is some sort of catastrophe that your savings ca n't handle or your timeline has been achieved notice that rental real estate is included so liquidating stocks to purchase rental real estate is not considered removing investment dollars just reallocating based on your asset allocation this bucket includes 401k 's iras all tax sheltered accounts non sheltered brokerage accounts and rental real estate in general your primary residence is not included in this bucket some people include the equity of their primary residence in the investment column but it can complicate the equation and i prefer to leave it out the consumption bucket is the most important bucket and the one you spend the most time with it requires a budget this includes your $ 5 magazine and your $ 200 bottle of wine anything in this bucket is gone you can recover a portion of it by selling it on ebay for $ 3 these are earned dollars but the original $ 5 is still considered spent the reason your thought process in this area is distinct from the other two the decisions made in this area will have the biggest impact on your personal finances warren buffett was famous for on haircuts because they are worth thousands of dollars down the road if they are invested instead remember this is a zero sum game so every $ 1 not consumed is placed in one of the other buckets once your savings bucket is full every dollar not consumed is sent to investments remember to include everything that does not fit in the other two buckets most people forget their car insurance life insurance tax bill at the end of the year accountant bill etc in conclusion there are three buckets savings which serve as your emergency bucket this money should not be touched unless you switch from accumulation to investments which are your dollars that are working for you over time they require a strategy and a timeline consumption which are your monthly expenses these dollars keep you alive and contribute to your enjoyment this is a short explanation of my use of money it can get as complicated and detailed as you want it to be but as long as you tag your dollars correctly you 'll be okay imho hth

although the market   discussion by other answers is correct the   tax structure of many developed nations i am familiar with canada in particular offers a preferred tax rate for dividend income compared to taxable gains consequently if your portfolio is large enough to make transaction fees a very small percentage rate this is a viable investment strategy   however as the preferred tax rate for dividends typically will catch up to that for capital gains at some cut off point there is a natural limit on how much income can be obtained in this way   if you believe your portfolio might be large enough to benefit from this investment strategy talk to a qualified investment advisor broker or tax consultant for the specifics for your tax jurisdiction

i think he makes a little mistake here   gt and so we might see that there has been this tendency for our psychology and our humanity to be less and less innovative at a time when in fact we may need to be more and more innovative if we 're going to be able to survive the vast numbers of people on this earth   in the first part of the sentence he is talking about our per capita rate of innovation i.e. we as individuals do n't have to be as innovative to benefit as much as we used to because we have more access to innovative ideas and hence can get that benefit from better copying   in the latter part of the sentence the need to be more and more innovative he 's talking about the cumulative innovation not per capita the argument contradicts itself because the reason we can be individually less innovative is because we can produce the same or greater cumulative innovation by aggregating fewer local innovations over more people   this is how idea evolution i.e. works as opposed to material wealth say for instance we all contribute a little to gdp if there are more people contributing gdp will grow but we each can only access our little portion of it so gdp per capita really tells a better story   ideas do n't work like that if we aggregate everyone 's useful innovations into an innovation gdp we all share the full cumulative gdp it does n't get divided such the we can only access a small portion of the idea hence less per capita contribution can still produce more innovation value so in the latter sense we are becoming more innovative on aggregate   he also seems to miss the important factor of efficiency we have evolved means to make selection of good ideas more efficient via for instance the scientific method hence with the same or less innovation at the hypothesis level we can produce more useful idea output with less effort trial and error   he has some good discussion points but i think he 's missed a few key parts of the math

it is pretty much the same as a normal margin loan but cheaper because you do n't own the underlying if the margin is $ 1000 at 5 you could borrow $ 20000 in total so the actual amount would be $ in total that you would have to pay interest on so at the moment it is 5.1 which is $ days = $ a day and if the share price rises you do n't pay extra in interest costs unless you have borrowed still stays at a day until you have sold the shares

while i do not have an issue with treating customers clients well the whole mentality of the customer is always right needs to be re evaluated    in a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly by no fault of the employee their privilege to be right ends in situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer if you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues if your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high turnover rate this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital but in workplace knowledge time and most prominently money chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with see below    another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle simply put 80 of your revenue will come from 20 of your customer base and usually the 20 tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand another application of this principle shows that 20 of your customer base accounts for 80 of the resource usage within your company the principle itself is not limited to 80/20 but the of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures    in short not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another in addition to this workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer average firms provide good service excellent firms provide smart service

no the expense ratio would be something you would n't be charged if you bought shares of the etf long then the dividends are usually reduced by the expense ratio if you wanted to know where to find that charge in general you would have to make up for any dividends the underlying stocks as part of general shorting since the idea is that once you buy to put back the shares it has to appear as if they were n't missing in the first place no the authorized participant would handle changes to the underlying structure if needed

the different levels are somewhat related to levels of risk writing a covered call is pretty low risk in the sense that if i buy the stock but sell a call i now have a lower cost for the stock and however low the stock drops i 'm still slightly better off than the regular stock buyer covered call writing is often used to generate premium income from a stock portfolio and less as a tool for speculation buying a call or put is simpler in execution but the risk of losing the entire amount spent i actually avoid the word invested here due to leverage involved is n't just a possibility it can be pretty likely depending on the strike price put writing and uncovered naked call writing can entail even higher risk relative to the premium received consider extreme moves in the underlying to understand the potential losses involved the more sophisticated trades are presumed to take a bit more experience and tolerance for risk and each broker has its own set of criteria to allow the client to trade at each level

there are two independent sets of terms we need to define in order to answer your question   i am trying to understand the difference between value blend and growth these are different categories of mutual funds value discounted or undervalued stocks this is often measured by a difference between the stock 's price and the net asset value growth stocks that fund managers believe are poised for significant growth increase in stock price and blend a blend of two categories of stocks in this context it probably refers to a combination of growth and value stocks but it just depends on the context   i want to receive dividend and growth these are ways to receive earnings from a stock or fund dividend a direct cash payment from owning a stock or a fund stocks and funds who pay out 100 of their profits do n't have any money leftover to grow themselves and either stagnate or shrink growth an increase itself in capital gains if a stock or fund pays out zero dividends then all profits are invested back into the company for fund increasing its value if you intend to automatically reinvest dividends then receiving dividends is essentially the same as receiving profit through capital gains if you intend to sell stocks or funds periodically to get some extra spending cash then receiving profits through capital gains is essentially the same as dividends

you must read e myth by michael   i 've had a business for 13 years   i read this book 4 years ago and it changed everything    it 's about building systems within your business that allow it to eventually run on its own which brings it that much more value     everyone always also recommends the millionaire next door it 's a great book but can be tedious   it essentially takes a statistical look at real millionaires and their lifestyles and shows that making a lot of money and living modestly leads to true wealth as opposed to people who make a lot of money but have too many large liabilities excessively expensive cars and houses ect so their net worth is less than a million   it 's not about having tons of money it 's about living modestly   the last one is 7 habits of highly effective people i have n't gotten to that one yet    edit   more general advice pay taxes on your money as it comes in   do n't wait until the end of the year and get a huge tax bill   also have an endgame goal or vision to start with so you can always have a guide to where you 're going for instance do you want to always run and operate your business or do you hope to build it and then sell or do you want to be a hands off owner eventually and have someone else manage it   the better shaped your endgame vision is the easier it will be to get there   be stingy especially at first you need cash   do nt go buying a brand new mac laptop and an office space you do n't need   eventually you 'll learn when you need to spend money and when to be stingy

to have to stop you right there most fortune 500 companies pay a lot of tax additionally they get targeted for audits quite a bit because of their size and complexity but at the end of the day if it shows a net profit on their income statement they 're generally paying tax   true but they make an effort to create a structure that profits and maximizes expense income tax is a real thing but it 's not the primary vehicle of taxation that some people think it it they pay more in other taxes like payroll social security and other kinds of tax   gt;a progressive scale for capital gains will just lead to high income individuals transferring the form of income to something else   you 're probably right

therefore i get the outcome i want    the human brain must think it ca n't stop   if you do n't believe me try     the mental process of putting stuff in those is called rationalization   this is a bored mind who wants something   if that mind is not particularly well disciplined those things will get pretty unrealistic    that is what has happened to your friend   landlords do not like drama   they do like money   generally a landlord will be happy to take your money any reasonable way that they can achieve   it sounds like either your landlord lost the ability to do credit cards or he got sick of paying the 3 overhead or some other overhead costs that may be higher because he does not have the right credit card merchant service   for instance paypal here charges flat but a traditional can cost up to $ 2000 a year in up fees and charges    as soon as the landlord calls the rent a debt he has to take cash   but in most places rental is at will and the landlord can evict for any reason or no reason at all except race color national origin family running a daycare center and a few other protected reasons   and there 's not a whole lot you can do about it   even for a lease he can trump up a reason   your friend would be wise to have a meeting of the minds with the landlord about how he 'd like to pay   business is done by mutual consent not non consensual legal tricks   i agree i would n't do ach either    one problem with ach or credit is the landlord can charge anything he pleases and that 's when they start in surcharges for things   once he 's pulled the money out you 're really at a disadvantage to argue since he already has the money and it 's really difficult to do a chargeback on part of a payment so you end up having to chargeback the entire rent check and now he can evict you

it is n't always bad there are cases where it works unfortunately these are hard to predict   there is no magic formula if you have x years of experience in profession y that makes it perfect to go into business z. even if y and z are the same unless you have the correct type of experience in z you can quickly get over your head ten   years as a waiter does n't help you to understand the entire restaurant business   in some cases the key to running a successful business is having years of experience running a business in other cases the knowledge has to be domain specific the less complete your knowledge the more and blind spots that will exist in your operation   the weaknesses have to be filled by others in your team but that exposes you to other problems they can let you down without you knowing it   the better approach is to say in a few years i want to own a business what do i need to do to get to that point besides money to buy the business money to run the business and money to survive the early years what knowledge do i need to gain or team members do i need to recruit

beyond the yield price relationship a good intuitive way to understand it is just this these people control a substantial amount of money that could be essentially loaned to governments    if they feel a particular policy is likely to lead to inflation or default they may decide not to loan that country any more money   all else being equal with a smaller supply of possible borrowers the country will have to pay higher interest to fund a particular amount of debt furthermore they may loudly publicly announce that they will no longer lend to that country in which case other participants may be persuaded that they too should no longer lend at the going rate   what 's more this is somewhat self fulfilling as rates go up the country will spend more money servicing its debt and will in fact become a worse risk    so i think the thing that gives them their nature is that governments worry they will round up a and things will run away   as far as actual incentives i would welcome more information but i think the main bond case is that they are basically long on the country but want it to tighten up its policy so their existing holdings do n't decline

there are markets in which there is n't a lot of choice to enable downward price pressure like drugs and healthcare     also consolidation always results in reduced consumer choice and sooner or later increased prices   that 's a big part of why they do it    in healthcare in the us there is huge consolidation among specialty practices in order to force insurance companies to pay more   e.g every and in a 30 mile radius from here was bought by the same practice so now the are forced to pay the rate this practice dictates   no small practices have started here in the past 20 years all the new mds just join the big existing practice in order to fill any increased demand   these practices often pick and choose which insurers they will work with and they do n't take medicare   but this is one example of how markets get and harmful if not regulated there are many others

but speculation is absolutely intended to happen and is considered necessary for healthy a investment environment   what i am saying however is that this desire to rid the world of hft appears to be moral rather than logical there is very little reason to eliminate hft as it stands although there appears to be a propensity for very emotional responses to the basic concept ones i can appreciate however i am suggesting they are misguided as the people who should be upset with hft are the hedge fund managers and day traders they are not you or me who buy and sell shares on a whim every so often if you want to ban day traders that is a separate argument i do n't want to go into   the idea that these computer algorithms are all set to sell sell sell is provably nonsensical if that were the case all of the hft participants would have gone massively bankrupt during the flash crashes also it is quite patently the case that somebody has to be buying in order for anybody to sell saying this is what caused some of the crashes is just your desire for a simple explanation it must have been more complex than this and to my knowledge none of these crashes have been adequately explained although some poorly designed algorithms have been note that in one of these cases iirc a fund closed its doors due to the losses and the market was largely unaffected so it seems like a problem that self corrects in this case and one that only harms the participant that   also to correct a basic misunderstanding selling happens all of the time and does not inherently drive the price down there are by definition an equal number of sales to what drives the price down is the people buying being willing to pay   edit as another aside a point i have made elsewhere and seems suitable to make here flash crashes whilst causing panic are again something only the professional intra day trading community are likely to be affected by their very name implies so the reason being that anybody investing based on the long term investment potential of a company will only benefit in the temporary drop in price as they can purchase more of the company at a bargain price any intelligent investor will not be by the drop in price as price has no bearing on a company 's real value and stocks do tend towards this value over time whatever happens over the short term the only case in which it could is if the company owns a large portfolio of stock that itself devalues dramatically that they intended to sell and as a result experience cash flow problems this is so incredibly unlikely with a flash crash as to be ignored

a home is an investment but the value it returns is n't primarily financial $ $ they are consumption a place to live this gives it different characteristics than other investments e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home does n't do much to assist your financial well being and future income and is n't necessarily the responsible thing to do you may get some capital gains typically in line with inflation sometimes less sometimes more but those are n't the most reliable and it 's difficult to realize them it involves selling your house and moving its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent but if you 're still working full time and can expect cost of living increases that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to say someone living on a fixed income but as for treating it as a low risk investment that 's very problematic real low risk investments are things like government bonds where you ca n't lose principal unless you 're going to live into your house until the day you die the real estate crash should have you of any notion that housing values never go down rather your house is a single illiquid investment imagine if you will going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties also you ca n't sell any of it until you move away and the transaction fee will take something like 3 still sound safe moreover it 's exactly the wrong kind of risk your house 's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy this means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time it totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations safety is not the way you should be thinking of it though

a credit card is not a bank account   it is essentially a contract to extend a line of credit on an as needed basis through a process accepted by the through approved cash advance etc   there is no mechanism for the bank to accept or hold a deposit   while most card issuers will simple retain the money for a period of up 30 60 days to apply toward transactions i have had a card that actually charged a fee for having a negative balance in excess of $ 10 for more than 30 fee was $ 10/month so no you can not deposit money on any credit card   you need an account that accepts deposits to make a deposit

this is very possibly a scam the way the scam works is that the scammers send you a letter and demand you call the telephone number but the telephone number belongs to the scammers not the bank when you call the number they will authenticate you by asking you a bunch of questions they will then have enough information to call the bank and pretend to be you and transfer out all of your money what you need to do is to find the telephone number for your bank without making use of this letter for example look at a previous bank statement or find the telephone number on the bank 's website call that number and discuss this letter if you have already called the number in the letter and if you have the slightest reason to believe it is not valid stop reading this is an emergency immediately call a legitimate number at the bank explain the situation and note that you believe your information has been compromised why are you still reading do it now

this answer fills in some of the details you are unsure about since i 'm further along than you i bought the espp shares in 2012   i did n't sell immediately but in 2015 so i qualify for the long term capital gains rate here 's how it was reported the 15 discount was reported on a w2 as   it was also mentioned twice in the info box not all of my w2 's come with one of these but also   this showed the sale trade with my cost basis as the discounted price of $ 5000 and for interests sake i also got the following in 2012 warning this means that just going ahead and entering the numbers means you will be taxed twice once as income and once as capital gains i only noticed this was happening because i no longer worked for the company so this w2 only had this one item on it this is another example of the us tax system baffling me with its blend of obsessive compulsive need for documentation coupled with missing information that 's critical to sensible accounting the 1099 documents must says the irs since 2015 show the basis value as the award price your discounted price    so reading the form 8949 note if you checked box d above but the basis reported to the irs was    incorrect enter in column e the basis as reported to the irs and    enter an adjustment in column g to correct the basis we discover the number is incorrect and must adjust   the actual value you need to adjust it by may be reported on your 1099 but also may not i have examples of both i calculated the required adjustment by looking at the w2 as detailed above i this information from the following documents provided by my stock management company you should the tax resources section of your provider

generally speaking granting rights to one bank account e.g. making a joint account does not extend rights to other accounts or otherwise let one joint owner create new obligations on the other owner e.g. opening a line of credit that the other owner must pay for except to the extent of the joint account   i assume there are no uk rules that would change this feature the other party can of course withdraw all the money without need for your approval   this also means that the joint account could be exposed to all the creditors of either party   if your account joint tenant has huge debts the creditors could theoretically look to the joint account for satisfaction   at least that would be an issue under us law frankly it may be simpler to get a separate account for the other person if possible and make transfers with online banking   it could also make sense to get a banking card if those are in the uk which works like a debit card and can be through various means sometimes a call sometimes online deposits sometimes in physical stores   there may be fees to getting such a card or a second account of course   the benefit is that the cardholder has no access to your account and you control recharging   such cards are widely available in the us to people who otherwise would not qualify for traditional bank accounts note also the fatca complication with adding a us person to your account   my understanding is that a number of non us banks will simply close the accounts of americans rather than deal with hassles under fatca

as previously answered the solution is margin it works like this you deposit e.g. usd at your trading company they give you a margin of e.g. so you are allowed to trade with usd   let 's say you buy pieces of a stock at $ 20 usd fully using your limit and the price changes to $ your profit is 5000 $ 0.50 = $ fast money if you are lucky let 's say before the price went up to it had a slight dip down to $ your loss was 5000 $ 0.2 = wait you had just 1000 to begin with you 'll find an email saying margin call or termination notice your shares have been sold at $ and you are out of business the broker willingly gives you this credit since he can be sure he wo n't loose a cent of course you pay interest for the money you are trading with but it 's only for minutes so to answer your question you do n't care when you have your money back the trading company will always be there to give you more as long as you have deposit left i thought no one should get margin explained without the warning why it is a horrible idea to full use the ridiculous high margins some broker offer 1:10 might or might not be fine but is

they are not required to fulfill the trade that they have intended to execute   they are able to cancel or modify the trade at any point   example this is how insiders are able to manipulate the price of shares through there buying and selling intentions   a ceo would be able to disclose a buy order for a month from now or whatever time period is required   this would most likely increase the price of the stock as investors would see this as a good sign of company performance   up until the point when the buy order is scheduled to execute the ceo can then cancel the order and create a new sell order   since the stock is high in price his new order is likely to make him money based on the manipulation from his trading intentions    i am not an expert on the subject and only know as much as i do through personal research here is an interesting article about this kind of insider trading and manipulation fine line between legal and illegal insider

your employer sends the money that you choose to contribute plus employer match if any to the administrator of the 401k plan who invests the money as you have directed choosing between the alternatives offered by the administrator typically the alternatives are several different mutual funds with different investment styles e.g. a s&p 500 index fund a bond fund a money market fund etc   now a statement such as i see my 401k is up 10 is meaningless unless you   tell us how you are making the comparison for example if you have just started employment and $ 200 goes into your 401k each month and is invested in a money market fund these are paying close to 0 interest   these days then your 11th contribution increases your   401k from $ 2000 to $ 2200 and your 401k is up 10 more generally suppose for simplicity that all the   401k investment is in just one stock mutual fund and that you own 100 shares of the fund as of right now   suppose also that your next contribution will not occur for three weeks when you get your next paycheck at which time additional shares of the mutual fund will be purchased now the value of the mutual fund shares often referred to as net asset value or nav fluctuates as stock prices rise and fall and so the   401k balance = number of shares times nav changes in accordance with these fluctuations so   if the nav increases by 10 in the next two weeks your 401k balance will have increased by 10   but you still own only 100 shares of the mutual fund you can not use the 10 increase   in value to buy more shares in the mutual fund   because there is no money to pay for the additional shares   you wish to purchase   notice that there is no point selling some of the shares at the 10 higher nav to get cash   because you will be purchasing shares at the higher nav too you could of course sell shares of the stock mutual fund at the higher nav and buy shares of some other fund available to you in the 401k plan   one advantage of doing this inside the 401k plan is that you do n't have to pay taxes now on the 10 gain that you have made on the sale outside tax deferred plans such as 401k and ira plans such gains would be taxable in the year of the sale   but note that selling the shares of the stock fund and buying something else indicates that you believe that the nav of your stock mutual fund is unlikely to increase any further in the near future a third possibility for your 401k being up by 10 is that the mutual fund paid a dividend or made a capital gains distribution in the two week period that we are discussing   the nav falls when such events occur but if you have chosen to reinvest the dividends and capital gains then the number of shares that you own goes up   with the same example as before the nav goes up 10 in two weeks at which time a capital gains distribution occurs and so the nav falls back to where it was before   so before the capital gains distribution you owned 100 shares at $ 10 nav which went up to $ 11 nav 10 increase in nav for a net increase in 401k balance from $ 1000 to $ 1100 the mutual fund distributes capital gains in the amount of $ 1 per share sending the nav back to $ 10 but you take the $ 100 distribution and plow it back into the mutual fund purchasing 10 shares at the new $ 10 nav   so now you own 110 shares at $ 10 nav no net change in price in two weeks but your 401k balance is $ 1100 same as it was before the capital gains distribution and you are up 10   or you could have chosen to invest the distributions into say a bond fund available in your 401k plan and still be up 10 with no change in your stock fund holding but a new investment of $ 100 in a   bond fund so being up 10 can mean different things and does not necessarily mean that the return can be used to buy more shares

your broker ameritrade offers a variety of exchange traded funds etfs that you can buy and sell with zero commission   an etf is like a mutual fund but you buy and sell shares the same way you buy and sell shares of stocks   from your point of view the relevance of this is that you can buy and sell as many or as few shares as you like even down to a single share   note that to get the commission free trades on the available etfs you have to sign up for it in your account profile   be sure to do that before you enter any buy orders you 'll want to start by looking at the ameritrade 's list of commission free etfs   notice that they are divided into different categories   stocks bonds international and commodities   which categories you pick from will depend on your personal investing goals time horizon risk tolerance and so on   there are lots of questions and answers on this site that talk about asset allocation   you should read them as it is the most important decision you will make with your portfolio the other thing you want to be aware of is the expense ratio for each fund   these expenses reduce the fund 's return they are included in the calculation of the net asset value of the shares so lower is definitely better   personally i would n't even consider paying more than about 0.10 commonly read 10 basis points or 10 bp for a broad based domestic stock fund   for a sectoral fund you might put up with as much as 20 bp in expenses   bond funds tend to be a little more expensive so maybe allow as much as 25 bp and likewise for international funds   i 've never invested in commodity funds so i 'll let someone else on appropriate expense ratios for those once you 've decided what funds you want and have signed up for commission free trades all you have to do is enter the trade orders   the website where you manage your account has tutorials on how to do that   after that you should be all set good luck with your investing

see and the articles linked from it the issue with holding a levered etf past 1 day is that investors expose themselves to path dependency in the underlying the reason for the difference in payouts comes from the fact that the manager of the levered etf promises you a multiple of the daily returns of the underlying to be able to promise you these daily returns the etf manager has to buy sell some of the underlying every day to position himself to have a constant leverage ratio the next day the short video below explains this process in detail for a 2x long etf but the same result holds for a 2x short etf the manager has to buy more of the underlying on a day when the underlying increases in value and sell more of the underlying when the underlying goes down in value

i think there is a rather unclear line but it is being crossed i do n't want to say no career advice because there has been some really helpful questions asked that while they want to know for a job search are helpful there 's also the posts like what does an banker actually do that do n't belong here tricky to differentiate what 's okay from what is n't but at the moment i 'd rather downvote the incorrectly posted to keep the useful posts

i doubt that there is an arrangement with any country that would allow you to transfer money out of a 401(k and roll it over to another country that is n't governed by us tax laws without taking a distribution   the us government wo n't let you pull out like that without taking its cut there may be but i 'd be surprised   check around in the appropriate venues if you 're making a distribution that incurs penalties then that 's what you 're doing   if you can do so without incurring penalties then great for you just deposit into the vehicle of your choice in your country

in all transitions real people actually did suffer   in the large view new markets were created and new jobs appeared   but the people who got those new jobs were not the same people who originally lost them   when the pace of such disruption is relatively slow those pain points are manageable   when the disruptions start coming one after another in rapid fire the managing of problems of that many real suffering jobless or under employed people becomes a disruptive problem in and of itself

sounds like they need to tighten the regulation around that and specify how long one can be off and tie that to further employment in other words you ca n't go off and come back to just quit but need a specified time off and a specified time back on the job beyond entry level ca n't you hire contract workers for the interim surely the uk has temp agencies for just this sort of thing

i find that hard to believe because when compared to the other engineering professions software is already extremely highly paid the problem is that the tech industry has continued to grow massively since 2001 and yet the number of computer science has dropped precipitously since that time according to the computing research uploads documents resources the number of cs graduates fell by more than half between 2001 and 2009   furthermore the jobless seattle blog for software developers is at 4.4 3.6 for web developers and 3.6 for computer programmers these are well below the national averages   so when companies like microsoft complain that they 're finding a shortage of engineers i 'm inclined to believe them the statistics seem to back it up so for the past decade software engineers have experienced high demand low supply and consistently high pay this leads me to believe that further increasing pay is n't going to help the situation what we need is more investment in stem education which is precisely what this $ 10k per visa fee is supposed to go towards it seems like a pretty good idea to me

the simplest way is you transfer the funds into your nre account in india from the nre account transfer the funds to your brother in law and show the purpose as loan from 2012 onwards rbi has simplified things under and your brother in law can deposit repay the loan back into the nre account once the funds are in nre account you can repatriate then whenever you like this entire process requires less paperwork the option you have suggested is also fine however your brother in law needs to engage the services of a ca and he will authenticate the purpose of remittance to the bank based on this certificate the bank will transfer the funds outside of india

can anyone recommend a good textbook that covers fannie mae and freddie mac or more broadly the us home mortgage market a basic search seems to mostly turn up books that aim to make an ideological point rather than attempt to provide an actual explanation   i have a basic financial knowledge including a basic understanding of derivatives at the level of say the textbook by hull but know very little about the us mortgage market specifically i do n't mind technical detail and am not afraid of math i do n't mind if the book is broader as long as it includes a reasonably in depth look at these gses and their role   this seems to be a pretty basic piece of knowledge for many financial professionals so i assume there must be at least one standard textbook on this that i just have n't been able to find   edit i 'm looking for something post 2008 of course

they can not refuse to accept coins and demand some other payment after providing a good or service   legal tender is legal tender for all debts   but until they provide the good or service they do n't have to accept it    in this case you want the service of depositing money   but by its nature they have to accept the payment first   in that situation they can refuse it   there is no law that banks have to accept your deposits   if they do n't want you as a customer that 's their problem    consider switching banks   historically this was easier and some banks may still do things the old way   call your local banks and ask   perhaps you 'll find someone happy to do business with you on your terms    as already said some coin rolling machines will pay you with gift certificates   if you plan to buy a sufficient amount from the place that accepts the gift certificate this can get that place to play the fee   that may help you although it is obviously a limited solution   the goal is to make it so that you only make purchases that you would have anyway   the seller obviously has a different goal    it 's possible to buy coin   heck you could buy one with a gift certificate from a public machine   cheap ones require extra work to get the coins rolled and may jam a lot   more expensive ones do more of the work for you   note that a given that works better may be cheaper than another that does n't work as well   cheap is more of a qualitative judgment than a financial measure in this case    if you carry a small amount of change with you pretty much everywhere accepts small amounts of change for purchases   so if you have been always paying with dollars and dumping the change in a jar instead always give the correct change coins   they may still give you dollars in change but at least you wo n't get new coins   and you 'll use some of your existing coins   of course this does n't scale well    for small purchases say $ 1.50 you can often pay the whole thing in change without argument   or if something is $ you might give them $ 10 $ 5 two $ 1 bills and the rest in change    if you are buying something and can see that they have little change in one of the coin buckets offer to swap some change for bills   sometimes places find that easier than breaking a roll    with vending machines use change instead of dollar bills   especially use exact change so as not to convert bills to change   they usually do n't take pennies but they 're great with nickels and above    this wo n't allow you to use change as a way to force yourself to save   but it will keep your change down to a manageable level going forward   and you might be able to use up your existing store   i 'm assuming that this is n't a fifty year coin collection that you are just now starting to process   but if you have six months of change you should be able to use it up in a year or so    i tend to do this   so i rarely have more than a couple dollars in change   no one ever tells me that they do n't take change because i do n't give anyone a lot   maybe $ .99 here but more likely $ there   sometimes i give them e.g. $ so as to get $ .25 in change rather than $    it 's a little more work at every transaction but it saves the big of work of rolling the coins   and you do n't have to buy

as your financial situation becomes more complex it becomes increasingly more difficult to keep track of everything with a simple spreadsheet   it is much easier to work with software that is specifically designed for personal finances a good program will allow you to keep track of as many accounts as you want   a great program will completely separate the different account balances location of the money from the budget category balances purpose of the money   let me explain when you set up the software you will enter in all of your different bank accounts with their balances   perhaps you have three savings accounts and two checking accounts   it does n't matter   when you are done entering those the software will total them up and the next job you have is assigning this money into different budget categories your spending plan   for example you might put some of it into a grocery category some into an entertainment category some will be assigned to pay your next car insurance bill and some will be an emergency fund   these categories are completely customizable and your budget can be as broad or as detailed as you wish   when you deposit your paycheck you assign that new income into budget categories as well   it does n't matter at this point which accounts your money are located in the only thing that matters is that you own this money and you have access to it   now you might want to use a certain account for a certain budget category but you are not required to do so   for example your grocery category money will probably be in your checking account since you will be spending from it regularly   your emergency fund will hopefully be in an account that earns a little higher interest once you take this approach you might find you do n't need as many bank accounts as you thought you did because the software does the job of separating your money into different accounts for different purposes i 've written before about the different categories of personal finance software   ynab mvelopes and everydollar are three examples of software that will take this approach of separating the concepts of the bank account and the budget category

if you think you can pay off the entire amount you borrowed over the next 12 month then you 're getting an unsecured loan at around 4 apr assuming you 're borrowing for the whole year    that 's pretty good compared to what you can typically get at the credit union   however if you only need the money for say 3 months that 4 fee effectively becomes a 16 apr and the real trouble comes when you do n't pay it off by the end of the 12 month and the standard rate kicks in if you do use the convenience check be sure to put in your calendars a reminder that the balance is due set the reminder about a month before the last billing cycle of your 0 period make sure you also have sufficient cash flow and an automated payment setup to make sure you always pay at least the minimum due on time   depending on your banking history you might be able to get away with one missed payment but more likely you 'll be penalized as soon as you miss a payment by a penny or a day and the 0 loan suddenly becomes very expensive read all the fine print make sure you understand them and set up a system to make sure you can play to the rules of the game

typically you can use credit card balance transfers to consolidate some or all of your other loan balances in one place   the interest rate might be lower   some prefer to make one payment rather than multiple payments   there is typically a fee that is imposed by the card that is originating or creating the loan   this would be the credit card you are transferring the balances   that fee is typically in the 3 to 5 range    while tempting and attractive on the surface this plan typically leads to a worse situation then you are now    it 's a tough pill to swallow but your problem is that you spend too much money   transferring money will not change this problem it is your behavior that has to change in order to not accumulate more debt   it has to change further if you want to get rid of the debt in a timely fashion    you would be far better served to forget about this transfer and get your life into control   spend a lot less earn more   pay off the cards you have now and cut them up   make a goal to be done in a year and figure out how to earn enough money to make that happen btw i am a reformed over spender that now owes nothing   yep my house cars and rental property are all paid for   you can get there too

sorry i always use my phone when using reddit and i 'm also not a native speaker basically what i tried to say is   the reason the whole world using this economic system is because when people divide their work force and everyone specializes on one thing they are much better at it gain more experience become more efficient and basically it is just more productive    that s why everyone has a job   but jobs has few downsides most prominent one being making all these repetitive tasks one can lose their purpose this is the situation for the poor community people who do not earn a lot of money and does n't have a good statue can be depressed by going to same place everyday doing the same thing for 40 50 years   for reason is everyone is doing repetitive tasks even if it is something you love personally i would hate my hobbies if i had to do them everyday not for enjoyment but for money but some are being rewarded much more    my goal of telling all these is this is not a perfect economic system but it is the most efficient one today people need motivation if they are going to do the same thing all the time the motivation could be different than money and statue but it is much easier to convince the masses these are important so the machine could work   only a fool with no regard to history would tell this is the best economic system and it will never change since world is always changing 5 years ago companies were banks and investment companies now they are tech internet my belief is that for now the system is structured and will stay the same until which changes the economy war economy needs other stuff compared to what we are producing normally motivation also changes in these times it 's not money anymore but for your countries sake and pride political system which is unusual to most since it is the economic change in classes which makes the political system to change

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

you ca n't calculate how many houses it will take to do so you would have to know how much you can charge in rent compared to how much is costs to run that particular location if the desirability of that location changes so does the ability to rent the place and so does the amount you can charge it is possible to create a business in real estate that would allow you to generate retirement income but you would be focusing all your income in your retirement years on one segment of the entire investment universe the diversification would have to come from spreading the money through different types of real estate condo apartments houses commercial warehouse light industrial you would even have to decide whether you want them all in one micro market or spread throughout a larger market or an even wider area diversification   as your empire grew and you approached retirement age you would have to decide if you wanted to liquidate your investments to minimize risk the long leases that provides stability of income would make it hard to sell quickly if the market in one area started to weaken

yeah most employers will say that their employment is at will and they can fire for anything but that 's usually not true if someone gets fired there has to be a reason those agreements that people are often required to sign when they start a job are not legally binding in any at all   employers will usually lie about it because they are breaking the law and they know it the only situation where they could get away with not having a reason to terminate someone is if they do not replace that person which is a lay off basically any other circumstance they had a reason and they are responsible for that reason

its easier than that employer matching contributions are   always pre tax while your contribution is split between the pre tax and the roth post tax parts matching contributions are always pre tax quote from the regulations i linked to for example matching contributions are not permitted to be allocated to a designated roth account so the tax you pay is only on the roth portion of your contribution one of the reasons for that is the complexity you 're talking about but not only matching is not always vested and it would be hard to determine what portion to tax and at what rate if matching would be allowed to go to roth

depends on how far down the market is heading how certain you are that it is going that way when you think it will fall and how risk averse you are   by better i will assume you are trying to make the most money with this information that you can given your available capital if you are very certain the way that makes the most money for the least investment from the options you provided is a put   if you can borrow some money to buy even more puts you will make even more   use your knowledge of how far and when the market will fall to determine which put is optimal at today 's prices   but remember that if the market stays flat or goes up you lose everything you put in and may owe extra to your creditor   a short position in a futures contract is also an easy way to get extreme leverage   the of the leverage will depend on how much margin is required   futures trade in large denominations so think about how much you are able to put to risk the inverse etfs are less risky and offer less reward than the derivative contracts above   the levered one has twice the risk and something like twice the reward   you can buy those without a margin account in a regular cash brokerage so they are easier in that respect and the transactions cost will likely be lower directly short selling an etf or stock is another option that is reasonably accessible and only moderately risky   on par with the inverse etfs

lets imagine two scenarios 1 you make 40 of total income yearly contributions to a savings account that earns 1 interest for 10 years in this scenario you put in and earned in interest for a total of 2 you make the same yearly contribution to an index fund that earns 7 on average for 10 years in this scenario you put in the same but earned in interest for a total of the main advantage is option 1 has more liquidity you can get the money out faster option 2 requires time to divest any stocks bonds so you need enough savings to get you through that period imagine another two scenarios where you stop earning income you stop working and have only your principal amount in a 1 savings account if you withdraw yearly for your current cost of living you will run through your savings in 7 years you stop working and have only 20k 2 years of savings in savings that earns 1 with in stocks that earns 7 if you withdraw your cost of living currently at you will run through your investments in 15 years and your savings in 2 years for a total of 17 years the two years of income in savings is extremely generous for how long it starts the process   in summary invest your money it was n't specified what currency we are talking about but you can easily find access to an investment company no matter where you are in the world keep a small amount for a rainy day

first of all to answer the basic question is one method correct might it depend on local laws yes it does depend on local laws because ultimately the business will have to file forms with the county city   these forms are going to ask for the total sales based on the tax category tax free x% y% each transaction could have parts that fall into each category the local taxing authority decides what goes into each category the local taxing authority also determines how often the business needs to submit the taxes they can even decide to base the rates used by where the customer lives   a business is not required to charge directly for sales tax that is why frequently at sporting events the price on the menu notes that all sales taxes are included i suppose not directly charging a sales tax makes the monthly calculation harder but the state will still get their money rounding up at the end of the entire transaction is enough to make sure they collect enough taxes so they do n't have to dip into their profits

it depends on whether or not you are referring to realized or unrealized gains   if the asset appreciation is realized meaning you 've sold the asset and actually collected liquidity from it then has provided a good route to follow    however if the gains are unrealized meaning only that the current value of the underlying have increased or decreased then you might want to record this under an income unrealized gains account   one of the main distinctions between the two are whether or not you have a taxable event realized or just want to better track your net worth at a given time unrealized    for example i generally track my retirement accounts increase in value sans interest dividends and contributions as income from an income unrealized gains account   i can still reconcile it with my statements and it shows an accurate picture for my net worth but the money is not liquid nor taxed and is more for informational purposes than anything    and no i do n't create an additional expense account here to track losses   just think of unrealized gains as an income account where the balance will fluctuate up and down and potentially even go negative over time

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

are you in an occupation that regularly collects change or is this change left in your pocket at the end of the day here in the us it is typically worth it to invest in some automatic coin counters if you are in an occupation that regularly collects coins   in your case you can collect the little from the bank use your coin counters and then make a deposit   here is an example of us coin counters if it is just pocket change then in the morning make it a habit of taking some with you   this way you are less likely to break larger bills   also if you are making a deposit at the bank add some change to the deposit without making it to annoying

buy and hope is a common investment strategy it 's also one that will keep you poor instead of thinking about saving money to put against a credit card or line of credit using your own job and hard earned dollars why not use someone else 's money if you have enough of a down payment for a property of your own consider a duplex or where you live in one of the units since you will be living there you only need 5 down as opposed to 20 down if you do not live there this arrangement gives you a place to live while you have other people paying your mortgage and other debts if done properly you can find a place that is cash flow positive so you basically live rent free   this all assumes you have a down payment and a bank that will work with you your best bet is to discuss your situation with a mortgage broker they know all the rules and which banks have the best deal for you a mortgage broker works on your behalf and is paid by the lending institution not you there are various caveats with this strategy and they all revolve around knowing what to do and how to execute the plan i suggest googling robert kiyosaki and reading rich dad poor dad before taking this journey he offers a number of free and paid seminars that teach people how to purchase real estate and make it pay i have taken the free evening seminar and the $ 500 weekend seminar on how to purchase properties and make money with them note that i have no affiliation with kiyosaki and i do find his methods to work

it is possible to achieve a substitute for refinancing but because of the short life of cars at least relative to housing there are no true first the entire loan will not be able to be refinanced   the balance less approximately 80 of the value of the car will have to be repaid   cars depreciate by something like 20 per year so $ 2,000 will have to be repaid now you should be able to get a loan if your boyfriend has good credit but the interest rate will not drop too much further from the current loan 's rate because of your presumably bad credit rating assumed because of your current interest rate while this is doable this is not a good strategy if you intend to have a long term relationship   one of the worst of a relationship is money   it will put a strain on your relationship and lower the odds of success the optimal strategy if the monthly payments are too high is to try to sell the car so to buy a cheaper car   the difficulty here is that the bank will not allow this if balance of the loan exceeds the proceeds from the sale so putting as much money towards paying the balance to allow a sale is best as a side note please insure your car against occurrences such as theft and damage with a deductible low enough to justify the monthly payment   it is a terrible position to have a loan no car and no collateral against the car

while people will say i 'm going to sue you for all your worth that 's not how it really works when someone brings a lawsuit they are supposed to show how much harm you actually caused them the court then awards them an amount equal to whatever the judge or jury are convinced was the actual harm so in the case of a car accident if someone can convince the court that you caused the accident and that he had $ 100,000 in medical bills lost wages from work and/or whatever other expenses than the court will order you to pay $ 100,000 a court can add on compensation for pain and suffering and it can add punitive damages if you were reckless and irresponsible but that does n't change the point here if you 're a billionaire and this is less than you spend on lunch in a week good for you you pay it and you 're done if your only assets are the clothes you 're wearing and your iphone and you do n't have enough insurance to cover it then you will be in debt for a long long time saying sorry i do n't have that much money will not help your liability is not limited to what you can afford to pay many people say that in real life courts will order big companies that are responsible for an accident to pay more than it would order an ordinary person to pay because they figure that they can afford it i do n't know whether that 's true but even if the court goes easy on you because you 're poor you can still be ordered to pay a substantial amount of money if the amount is totally beyond what you have if the court orders you to pay $ 1 million and you make $ 10,000 a year than the other person ca n't expect to ever get all their money but you 'll be paying for the rest of your life

another answer to this question occurred to me as i started learning more about historical uses for gold etc   perhaps it 's a idea but i 'm going to float it anyway to see what you folks think investing in gold is an indirect investment in the economy and gdp of the nation of india   to that extent is it only a hedge against inflation so long as the indian economy grows at a more rapid rate than your local inflation rate   fact india currently consumes more than 1/3 of gold production predominantly in the form of jewelry and their demand has been growing rapidly up 69 just between 2009 and 2010 alone i ca n't find too many consumption numbers for india but when you look at past articles on this subject you see phrases like one forth and 20 being used only a few years go to describe india 's consumption levels fact india has virtually no domestic sources of gold   india ’s handful of gold mines produce about 2.5 tonnes of the metal each year a fraction of the country ’s annual consumption of about 800 tonnes fact indian culture places high value on gold as a visible demonstration of wealth   particularly in situations such in indian weddings where the bride brings in gold to show her family 's status and wealth and it forms part of the given to bride it is believed that a bride wearing 24k gold on their wedding to bring luck and happiness throughout the married life fact the recent trends in outsourcing indian citizens working abroad sending money home etc have all lead to a influx of foreign cash to the indian economy and explosive gdp growth see the following chart and compare the period of with a chart showing the price of gold in other answer here   notice how the curves parallel each other to a large degree   potentially unfounded conclusion drawn from above numbers   the rapid growth of the indian economy coupled with a rich cultural tradition that values gold as a symbol of wealth along with a sudden rise in wealthy people due to the economy and influx of foreign cash has resulted in skyrocketing demand for gold from india and this large consumption demand is the most likely explanation for the sudden rise in the price of gold over the last several years   investors then jump on the rising price bandwagon as especially does anyone that can make a profit from selling gold to those seeking to get on said bandwagon as such as long as indian cultural tradition remains unchanged and their economy remains strong the resulting increasing demand for gold will sustain current and perhaps increased prices   should there be any sudden collapse in the indian gdp gold will likely tumble in parallel disclaimer not an expert just observations based off the data i 've seen there may be other parts to the picture of gold demand that i 've not considered

this has to do with the type of plan offered is it a 401(k plan or a profit sharing plan or both if it 's 401(k i believe the irs will see this distribution as elective and count towards the employee 's annual elective contribution limit if it 's profit sharing the distribution would be counted toward the employer 's portion of the limit however profit sharing plans have a formula that 's standard across the board and applied to all employees i.e. 3 of company profits given equally to all employees one of the benefits of the profit sharing plans is also that you can use a vesting schedule i 'd consult your accountant to see how this specifically impacts your business but in the case you describe this sounds like an elective deferral choice by an employee and i do n't see how or why you 'd make this decision for them give them the bonus and let them choose how it 's paid out edit in re reading your question it actually sounds like you 're wanting to setup a profit sharing type situation but again heed what i said above you decide the amount of profit but you also have to set an equation that applies across the board there is more complication to it than this brief explanation and i 'd consult your accountant to see how it applies in your situation

first as noted in the comments you need to pay attention to your network providers   if you are unable to pay exorbitant prices out of pocket then find an in network medical provider   if you are unhappy with the in network provider list e.g. too distant or not specialists then discuss switching to another plan or insurer with your employer or broker second many providers will have out of pocket or uninsured price lists often seen in outdated formats or   since you have asked for price lists and not been provided one i would pursue it with the practice manager or equivalent or else a doctor and ask if they have one   it 's possible that the clinic has an out of pocket price list but the front line staff is unaware of it and was never trained on it third if you efforts to secure a price list fail and you are especially committed to this specific provider then i would consider engaging in a friendly by direct negotiation with the practice manager or other responsible person   person they will be amenable to creating a list of prices if you are particularly proactive and aggressive you could offer to find out of pocket price lists from other clinics nearby   you could also flat out ask them to charge you a certain fee for office visits if you do this try to get some sort of offer or agreed price list in writing   most medical practices are uncomfortable asking patients for money so that may mean flat refusal to negotiate but it may also mean surprising willingness to work with you   this route is highly unpredictable before you go down it and it 's dependent on all sorts of things like the ownership structure business model and the personalities of the key people there the easiest answer is to switch clinics   this one sounds very unfriendly to hsa patients

the simple answer for the so called rule of x would be found by in your case update   if you want an approximation closer to the nominal rule of 72 value use this equation that incorporates a better approximation for the natural log the rule of 72 fits this for an interest rate of for a growth multiple of 2 the rule of 72 comes from by the natural as such the 2 is the multiple of growth the rate r here is not in percent so to change to percent say r you have to multiply by 100 the number 72 is often used because it is easier to divide evenly than and is a better fit approximation for the natural log and common interest rates   if you need more you can find all this on wikipedia

it is always possible for a company 's valuation in the market to be larger than the market it serves and in fact it is not uncommon   there 's valid argument that uber would be a good example of this with a market cap of more than $ 60 billion   market cap is the total value of all shares outstanding   keep in mind that what a company 's shares   trade for is less a reflection of its past or to some degree even present revenue activity and more of a speculative bet on what the company will do in the future

to know if a stock is undervalued is not something that can be easily assessed else everybody would know which stock is undervalued and everybody will buy it until it reaches its true value but there are methods to assess the value of a company i think that the 3 most known methods are if the assets of the company were to be sold right now and that all its    debts were to be paid back right now how much will be left this    remaining amount would be the fundamental value of your company that method could work well on real estate company whose value is more or less the buildings that they own minus of much they borrowed to acquire them it 's not really in the case of facebook as most of its business is immaterial i know the value of several companies of the same sector so if i want    to assess the value of another company of this sector i just have to    compare it to the others for example you find out that internet companies are being traded at a price that is 15 times their projected dividends its called a price earning ratio then if you see that facebook all else being equal is trading at 10 times its projected dividends you could say that buying it would be at a discount a company is worth as much as the cash flow that it will give me in    the future if you think that facebook will give some dividends for a certain period of time then you compute their present value this means finding how much you should put in a bank account today to have the same amount in the future this can be done by dividing the amount by some interest rates so if you think that holding a share of a facebook for a long period of time would give you at present value 100 and that the share of the facebook is being traded at 70 then buy it there is another well known method a more quantitative one this is the capital asset pricing model i wo n't go into the details of this one but its about looking at how a company should be priced relatively to a benchmark of other companies also there are a lot 's of factor that could affect the price of a company and make it away from its fundamental value crisis interest rates regulation price of oil bad management and even by applying the previous methods the value itself will remain speculative and you can never be sure of it and saying that you are buying at a discount will remain an opinion after that to price companies you are likely to understand financial analysis corporate finance and a bit of

's answer has a very good discussion of the types of pe ratio so i will just answer a very specific question from within your question and who makes these estimates is it the market commentators or the company saying we 'd expected to make this much future earnings estimates are made by professional analysts and analytical teams in the market based on a number of factors if these analysts are within an investment company the investment company will use a frequently updated value of this estimate as the basis for their pe ratio some of these numbers for large or liquid firms may essentially be generated every time they want to look at the pe ratio possibly many times a day in my experience they take little notice of what the company says they expect to make as those are numbers that the board wants the market to see instead analysts use a mixture of economic data and forecasting surveys of sentiment towards the company and its industry and various related current events to build up an ongoing model of the company 's finances how sophisticated the model is is dependent upon how big the analytics team is and how much time resource they can devote to the company for bigger firms with good investor relations teams and high liquidity or small fast growing firms this can be a huge undertaking as they can see large rewards in putting the extra work in the   at least one analytics team at a large investment bank that i worked closely with even went as far as sending analysts out onto the streets some days to get a feeling for some companies and industries growth potential each analytics team or analyst only seems to make public its estimates a few times a year in spite of their being calculated internally as an ongoing process the reason why they do this is simple this analysis is worth a lot to their trading teams asset managers and paying clients than the pr of releasing the data although these projections are good at time of release   their value diminishes as time goes on particularly if the firm launches new initiatives etc this is why weighting analyst forecasts based on this time variable makes for a better average most private individual investors use an average or time weighted average on time since release of these analyst estimates as the basis for their forward pe

i believe the only thing you have n't mentioned to him is the possibility that his activity is criminally fraudulent i would sit him down and say something substantially similar to the following we 've talked about your investment before and i know you believe it 's fine   i just want to make sure you understand that this is very likely fraudulent activity   i know you believe in it but you 've said you do n't understand how or why it works   the problem with that is that if it is a fraud you ca n't protect yourself from criminal prosecution because you did n't understand what you were doing   the prosecutor will ask you if you asked others to give you or the organization money and then they will you based on trying to defraud others it does n't matter whether you did it on purpose or just because you believed the people you are investing in so i very strongly advise you to understand exactly what the system is and how it works and then make sure with a lawyer that it 's legal   if it is then hey you 've learned something valuable   but if it 's not then you will save yourself a whole lot of trouble and anguish down the road if you step away before someone you attract to the investment decides to talk to their accountant or lawyer   a civil lawsuit may be bad but if you 're criminally prosecuted it will be so much worse now that i 've said my piece i wo n't talk to you about it anymore or bother you about it i wish you luck and hope that things work out fine i would n't talk to the police or suggest that i 'd do anything of that nature without proof then there 's no real way to start an investigation anyway and unfortunately scams like this are incredibly hard to investigate so the police often spend little to no time on them without a high level insider giving up evidence and associates chances are good nothing would happen to your friend one day the organization will disappear and he wo n't recover any more money but there 's a distinct possibility that when that happens the people below him will come for him and he wo n't be able to look further up the chain for help perhaps the threat of illegal activity will be enough to prevent him from defrauding others but if not i think at least you can let it go and know that you 've done everything for him that might work

it is n't that the companies force traders it is more the other way around traders would n't trade without margin the main reason is liquidity and taking advantage of minor changes in the forex quotes it goes down to pips and traders make on movement of pips maybe by 1 or 2 and in some cases in or less of a pip so you need to put in a large amount to make a profit when the quotes move up or down supposedly if they have put in all the amount upfront their trading options are limited and the liquidity in the market goes out of the window the banks and traders can not make a profit with the limited amount of money available at their disposal so what they would do is borrow from somebody else so why not the broker itself in this case maybe the forex company and execute the trades so it helps everybody forex companies make their profit from the fees more the trades done more the fees and hence more profit traders get to put their fingers in many pies and so their chances of making profits increases so everybody is happy

the advice you were given in the other question was do n't do it the math is not the issue the interest structure is not the issue but there is a significant chance that you could lose money on the deal if you invested your money in a nasdaq heavy position in january 2000 you are still waiting to break even in november of 2013 invest in almost anything in august 2001 and you will be down for a long time invest just before the housing collapse in 2007 and only now returning back to where you were if you take money on a monthly basis and invest it you will be better off   if want to get the loan then set up a stream of money into a bank account to make sure that when payments are due you have the cash to do so when the two years are up you will have cash to repay the loan and no need to sell the investments also if you are a bad judge of investments you wo n't have a problem repaying the loan using a loan to purchase stock reduces your gains and increases your losses use the power of dollar cost averaging by making periodic purchases

like i said to the others do a remind me i am not trying to hate on you or your views but facebook is not the future not even close they survive because the vision of facebook is heavily flawed   also gopro being worth half what is with in 5 years only shows your lack of research into the company and to what i said i also said that the money i made was essentially a drop in the bucket of what i wanted to invest but i held back heavily because of the type of companies they are and what the stocks show the fact i made what i did on what little i put in is well awesome no i am not a billionaire but i am rather good at picking short and middle to long term well and have done well with it my only fault is i do n't trust my own judgement enough i am sorry you think snap chat is a bad long term investment because in 5 years it will be over 100 a share i do n't expect you to take or trust the advice from a random person online but you talk like you actually know which you do n't and that is ok i just gave my opinion which i have zero doubt will pan out but that is the beauty of it

given that you have your emergency fund and no other high interest rate debts credit cards etc you will want to put down at least enough to not have to pay private mortgage insurance pmi   pmi is solely to protect the lender if you default   it has no benefit to you   it generally means that you will need at least 20 down   after that its a personal decision depending on what else you are going to do with the money   if you are the type to spend money frivolously if you have it it might make sense to put as much down as you can   if you think that you can invest the money and over the long term make more than the historically low mortgage interest rates it might make sense to invest    one thing to keep in mind is that money that you put into the down payment is relatively illiquid meaning that it is hard to turn back into cash   if you have large expenses in the future like health problems or college for the kids it might be better to have the money in something easier to turn into cash

matt explains the study numbers in his answer but those are the valuation of the brand not the value of the company or how rich the company is    presuming that you 're asking the value of the company the usual way for a publicly traded company to be valued is by the market capitalization 1   market capitalization is a fairly simple measure basically the total value of all the shares of stock in that company you can find the market cap for any publicly traded company on any of the usual finance sites like google finance or yahoo finance if by rich you mean the total value of assets assets being all property including cash real property equipment and licenses a company owns that information is included in a publicly traded company 's quarterly sec filing and investor releases but is n't usually listed on the popular finance sites an example can be seen at duke energy 's investor relation site the same information can be found for all companies on edgar the sec 's search tool   if you open the most recent quarterly filing and go to page 8 you can see that they have $ in assets and a high level breakdown of those note that the numbers are given in millions of dollars for a privately held company this information may or may not be available and you 'd have to track it down if it is available i picked duke energy because it 's the first thing that popped into my mind   i have no affiliation with duke and i do n't directly own any of their stock

what you are seeing is the effects of inflation as money becomes less valuable it takes more of it to buy physical things be they commodities shares in a company 's stock and peoples time salaries   just about the only thing that does n't track inflation to some degree is cash itself or money in an account since that is itself what is being devalued   so the point of all this is buying anything a house gold stocks that does n't depreciate a car is something of a hedge against inflation however do n't be tricked as many are into thinking that house just made you a tidy sum just because it went up in value so much over x years remember 1 all the other houses and things you 'd spend the money on are a lot more expensive now too and 2 you put a lot more money into a house than the mortgage payment taxes insurance maintenance etc i 'm with the others though do n't get caught up in the gold bubble doing so now is just speculation and has a lot of risk associated with it

yes you will need an emergency fund for the rental besides appliances or a roof that might need to be replaced you will also have to protect against being unable to rent the unit   another risk is that you may have a tenant damage the unit while you can get the money through the courts it may take months or longer you ca n't wait for the money before you repair the unit keeping the rental unit funds separate from the rest of your funds will allow you to make sure you are adequately protecting yourself

you 're lending the money to your business by paying for it directly   the company accounts must reflect a credit the amount you lend to it and a debit what it then puts that loan towards    it 's fairly normal for a owner driven company to reflect a large loan account for the owners   for example if you have a room at home dedicated for the business it is impractical to pay rent directly via the company   the rental agreement is probably in your name you pay the rent and you reconcile it with the company later you could even charge your company taxable interest on this loan when you draw down the loan from the company you reverse this debit your loan account and credit the company paying off the debt as far as tracking that expenditure simply handle those third party invoices in the normal way and file them for reference

one alternative to is the permanent portfolio concept do not buy the mutual fund behind this idea as you can easily obtain access to a low cost money market fund stock index fund and bond fund and significantly reduce the overall cost   it does n't have the huge booms that stock plans do but it also does n't have the crushing blows either   one thing some advisers mention is success is more about what you can stick to than what traditionally makes sense as you may not be able to stick to what traditionally makes sense all people differ this is an excellent pro and con critique of the permanent portfolio read the whole thing that does highlight some of the concerns with it especially the big one how well will it do in a world of high interest rates   assuming we ever see a world of high interest rates it may not provide a great return the authors make the assumption that interest rates will be rising in the future thus the permanent portfolio is riskier than a traditional 60/40   as we 're seeing in europe i think we 're headed for a world of negative interest rates something in the past most advisers have thought was very unlikely   i do n't know if we 'll see interest rates above 6 in my lifetime and if i live as long as my father that 's a good 60 + years ahead i realize people will think this is crazy to write but consider that people are willing to pay governments money to hold their cash that 's how crazy our world is and i do n't see this changing

it 's not necessarily bad but it can cause the stock price to become a lot more volatile depends on which side of the bet you 're on suppose a hedge fund manager thinks a company is poorly run he may buy a ton of shares so that he can get rid of the current ceo and replace it with his her own for the hedge fund and others long on the stock this is good those who are trading options or using some short term strategies could get screwed because of the sudden volatility   my next point is related to the above what is the intrinsic value of a stock the current price of a stock is the equilibrium of all investor 's perception of the stock 's value professionals make up a value for a stock using models such as dcf once they do so they trade based on what they believe the value of the stock is you might calculate a stock is worth 70 and i believe it 's 80 so the stock price is going to fluctuate a bit but it should keep within that range assuming we 're the only investors then comes a hedge fund manager say carl icahn and discloses a stake in our stock wow the stock must be really valuable everyone starts buying this stock so up it goes to 90 simply because the guy who seems to know what he 's doing bought it the point here is that now it 's not trading based on intrinsic value now it 's purely psychological ie it 's now a momentum stock which you have no idea when it 'll crash look at tesla netflix or just google momentum stocks all the big crashes in stock prices happen when these big funds unload their stocks a surge in supply will cut the price the problem is you ca n't predict when some fund manager will decide to sell some stake of his   tying everything together is liquidity the more liquid a stock is the easier it is to obtain and the less volatile it is the more people playing the game with not too big shares of stock the faster the price will converge to some equilibrium and with less volatility institutional investors take away liquidity

the point of the enrollment penalty is basically the same as the aca penalty   any sort of health insurance or really any insurance is funded by creating a risk pool of high and low risk people and pricing it so that the overall payments cover the total risk    that means however that on average the low risk people end up paying more than their share more than it would have cost them without the insurance any provider agreements to charge less which is significant in the health insurance business   of course some of them do end up using more than they pay but not on average assuming the risk was calculated accurately while there is n't really a completely low risk pool in medicare there is a significant difference in utilization = cost between younger 65 70 and older   as such for many health 65 year olds it would be beneficial to not enroll in medicare right away delay a few years if they 're fully healthy and wait until they are less healthy   since medicare wo n't turn you away for pre existing conditions that 's a risk some would take in order to accommodate for that medicare effectively says if you did n't help subsidize the costs of the high users when you were younger you need to pay more to make up for that fact hence the enrollment penalty    the new york times explains this in part in a 2006 article discussing part d which was new that year and has a similar penalty the purpose of the late enrollment penalty is to encourage people to    sign up as soon as possible before they have significant drug costs

from the perspective of an investor and someone in high tech during that period here is my take   a few high tech companies had made it big apple microsoft dell and a lot of people were sitting around the fact that we all should have realized that computers were going to be huge and invested early in those companies we all convinced ourselves that we knew it was going to happen whether we did or not but for some reason we did n't put our money where our mouth was and now we were because we could be millionaires already in the meantime the whole internet thing transitioned from being something that only nerds and academics used to a new paradigm for computing many of us reasoned that we were n't going to be suckers twice and this time we were getting on that boat before it left for money land   so it became fashionable to invest in internet stocks everyone was doing it it was guaranteed to come up in any conversation at parties or with friends at work so with all this investment money out there for the internet 's next big thing naturally lots of companies popped up to take advantage of the easy money it got to the point where brokers and venture capital firms were beating the looking for companies to throw money at and often they did n't scrutinize these company 's business plans very well and/or bought into insane growth projections frankly most of the business plans amounted to we may not make any money off our users but if we get enough people to sign up that has to be valuable right   problem 2 was that most of these companies were n't run by proven business types but that did n't matter it worked for those rag tag kids at google apple and microsoft right well business types who know how to build a sustainable business model are so in the new internet economy   also the implicit agenda of most of these new entrepreneurs is 1 get enough funding to make the company big enough go public while keeping enough equity to get rich when it does 2 buy a ferrari 3 repeat with another company    now these investors were n't stupid they knew what was going on and that most of these internet companies were n't going to be around in a decade everyone was just playing the momentum and planned to get out when they saw the signal that the whole house of cards was going to fall at the time we always talked about the fact that these investments were totally playing with monopoly money but it was addictive during the peak at least on paper my brokerage account was earning more money for me than my day job   the problem was that it was all kind of a pyramid scheme these dot com companies needed a continual supply of new investment because most of them were operating at a loss and some did n't even have a mechanism to make a profit at all at least not a realistic one a buddy of mine for example worked for an ipo bound company that made a freaking web based contact management system they did n't charge yet but they would one day turn on the meter and all of those thousands of customers who signed up for a free account would naturally start paying for something the company was actively devaluing by giving it away for free this company raised more than $ 100 m in venture capital   so eventually it started to get harder for these companies to continue to raise new money to pay operational costs without showing some kind of roi that is the tried and true model for valuing a company started to back in and these companies had to admit that the ceo had no clothes so without money to continue paying for expensive developers and marketing these companies started to go under when a few of the big names tumbled everyone saw that as the signal and it was a race to the bank the rest is history

the contract should address this issue it will specify the types of remedies and damages that would result if either side tries to back out of the deal there can be monetary penalties and the courts can force the seller to complete the deal where i have experienced this it generally takes only a gentle reminder from the agent regarding the consequences there is also limited indirect protection via the contract between the seller and their real estate agent many times that contract will require the seller to pay the agent their commission if there is n't a valid reason to cancel the deal the contract was to find a fully qualified buyer the threat of having to pay 6 of list price to the agent and not selling the house can be enough to get them to complete the deal all this assumes there was fraud which could bring in criminal penalties

from also corp or is an intentionally erroneous spelling of the word bank but pronounced the same way it has been adopted by companies which are not banks but wish to appear as such and satisfy legal restrictions on the usage of the word bank for instance if the original company is known as bank of america then the new investment banking entity may be known as of america securities llc if the original company is known as bank of manhattan then its insurance business might be known as of manhattan insurance and its holding company might be called manhattan this practice originates from legal necessity under the laws of most states a corporation may only use the word bank in its name if it has obtained a banking charter under state or federal banking laws so of america is the subsidiary of boa that does n't have appropriate licenses to be called bank wonders of complex regulation

the exact answers depend on what you 're going to do and what you started with and what your local market is like but a bit of and/or asking a good general contractor will yield a table of typical improvement in sale price from various renovations one thing you 'll discover is that unless you are staring with something almost few if any if return more than you paid for them getting back 85 is exceptionally good a possible exception is energy saving measures basic air and attic insulation improvements pay back their cost relatively quickly and solar can do so if you have a decent site for that and these are often subsidized in one way or another by government or utilities for most things the real answer is to ask yourself what would make the house better for you and your family and what that would be worth to you if you can get it done for less than that go for it it 's a good idea to put together as complete a list possible before starting since some will be considerably less expensive if done in the right order or at the same time redo your roofing before installing rooftop solar panels if possible as one example then prioritize by what will improve your enjoyment of the house most you 'll probably get better specific advice over in the home improvement area of stack exchange

i recently needed to compute a better balance that let us pick and choose what to include in the computed sum without losing information so i this topic and i 'm pleased to say that i 've found a solution that works at least for our data you may have transactions that this code does n't recognize but you can always modify it to match my solution was written for ms sql server 2008 or later it uses a a view and a aggregate sum over order by which means it should be almost syntax compatible with mysql does not support over but you can perform a running sum using a variable with arithmetic addition directly in the select clause create a database table with this feel free to exclude columns you 're not interested in such as create a unique index on you could use it as a primary key i suppose you might be tempted to create a foreign key relationship between and however this will fail if you enforce it we have many transactions where points to a transaction that does n't exist this is usually in the case of type = web accept payment received and status = canceled we also have some values longer than 17 characters some start with all pending money requests i suspect this indicates the transaction is unfinished re download your entire paypal history csv files so that you have the latest retroactive updates import these csv files into this table do a simple test to see how bad paypal 's default data is to find out where the differences are coming from run this query the order by is to ensure consistent ordering when multiple transactions share the same timestamp as you scroll through the results you 'll see how the naive sum is thrown off from the official paypal computed balance column so as you can see the net column value can not always be trusted what we need is to generate our own value which is accurate that is the value is 0.00 for rows which do not affect the balance instead of being what they are right now the problem is given a single row of data such as any single row from the example table in my original question we have no way of inherently knowing what its is i have devised two functions to help solve this problem the first function only looks at the type and status column values and generates accurate values for the vast majority of rows indeed in our dataset we only had one row for which this approach did not work i recommend you try this one first and compare the running sum value to ensure it works for your data you can use this function in the query like so below hopefully it should give you an accurate running sum and balance figure at the end 8 and here 's the view that ties it all together used like so i hope this helps anyone else wanting to do accurate bookkeeping with paypal transaction history files

i was a school board member and district negotiator for the teacher contract   i came off the board in the last couple years   in this case it does n't seem like tenure is the issue   this is a seniority issue   teacher unions like most unions are strict seniority shops   that is basically the only thing that matters   tenured teachers can be let go without cause essentially only for budget reasons   districts schools will identify which grade level for elementary or what program subject the reduction in staffing will occur   the lowest senior person is let go first regardless of skill or past performance   interestingly if a teacher is certified to teach in more than 1 subject area this can also cause chaos   if that same teacher is the one who is reduced from a given department and they have higher seniority than the department where they also have certification they will bump that other teacher thus taking their job   let 's say you have a teacher who is certified in science and math in the high school setting   they are number 90 out of 200 on the seniority list   this teacher may have been teaching science for 10 years but the other teachers in that department are all higher on the seniority list   the lowest senior teacher in the math department is number 100 out of 200   if the district identifies that a reduction of 1 science teacher is necessary that teacher gets to bump the math teacher out of the job thus getting laid off so that they can fill the math slot even though they have n't taught math in over 10 years     while not in all cases often the teachers union negotiators set the stage for these type of layoffs   usually districts have only so many resources to go around   their funding is set for them by the state and any local operating levy needs to be voted into place which can be difficult   also recognize that the teachers at the table in the negotiating session are the more senior teachers in the district since they have been around longer and are much less likely to lose their jobs due to staff reductions   if the teachers union negotiates a raise that is higher than the district can support with the same number of teachers the number of teachers must be reduced   if you think the negotiators are there for all the teachers you are wrong   one of the teachers i negotiated with once said the following we would rather a higher compensation package at the expense of teacher reductions   the system is designed to defend teacher compensation and provide job security as the first priority not to provide the best education for our kids   as with this teacher they are losing a great asset because an outdated and terrible system was being upheld

i do n't like reits because they are more closely correlated to the movement of the stock market they do n't really do the job of diversifying a portfolio because of that correlation   when the stock market dropped in 2008 reits were hammered as well because the housing bubble burst bonds went up and if you rebalanced sold the bonds to buy more stock then you came out much further ahead when the stock market recovered the point of adding bonds for diversification is that they move in the opposite direction of equities the major drops and providing buying opportunities reits do n't fit that bill reits are not undergoing a correction like bonds because the price of real estate is a function of housing supply and buyer demand rising interest rates only make it a little harder for buyers to buy so the effect of rising interest rates on real estate prices is muted the other effects on real estate prices more wealth in the economy for buyers pushes in the opposite direction of the rising interest rates

investors who are themselves canadian and already hold canadian dollars cad would be more likely to purchase the tsx listed shares that are quoted in cad thus avoiding the currency exchange fees that would be required to buy usd quoted shares listed on the nyse assuming shopify is only offering a single class of shares to the public in the ipo and shopify 's form f-1 only mentions class a subordinate voting shares as being offered then the shares that will trade on the tsx and nyse will be the same class i.e. identical consequently the primary difference will be the currency in which they are quoted and trade this adds another dimension to possible arbitrage where not only the bare price could deviate between exchanges but also due to currency fluctuation an additional implication for a company to maintain such a dual listing is that they 'll need to adhere to the requirements of both the tsx and nyse while this may have a hard cost in terms of additional filing requirements etc in theory they will benefit from the additional liquidity provided by having the multiple listings canadians in particular are more likely to invest in a canadian company when it has a tsx listing quoted in cad also for a company listed on both the tsx and nyse i would expect the tsx listing would be more likely to yield inclusion in a significant market index say one based on market capitalization and thus benefit the company by having its shares purchased by index etfs and index mutual funds that track the index i 'll also remark that this dual exchange listing is not uncommon when it comes to canadian companies that have significant business outside of canada

to be honest i do n't know how any of this work in the us so my answer will be of very limited value to yourself i suspect but when it comes to the uk if you 're going to get the same pay gross either way than being independent makes very little sense   running your own business is hassle is generally more risky although possibly not in your case and costs money some of the most obvious costs are the added ni probably the need for an accountant at around £ 1200 p a for basic accountancy service you are obliged by law to have liability insurance and you probably want professional indemnity insurance this will be around £ 600 p a and so on and so forth   on top of that anyway as a contractor you really should n't be getting any benefits from the client and so health insurance company car even parking are all meant to be arranged by and paid by your company and ca n't or rather should n't be charged to the client so i would say if you 're seriously thinking about setting up a consultancy company and this client is first of many set up a company but take into account the sums you need to earn if you 're really thinking about employment be an employee

well as you say the instructions for form w-2 for your employer to fill out say you must report all employer contributions including    an employee 's contributions through a cafeteria plan to    an hsa in box 12 of form w-2 with code w. employer    contributions to an hsa that are not from the    income of the employee also must be reported in boxes 1    3 and 5 however while it 's your employer 's job to fill out w-2 correctly it 's only your job to file your taxes correctly especially as you say your box income is correct this is n't too hard to do you should file form 8889 with your return and report the contributions on line 9 as employer contributions and as you say both what the employer contributed outright and what you had deducted from your pay are both employer contributions be sure to keep your final pay stub for the year or other documentation showing that your employer did contribute that amount just in case the irs does end up questioning it for some reason   if you really want to you could try calling the irs and letting them know that you have contributions that were n't reported on your w-2 to see if they want to follow up with your employer about correcting their documentation if your efforts have been fruitless there 's even a faq page on the irs site about how to contact them when your employer is n't giving you a correct w-2 and how to fill out a form instead of using the w-2 which i 'd recommend if the amount of income listed was wrong or if there were some other more major problem with the form most likely though since it 's not going to affect the amount of tax anybody will pay it 's not going to be at the top of their list i would worry more filling out the forms you need to fill out correctly rather than worrying about the forms your employer is n't filling out correctly

charitable donations can be deducted from your income and in that way make your taxable income lower hence lower taxes that 's the meaning of tax deductible as to if i donate it then the money will be given right to the charity instead of spread out to many other places taxes are being used by the government based on its own decisions presumably made by elected officials thus representing the will of the voters charities use the money based on their defined goals giving money to a charity will ensure it is used for the specific goal the charity declared and that 's the way for you to funnel money to the goals of your preference choice for example you can donate money to your temple around the corner or the gay rights organization or anti gay for that matters your money will be spent on the goals of your choosing re advantages charitable donations are used by the rich folks to avoid paying taxes on their income because they 're deductible so someone might donate money to places they use themselves like the temple church for example or the school where the kids go or politician which will objectively choose someone 's business for a big government contract etc etc for ordinary people it 's a way to reduce the taxable income and divert the money to the specific goals of their choice for example donating $ 100 to red cross japan tsunami relief fund will reduce your taxable income by $ 100 and total taxes by $ 28 assuming you 're in the 28 bracket thus the $ 28 will go to the specific goal your choose instead of the general taxes

buying a house is often more emotional than financial which makes that kind of advice tough to offer staying with the finance side you wrote 2 bedrooms is enough for me is it enough for your girlfriend is she on the same schedule for kids as you are 2 bedrooms means that with just one child you are less able to host a guest and the second child will need to share the bedroom nothing wrong with that just making sure you are aware of these things if the long term plan is to move to a new house a ten year horizon for the second house sounds good to me   i 'll make one brief comment on rent vs buy it 's easy to buy too big and discover you are paying for rooms you do n't use i have a house i 'll be glad to get rid of when our daughter goes off to college a dining room and formal living room go unused save for 3 or 4 days a year it already sounds like you 'll avoid this mistake   your question the right time when you are ready with the downpayment income and desire to do so you should at least have a feeling you plan to stay there for a time else the cost of buying selling would exceed any potential gain

an addition to the other answers more than a real answer i suspect note that fees are not the only way that you pay for foreign exchange where no foreign exchange fee is charged the issuer makes it back by giving an appalling spread on the rate be very careful not to go for a card that has no fees but an exorbitant spread i personally would open a cad denominated account in canada and convert a larger amount into that account when cad is historically weak the spreads will be better that way but do n't attempt to use it to mitigate exchange rate risk or to trade the two currencies for profit as that way madness and lie

some large merchants do not give discounts for cash payments as this does not work out any cheaper for them vs credit card payments in credit card typically fees given to all the 3 parties merchant bank issuer bank and visa would be around 3 if cash payment is made and the amounts are large say at walmart k mart they have to deposit such cash at banks have a provision to storing cash at stores people to count the cash so essentially they will have to pay for cash officer to count   bigger safe to store transport security insurance to take cash to bank plus banks charge around 1 charge for counting the large cash being deposited this cash would be in local branch where as the operations are centralized and walmart k mart would need the money in central account it takes time to get it transferred to a central account and there is a fee charged by bank to do this automatically on the other hand smaller merchants would like cash as they are operated stand alone and most of their purchases are also cash hence they would tend to give a discount for cash payment if any

i like your enthusiasm and initiative however there are a few things you need to consider that you have n't yet thought about first it is important to remember that trading with fake money is not the same as trading with real money   in the fake world you have $ 100k   with this fake money you can do reckless things with it such as put it all on one stock   if you lose it costs you nothing so you do n't have an emotional attachment to it   with real money it will feel different and that is something you have n't experienced yet second you mentioned that you are good at making picks   with all due respect i suggest that you are n't old enough to make that determination   you have n't been trading for long enough to determine if you are doing well at it     that having been said i do n't want to completely discourage you from trying something new third you mentioned long term investing but you also said that you need to make your money back quick and mentioned trading daily   those things are n't really compatible   i would n't consider what you are doing as long term investing   with the type of investing you are doing picking individual stocks and hoping for the value to go up in a relatively short time frame it is similar to gambling   the risk of losing is very much there and you should n't be investing money this way that you are n't prepared to lose   if you need the money for something soon do n't put it in the stock market never forget this   what can happen is that you start with small amounts of money do well and then thinking that you are good at this put in larger amounts of money   you will eventually lose   if you put in money that you need for something else you have a problem if you are trying this out for education and entertainment purposes that is great   but when it starts to get serious make sure that you are aware of the risks   educate yourself and be smart here is what i would suggest if you want to try this short term day trading type investing and you understand that the money can easily be lost i would balance that with investing in a more traditional way set aside an amount each month to put in a low expense index mutual fund   doing this will have several benefits for you   as for your specific questions about stock trading with small amounts yes you can trade with small amounts however every time you trade you will be paying a commission   even with a discount broker if you are trading frequently the commissions you will be paying will be very significant at the dollar amounts you are talking about   the only way i can see around this would be to try the robinhood app which allows you to trade without paying sales commission   i have no experience with that app

first keep in mind that there are generally 2 ways to buy a corporation 's shares you can buy a share directly from the corporation this does not happen often it usually happens at the initial public offering the first time the company becomes public where anyone with access to the stock exchange can become a part owner plus maybe a few more times during the corporations existence in this case the corporation is offering new ownership in exchange for a price set the corporation or a broker hired by the corporation   the price used for a public offering is the highest amount that the company believes it can get this is a very complicated field and involves many different methods of evaluating what the company should be worth if the company sets the price too low then they have missed out on possible value which would be earned by the previous private shareholders they would have gotten the same share of a corporation which would now have more cash to spend because of increased money paid by new shareholders if the company sets the price too high then the share subscription might only be partially filled so there might not be enough cash to do what the company wanted you can buy a share from another shareholder this is more common when you see the company 's share price on the stock exchange it is this type of transaction buying out other current shareholders the price here is simply set based on what current owners are willing to sell at the bid price listed by an exchange is the current highest bid that a purchaser is offering for a single share the ask price is the current lowest offer that a seller is offering to sell a single share they currently own when the bid price = the ask price a share transaction happens and the most recent stock price changes

at no point is it ever a good idea to stop making payments to show them you mean business when you signed up for the credit card account you agreed to pay what you charged and any applicable interested accrued on the accounts you are legally responsible for that debt and you can be sued if they are so inclined many times settlement agencies are employed because a risk assessment operator or whatever they 're called at your cc company calculated that they are currently financially better off settling for a reduced balance than attempting to chase you for the full amount as soon as the terms of your refinance hits your credit history that changes to reiterate and make it clear this is a very dangerous approach to breaking credit card debt and i would not advise that anybody proceed with it edit if you offer 50 of the balance in a lump sum payment they decline and you continue with non payment they have reason to believe that you are financially capable of making payments and are much more likely to seek legal action

summary it 's because you are effectively contributing more money in the second case so you have more money at the end   the effect of being covered by an employer retirement plan in the case of a 401(k that means either you or your employer contributed to it during the year is that it prevents you from deducting traditional ira contributions unless your income is below a very low level for single filing status it phases out at an magi of between $ and $ since you are unable to deduct the traditional ira contribution but you entered that you are still making the full $ 5500 contribution every year that means you are making a non deductible contribution of $ 5500 every year instead of a deductible contribution nondeductible contributions are after tax whereas deductible contributions are pre tax because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of the contribution so you effectively do n't pay income tax on the income you used to contribute $ 1 of pre tax money is not the same as $ 1 of after tax money if your marginal tax rate is 25 then $ 1 of pre tax money is equivalent to $ 0.75 of after tax money however since in both cases you are putting in the same nominal amount of contribution $ 5500 but one is pre tax and one is after tax in the after tax case you are effectively contributing more money i.e. more money is taken out from your bank account that year the $ 5500 pre tax contribution is equivalent to only $ 5500 0.75 = $ after tax i.e. you are only short $ from your bank account at the end of the year after making a $ 5500 deductible contribution whereas you are short $ 5500 after making a $ 5500 non deductible contribution so it 's not a fair comparison the non deductible traditional ira contributions are not taxed when withdrawn though the earnings earned from those contributions are still taxed so that 's why you are left with a greater amount this is a similar situation to what happens when you try to compare a $ 5500 deductible traditional ira contribution to a $ 5500 roth ira contribution it will look like the roth ira case leaves you with much more money but that 's again because you are effectively contributing more money because the roth ira contribution is after tax so it 's not a fair comparison the roth ira case will produce a much greater advantage than the non deductible traditional ira contribution case because for a roth ira both the contributions and earnings will not be taxed at withdrawal

i think also by insurance from other the risk gets spread around and these guys actually know what they are doing i 've heard insurers sometimes do n't using really rough thumb rules like buy 2 cats and end up with suboptimal reinsurance policies but they always make sure they are covered the have a better idea of what the risk is and can outsmart the insurers when they sell the reinsurance policies    expanding on the 2 cat thing insurers need to keep enough reserves + reinsurance to cover everything the gist is if they buy 2 catastrophe insurance then the will cover losses over 2 of the portfolio so the insurers only need to cover the first 2 of their portfolio it might be a bit more complicated than this of course   they might be better keeping higher reserves than 2 self insuring more buying less re insurance or they might be better keeping less than 2 reserves and self insuring less buying more re insurance it depends on the price they negotiate with the re insurer whatever the case they have to make sure that they can cover any disaster and the government will regulate this or end up getting pressured to fund bail outs as insurers go bankrupt and home owners are left with nothing

having a good dividend yield does n't guarantee that a stock is safe in the future the company may run into financial trouble stop paying dividends or even go bankrupt for this reason you should never buy a stock just because it has a high dividend yield you also need some criteria to determine whether that stock is safe to buy personally i consider a stock is reasonably safe if it meets the following criteria

is this a reasonable goal or will it be impossible to get a loan with    my almost non existent income i know i can put estimated rental revenue as income but i 'm not sure    if i would qualify banks typically only count rental income after you 've been collecting it for two years and at that point the banks will count 75 of it as income for loan qualification purposes   you 'd have to qualify for the mortgage without the potential rental income currently that means a 43 debt including proposed mortgage to gross income ratio even if you qualify you have to be prepared to handle repairs hvac water heater could fail on day 1 and tenants have a right to withhold rent if some repairs are n't made you also have to be able to weather non payment eviction of a tenant you could find a co maybe go in on a house with a friend but there are risks and complications that can arise there if a party becomes unable to pay or deciding how to split equity and expenses   if you had the income capital to comfortably pull it off without tenants then that 'd be a great situation college rentals tend to be lucrative i 'd recommend getting tenants with parental co signers to reduce risk if you qualify but would be in trouble quickly if one tenant stopped paying or a major appliance needed to be replaced then it 's probably not worth the risk

why would you want to withdraw only the company match and presumably leave your personal contributions sitting in your ex company 's 401k plan generally 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an ira so unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to and you think those investments are where you want your money to be roll over part or all of your 401k assets into an ira and withdraw the rest for personal expenses   if your personal contributions are in a roth 401k roll them over to a roth ira but as i remember it company contributions are not part of the roth 401k and must be rolled over into a traditional ira perhaps this is why you want to take those in cash to pay for your personal purchase also what is this 30 hit you are talking about you will owe income tax on the money withdrawn from the 401k and custodians traditionally withhold 20 and send it to the irs on your behalf plus penalty for early withdrawal which the custodian may also withhold if you ask them but the tax that you will pay on the money withdrawn will depend on your tax bracket which may be lower if you are laid off and do not immediately take on a new job that is the 30 hit may be on the cash flow but you may get some of it back as a refund when you file your income tax return

a is a promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action every company must do a balancing act while declaring the dividends in terms of companies interest can it use the surplus cash to generate more revenue to shareholders interests giving back to them the profits that due many countries have regulations governing as to when and how much the dividends may be given it also lays out the policy about declaring dividends to protect everyones interest for example if the company has a huge suit pending against it the company is not supposed to distribute the surplus cash as dividends and when the suit goes against it its left when no money to pay or other such examples where the interests of one or the other party is compromised the company law board ensures that all this is to in a fair manner so essentially these covenants include provisions about passing dividends means that due diligence has be exercised by the company in order to arrive at the dividends that are to be paid out

i think you are trying to figure out what will be a break even rental rate for you so that then you can decide whether renting at current market rates is worth it for you this is tricky to determine because future valuations are uncertain you can make rough estimates though the most uncertain component is likely to be capital appreciation or depreciation increase or decrease in the value of your property this is usually a relatively large number significant to the calculation the value is uncertain because it depends on predictions of the housing market future interest rates or economic conditions will likely play a major role in dictating the future value of your home obviously there are numerous other costs to consider such as maintenance tax and insurance some of which may be via escrow and included in your mortgage payment largest uncertainty in terms of income are the level of rent and occupancy rate the former is reasonably predictable the latter less so   would advise you make a spreadsheet and list them all out with margins of error to get some idea the absolute amount you are paying on the mortgage is a red herring similar to when car dealers ask you what payment you can afford that 's not what 's relevant what 's relevant is the net present value of all the payments in relation to what you are getting in return note that one issue with assessing your cost of capital is what 's your opportunity cost ie if you did n't have the money tied up in real estate what could you be earning with it elsewhere this is not really part of the cost of capital but it 's something to consider also note that the total monthly payment for the mortgage is not useful to your calculations because a significant chunk of the payment will likely be to pay down principal and as such represents no real cost to you its really just a transfer reducing your bank balance but increasing your equity in the home the interest portion is a real cost to you

you want to know if you should pay cash or use a credit card like cash there are so many benefits to the card like purchase protection cash back and postponed payments that there needs to be a really good reason to pay cash   if you are concerned about the 10 threshold ask your credit card company to raise your limit   if you are indifferent let the merchant decide for you by asking for a discount if you pay cash   the biggest reason is that credit cards when handled make your money work for you by keeping it in less liquid higher interest investments like inflation adjusted t bills you will still be able to access it by using the credit card to float large expenses without liquidating at a loss investment accounts like schwab one are great for this since you can borrow cash at a low interest rate against your securities until your security sale clears

the current mortgaged owner would typically not have the right to sell any portion of the house without approval from the bank the bank does n't own the house through the mortgage but they do have a series of rights that in some cases look similar to ownership   remember that a mortgage is just a loan that uses a house as collateral to reduce the risk to the lender in the event of default if it was just a personal loan without collateral then there would be a much higher risk of default and therefore the interest rate would be closer to 20 than 2 but because the loan was taken with collateral that collateral ca n't be sold without the bank 's permission if the bank allowed this to happen then one risk would be exactly as you say that the mortgagee stops paying the bank and the bank no longer is able to recover the full value of the loan on selling the remaining 50 of the house owed as collateral

alright bud i 'm sure you 're a smart and nice person who just wants people to earn as much as they possibly can at least i hope you are so let 's look at it logically    you are suggesting people that are unskilled uneducated lack the ability to negotiate in their favor and a government law must be placed to help them however the effect of a higher minimum wage means you now force that very individual to compete with more people for that same position this is because there 's not a lot of competition for a job that pays say $ because skilled people do n't apply to them the higher you set that minimum wage like the livable wage of $ 15/hr that i hear so much about the more skilled people will apply to these positions because they now pay more what makes you think an unskilled uneducated individual will be able to find employment in this competitive environment you are assuming that people earning minimum wage today will continue earning a minimum wage even if a higher minimum wage law is passed    also remember that employment goes both ways just as a potential employee has the freedom to walk away from a wage he does n't like an employer is free to not hire an employee for a given wage an employer does not hire personnel that provides value less than the wage paid because that employee now costs the employer to keep him retained so when you enforce a minimum wage which states an employer must at a minimum pay a certain wage you forcibly fire all the employees that do not merit that wage you effectively take away the 1 bargaining chip unskilled and uneducated individuals can offer which is offering to work for lower wages

yes it is possible as long as the broker you use allows conditional orders i use cmc markets in australia and they allow free conditional orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock see the place new order box below   once you have selected a stock to buy the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders the first condition is a place order if conditional order here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first   say the stock last traded at $ and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at $ 10.00 so you would place order if price is at or above $ 10.00 so if the next day the price moves up to $ 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market the second condition is a stop loss conditional order here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price it will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded so if you wanted to place your stop loss at $ 9.00 you would type in 9.00 in the box after if at or below and select if you want a limit or market order the third condition is a take profit conditional order this allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price say you wanted to take profits at 50 that is if the price reached $ 15.00 so you would type in 15.00 in the box after if at or above and again select if you want a limit or market order these conditional orders can all be placed at the time you enter your buy order and can be edited or deleted at any time the broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional orders and some brokers may have many more conditional orders than these three so investigate what is out there and if you are confused in how to use the orders with your broker simply ask them for a demonstration in how to use them

the principle of demand supply law will not work if spoofing or fake order is implemented however spoofing stocks is an illegal criminal practice   monitored by sec in stock market aggressive buyer are willing to pay for a higher ask price pushing the price higher even if ask size is considerably larger than bid size especially when high growth potential with time is expected larger bids may attract more buyers further a price increase positive pile on effect aggressive sellers are willing to accept a lower bid price pushing the price lower even if ask size is considerably smaller than bid size when a negative situation is expected larger asks may attract more sellers further a price fall negative pile on effect   moreover seller and buyers considers not only price but also size of shares in their decision making process along with marker order and/or limit order unlike limit order market order is not recorded in bid ask size market order but not limit order immediately affects the price direction thus ask bid sizes alone do not give enough information on price direction if stocks are being sold continuously at the bid price this could be the beginning of a downward trend if stocks are being sold continuously at the ask price this could be the beginning of a upward trend   this is because ask price is always higher than bid price in all the cases both buyers and sellers hope to make a profit in a long term and short term view

check is an obligation to pay and is in the us checks do n't expire there are countries where they do endorsements such as void after x days are meaningless and do n't affect the obligation to pay the bank is under no obligation to honor a check that is more than 6 months old based on the date on the check of course this is from the unified commercial code 4 404 however this refers to the bank not to the person who gave you the check the bank may pay if the check is deposited in good faith and there 's nothing wrong with it or with the account so the first thing you can do is deposit the check if asked you can say that the person just wrote the wrong date which is true worst case the check bounces if the check bounces you can start with demand letters and small claim courts the obligation to pay does n't go away unless satisfied i.e. paid

form w-9 officially the request for taxpayer identification number and certification is used in the united states income tax system by a third party who must file an information return with the internal revenue service irs it requests the name address and taxpayer identification information of a taxpayer in the form of a social security number or employer identification number a w-9 is typically required when an individual is doing work as a contractor or as an employee for a company and will be paid more than $ 600 in a tax year   the company is required to file a w-2 or a 1099 and so requests a w-9 to get the information necessary for those forms i can not say if it is incompetence on the part of the accounting department or a deliberate ploy to make the refund process more onerous but do not comply   politely on a refund without any further information   if the company refuses request a charge back from the credit card company file a complaint with the consumer protection department of the state where the company is located and write a bad review on yelp or wherever else seems appropriate

it 's pretty simple   increase banks ability to lend for     a. mortgages     b. small businesses   banks have tremendous quantities of cash trapped on their balance sheets that should be deployed into the economy where it generates growth jobs and strengthens the middle class    improve infrastructure    our infrastructure is in and improving it will generate growth and something to show for the massive debt load we 've accumulated for our nation    repatriation holiday this capital needs to be working in our economy increase taxes   the massive flood of liquidity we 've seen from the fed what we should be seeing released from banks and then what we should see from corporations cash will need to move through the economy and and going to work then taxed reducing deficits and eventually liquidity raise interest rates   in that order    capital moves through the market at different rates and i 'm usually for lower taxes but it is n't always the solution    lower taxes reduced regulation and low interest rates are all different ways of increasing liquidity but should be increased reduced at different parts of the economic cycle    dimon is right about washington this is bullshit

when you add points a break even date comes into play that date varies depending on the rate and number of points as an approximate example having one point at those rates would have a break even point of about 5 years at that time the amount you save with the lower rate makes up for the extra cash you paid for points after that you are saving money if you do n't plan on having the loan that long the points are not worth it also you need to calculate the break even date based on your own parameters i suggest searching for an online calculator or spreadsheet that supports point calculations you may also be able to deduct of your points every year ask you accountant about that

the incentives go all the way up the chain   in atlanta staff and administrators stole the tests and changed answers   even besides the incentive problems student test scores were not designed to measure teacher performance   you get these crazy schemes where teachers in non tested subjects are having fifty percent of their evaluation based on the average of teachers in a basket of similar classes that some funded consultant from his office   it 's absurd

well no because the auto dealers are n't on the hook are they they 've the loans onto some investment vehicle somewhere out in the ether        let 's be clear this all nets a massive loss the car has already depreciated by 50 of the retail value plus you have the costs of recovery and the margin of the guy who 's going to re sell it and what did you gain you squeezed a fraction of the price of the car out of the lender who was making minimum repayments before he defaulted       the upshot is that someone just bought a lot of cars that are now worth less than what they paid for them who 's going to take the hit wells and fargo

this question is predicated on the assumption that investors prefer dividends as this depends on who you 're speaking to   some investors prefer growth stocks some which do n't pay dividends so in this case we 're covering the percent of investors who like dividend paying stocks it depends on who you ask and it also depends on how self aware they are because some people may give reasons that make little financial sense   the two major benefits that i hear are fundamentally psychological dividends are like mini paychecks   since people get a from receiving a paycheck i would predict the same holds true for receiving dividends   more than likely the brain feels a reward when getting dividends even if the dividend stock performs lower than a growth stock for a decade the experience of receiving dividends may feel more rewarding plus depending on the institution they may get a report or see the tax information for the year and that also feels good some value investors do n't reinvest dividends as they believe the price of the stock matters stocks are either cheap or expensive and automatic reinvestment to these investors implies that the price of a stock does n't matter so dividends allow them to rebuild their cash after a buy   they can either buy more shares if the stock is cheap or keep the cash if the stock is expensive   think about warren buffett here he purchased $ 3 billion worth of shares of wells fargo at approximately $ 8 12 a share in 2009 from my memory as people were shocked that be bought into a bank when no one liked banks   consider how much money he makes from dividends off that purchase alone and if he were to currently believe wells fargo was overpriced he could keep the cash and buy something else he believes is cheaper   in these cases dividends automatically build cash post buying and many value investors believe that one should always have cash on hand this second point is a little tricky because it can involve risk assessment some investors believe that high dividend paying stocks like mo wo n't experience the huge declines of indexes like the spy   mo routed the spy in 2009 29 vs. 19 and these investors believe that 's because it 's yield was too desired it feels safer to them the index side would argue but what happens in the long run   the problem i have with this argument which is frequent is that it does n't hold true for every high yield stock though some high yield stocks do show strong resistance levels during bear markets

i am sure favoritism has a role to play in promotions i do n't know if the mit research controlled for like ability the point to the research though i think is that when managers see someone show up at work and stay for the full day that creates the illusion that someone is productive regardless of what they might actually be doing

yes they are and you 've experienced why generally speaking stocks that pay dividends will be better investments than stocks that do n't   here 's why 1 they 're actually making money they can balance sheets and news releases but cash is cash it tells no lies they ca n't fake it    2 there 's less good they can do with that money than they say when a business you own is making money they can do two things with it reinvest it into the company or hand it over to you all companies must reinvest to some degree but only a few companies worth owning can find profitable ways of reinvesting all of it having to hand you the owner some of the earnings helps keep that money from leaking away on such necessities like corporate jets expensive printer paper or ill conceived corporate buyouts       3 it helps you not freak out markets go up and markets go down if you own a good company that 's giving you a nice check every three months it 's a lot easier to not panic sell in a downturn after all they 're handing you a nice check every three months and checks are cash and cash tells no lies you know they 're still a good company and you can ride it out     4 it helps others not freak out see 3 that applies to everyone that in turn means market downturns weigh less heavily on companies paying solid dividends than on those that do not   5 it gives you some of the reward of investing in good companies without having to sell those companies if you 've got a piece of a good solid profitable growing company why on earth would you want to sell it   but you 'd like to see some rewards from making that wise investment would n't you      6 dividends can grow solid growing companies produce more and more earnings which means they can hand you more and more cash via the dividend which means that if say they reliably raise dividends that measly 3 dividend turns into a 6 dividend seven years later on your initial investment at year 14 it 's 12 year 21 24 see where this is going companies like that do exist google dividend   7 dividends make growth less important if you owned a company that paid you a 10 dividend every year but never grew an inch would you care how about 5 and it grows only slowly   you invest in companies not dividends you invest in companies to make money dividends are a useful tool when you invest to gauge company value to smooth your ride and to give you some of the profit of the business you own they are however only part of the total return from investing as you found out
