it actually depends on the services provided if you 're renting through airbnb you 're likely to provide much more services to the tenants than a traditional rental it may raise it to a level when it is no longer a passive activity see here for starters providing substantial services    if you provide substantial services    that are primarily for your tenant 's convenience such as regular    cleaning changing linen or maid service you report your rental    income and expenses on schedule c form 1040 profit or loss from    business or schedule c ez form 1040 net profit from business use    form 1065 u.s. return of partnership income if your rental activity    is a partnership including a partnership with your spouse unless it    is a qualified joint venture substantial services do not include the    furnishing of heat and light cleaning of public areas trash    collection etc for information see publication 334 tax guide for    small business also you may have to pay self employment tax on your    rental income using schedule se form 1040 self employment tax for    a discussion of substantial services see real estate rents in    publication 334 chapter 5

there 's no tax difference between using airbnb or craigslist or any other method to find tenants the rules relating to occupancy and frequency may be different for some purposes if you go from yearly or monthly tenants to daily rate tenants   your state and local authorities may in the future try to consider you a motel or bed n breakfast equivalent and subject you to various regulations and business taxes   but the method of finding customers itself is probably not meaningful for tax purposes

given your clarifying comment that you 're asking about the length of stay rather than airbnb in particular i 'd say there is a decent chance there will be tax differences   the difference is unlikely to be in income tax but many cities have local ordinances that impose transaction taxes on short stays   for instance the town where i live has a transient occupancy tax for any paid stay of less than 31 days unfortunately because these taxes are often levied by individual cities it 's hard to know whether one applies in your case   one town may impose no tax while the town right next to it does impose a tax   you 'll have to look at what your local laws are   this could be easy if your town has a nice comprehensive website about local laws if not you may have to do some deeper research in any case you should definitely look into it since there could be if there is a tax and the city finds out you 're not paying it   as airbnb has grown in popularity many municipalities have begun to crack down on airbnb renters who try to make money without paying taxes like a regular motel as well as conforming to other laws e.g. running a business in a neighborhood residential

you can if the market is open in a normal trading phase no auction phase works and there is an existing bid or offer on the product you want to trade at the time the market learns of your order keep in mind there are 2 prices bid and offer if the current bid and current offer were the same it would immediately result in a trade and thus the bid and offer are no longer the same market makers are paid given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices called quotes at most times these conditions are usually all true but commonly fail for these reasons most markets have an order type of market order that says buy sell at any price there are still sanity checks put in place on the price with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock so unless it 's a penny stock you wo n't suddenly pay ten times a stock 's value the amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer if there is a bid or offer the quantity is always at least 1

all the time for high volume stocks it may be tough to see exactly what 's going on e.g. the bid ask may be moving faster than your connection to the broker can show you   what i 've observed is with options the volume on some options is measured in the 10 's or 100 's of contracts in a day i 'll see a case where it 's $ bid ask and by offering $ 1.90 will often see a fill at that price since i may be the only trade on that option in the 15 minute period and note that the stock was n't moving more than a penny during that time i know that it was my order that managed to fill between the bid ask

ordinarily a stock split increases all shareholders share counts so that there is no change in anybody 's voting power   for example if you owned 1 of the company before the split after the split you now have twice as many shares but there are now twice as many shares outstanding so you still own 1 of the company   also stock splits are not ordinarily triggered   usually they happen when the board decides that for one reason or another it 's desirable to increase the number of shares in circulation which causes the price of each share to decrease proportionally    i 'm not familiar with the show and in particular i do n't know what the action is that the character being addressed is thinking of taking but it sounds like they are describing something akin to a poison pill   in these arrangements the pill is triggered by some predefined condition say a party acquiring shares in excess of a defined threshold   what typically happens is that shareholders other than the ones who triggered the pill get a chance to buy shares at a substantial discount thereby diluting the shares of the party that triggered it   because the other shareholders have to buy their additional shares albeit at a discount and because it applies only to certain shares it 's not really a split but it 's close enough that the writers of the show may have felt it was worth using the term that is more familiar to the public

the par value is a technicality that you can ignore in this case and it has nothing directly to do with the merger   when a company issues stock it puts a par value on the shares   if it later issues more shares they can not be issued at less than par value the rest of the notice seems to be as you said if you hold until the merger takes effect they are going to give you $ and your shares will be gone   as always you can try to sell on the open market before that time instead although you can bet that not too many people are going to want to give you more than $ at this point

you asked specifically about the roth ira option and stated you want to get the most bang for your buck in retirement   while others have pointed out the benefits of a tax deduction due to using a traditional ira instead i have n't seen anyone point out some of the other differences between roth and traditional such as i agree with your thoughts on using an ira once you maximize the company match into a 401k plan    my reasoning is i personally prefer etfs over mutual funds for the ability to get in and out with limit stop or oco orders at open or anytime mid day if needed   however the price for that flexibility is that you risk discounts to nav for etfs that you would n't have with the equivalent mutual fund   said another way you may find yourself selling your etf for less than the holdings are actually worth   personally i value the ability to exit positions at the time of my choosing more highly than the impact of tracking error on nav also as a final comment to your plan if it were me i 'd personally pay off the student loans with any money i had after contributing enough to my employer 401k to maximize matching   the net effect of paying down the loans is a guaranteed avg 5.3 annually given what you 've said whereas any investments in 401k or ira are at risk and have no such guarantee   in fact with there being reasonable arguments that this has been an excessively long bull market you might figure your chances of a 5.3 or better return are pretty low for new money put into an ira or 401k today   that said i 'm long on stocks still but then i do n't have debt besides my mortgage at the moment   if i were n't so conservative i 'd be looking to maximize my leverage in the continued low rate environment

putting debt out long means to borrow a sum of money paid back over a longer period of time than you could reasonably pay it back it should be important to note that this advice only applies for fixed rate loans meaning your rate ca n't change for the life of the loan without you explicitly changing it   the logic is that if you can borrow money when interest rates are really low there is a good chance you can find an investment that has a return higher than the interest rate on the loan it also means that when if interest rates go up in the future a simple savings account may even have a greater return than your loans interest the advice suggests to borrow over a long period so you are paying less interest per payment and gives you time to find a proper investment without having to pay too much interest during that time

this is known as zone pricing or geographical pricing such price variations may seem odd but they are not unique to on any given day in any major u.s. city a single brand of gasoline will sell for a wide range of prices even when the cost to make and deliver the fuel is the same the primary culprit is zone pricing a secret and pervasive oil company strategy to boost profits by charging dealers different amounts for fuel based on traffic volume station amenities nearby household incomes the strength of competitors and other factors it 's a controversial strategy but the courts have thus far deemed it legal and the federal trade commission recently said the effect on consumers was ambiguous because some customers got hurt by higher prices while others benefited from lower ones zone pricing as practiced in the gasoline industry in the united states is the pricing of gasoline based on a complex and secret weighting of factors such as the number of competing stations number of vehicles average traffic flow population density and geographic characteristics this can result in two branded gas stations only a few miles apart selling gasoline at a price differential of as much as $ 0.50 per gallon but the short answer is because they can it 's legal provided that some people are paying less while others are paying more essentially the larger richer audience is subsidizing the product for other areas it 's not terribly different than the way most drugs are priced in the world

theory of levered investing borrowing in order to increase investment exposure is a time honored and legitimate activity   it 's the optimal way to increase your exposure according to finance theory which assumes you get a good interest rate more on this later   in your case it may or may not be a good idea   based on the information in your post i believe that in your case it is not a good idea   consider the following concerns risk in finance reward comes with risk and in no other way   investing borrowed money means there is a good not small chance that you will lose enough money that you will need to pull significant wealth from your own savings in order to make up the difference   if you are in a position to do this and ok with that possibility then proceed to to the next concern   if losing a lot of money means financial calamity for you then this is a bad idea   you have n't described your financial situation so i do n't know in which camp you fall   if the idea of losing say $ 100 k means complete financial failure for you then the strategy you have described simply has too much risk make no mistake just because the market makes money on average does not mean it will make money or as much money as you expect over your horizon   it may lose money perhaps a lot of money make sure this idea is very clear in your mind before taking action rewards your post implies that you think you can reliably get on an investment this is not the case   there are many years in which a reasonable portfolio makes this much or more but on average you will earn less no ones knows the true long term market risk premium but it is definitely less than 10   a better guess would be 6.5 plus whatever the risk free rate is currently about 0   buying riskier investments means from the optimal portfolio meaning you took on more risk than is justified by how much extra money you expect to make   i never encourage people to invest based on optimistic or unrealistic goals   if anything you should be conservative about how you expect things to go   and remember these are averages any portfolio that earns also has a very good chance of losing 25 or more   people who sell or give advice on investments frequently get you charged up by pointing at times and investments that have done very well   unfortunately we never know whether the investments and time period in which we are investing will be a good one a bad one or an one   the reality of investing is well more realistic than what you have described costs i ca n't imagine how you could borrow that much money and only have an annual payment of $ 2000 as you imply that must be a mistake   no individual borrows at a rate significantly below 1   it sounds like it 's not a collateralized loan of any kind so unless you are some kind of prime loan customer your interest rate will be significant   subtract whatever rate you actually pay from 6.5 to get a rough idea of how much you will make if things go as well as they do on average   you will pay the interest whether times are good or bad if your rate is typical of personal loans there 's a good chance you will lose money on average using the strategy you have described   if you are ok with taking risk with a negative expected return consider a trip to las vegas   it 's more exciting ethics i 'm not one to make people feel guilty for doing things that are legal but of questionable morality   if that 's the case and you are ok with it more power to you i 'm not sure under what pretense you expect to obtain the money but it sounds like you might be crossing legal lines and committing actual crimes like fraud   make sure to check on whether what you intend is a white lie or something that can get you thrown in prison for example if you are proposing obtaining a subsidized education loan and using it for speculation i could easily see you spending serious time in prison and permanently ruining your life even if your plan works out   a judge and 12 of your peers are not going to think welfare fraud is a harmless twist of the truth summary i 've said a lot of negative things here   this is because i have to guess about your financial situation and it sounds like you may have unrealistic expectations of the safety and generosity of investing   quite frankly people for whom borrowing $ 250 k is no big deal do n't normally come and ask about it on stackexchange and they definitely do n't tend to lie in order to get loans   also $ 18 k a year does n't change their quality of life however i do n't know   if $ 250 k is small relative to your wealth and you need a good way to increase your exposure to the market risk premium then borrowing and investing may well be a good idea

if you have enough money to buy a car in full that probably means you have good credit if you have good credit car dealerships will often offer 0 loans for either a small period of time like 12 months or the entire loan taking a 0 loan is obviously more optimal than paying the entire lump sum up front you can take the money and invest in other things that earn you more than 0 however most dealerships offer a rebate or a 0 loan some commenters below claim that the rebate is usually larger than the saved interest so definitely do the math if you have that option

so there is no truly correct way to calculate return   professionals will often calculate many different rates of return depending on what they wish to understand about their portfolio   however the two most common ways of calculating multi period return though are time weighted return and money weighted return i 'll leave the details to this good article but the big picture is time weighted returns help you understand how the stock performed during the period in question independent of how you invested it it   whereas money weighted return helps you understand how you performed investing in the stock in question   from your question it appears both methods would be useful in combination to help you evaluate your portfolio both methods should be fairly easy to calculate yourself in a spread sheet but if you are interested there are plenty of examples of both in google docs on the web

so people deposit money with you you agree to pay them fixed back and then you invest money for your own profit sounds like a bank to me   or a dividend paying mutual fund or a number of other similar ideas   sure you 're welcome to start something like that up it 's unlikely you 'd get money from people unless you had already proved yourself competent as an investor though   after all if it 's possible to get a safe comfortable 5 why would anyone give you money at 2 or 3 instead of just getting that 5 for themselves   or more likely finding a competitor who gives 4.9 as in most things the market will find inefficiencies like this and squash them like bugs    that said there are some opportunities that take advantage of other kinds of situations   the most common i 'd say is owning a home   you take out a mortgage for 80 of the value of the home instead of buying it outright and you instead invest the 80 in the market   you likely will beat your mortgage rate given the current rates   that 's effectively doing the same thing with an expense you 'd have anyway you always have to live somewhere since it 's a secured loan you get better rates than the market will give as it 's quite safe and you can use tax laws in your favor mortgage interest deduction in particular and the capital gains break on primary residences

if you 're truly ready to pay an extra $ 1000 every month and are confident you 'll likely always be able to you should refinance to a 15 year mortgage 15 year mortgages are typically sold at around a half a point lower interest rates meaning that instead of your apr you 'll get something like apr   that 's a lot of money over the course of the mortgage   you 'll end up paying around a thousand a month more so exactly what you 're thinking of doing and not only save money from that earlier payment but also have a lower interest rate   that 0.5 means something like $ 25k less over the life of the mortgage   it 's also the difference in about $ 130 or so a month in your required payment now of course you 'll be locked into making that larger payment so the difference between what you 're suggesting and this is that you 're paying an extra $ 25k in exchange for the ability to pay it off more slowly in which case you 'd also pay more interest obviously but in the best case scenario   in the 15 year scenario you must make those payments   in the 30 year scenario you can pay for a while if you lose your job or want to go on vacation or whatever of course the reverse is also true you 'll have to make the payments so you will   many people find enforced savings to be a good strategy myself among them i have a 15 year mortgage and am happy that i have to make the higher payment because it means i ca n't spend that extra money frivolously so what i 'd do if i were you is shop around for a 15 year refi   it 'll cost a few grand so do n't take one unless you can save at least half a point but if you can do

generally for tax questions you should talk to a tax adviser do n't consider anything i write here as a tax advice and the answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer does irs like one payment method over other or they simply do n't care    as long as she can show the receipts they do n't care as long as she withholds the taxes 30 unless specific arrangements are made for otherwise she should withhold 30 of the payment and send it to the irs the recipient should claim refund if the actual tax liability is lower it 's only consulting work at the moment so most of the communication    is done over phone should they start engaging in written    communication to keep records of the work done yes if she wants it to be a business expense is it okay to pay in one go to save money transferring fees can she    pay in advance again she can do whatever she wants but if she wants to account for it on her tax returns she should do it the same way she would pay any other vendor in her business she can not use different accounting methods for different vendors basically she has not outsourced work in previous years and she    wants to avoid any red flags then she should start by calling on her tax adviser and not an anonymous internet forum

i 'm not going to tackle the 2nd part of your question as any number of the questions tagged with international transfer should cover you on that there 's no way to transfer an isa into an australian tax free savings account so no need to worry about anything special there do n't forget that the fx rates change quite a bit over time and different methods have varying fees so moving at the wrong time could easily cost you more than the missed interest for the first part it depends one thing you should seriously consider right away is switching your isa money into one paying a better rate check the best buy tables online or in a paper as you can get a lot better than 0.1 on a transfer in even with current depressed rates at least that way you 'll earn more interest while you decide as for when to transfer that 's something you 'll have to calculate for yourself based on your marginal tax rate and your view of how the fx rates will shift if you 're a 40 taxpayer then 2 in an isa is worth the same to you as 3.3 gross do n't forget to consider both your uk and australian tax rates in the year you move as most likely you 'll have to pay the higher of the two the westpac rate looks like you might struggle to beat a decent isa over the course of a year were you a higher rate tax payer oh and do n't forget that you 'll likely loose the tax free status of your isa once you 're an australian tax resident so you 'll need to start paying tax on interest in the isa once you 're out there

your question is based on incorrect assumptions generally there 's no penalty per se to make a withdrawal from your rrsp even if you make a withdrawal earlier than retirement however you define it a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant our u.s. neighbours have a 10 penalty on non hardship early withdrawals before age 59 half from retirement accounts like the 401k and ira it 's an additional measure designed to discourage early withdrawals and raise more tax   yet in canada there is no similar penalty individual investments inside your rrsp may have associated penalties such as the dreaded deferred sales charge of some back end loaded mutual funds or such as funds that generated additional special tax credits that could get clawed back   yet these early withdrawal penalties are distinct from the rrsp nature of your account   choose your investments carefully to avoid these kinds of surprises rather an rrsp is a tax deferred account and it works like this   the government allows you to claim a nice juicy tax deduction which can reduce your income tax at your marginal rate in the year you make a contribution or later if you should choose to defer the deduction the resulting pre tax money accumulated in your rrsp benefits from further tax deferral assets can grow without attracting annual income tax on earned interest dividends or capital gains you do n't need to declare on your income tax return any of the income earned inside your rrsp unlike a regular investment account here 's the rub once you decide to withdraw money from your rrsp the entire amount withdrawn is considered regular income in the year in which you make the withdrawal   thus your withdrawals are subject to income tax and yes at your marginal rate   this is always the case whether before or after retirement you mentioned two special programs the home buyers plan hbp and the lifelong learning plan llp   neither the hbp nor the llp permit tax free withdrawals   rather each of these programs are special kinds of loans that you can borrow from your own rrsp hbp and llp loan money is n't taxed when you get it because you are required to pay it back and you pay it back into your own rrsp you always pay income tax at your marginal rate on your rrsp withdrawals above i said a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant   yet there are ages that matter   by the end of the year in which you turn 71 you are required to convert your rrsp to a it 's similar but you can no longer contribute and you must withdraw a minimum amount each year other circumstances related to age may qualify for minor tax relief intended for retirees such as the age amount or the pension income credit   generally such measures do n't significantly change the fact that you pay income tax on rrsp withdrawals at your marginal rate these measures raise the minimum you can take out without attracting tax but most do nothing at the margin exception one might split eligible pension income with a spouse or common law partner which may reduce tax at the margin

fees liabilities yes the first problem is that liabilities are being improperly booked if the fee you charge is fixed upon deposit then the fee should credit revenue the fee charged to you should be booked by crediting cash and then debiting expenses and the remaining should be booked as a liability if the fee is fixed upon withdrawal then this will become more complex because of the fact that a change in the fee can occur before it can be applied   in this case the current fee should be credited as revenue and some allowance for fee increase should also be credited   the amount owed to the should be booked as a liability as before multiple currency bookings i will assume that this is for a cryptocurrency service of some sort considering the comments in your question and your presence on accounting can become very dangerous when mixing denominations   this is why all major accounting standards mandate books be maintained single currency in your case if the deposit is in usd for example and the liability is in btc then two books must be maintained one for each to account for your operation properly using single currency accounts the denominations must be exchanged internally and balanced across the two sets of books for a deposit of btc depository of usd the operation would be the same as described above but then the cash should be credited away and the liabilities debited away from the usd books with simultaneous cash debits and liability credits on the btc books considering the extreme volatility of cryptocurrency exchange rates accounts on the wrong set of books will quickly lead to insolvency or loss from improper accounting or both from revenue to income revenue can be construed as a liability since it could theoretically exist on the balance sheet i mention this because all books despite their name and quarter are really simply long t accounts like a blockchain   a blockchain could be into users individual income statements balance sheets as the reverse of this concept revenues are credited expenses are debited   the difference net income is debited away with a credit to owners equity

a quick excel calculation tells me that if you are earning a guaranteed post tax return of 12 in a liquid investment then it does n't matter which one you pick according to the following excel formula you would be able to invest now at 12 interest and you could withdraw every month for 24 months   which means that the option and the option are essentially the same this of course is depending on that 12 guaranteed return   where i come from this type of investment is unheard of   if i was sure i 'd still be using the same service two years from now i would choose the payment option you asked in the comments how to change the formula to account for risk in the investment   risk is a hard thing to quantify   however if you are certain that you will be using this service in two years from now you are essentially achieving 13 in a guaranteed return by pre paying your fee   in my experience a 13 guaranteed return is worth taking   trying to achieve any more than that in an investment is simply a gamble that having been said at the amount we are talking about each percent difference in return is only about   the biggest risk here is the fact that you might want to change services before your term is up   if these amounts are relatively small for you then if there is any chance at all that you will want to drop the service before the 2 years is up just pay the monthly fee

on reading couple of articles some research over internet i got to know about diversified investment where one should invest 70 in equity related rest 30 in debt related funds yes that is about right although the recommendation keeps varying a bit however your first investment should not aim for diversification putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues my suggestion would be to start with an index eft or large cap then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc   on this site we do n't advise on specific funds you can refer to or or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly ps rather than buying paper buy it electronic better you can now buy it as demat if you already have an demat account it would be best to buy through it

this answer is better served as a comment but i do n't have enough rep   it is not guaranteed that they do not accrue interest while you are a full time student some student loans can capitalize the interest before pursuing leveraged investing be sure that your student loan is not capitalizing capitalized interest capitalized interest is a second reason your loan may end up costing    more than the amount you originally borrowed interest starts to accrue grow from the day your loan is disbursed    sent to you or your school at certain points in time when your    separation or grace period ends or at the end of forbearance or    deferment your unpaid interest may capitalize that means it is added    to your loan ’s current principal from that point your interest will    now be calculated on this new amount that ’s capitalized interest capitalized interest if you accrue interest while you are in school as with direct    unsubsidized unsubsidized direct and plus loans and    private loans you will have capitalized interest if it is unpaid    unpaid accrued interest is added to the principal amount of your loan    after you leave school and finish any applicable grace period simply put there will be interest to be paid on both the principal of    the loan and on the interest that has already accumulated to minimize the effects of the capitalized interest on the amount you    will pay overall you can pay the interest during college instead of    waiting until after graduation that way you start with the original    principal balance minus any fees when you begin repayment

i was i a similar position as you and sometimes credit bureaus might be difficult to deal with especially when high amounts of money are involved to make the long story short someone opened a store credit card under my name and made a charge of around 3k after reporting this to the bureaus they did not want to remove the account from my credit report citing that the claim was frivolous after filing a police report the police officer gave me the phone number for the fraud department of this store credit card and after they investigated they removed the account from my credit i would suggest to do the following communicating with creditors and debt collectors you have the right to   stop creditors and debt collectors from    reporting fraudulent accounts after you give them a copy of a valid    identity theft report they may not report fraudulent accounts to the    credit reporting companies get copies of documents related to the    theft of your identity like transaction records or applications for    new accounts write to the company that has the documents and include    a copy of your identity theft report you also can tell the company to    give the documents to a specific law enforcement agency stop a debt    collector from contacting you in most cases debt collectors must    stop contacting you after you send them a letter telling them to stop    get written information from a debt collector about a debt including    the name of the creditor and the amount you supposedly owe if a debt    collector contacts you about a debt request this information in    writing i know that you said that the main problem was that your credit account was combined with another but there might be a chance that identity theft was involved if this is the case and you can prove it then you might have access to more tools to help you for example you can file a report with the ftc and along with a police report this can be a powerful tool in stopping these charges feel free to go to the website for more information

this is a classic case of sunk cost fallacy the basic idea is this do n't look at how much you 've invested look at what the thing is worth it sounds like you are no longer able to keep up so the financial answer is to stop making repairs etc   the only question is whose name is on the deed if your coworker still owns the asset you can simply back out say the mobile home is yours any repairs and payments i made are yours too   basically you will be out all of your work and what you put into it but you 're not continuing to dig a hole your coworker should consider your investment as a gift but a gift that is no longer being made if in taking over the asset he put it in your name the asset is yours to do with as you please   it sounds like you should dispose of the asset even if its at a loss either way from a financial perspective the answer is to cut your losses and be done with it all of that is of course a strictly financial answer   reading between the lines it seems like you feel guilty about not being able to honor the commitment you have made   if there is a sentimental attachment to the mobile i would suggest discussing your situation with the coworker   that 's really not a financial consideration but that does n't mean its unimportant

in addition to the answer from cqm let me answer your am i missing anything question then i 'll talk about how your approach of simplifying this is making it both harder and easier for you last i 'll show what my model for this would look like but if you are n't capable of stacking this up yourself then you really should n't be borrowing 10,000 to try to make money on the margin am i missing anything yes you 're forgetting 1 taxes specifically income tax and 2 sales fees   on the first you have not considered anything in your financial model for taxes you should include at least 25 of your expected returns going to taxes because anything that you buy and then sell within 12 months is taxed as income not capital gains on the second you will incur sales commissions and/or transaction fees depending on the brokerage you are using for your plan these tend to vary widely but i would expect to spend at least $ 25 per sale so if i were building out this model i would think that your break even would have to at least cover monthly interest + monthly principal payment income tax when sold commissions and broker 's fees every time you sell holdings on over simplifying you have the right idea with thinking about both interest and principal in trying to sketch this out but as i mentioned above you 're making this both harder and easier for yourself you are making it harder because you are doing the math wrong the actual payment for this loan assuming it is a normal loan can be found most easily with the pmt function in excel = nper pv fv = 24 0 that returns a monthly payment   of principal + interest of   so you actually are over calculating the payment by $ with your ballpark approach however you did n't actually have all the factors in the model to begin with so that does n't matter much   you are making it artificially easier because you have not thought about the impact of repaying principal what i mean is this in your question you indicate   i 'm guessing the necessary profit is just the total interest on this loan = = $ 720 usd so i 'll break even on this loan if and only if i make $ 720 from stocks over 24 months so the rate of return is + 720 = this sounds all you need is a total return across two years but assuming this is a normal loan and not an interest only loan you have to get rid of your capital a little bit at a time to pay back the loan in essence you will pay back 1/3 of your principal the first year and then you have to keep making the same fixed interest + principal payments out of a smaller base of capital   so for the first few months you can cover the interest easily but by the end you have to be making phenomenal returns to cover it   here is how i would build a model for it i actually did and your breakeven is about per month at that outstanding annual return you would be earning a whopping $ 4 at least as far as the variables are concerned you need to be considering your current capital balance because month 1 you may have $ 10,000 but month 2 you have just after paying back some principal   your rate of return if you do this in excel you can play with it some but you should save the time and just invest somewhere else your actual return that month rate of return existing capital balance   loan payment = for the parameters you gave earlier   income tax = actual return .25 with this kind of loan you 're not actually making enough to preserve the 10,000 capital and you 're selling everything you 've gained each month   commission = $ 25 per month assuming that covers your trade fees and broker commissions i guarantee you that this is not the deal breaker in the model so do n't get excited if you think i 'm over estimating this and you realize that scottrade or somewhere will let you have trades at $ each    monthly ending balance = = next month 's starting capital balance   stack it all up in excel for 24 months and see for yourself if you like the key thing you left out is that you 're repaying each month out of capital that you 'd like to use to invest with this makes you need much higher returns   even if your initial description was n't clear and this is an interest only loan you 're still looking at a rate of about 7.6 annually that you need to hit in order to just break even on the costs of holding the loan and transferring your gains into cash

this is the kind of scenario addressed by reddit 's /r personalfinance prime directive or i have $ x what should i do with it it follows a fairly linear for personal spending beginning with a budget and essential costs the gist of the is to cover your most immediate costs and risks first while also maximizing your benefits it sounds like you would fall somewhere around steps 1 and 3 step 2 wo n't apply since this is not pretax income if you do n't already have at least $ 1000 reserved in an emergency fund that 's a great place to start after that you 'll want to use the rest to pay down your debt your credit card debt is very high interest and should be treated as a financial emergency besides the balance of your gift you may want to throw whatever other funds you have saved beyond one month 's expenses at this problem as far as which card since you have multiple debts you 're faced with the classic choice of which payoff method to use snowball lowest balance first or avalanche highest interest rate first avalanche is more financially optimal but less immediately personally since your 26 apr debt is so large and so high interest i would recommend focusing every available penny on that card until it is paid off and then never use it again again per the that means using everything left over after steps 0 2 are fulfilled

the methodology leads me to believe the were setting up a poll for the sole purpose of getting a headline like this    for one the eliminated anyone who did n't graduate with a 4-year degree thus disqualifying anyone who has student loan debt but may have graduated with a lesser degree or did n't graduate at all i would assume probably safely that people with a 4-year degree are on average in a more financially stable situation than those who were disqualified from the poll and this would be more likely to worry about other things rather than paying student loan debt    for two the poll was commissioned by a refinancing startup that could use the publicity of student loan anxiety to drive more business having a article like this on a relatively popular site like the examiner that links straight to their website is just what a startup would love to have to get free marketing

there are many different methods for a corporation to get money but they mostly fall into three categories earnings debt and equity   earnings would be just the corporation 's accumulation of cash due to the operation of its business perhaps if cash was needed for a particular reason immediately a business may consider selling a division or group of assets to another party and using the proceeds for a different part of the business debt is money that to put it simply the corporation legally must repay to the lender likely with periodic interest payments apart from the interest payments if any and the principal original amount the lender has no additional rights to the value of the company there are basically 2 types of corporate debt bank debt and bonds   bank debt is just the corporation taking on a loan from a bank bonds are offered to the public ie you could potentially buy a tesla bond where you give tesla $ 1k and they give you a stated interest rate over time and principal repayments according to a schedule which type of debt a corporation uses will depend mostly on the high cost of offering a public bond the relationships with current banks and the interest rates the corporation thinks it can get from either method equity or shares is money that the corporation to put it simply likely does not have a legal obligation to repay until the corporation is liquidated sold at the end of its life and all debt has already been repaid but when the corporation is liquidated the shareholders have a legal right to the entire value of the company after those debts have been paid so equity holders have higher risk than debt holders but they also can share in higher reward that is why stock prices are so volatile the value of each share fluctuates based on the perceived value of the entire company   some equity may be offered with specific rules about dividend payments maybe they are required a preferred share likely has a stated dividend rate almost like a bond but also likely has a limited value it can ever receive back from the corporation maybe they are at the discretion of the board of directors maybe they will never happen there are 2 broad ways for a corporation to get money from equity a private offering or a public offering a private offering could be a small mom and pop store asking their neighbors to invest 5k so they can repair their business 's roof or it could be an angel investor think shark tank contributing significant value and maybe even taking control of the company perhaps shares would be offered to all current shareholders first a public offering would be one where shares would be offered up to the public on the stock exchange so that anyone could subscribe to them why a corporation would use any of these different methods depends on the price it feels it could get from them and also perhaps whether there are benefits to having different shareholders involved in the business ie an angel investor would likely be involved in the business to protect his her investment and that leadership may be what the corporation actually needs as much or more than money whether a corporation chooses to gain cash from earnings debt or equity depends on many factors including but not limited to 1 what assets earnings potential it currently has 2 the cost of acquiring the cash ie the high cost of undergoing a public offering vs the lower cost of increasing a bank loan and 3 the ongoing costs of that cash to both the corporation and ultimately the other shareholders ie a 3 interest rate on debt vs a 6 dividend rate on preferred shares vs a 5 dividend rate on common shares which would also share in the net value of the company with the other current shareholders   in summary earnings would be generally preferred but if the company needs cash immediately that may not be suitable debt is generally cheap to acquire and interest rates are generally lower than required dividend rates equity is often expensive to acquire and maintain either through dividend payments or by reduction of net value attributable to other current shareholders but may be required if a new venture is risky ie a bank bondholder may not want to lend money for a new tech idea because it is too risky to just get interest from they want access to the potential earnings as well through equity

your explanation is nearly perfect and not hand at all stock prices reflect the collective wisdom of all participating investors investors value stocks based on how much value they expect the stock to produce now and in the future so the stability of the stock prices is a reflection of the accuracy of the investors predictions investor can be seen as a sequence of increasingly sophisticated stock pricing strategies if investors were able to predict the future perfectly then all stock prices would rise at the same constant rate in theory if a particular investor is able to beat the market it is because they are better at predicting the future profits of companies or they are lucky or they are better at predicting the irrational behavior of other investors

what you need to know about estate magazines including why you may need a will and assigning a power of attorney   1 no matter your net worth it 's important to have a basic estate plan in place   such a plan ensures that your family and financial goals are met after you die   2 an estate plan has several elements   they include a will assignment of power of attorney and a living will or health care proxy medical power of attorney for some people a trust may also make sense when putting together a plan you must be mindful of both federal and state governing estates   3 taking inventory of your assets is a good place to start   your assets include your investments retirement savings insurance policies and real estate or business interests ask yourself three questions whom do you want to inherit your assets whom do you want handling your financial affairs if you 're ever whom do you want making medical decisions for you if you become unable to make them for yourself   4 everybody needs a will   a will tells the world exactly where you want your assets distributed when you die it 's also the best place to name for your children dying without a will also known as dying can be costly to your heirs and leaves you no say over who gets your assets even if you have a trust you still need a will to take care of any holdings outside of that trust when you die   5 trusts are n't just for the wealthy   trusts are legal mechanisms that let you put conditions on how and when your assets will be distributed upon your death they also allow you to reduce your estate and gift taxes and to distribute assets to your heirs without the cost delay and publicity of probate court which administers wills some also offer greater protection of your assets from creditors and lawsuits   6 discussing your estate plans with your heirs may prevent disputes or confusion   inheritance can be a loaded issue by being clear about your intentions you help potential conflicts after you 're gone   7 the federal estate tax exemption the amount you may leave to heirs free of federal tax is now set permanently at $ 5 million indexed for inflation   in 2013 estates under $ 5.25 million are exempt from the tax amounts above that are taxed up to a top rate of 40   8 you may leave an unlimited amount of money to your spouse tax free but this is n't always the best tactic   by leaving all your assets to your spouse you do n't use your estate tax exemption and instead increase your surviving spouse 's taxable estate that means your children are likely to pay more in estate taxes if your spouse leaves them the money when he or she dies plus it defers the tough decisions about the distribution of your assets until your spouse 's death   9 there are two easy ways to give gifts tax free and reduce your estate   you may give up to $ 14,000 a year to an individual or $ 28,000 if you 're married and giving the gift with your spouse you may also pay an unlimited amount of medical and education bills for someone if you pay the expenses directly to the institutions where they were incurred   10 there are ways to give charitable gifts that keep on giving   if you donate to a charitable gift fund or community foundation your investment grows tax free and you can select the charities to which contributions are given both before and after you die

it 's legal in fact they are required to do this assuming you are in fact a hce highly compensated employee to avoid getting in trouble with the irs i 'm guessing they do n't provide documentation for the same reason they do n't explain to you explicitly what the income thresholds are for social security taxes etc that 's a job for your personal accountant here 's the definition of a hce   an individual who owned more than 5 of the interest in the business at any time during    the year or the preceding year regardless of how much compensation    that person earned or received or for the preceding year received    compensation from the business of more than $ 115,000 if the preceding    year is 2014 $ 120,000 if the preceding year is 2015 2016 or 2017    and if the employer so chooses was in the top 20 of employees when    ranked by compensation there are rules the restrict distributions from plans like 401ks for example treasury reg says that a plan can not make a distribution to a hce if that payment reduces the asset value of the plan to below 110 of the value of the plan 's current liabilities so after taking account all distributions to be made to hces and the asset value of the plan everyone likely gets proportionally reduced so that they do n't run afoul of this rule there are for this but these are options that the plan administrators may take not you i suppose if you were still employed there and at a high enough level a company accountant would have discussed these options with you note there 's a chance there 's some other limitation on hces that i 'm missing which applies to your specific situation your best bet to understand is simply ask your money is still there you just ca n't get it all this year

there are two fundamental flaws to your plan supposing that you can get a loan with an interest rate that is less than the profit you are likely to get from an investment historically the u.s. stock market goes up by 6 to 7 per year i just did a quick check and found rates for unsecured loans of 10 to 15 of course interest rates vary depending on your credit rating and all sorts of other factors but that 's probably a reasonable ball park borrowing money at 15 so you can invest it at 6 is not a good plan of course you could invest in things that promise higher returns but such investments have higher risks if there was a super safe investment that was virtually guaranteed to give 20 profit the bank would n't loan you money at 10 or 15 they 'd put their money in this 20 investment i do n't know what your income is but unless it 's substantial no one is going to give you an unsecured loan for $ 250,000   in your question you say you 'll use $ 2,000 of your profits to make payments on the loan that 's less than 0.8 of the loan amount if you really know a bank that will loan money at 0.8 i 'm sure we 'd all like to hear about it that would be an awesome rate for a fully secured loan never mind for a signature loan $ 250,000 for 10 years at 10 would mean payments of $ 3,300 per month and that 's about the most optimistic terms i can imagine for a signature loan you say you plan to lie to the bank what are you going to tell them a person does n't get to be a bank loan officer with authority to make $ 250,000 loans if he 's a complete idiot they 're going to want to know what you intend to do with the money and how you plan to pay it back if you 're making a million dollars a year sure they 'll probably loan you that kind of money but if you were making a million dollars a year i doubt you 'd be considering this scheme as said in the comments if it was really possible to get bigger returns on an investment than you would have to pay in interest on an unsecured loan then everybody would be doing it all the time sorry if you want to be rich the realistic choices are a arrange to be born to rich parents b win the lottery c get a good job and work hard

you are young and therefore have a very long time horizon for investing absolutely nothing you do should involve paying any attention to your investments more than once a year if that first off you can only deposit money in an ira of whatever kind if you have taxable income if you do n't you can still invest just without the tax benefits of a roth my suggestion would be to open an account with a discount brokerage schwab fidelity etrade etc the advantage of a brokerage ira is that you can invest in whatever you want within the account then either buy an s&p 500 or total market index fund within the account or buy an index based etf like a mutual fund but trades like a stock the latter might be better since many mutual funds have minimum limits which etfs do not set the account up to reinvest the dividends automatically s&p 500 yields will far outstrip current savings account yields and sit back and do nothing for the next 40 or 50 years well except for continuing to make annual contributions to the account which you should continue to invest in pretty much the same thing until you have enough money and experience and knowledge to diversify into bond funds international funds individual stocks etc disclaimer i am not a financial planner i just manage my own money and this strategy has mostly kept me from stressing too badly over the last few years of market turmoil

this depends on the particular index of course capital gains taxes occur when stock is sold for a profit this occurs less frequently in an index fund where an active manager frequently buys and sells stocks after all he wants to be active the index fund only sells stocks when the particular stock leaves the index for an index such as the s&p 500 this does not happen that often   the more specific the criteria of the index fund the more often the selling of stock and thus the need to pay capital gains taxes occurs

agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   i was being sarcastic    gt;but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   correlation does n't equal causation remember that this is also the same time that european japanese and soviet economies were picking back up after ww2 global production picked up and there was more international competition    gt;because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems   the eu can not print money in the same way the usa can if anything the euro is a cautionary tale about currency 's with too stringent printing limitations along with tying together a set of countries at vastly different levels of economic development    the usa is not anywhere near the point of no return and seeing as we can finance our debt at ridiculously low rates compared to the rest of the world it would be much simpler to do that than try and restructure the entire monetary system of the usa   over what the last 40 years we are at about 80 90 years now    hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years   the gold standard has not been in use for hundreds of thousands of years nor was it the only currency previous to fiat   gt;i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs   i do n't think asking my local college grad is a good way of determining the usa 's macro economic situation you 're absolutely right that there is a major major disparity of wealth problem but the gold standard is n't the reason for that unemployment insurance and welfare are also comically small portions of the budget if you wanna talk about cutting spending defense and medicare are where it 's at and you do n't even have to hurt old people or soldiers to fix them

when i was in that boat a few years ago i went for the car first   my thoughts if i get the car first i 'm guaranteed to have a car that runs well   that makes it more convenient to commute to any job or for social functions   i ended up dropping about $ 20k into a car paid cash i do n't like being in debt   i chose to buy a really nice car knowing it will last for many years to come i 'm expecting to not replace it for about 10 years from the purchase   i would urge you to consider paying in full for the car dumping $ is a lot and there are plenty of nice cars out there in the $ 10 20k range that will work just fine for years to come   one benefit of paying in full is that you do n't have a portion of your income tied into the car loan the main reason i chose not to go for the house first had more to do with the difference in commitment   a home mortgage is a 30-year commitment on a large chunk of your income   with the job market and housing markets both currently working against you it 's better to wait until you have a large safety net to fall into for example it 's always recommended to have several months worth of living expenses in savings   compared to renting having 6 or more months of mortgage payments + utilities + insurance + property taxes + other mandatory expenses see food gas comes out to a significant amount more that you should have saved for me i 'm looking at a minimum of about $ 20k in savings just to feel comfortable ymmv   also owning a house always has more maintenance costs than you will predict   even if it 's just replacing a few light bulbs at first eventually you 'll need something major an appliance will die your roof will spring a leak anything i had both of those happen in the first year though it could be bad luck   you should make sure that you can afford the increased monthly payments while still well under your income once you 're locked in to the house you can still set aside a smaller chunk of your income for a new car 5 10 years down the road   but if you 're current car is getting down to it 's last legs you should get that fixed up before you lock yourself in to an uncomfortable situation do n't be in too much of a hurry to buy a house   the housing market still has a ways to go before it recovers and there 's not a whole lot to help it along   interest rates may go up but that will only hurt the housing market so i do n't expect it to change too much for the next several months   with a little bit of sanity we wo n't have another outrageous housing bubble for many years so houses should remain somewhat affordable interest rates may vary   also keep in mind that if you pay less that 20 down on the house you may end up with some form of mortgage interest which is just extra interest you 'll owe each month

i 'm not so sure the insider outsider distinction is the best one although it does have its uses for example if an organization has stagnated you might not want business as usual someone stuck in and a of the stagnant religion on the other hand bringing in an outsider does n't necessarily mean change they may be just as much of a of the same religion that made the organization stagnant in the first place   personally i would n't say there was a definitive ballmer era though people regularly change their own tactics and approaches and i think ballmer saw the light towards the end of his term with respect to one microsoft or at least it was one major conversion among a series of as yet ones i think satya continued much of that in his own way much like two restaurants can both be french but still be quite distinct from one another   but if even early ballmer can be different from late ballmer the important thing is probably more about how much change is happening and whether it is the right change

this stock is the same as any other but you need to keep clear in your head that you and your company are now different entities   you the person will pay tax on capital gains and losses when you sell any stock that you hold in your own name   you 'll also owe regular tax if you draw a salary etc   the fact that it may be your company does not change these things the company will not recognize a gain by selling stock to raise capital since it 's nominally exchanging things of equal value say $ 100 in cash for $ 100 in stock   in order to sell stock however you might need to register with the sec depending on how you 're going about finding your investors so keep that in mind

well like a lot of stuff on there is not a simple answer but generally it is not a good thing take a look at the wikipedia entry on net operating loss basically the company is commenting that when they do make money they will receive preferential tax treatment on that income     so whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on a couple of things nol does n't directly impact book value other than how the actual assets of the company changed over the previous quarter i believe there is a 1:1 correspondence to how the assets change and nol but i am sure someone could clarify that for me in another answer or as a comment

purchasing an option to sell the stock is probably the safest bet this gives you reasonable leverage and your risk is limited to the cost of the option say the stock currently sells for $ 100 per share you think it will drop to $ 80 per share in the next two weeks and the market thinks the price will be stable now consider an option to sell one share of that stock for $ 95 any time within the next two weeks the market would consider that option nearly worthless since in all likelihood you would lose out by exercising it since you could just sell the share on the market for a price expected to be higher than that you might be able to acquire that option for $ 5 now say you 're right and within two weeks the price drops to $ 80 now you can purchase a share for $ 80 exercise the option to sell it for $ 95 and pocket $ 15 that would make you a $ 10 profit on a $ 5 investment if you 're wrong you just let the option lapse and are out $ 5 no problem in reality you would buy a number of such options and you would n't actually buy a share and exercise the option you would just sell the option back to its issuer for $ 15

in a taxable account you 're going to owe taxes when you sell the shares for a gain you 're also going to owe taxes on any distributions you receive from the holdings in the account these distributions can happen one or more times a year vanguard has a writeup on mutual fund taxation   note for a fund like you linked you will owe taxes annually regardless of whether you sell it the underlying assets will pay dividends and those are distributed to you either in cash or more as additional shares of the mutual fund look into dividend reinvestment taking vfiax 's distributions as an example if you bought 1 share of the fund on march 19 2017 on march 20th you would have been given $ that would be taxable you 'd owe taxes on that even if you did n't sell your share during the year your last paragraph is based on a false premise the mutual fund does report to you at the end of the year the short and long term capital gains along with dividends on a 1099-div you get to pay taxes on those transactions that 's why it 's advantageous to hold low turnover mutual funds in taxable accounts

sometimes very often there is two things at play with the good ones you exchange money for a service that cuts down on the time it takes to learn or improve certain skills this can be done by specific trainings this can be done by making a digestible summary of information etc   in that case i do n't think it 's a waste of time or a waste of money however on facebook you see a lot of business trainers that do n't bring added value the one literally repeating what facebook has in their manuals but charge for it the ones who are not bringing new insights on how you can improve and run your business or how you can improve your management skills because as your business grows you will need to learn more of those and you 'll have less time to learn them in it 's about weeding the bullshit out

when stocks have a change in price it is because of a trade to have a trade you have to have both a buyer and a seller   when the price of a security is going up there are an equal amount of shares being sold as being bought when the price of a security is going down there are an equal amount of shares being bought as being sold   there almost always is an unequal amount of shares waiting to be sold compared to the amount waiting to be bought but waiting shares do not move the price only when the purchase price and the sale price agree and a trade occurs does the price move   so the price does not go down because more shares are being sold neither does the price go up because more shares are being bought

in the event that payment is not made by the due date on the invoice then the transaction is essentially null and void and you can sell the work to another client for your particular situation i would strongly suggest that you implement a sales contract and agreement of original transfer of work of art for any and all future sales of your original works of art in this contract you need to either enforce payment in full at time of signing or a deposit at signing with payment in full within x amount of days and upon delivery of item   in your sales contract you will want to stipulate a late fee in the event that the client does not pay the balance by the date specified and a clause that stipulates how long after the due date that you will hold the artwork before the client forfeiting deposit and losing rights to the work    you will also want to specify an amount of time that you provide as a grace period in the event client changes their mind about the purchase and you can make it zero grace period making all sales final and upon signing of the agreement the client agrees to the terms and is locked into the sale in which point if they back out they forfeit all deposits paid i own a custom web design business and we implement a similar agreement for all works that we create for a client requiring a 50 deposit in advance of work being started an additional 25 at time of client accepting the design layout and the final 25 at delivery of finished product    in the event that a client fails to meet the requirements of the contract for the second or final installment payments the client all money paid and actually owes us 70 of total quoted project price for wasting our time we have only had to enforce these stipulations on one client in 5 years the benefit to you for requiring a deposit if payment is not made in full is that it ensures that the client is serious about purchasing the work because they have put money in the game rather than just their word of wanting to purchase think of it like putting earnest money down when you make an offer to buy a house hope this helps

the problem with your math is that your assumptions are all sorts of fucked up you have him living in a 700 sqft apartment in but paying $ 1400 in indianapolis i live here $ 1400 in indy is enough to rent a 3 bedroom house or a 3 bedroom luxury apartment downtown and a front end dev is n't going to be making 70 k in indy with 5 years experience that 's the average of salaried employees in indy web developers make more my friend 's starting job out of a no name local college here was with 5 years experience you can find a job paying a lot more than that your salary scale is automatically going to be skewed since tech pays more and a greater percentage of the population is going to be in tech in sf than indy the dude would probably be making more like 90k if he was competent and paying $ 500 a month for a 700 sqft apartment if he had some money for a down payment for $ 1400 a month he could afford the mortgage of like a 300 k house and could actually be putting that money into an investment rather than sinking that money into rent good luck buying a house in sf for less than 1m. but for sport let 's assume he does n't buy a home and is renting a small apartment so he is now paying only $ 6000 a year for housing and is making 20 k more than your estimate which after taxes is like what at least 16 k in take home money plus the 11 k he is paying less in rent than you assumed so he is actually making 27 k more than you are assuming in your math and now instead of making 20 k less a year than he would in sf he is making 7 k more again if he was smart and bought a house which is n't possible for 99 of people in sf the monetary gain is n't even close   and do n't get me started on the perks of california people from cali all seem to be under the assumption that things like nature restaurants and entertainment only exist in california

yes a diversified portfolio can generate greater returns than the s&p 500 by going outside it for instance small stocks on average generate higher returns than the large caps found in the s&p 500 so if you own a diversified portfolio of stocks some of which are smaller in market cap than the typical s&p 500 stock you have a chance to outperform you might also outperform by owning other asset classes than stocks such as gold real estate and timber among others at appropriate times you may also be able to get the relevant exposure by owning gold and timber stocks and reits this was a lesson that david of the yale endowment taught us

this is only a partial answer to your question 1 if you have a conservative approach to savings and actually even if you do n't you should not invest all of your money in any single industry or product   if you want to invest some money in oil okay but do n't overdo it if your larger goal is to invest the money in a manner that is less risky but still more lucrative than a savings account you should read up on personal finance and investing to get a sense of what options are available   a commonly recommended option is to invest in low cost index funds that mirror the performance of the stock market as a whole   the question of how should i invest is very broad but you can find lots of starting points in other questions on this site by googling or by visiting your local library

as others have said if you do n't have dependents there 's little need for life insurance if you ca n't think of any obvious beneficiary for an insurance policy than you probably do n't need one dependents here should be understood broadly it would n't necessarily be limited to wife and children if you 're the only support for your handicapped cousin for example you might want to provide for him but i take it from your question that you have no such special case of course even if you have no dependents now you might pick some up in the future and if and when that does happen your medical situation may have changed making it difficult to get life insurance but if you have no immediate plans so that any such even is likely to be far away a serious alternative to consider would be to invest the money you would have paid in insurance premiums then if someday you do acquire dependents you have a pot of money set aside to provide for them in case something happens to you if it 's not enough and you can get insurance at that time then great but if you ca n't get insurance at least there 's something if you never do acquire dependents you can consider that pot of money part of your retirement fund

i 'm a native english speaker and managed a team of hungarian developers ranged from 15 people to 22 at our biggest i think i was not quite fluent in hungarian at the time and i found it was actually much easier than you would expect to manage the team   the majority of them had at least a little bit of familiarity with english but only one or two were fluent   so for the most part the team liked to help me find the right words phrasing for what i was trying to say it became a collaborative effort rather than me telling them what to do   plus the unintended of saying entirely the wrong thing always broke the tension   being not fully fluent also required us all to keep our communications and thoughts rather basic so we could n't get mired in jargon or go off into the weeds on some bit of esoteric nonsense we kept it simple   and if something complex needed to be expressed then i could talk in detail with one or two of the guys that spoke english well and they could translate for the rest of the team

with the caveat that you should always read the fine print generally the high water mark is the absolute highest mark at end of any quarter sometimes month over all the quarters months in the past   intra quarter marks do n't matter    so in your example the mark at the end of the second quarter would only be the new if that mark is higher then the mark at the end of every previous quarter   again what happened in the middle of of the second quarter does n't matter for hedge funds the may only be be from the date you started investing rather than over the whole history of the fund but i would be surprised if that was true for any mutual funds   though as i may have mentioned it is worth reading the fine print

basically the idea of an ira is that the money is earned by you and would normally be taxed at the individual rate but the government is allowing you to avoid paying the taxes on it now by instead putting it in the account this tax deferral encourages retirement savings by reducing your current taxable income providing a short term carrot   however the government will want their cut specifically when you begin withdrawing from that account the principal which was n't taxed when you put it in will be taxed at the current individual rate when you take it out when you think about it that 's only fair you did n't pay taxes on it when it came out of your paycheck so you should pay that tax once you 're withdrawing it to live on here 's the rub the interest is also taxed at the individual rate at the time that was a good thing the capital gains rate in 1976 when the regular ira was established was 35 the highest it 's ever been now that 's not looking so good because the current cap gains rate is only 15 however these rates rise and fall cap gains more than individual rates and so by contributing to a traditional ira you simplify your tax bill the principal and interest is taxed at the individual rate as if you were still making a paycheck a roth ira is basically the government trying to get money now by giving up money later you pay the marginal individual rate on the contributions as you earn them it becomes a post tax deduction but then that money is completely yours and the kicker is that the government wo n't tax the interest on it if you do n't withdraw it before retirement age this makes roths very attractive to retirement investors as a hedge against higher overall tax rates later in life if you think that for any reason you 'll be paying more taxes in 30 years than you would be paying for the same money now you should be investing in a roth a normal non ira investment account at first seems to be the worst of both worlds you pay individual tax on all earned wages that you invest then capital gains on the money your investment earns stock gains and dividends bond interest etc whenever you cash out however a traditional account has the most flexibility you can keep your money in and take your money out on a timeline you choose this means you can react both to market moves and to tax changes when a conservative administration tax rates on capital gains you can cash out pay that low rate on the money you made from your account and then the money 's yours to spend or to reinvest you can if you 're and tax savvy use all three of these instruments to your overall advantage when tax rates are high now contribute to a traditional ira and then withdraw the money during your retirement in times where individual tax rates are low when tax rates are low like right now max out your roth contributions and use that money after retirement when tax rates are high use a regular investment account as an overage to roth contributions when taxes are low contribute when the individual rate is low then capitalize and reinvest during times when capital gains taxes are low perhaps replacing a paycheck deduction in annual contributions to a roth or you can simply fold it back into the investment account this is n't as good as a roth but is better than a traditional by capitalizing at an advantageous time you turn interest earned into principal invested and pay a low tax on it at that time to avoid a higher tax later however the market and the tax structure have to coincide to make ordinary investing pay off you may have bought in in the early 90s taking advantage of the lowest individual rates since the great depression while now capital gains taxes are the lowest they 've ever been if you cash out you may not be realizing much of a gain in the first place

is it not that bad depends how bad is bad the problems causes by a government having large debt are similar to those caused by an individual having large debt the big issue is more and more of your income goes to paying interest on the debt and is thus not available for spending on goods and services if it gets bad enough you find you can not make payments you start defaulting on loans and then you have to make serious sacrifices like selling your property to pay the debt nations have an advantage over individuals in that they can sometimes debt i.e. simply declare that they are not going to pay lenders can then refuse to give them more money but that does n't get their original loans paid back in theory other nations could send in troops to seize property to pay the loan but this is a very extreme solution totally aside from any moral considerations modern warfare is very expensive it 's likely the war would cost you more than you 'd recover on the debt how much debt is too much it 's hard to give a number any more than one could give a maximum acceptable debt for an individual american banks have a rule of thumb that they wo n't normally loan you money if your total debt payments would be more than 1/3 of your income i 've never come close to that that seems awfully high to me but say a young person just starting out so he 's not making a lot of money and he lives someplace with high housing prices might find this painful but acceptable etc

i disagree   employee pay has always been a budgetary line item to large business owners   that 's just the way it is   much of the reason for the decrease in the percent of revenue going to employees is because companies nowadays do n't need to hire as many people   technology has reduced the number of employees most industries require while still maintaining or boosting productivity   i think a more fair way of looking at these figures would be to look at the sum of both employee pay and capital expenses as a percent of revenue

the issues of trading with unsettled funds are usually restricted to cash accounts   with margin i 've never personally heard of a rule that will catch you in this scenario   you wo n't be able to withdraw funds that are tied up in unsettled positions until the positions settle   you should be able to trade those funds   i 've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds but that does n't mean there is n't a broker somewhere that does brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions however since margin is basically offering you a line of credit   you should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules i 'd guess that you may have heard about restrictions that apply to cash accounts and think they may also apply to margin accounts   if that 's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally try searching for these terms you should be able to find a lot of clear resources on those terms   here 's one that 's current and provides examples on a margin account you avoid these issue because the margin essentially a loan from your broker provides a cushion additional funds that avoid the issues   it is possible that if you over extend yourself that you 'll get a margin call but that seems to be different than what you 're asking and maybe worth a new question if you want to know about that

stock prices are set by bidding in principle a seller will say i want $ 80 if he ca n't find anyone willing to buy at that price he 'll either decide not to sell after all or he 'll lower his price likewise a buyer will say i 'll pay $ 70 if he ca n't find anyone willing to pay that price he 'll either decide not to buy or he 'll increase his price for most stocks there are many buyers and many sellers all the time so there 's a constant the typical small investor has very little control of the price you say i want to buy 10 shares of xyz corporation and my maximum price is $ 20 if the current trending price is below $ 20 your broker will buy it for you if not he wo n't you normally have some time limit on the order so if the price falls within your range within that time period your broker will buy that is your choice is basically to buy or not buy or sell or not sell at the current price you have little opportunity to really negotiate a better price if you have a significant percentage of a company 's total stock different story in real life most stocks are being traded constantly so buyers and sellers both have a pretty good idea of the current price if the last sale was ten minutes ago for $ 20 it 's unlikely anyone 's going to now bid $ 100 they 're going to bid $ or $ or some such if the last sale was for $ 20 and your broker really came to the floor and offered to buy for $ 100 i suppose someone would sell to him very quickly before he realized what an outrageous price this was i use td ameritrade and on their web site if i give a price limit on a buy that 's more than a small percentage above the last sale they reject it as an error i forget the exact number but they wo n't even accept a bid of $ 80 if the stock is going for $ 40 they might accept $ 41 or $ 42 something like that

okay savings in a nutshell so take at least year 's worth of rent $ 30k or so maybe more for additional expenses that 's your core emergency fund for when you lose your job or total a few cars or something keep it in a good savings account maybe a cd ladder but the point is it 's liquid and you can get it when you need it in case of emergency replenish it immediately after using it you may lose a little cash to inflation but you need liquidity to protect you from risk it is worth it the rest is long term savings probably for retirement or possibly for a down payment on a home a blended set of stocks and bonds is appropriate with stocks storing most of it if saving for retirement you may want to put the stocks in a tax deferred account if only for the reduced paperwork stocks generate so much having some money especially bonds in something like a roth ira or a non tax advantaged account is also useful as a backup emergency fund because you can withdraw it without penalties take the money out of stocks gradually when you are approaching the time when you use the money if it 's closer than five years do n't use stocks your money should be mostly bonds when you 're about to use it and not 30-year bonds or anything like that either those are sensitive to interest rates in the short term you should have bonds that mature approximately the same time you 're going to use them keep an eye on that if you 're using bond funds which continually roll over that 's basically how any savings goal should work retirement is a little special because it 's sort of like 20 years worth of savings goals so you do n't want all your savings in bonds at the beginning and because you can get fancy tax deferred accounts but otherwise it 's about the same thing college savings likewise there are tools available to help you with this an asset allocation calculator can be found from a variety of sources including most investment firms you can use a target date fund for something this if you 'd like automation there are also a couple things like say vanguard funds from vanguard which target other savings goals you may be able to understand the way these sorts of instruments function more easily than you could other investments you could do a decent job for yourself by just opening up an account at vanguard using their online tool and pouring your money into the stuff they recommend

it 's not quite identical due to fees stock rights and reporting tax obligations   but the primary difference is that a person could have voting rights in a company while maintaining zero economic exposure to the company sometimes known as empty voting as an abstract matter it 's identical in that you reduce your financial exposure whether you sell your stock or short it   so the essence of your question is fundamentally true   but the details make it different   of course there are fee differences in how your broker will handle it and also margin requirements for shorting   somebody playing games with overlapping features of ownership sales and purchases may have tax and reporting obligations for straddles wash sales and related issues   a straight sale is generally less complicated for tax reporting purposes and a loss is more likely to be respected than someone playing games with sales and purchases but the empty voting issue is an important difference   you could buy stock with rights such as voting engage in other behavior such as forwards shorts or options to negate your economic exposure to the stock while maintaining the right to vote   of course in some cases this may have to be disclosed or may be covered by contract and most people engaging in stock trades are unlikely to have meaningful voting power in a public company   but the principle is still there as explained in the article by henry and bernie black hedge funds have been especially creative in voting rights from economic ownership sometimes they hold more votes than economic ownership a pattern we call empty voting in an extreme situation a vote holder can have a negative economic interest and thus an incentive to vote in ways that reduce the company 's share price sometimes investors hold more economic ownership than votes though often with voting rights the de facto ability to acquire the votes if needed we call this situation hidden ownership because the economic ownership and de facto voting ownership are often not disclosed

i am in a different situation because i earn more than i spend but i have found that i need to make the money inaccessible if i want to really avoid spending it   i used to just throw my paychecks into a high yield savings account but eventually the balance was large enough that a large purchase did n't seem like that much because i would have had so much left in the account after the purchase   it was way too easy for me to spend way too much now i invest my savings automatically   the obvious benefit is my money has a much higher growth rate than a simple savings account especially with fed interest rates so low   i invest most of my savings in retirement accounts where there are severe penalties for withdrawing prior to retirement age   then i invest a significant portion to a regular brokerage account where the money is invested in stock and bond funds   this money is accessible within a few days of whenever i need it   the remainder of my savings goes into a savings account as cash i can get to at any time   all 3 accounts grow with every paycheck market fluctuations aside    this system helps me to categorize my savings as never ever touch retirement accounts touch only if i can wait 3 days and am willing to pay taxes brokerage account or touch whenever you need it with no penalties savings account   if my savings account grows too much i 'll move money from there to the brokerage account where it has more growth potential   the longer my money is invested in the brokerage accounts the less taxes i 'll need to pay when i sell withdraw the funds so that 's even more incentive for me to keep those funds where they are i have credit cards so in my opinion having to wait 3 days for funds from my investment account to become accessible is considered accessible in an emergency because my credit cards can be used to cover a large purchase for 3 days and as long as i pay it off within the grace period there 's no interest charged tl;dr investing is probably the smartest way to both grow your money and prevent the urge to spend it right away   my advice is to start with a 401(k or ira as soon as you can since the younger you are the more time until retirement that your money has to compound   investing $ 100 more a month can mean hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in your account when you 're ready to retire

the consumer who opens a cd may receive a passbook   or paper certificate it now is common for a cd to consist simply of a book entry and an item shown in the consumer 's periodic bank statements that is there is usually no certificate as such generally speaking cds should offer higher interest that typically does n't vary over the term of that cd   so in that way it offers a bit more security on the return   but they also lock up your money for a specific period of time

standard repayment can be quite burdensome fortunately it looks like servicing offers a variety of payment plan options and even provides a calculator that you can use to compare them given your adjusted gross income and current loan balances this wo n't reduce that $ 420 to $ 0 but it may bring it down significantly   i agree with @littleadv that you need legal advice to answer your other questions that being said i can tell you that it is possible to go into deferment and/or forbearance at any time not only before you start making regular payments as long as you meet the criteria   otherwise it may be worth looking through other questions and answers on here about lowering expenses and increasing income there is a lot of good advice for people in similar situations to yours if you are truly in hardship even with a full time job you may qualify for supplemental nutrition insurance a.k.a food stamps   best of luck

at the most fundamental level every market is comprised of buyers and selling trading securities these buyers and sellers decide what and how to trade based on the probability of future events as they see it that 's a simple statement but an example demonstrates how complicated it can be picture a company that 's about to announce earnings some investors traders from here on agents will have purchased the company 's stock a while ago with the expectation that the company will have strong earnings and grow going forward other agents will have sold the stock short bought put options etc with the expectation that the company wo n't do as well in the future still others may be unsure about the future of the company but still expecting a lot of volatility around the earnings announcement so they 'll have bought sold the stock options futures etc to take advantage of that volatility   all of these various predictions expectations etc factor into what agents are bidding and asking for the stock its associated derivatives and other securities which in turn determines its price along with overall economic factors like the sector 's performance interest rates etc it can be very difficult to determine exactly how markets are factoring in information about an event though take the example in your question the article states that if market expectations of higher interest rates tightened credit conditions in this case lenders could expect higher interest rates in the future so they may be less willing to lend money now because they expect to earn a higher interest rate in the future you could also see this reflected in bond prices because since interest rates are inversely related to bond prices higher interest rates could decrease the value of bond portfolios this could lead agents to sell bonds now in order to lock in their profits while other agents could wait to buy bonds because they expect to be able to purchase bonds with a higher rate in the future   furthermore higher interest rates make taking out loans more expensive for individuals and businesses this potential decline in investment could lead to decreased revenue profits for businesses which could in turn cause declines in the stock market agents expecting these declines could sell now in order to lock in their profits buy derivatives to hedge against or ride out possible declines etc however the current low interest rate environment makes it cheaper for businesses to obtain loans which can in turn drive investment and lead to increases in the stock market this is one criticism of the easy money quantitative easing policies of the us federal reserve i.e. the low interest rates are driving a bubble in the stock market one quick example of how tricky this can be the usual assumption is that positive economic news e.g. low unemployment numbers strong business residential investment etc will lead to price increases in the stock market as more agents see growth in the future and buy accordingly however in the us positive economic news has recently led to declines in the market because agents are worried that positive news will lead the federal reserve to taper stop quantitative easing sooner rather than later thus ending the low interest rate environment and possibly tampering growth   summary in short markets incorporate information about an event because the buyers and sellers trade securities based on the likelihood of that event its possible effects and the behavior of other buyers and sellers as they react to the same information information may lead agents to buy and sell in multiple markets e.g. equity and fixed income different types of derivatives etc which can in turn affect prices and yields throughout numerous markets

the fee to withdraw cash from an atm using your credit card as opposed to your debit card is akin to the merchant fees paid by any business that accepts your credit card as payment these fees range from around 2.75 of the transaction to upwards of 5 and are charged to the merchant the fees are split among the various vendors that provide the infrastructure to conduct the credit card transaction resulting in the merchant receiving the money and the charge on your credit account these fees are used by each vendor to cover their costs and ultimately generate a profit note most vendors in the value chain do not receive any revenue from any interest you may pay on your outstanding balance therefore when you withdraw cash from an atm you are paying the merchant fees instead of whatever merchant you are purchasing goods services from with the cash withdrawn

good question if a person has a choice it is probably better to pay cash but not always if your large pile of cash can earn more being invested than cost of the interest to borrow a similar large pile of cash it is beneficial to get a mortgage otherwise pay cash example a house costs $ 100,000 i have $ 100,000 in extra money i can invest that at 5 per year and i can borrow an additional $ 100,000 at 2 per year since i can make more on my pile of cash than it costs to borrow another pile of cash borrowing is better compound interest is the most powerful force on the planet according to albert einstein maybe that is n't likely for most people though here is the results from some online financial calculators borrowing $ 100,000 with 2 interest for 30 years will cost a total of $ you get $ 100,000 but it cost you $ to do it saving $ 100,000 in a bank account with an interest rate of 5 will be worth $ in 30 years by not spending the money you will earn $ over the course of 30 years so if you can invest at 5 and borrow at 2 you will end up with $ more than if you did n't it is a pretty extreme example and financial advisers make a lot of money figuring out the complex nature of money to make situations like that possible

you 're making $ 100k together per year you 're not in the hole you 're in the top 25 of all households and the top 10 of non family households as yours would be   to be blunt you 're not in the rely on assistance area you 're in the save up for your downpayment sector my suggestion would be to figure out a way to save more than $ a month for now   $ 100k gross income means you have about $ 8k net income per month $ 2k for rent and other necessities means you have $ 6k per month that you can potentially save   even half of that $ 3k per month means you have $ saved by the end of this year and $ on an annual basis as far as marriage or domestic partnership i would n't get into one based on whether it helps you afford a home   it might be a good idea because it helps you handle some of the details arising when you have joint property perhaps but not solely for the financial aspect and as far as how much home is realistic   $ 250k is certainly realistic if you can save up enough for a good down payment   try to get to the 20 25 range   if you 're already halfway there another year of renting wo n't kill you and it will mean no pmi and much better rates    also consider a 15 year mortgage we 're in the same general income category as you and manage a 15 year on a $ 250k range house quite nicely   it does n't add all that much to your monthly payment amount compared to what you 'd expect particularly since the monthly payment includes property taxes which wo n't increase based on the length of the mortgage now that we have actual numbers from the op so without cutting anything you have $ 2k yourself you can be saving   this assumes your rent number of $ is your portion of rent and not the 100 amount   that 's $ per year just by yourself   on top of that you 've got another $ 40k or so coming from your partner at least some of which should be available as well if he she is going to be co owning   but if not at least you have about $ 2000 a month you can be saving   you could also downsize the car cut cable tv downsize the phone and have another $ 500 or so available but it does n't really look like you need to do that given how much you have available now i 'd look at what you 're doing with that per month right now and see how you can free most of it up   you have n't mentioned a few things like utilities not sure if that 's just or if your partner is paying them so perhaps not all of it is available   but even $ 1000 a month is $ 12000 to add to the $ 20000 you have now which makes a big dent in that down payment

dude i 'm a small business owner the fact of the matter is employee costs are a big expense but the truth is i think people that pay minimum wage are scum    if you 're so convinced that a livable wage would make it worse why do n't you standardize a companies 10-k and show me that the cost of the product will raise equal to the wage increase you ca n't because it wo n't the cost increase on margins is divided over every operating metric a company has and therefore the price wo n't increase at a 1:1 ratio    further the margins that are made by the companies employing the people making minimum wage are often from government assistance so you 're claiming it 's cheaper for the populace to create false net revenues by directing tax dollars to support the very people that ca n't buy food because of a $ 7 an hour wage    then you have the countless people stuck in the welfare hole of losing their benefits if they get a slightly better job that just knocks them out of the specified ranges required to qualify so you have people that want to work but now ca n't make too much money or it will make their life worse all because of the system that was created by a minimum wage that never matched inflation and cheap companies that rely on welfare systems to keep their employees happy a rough to keep living    companies that pay minimum wage are jokes

tax is often calculated per item   especially in the days of the internet some items are taxable and some are n't depending on the item and your nexus   i would recommend calculating and storing tax with each item to account for these subtle differences edit not sure why this was downvoted if you do n't believe me you can always check with amazon i think they know what they 're talking about final update now if someone goes to your site and buys something from your business in california and the shipping address for the product is nevada then taxes do not have to be collected   if they have a billing address in california and a shipping address in nevada and the goods are shipping to nevada you do not have to declare tax if you have a mixture of tangible computer mouse keyboard and intangible assets warranty in a cart and the shipping address is in california you charge tax on the tangible assets but not on the intangible assets yes you can charge tax on the whole order   yes for most businesses that 's good enough but i 'm not trying to provide the good enough solution i 'm simply telling you how very large businesses run and operate   as i 've mentioned i 've done several tax using software called google if you 've not heard of it and have done those for companies like the bbc and owned and operated by bill gates take it or leave it but the correct way to charge taxes especially given the complex tax laws of the us and internationally is to charge per item   if you just need the good enough approach feel free to calculate it by total some additional reading another possible federal limitation on internet taxation is the united states supreme court case corp. v. north dakota 504 u.s. which held that under the dormant commerce clause goods purchased through mail order can not be subject to a state ’s sales tax unless the vendor has a substantial nexus with the state the tax   in 1997 the federal government decided to limit taxation of internet activity for a period of time the internet tax freedom act prohibits taxes on internet access which is defined as a service that allows users access to content information email or other services offered over the internet and may include access to proprietary content information and other services as part of a package offered to customers the act has exceptions for taxes levied before the statute was written and for sales taxes on online purchases of physical goods

first and foremost you must remember that they are people something i do n't think you have trouble with but others might when dealing with increasingly desperate financial struggles it 's not uncommon to allow financial trouble to define you or for others to see you only as poor money is a human creation it 's not real like fire or water and money problems is a misnomer whatever problems they have money is only one symptom often dealing with those deeper human problems such as lack of confidence depression fear or behavioral issues is the key to correcting downstream problems like poor money management not that learning how to manage money is n't important but it does n't sound like that is the primary issue in this case westerners tend to view money trouble as distinct from other problems the answer to money troubles is often understood to be more money or smarter money earn more or spend better it helps to step back and look beyond finances what 's going in their lives how does that make them feel do they feel unimportant or valueless how 's their family life do they have good emotional support or are they running on empty trying to fill the with other things like games for example simply telling them to stop purchasing games for example without finding a better replacement just the feelings of shame and discovering the deeper elements of your friends situation is much more complicated than giving them money or paying for a financial counselor neither of which are bad things but it may make a tremendous difference not just in your friends bank account but in their lives as well my wife and i have experienced all of this first hand so i know the predicament you are in we 've even had people in tough financial situations live in our home with us in all the situations in which we 've been close enough to understand context money was n't the primary issue it 's always been something else more often than not family but not always i 've found the book when helping hurts helpful for gaining some perspective though it 's not a perfect match since it deals more with poverty on a grand scale you may still find it helpful in terms of general principles but ultimately each situation is going to be unique and no one size fits all strategy exists to solve all problems in the end building a deeper relationship is the best path toward finding a long term solution

you should start by calling the clinic and asking them to tell you how the visit was coded some clinics have different billing codes based on the complexity of the visit if you have one thing you are seeing the doctor about that could be coded differently than if you have 4 things you are seeing the doctor about in fact even if you are there just for one but while you are there you happen to ask a few quick questions about other possible ailments the doctor could decide to use the billing code for the higher complexity if when speaking to the billing department it is determined that the visit is using a higher complexity billing code and a higher charge as a result you could then request that it be re coded with the lower complexity visit realize if you request that they will probably have to first get approval from the doctor that saw you note i am basing this answer on first hand experience about 6 months ago in illinois where the situation i described happened to me because i asked some unrelated questions about other possible ailments at the end of a visit to an after hours clinic the billing department explained that my visit was coded for 4 issues 3 of them were quick questions i asked about at the end of the visit one of which she referred me to another doctor my additional questions probably extended the visit by 3 4 minutes in my case i never got the bill reduced mainly due to my own laziness and my knowing that i would hit my deductible anyway this year of course i ca n't say for sure if this is what happened in your case or even if this practice is widespread this was the first and only time in my life that i encountered it as a side note your primary doctor would likely rarely ever bill you for a more complex visit as it likely would n't lead to much repeat business as for your last question regarding your credit if the provider decides to lower the price and you pay the lower price this in no way can affect your credit surprising update when i called the billing office months ago i had asked if they could confirm the code with the doctor and i was told they would look into it i never heard back never followed up and assumed that was the end of it well today i got a call back months later and was informed that they had re coded the visit which will result in a lower charge it 's still pending the insurance adjustment but at some point in the future i expect to receive either a credit on my next statement or a check in the mail the price difference pre insurance in my case has gone from $ to $ 235 update i did receive a check for the difference the check was dated july 20 2016 which is just over 2 months after the phone call informing me i would receive it

typical costs to buy might include one piece of advice if you 've never bought fixing problems with a house always seems to cost more than the discount in price due to the problems say the house needs a 15 k new kitchen it seems like it will be just 7 k cheaper than a house with a good kitchen that kind of thing careful with the fixer   costs to sell include doing your own cleaning repairs moving etc can save a lot   you can also choose to work without an agent but i do n't know how wise it is especially for a first time buyer in my town there are some agents that are buyers only never seller 's agents which helps keep them   agent commissions may be lower in some areas or negotiable anywhere real estate transfer taxes may be owed by buyer or seller depending on location

i do n't know which articles you have read but as far as i know the impact of automation will not be same in every industry for example take education where human interaction is intensive automation is unlikely to displace human roles delivering value but the same can not be said about manufacturing which on the other extreme is a labor intensive industry most industries fall in between these extremes meaning full automation is impractical

i am not familiar with this broker but i believe this is what is going on when entering combination orders in this case the purchase of stocks and the writing of a call it does not make sense to set a limit price on the two legs of the order separately in that case it may be possible that one order gets executed but the other not for example instead you can specify the total amount you are willing to pay net debit or receive net credit per item for this particular choice of a buy and write strategy a net credit does not make sense as joetaxpayer has explained hence if you would choose this option the order would never get executed for some combinations of options it does make sense however it is perhaps also good to see where the max gain numbers come from in the first case the gain would be maximal if the stock rises to the strike of the call or higher in that case you would be payed out $ 100 = $ 250 but you have paid $ 100 for the combination hence this leaves a profit of $ 109 disregarding transaction fees in the other case you would have been paid $ for the position hence in that case the total profit would be $ = $ but as said such an order would not be executed by the way note that in your screenshot the bid is at 0 so writing a call would not earn you anything at all

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

my revised bottom line advice offer to send a 2nd payment preferably in the form of money order or cashier 's check for the difference you are agreeing to pay i can not imagine any reason why they would object to this there is no fee to cash a check there 's less risk of error and less work involved alternatively offer to send a new check only once the other has been returned do n't issue one more full amount check while the other is still outstanding there is a good reason not to accept partial payment by them which is that accepting a partial payment of a debt comes with a varieties of strings attached depending on the nature of the debt such as with court processes may need to be etc they likely want to avoid such a situation but this does not provide any support for why they ca n't just take a second payment and then cash it all at once as a single full settlement of the debt in a perfect world you could skip all the non sense by simply having your bank put a stop payment on the old check before sending a new one unfortunately this might not work with 100 accuracy but in your case if the partial payment is a significant amount of money to you i 'd go ahead and spend the $ 20 40 to put in the order now as an extra safety on them not doing what they claim if for some incredibly stupid reason you ca n't handle this with a 2nd payment instead of one single full one it turns out banks have lots of surprising and stupid rules like stop payments on a check expiring in 6 months and they may even cash stale checks over a year old no guarantee of a stop being successful etc the real rule is they might cash the check unless you close the account sigh this is one of many reasons i never ever use checks i am not aware of any law that requires a check to be physically returned if requested or proof or destruction provided or anything like that it 's a large part of the reason why we have the ability to stop payment on a check and so void it through the bank without having any physical access to the check but this process is spotty and imperfect and can not be relied upon you can request them to do whatever you like like void it and send it back or destroy it and they can just refuse or say they 'll do it and then just not do it and you have no real useful recourse the main goal should be to avoid losing money if someone accidentally or intentionally cashes both checks so you can ask or demand refuse to pay until they return the check etc and they can respond more or less any way they want as a final piece of future advice consider no longer using checks for purposes like this switch to using something like a cashier 's check or money order offered by your bank which by their very nature takes the money out of your account immediately all ongoing connection to your bank account and is effectively like cash with the added benefit of a paper trail keep the stub and and receipt from the cashier 's check money order in case it is lost or they claim they did n't get the money

i think the top three answers by joe anthony and are giving you all the detail that you need on a technical sense although i would like to add a simple picture that that you can not really compare day trading to long term trading and that the addictive and aspect that you mentioned can not be taken out of consideration the long term investor is like someone buying a house for investment you carefully look at all offers on the market you choose by many factors price location quality environment neighborhood and extras after a long research you pick your favorites and give them a closer look until you finally choose the object of desire which will pay off in 10 years and will be a wise investment in your future now this sounds like a careful but smart person who knows what he wants and has enough patience to have his earnings in the future the short term investor is like someone running into the casino for a game of black jack roulette or poker he is a person that thinks he has found the one and only formula the philosopher 's stone the money press and is seeking immense profits in just one night and if it does not work he is sure that this was just bad coincidence and that his formula is correct and will work the next night this person is a pure gambler and running the risk of becoming addicted he is seeking quick and massive profits and does not give up even though he knows that the chances of becoming a millionaire in a casino are quite unrealistic and not better than playing in a lottery so if you are a gamer and the profit is less important than the fun then short term is the thing for you if you are not necessarily seeking tons of millions but just want to keep your risk of loss to a minimum then long term is your way to go so it is a question of personality expectations and priorities the answer why losses are bigger on high frequency signals is answered elsewhere but i am convinced in reality it is a question of what you want and therefore very subjective i have worked for both i have worked for a portfolio company that has gone through periods of ups and downs but on the long term has made a very tempting profit which made me regret that i did not ask for shares instead of money as payment these people are very calm and intelligent people they spend all their time investigating and searching for interesting objects for their portfolio and replace losers with winners they are working for your money and investors just relax and wait this has a very serious taste to it and i for my part would always prefer this form of investment i have worked for an investment broker selling futures i programmed the account management for their customers and in all those years i have only seen one customer that made the million but tons of customers that had made huge losses and this company was very emotional harsh employees changing day by day top sellers coming in all the people working there where gamblers just like their customers well it ended one day when the police came and confiscated all computers from them because customers have complained about their huge losses i am glad that i worked as a remote developer for them and got paid in money and not in options so both worlds are so different from each other the chances for bigger profits are higher on day trading but so are the chances for bigger losses so it is pure gambling if you like gambling split your investment half in long term and other half in short term that is fun and wise in one but one thing is for sure in over ten years i have seen many customers loosing loads of money in options in the future markets or currencies but i have never seen anyone making a loss in long term portfolio investment there have been hard years where the value dropped almost 30 but that was caught up by the following years so that the only risk was minimizing the profit

long convexity is achieved by owning long dated low delta options when a significant move occurs in the underlying the volatility curve will move higher instead of a linear relationship between your long position and it 's return you receive a multiple of the linear return for example share price $ 50 long 1 equals 100 shares contract of a 2 year 100 call assume this is a 5 delta option if the stock price rises to $ 70 the delta of the option will rise because it is now closer to the strike lets assume it is now a 20 delta option then   expected return on a $ 20 price move higher 100 however what happens is the entire volatility surface rises and causes the 20 delta option to be 30 delta option then the return on a $ 20 price move higher 100 this $ 200 extra gain is due to convexity and explains why option traders are willing to pay above the theoretical price for these options

i think a simplified version of what you are asking is how much benefit you will receive from lower mortgage payments on your future $ 400k roughly home loan by having a higher credit score than now and whether taking a car loan now will increase that benefit more than the value of the car loan since you already know the cost to you of the car loan the other two thing you need to know in order to answer that question are 1- the amount of increase a car loan gives your credit score and 2- how much lower your mortgage interest rate will be with a higher credit score answering 1 seems like fuzzy credit magic to me that someone else may be able to answer but 2 should be easy to determine by talking to a mortgage broker to see what rate you can get with your current credit score and finding out how much higher it needs to be in order to get a better rate then you can take the difference in mortgage payments between the two rates and compare that to your car loan value

the solution is spending restraint during the growth periods and prudent application of counter cyclical fiscal policy especially during the slow periods the usa on a strange experiment lead be greenspan of excessively low interest rates for a prolonged period of time periods of strong economic growth should feature high interest rates periods of reduced economic growth can then be countered somewhat through monetary policy the government should also endeavour to run surplus budgets during the good times and not be afraid of turning those into deficit budgets in the downturns if you run a deficit budget during a period of strong economic growth together with low cash rates you have nowhere to move when the cycle reverses   the solution now that is difficult i would say that the solution now would be to raise revenues through corporate taxes and similarly increase government spending on investments aimed at stimulating the economy use this time to invest in the much needed infrastructure maintenance and upgrades that the usa needs these need to be fast tracked into action and i would therefore consider fixing infrastructure as more important than installing new infrastructure    there are probably long term structural adjustments that need to be looked at too but i am not intimately familiar with the usa as i am australian it is clear however that austerity during economic downturns does not help end the recession or benign growth it is clear to me as an observer however that employment appears to be the big issue in the usa right now so cutting jobs is not a smart move   edit i 'll point out that my opinion comes from the australian experience our government ran surplus budgets during our period of recent growth and our reserve bank kept interest rates high when the gfc hit us in 2008 the government almost instantly reversed its fiscal policy going so far as mailing $ 900 cheques to every australian just to get cash flowing in the economy they then upon infrastructure spending programs similarly the reserve bank were able to quickly and dramatically reduce interest rates the result was that we saw 1 quarter of mildly negative growth and positive growth ever since hence no recession we ran a textbook example of counter cyclical fiscal and monetary policy which is today lauded by economists over we now have 5 unemployment low government debt relative to the oecd and high economic growth relative to the oecd

at a very high level the answer is yes that 's a good idea for money that you want to invest on the scale of decades putting money into a broad market based fund has historically given the best returns something like the vanguard s&p 500 automatically gives you a diverse portfolio with super low expenses as it sounds like you understand the near term returns are volatile and if you really think you might want this money in the next few years then the stock market might not be the best choice as a final note as one of the comments mentioned it makes sense to hold a broad market based fund for your ira as well if possible

when using a debit card there are two limits that may be imposed on the use the current balance and the maximum daily limit if the banking institution limits your daily usage that may mean that on a particular day you may not be able to make a large purchase even though you have money in the bank otherwise as long as you have funds in the account linked to the debit card you can make the transaction the catch is that as soon as the transaction is sent to the bank one of two things happens the money is immediately deducted from the account or a hold equal to the the amount of the transaction is placed on the account a hold is generally used when the transaction is done in two parts the pre scan at a restaurant or gas station the hold reduces the amount of available funds in the account a hold or an immediate deduction limits the size of future transactions to be able to make larger transactions you need to transfer more money into the account there is no debit card transaction that you can do to   artificially allow a larger transaction unless the bank is not placing a hold or doing an immediate deduction   because a debit card is linked to a bank account some accounts have overdraft protection this protection comes in two forms they either transfer your money from another account or they make a loan either way there can be costs involved

the specific state pension plan you have linked to is provided by the government of the u.k. to workers resident there more generally speaking many countries provide some kind of basic worker 's pension or social security to residents   in the united states it is called surprise social security and in canada most of us call ours canada pension plan   such pensions are typically funded by payroll deductions distinct separate from income tax deducted at source   you can learn about the variety of social security programs around the world courtesy of the u.s. social security administration 's own survey what those and many other government or state pensions have in common and the term or concept that i think you are looking for is that they are typically defined benefit type of plans   a defined benefit or db plan is where there is a promised or defined benefit i.e. a set lump sum amount such as with a cash balance type of db plan or income per year in retirement more typical note defined benefit plans are not restricted to be offered by governments only many companies also offer db plans to their employees but db plans in the private sector are becoming more rare due to the funding risk inherent in making such a long term promise to employees whereas a defined contribution or dc plan is one where employee and/or employer put money into a retirement account the balance of which is invested in a selection of funds then at retirement the resulting lump sum amount or annual income amounts if the resulting balance is are based on the performance of the investments selected that is with a dc plan there is no promise of you getting either a set lump sum amount or a set amount of annual income at retirement   the promise was up front on how much money they would contribute   so the contributions are defined often according to a matching contribution scheme yet the resulting benefit itself is not defined i.e. promised summary db plans promise you the money the benefit you 'll get at retirement dc plans only promise you the money the contributions you get now

compared with a sole proprietorship the main disadvantages of an s corporation or an llc are that it adds a lot of management overhead time and possibly money if you do n't do it all yourself and there are fees you must pay to incorporate as well as additional yearly maintenance fees which vary by state you should be able to weigh the tax savings and liability protection against the extra costs and hassle and see which way the scales tip as a rule of thumb the bigger your business gets or the more income you make the more attractive incorporating becomes note there are some additional taxes that certain jurisdictions impose on business income for example il and ca charge 1.5 tax ny is less but nyc is in nyc specifically you could actually end up paying slightly more tax as an s corp than you would as a sole proprietorship in most places though the nominal local taxes will still be less than the fica taxes you could potentially save

insurance is mostly for covering against catastrophic events it 's not something that must be helpful to you every day sounds like you health is okay and you do n't mind paying some cash in case of minor events you could try to find a policy where coverage kicks in only once an incident is big enough high deductible in such cases you payments will be significantly lower because you 'll be unable to apply with minor incidents and that saves money to the insurance company and you 're still covered against catastrophic events

what they re fishing for is whether the money was earned in the u.s.   it 's essentially an interest shelter and/or avoiding double taxation    they 're saying if you keep income you make outside the us in a bank inside the us the us thanks you for storing your foreign money here and does n't tax the interest but the nation where you earned that income might    there is no question that the airbnb income is connected with a us trade or business    so your next question is whether the fraction of interest earned from that income can be broken out or whether irs requires you to declare all the interest from that account    honestly given the amount of tax at stake it may not be worth your time researching    now since you seem to be a resident nonresident alien it seems apparent that whatever economic value you are creating to earn your salary is being performed in the united states if this is for an american company and wages paid in usd no question that 's a us trade or business but what if it 's for a swedish company running on swedish servers serving and paid in to a swedish bank which you then transfer to your us bank does it matter if your boots are on sovereign us soil   this is a complex question and some countries uk say if your boots are in our nation it is trade income in our nation others ca do not   this is probably a separate question to search or ask to be clear the fact that your days as a teacher or do not count toward residency is a separate question from whether your salary as same counts as us income

this is the bird 's eye view of how shorting works when you place an order to sell a stock short your broker attempts to grab the desired number of shares from any accounts of its other customers and makes them available for you to sell if no other customers own shares of this stock then generally you are out of luck it is more complicated like that in practice but this is just an overview     your odds are better if the particular stock has a large float i.e. a large number of shares that are actually available for trading and its short ratio is low which means relatively few shares    are currently being sold short also a large brokerage may be more likely to have access to the shares than a small niche market broker    the example you 've given 's list is a $ 600 m small cap with a comparatively low float and though i have n't been able to glean the short ratio it appears that a lot of investors are bearish on this stock and probably already had the same idea to short it   there is really no way to find out if a specific broker has shares in inventory available for shorting short of forgive the pun checking directly with the broker

i do n't know about india but here in the us banks and more friendly institutions such as credit unions use to offer the option of a secured credit card where the card was secured by placing a lock on money in a savings account equal to the credit limit on the card so for example if you had $ 1500 in savings you could have them lock say $ 1000 which you would not be able to withdraw from savings in return for a credit card account with a credit limit of $ 1000   typically you still earned interest on the full amount of the savings you were just limited to having to maintain a minimum balance in that account of $ 1000

my advice to you act like responsible adults and owe up to your financial commitments   when you bought your house and took out a loan from the bank you made an agreement to pay it back if you breach this agreement you deserve to have your credit score trashed   what do you think will happen to the $ 100k+ if you decide to stiff the bank the bank will make up for its loss by increasing the mortgage rates for others that are taking out loans so responsible borrowers get to subsidize those that their responsibilities if you were in a true hardship situation i would be inclined to take a different stance but as you 've indicated you are perfectly able to make the payments you just do n't feel like it real estate fluctuates in value just like any other asset if a stock i bought drops in value does the government come and bail me out of course not what i find most problematic about your plan is that not only do you wish to breach your agreement but you are also looking for ways to conceal your breach please think about this best of luck with your decision

another thing that insurance companies try to do with these types of vehicles is to promote the cash value of the policy the longer you participate in the policy the more your cash value goes up assuming the investments perform reasonably well the selling point is that at any time you can take out part of that cash value without impacting your insurance policy a lot of people see that benefit as being the same as either putting the money in the bank or investing it when actually they could do better if they did either of those things themselves one true advantage of the whole term policy is that if you should fall on hard times and are not able to work the premium payments can be taken out of the cash value that way even if you ca n't make the monthly payments the insurance policy basically pays for itself i actually experienced this myself many years ago after i lost my job and had some health issues i was out of work a long time but my life insurance never lapsed that in itself made it worthwhile for me

there are many financial reasons why a bank would not want to allow this while making a note of them does not answer your question i think it 's important to note why traditional cd products do not allow such contributions below are two reasons if a bank wanted to offer such a product they could hypothetically create mechanisms to account for the above and guess what these types of accounts exist they are called savings accounts they allow regular deposits but often have variable interest rates charge fees if you do n't make regular deposits or offer interest rates below a typical cd note you say you understand what a cd ladder is but you have n't explained why you do n't want to do it it sounds like what you want is the convenience of a savings account but with the higher interest rate of a cd unfortunately you have to give up a bit of interest if you want this convenience

three important things worth remembering about kelly when applied to real world edges 1 full kelly is gut volatile while it the growth of the bankroll it does so in a way that still leaves you very likely to experience massive 50%+ reductions in capital most long terms users of kelly tend to stick in the 1/4 to 1/2 kelly unit range to try and stay sane and retain a margin of error see below for how large the typical swings can be with full kelly   2 garbage in garbage out if you are making errors in pricing your actual edge kelly becomes very wrong very fast easily leading you to a high chance of ruin if you are over estimating your true edge as most people do massively over estimate their edges kelly simply pushes them far into territory where risk of ruin is high 3 a kelly user prefers to back likely outcomes over non likely ones even to the point where they prefer a smaller edge if the chances of winning are better compare the below comparison of growth between two betting scenarios decimal odds so for the chances do   in this case despite the percentage edge on the red bet being higher than that of the green in terms of bankroll growth it ends up only being roughly as good to a kelly gambler as the smaller edge on the more likely event this has an obvious effect on the types of edges you should be seeking out if given choices between

for a non technical investor meaning someone who does n't try to do all the various technical analysis things that theoretically point to specific investments or trends having a diverse portfolio and rebalancing it periodically will typically be the best solution for example i might have a long term growth portfolio that is 40 broad stock market fund 40 large industry specific market funds and 20 bond funds   if the market as a whole tanks then i might end up in a situation where my funds are invested 30 market 35 industry 35 bonds   okay sell those bonds which are presumably high and put that into the market which is presumably low   now back to    then when the market goes up we may end up at say in which case we sell some of the broad market fund and buy some bond funds back to   ultimately ending up always selling high whatever is currently the other two and buying low whatever is underperforming    having the industry specific fund(s means i can balance a bit between different sectors maybe the healthcare industry takes a beating for a while so that goes low and i can sell some of my tech industry fund and buy that    none of this depends on timing anything you can rebalance maybe twice a year not worrying about where the market is at that exact time and definitely not targeting a correction specifically   you just analyze your situation and adjust to make everything back in line with what you want this is n't guaranteed to succeed any more than any other strategy is of course and has some risk particularly if you rebalance in the middle of a major correction so you end up buying something that goes down more   but for long term investments it should be fairly sound

1 how does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation and at worst it should be viewed as a liability and has no place alongside other real investments periods of high inflation are generally accompanied with interest rates any home is a liability as has been pointed out in other answers it costs money to live in it costs money to keep in good shape and it offers you no return unless you sell it for more than you have paid for it in total in fact as long as you have an outstanding mortgage it actually costs you money to own even when not considering things like property taxes utilities etc the only way to make a home an investment is to rent it out for more than it costs you in total to own but then you ca n't live in it instead 2 how should one view payments on a home mortgage how are they similar or different to investing in low risk low reward investments like joetaxpayer said in a comment paying off your mortgage should be considered the same as putting money into a certificate of deposit with a term and return equivalent to your mortgage interest cost adjusting for tax effects what is important to remember about paying off a mortgage besides the simple and not so unimportant fact that it lowers your financial risk over time is that over time it improves your cash flow if interest rates do n't change unlikely then as long as you keep paying the interest but do n't pay down the principal assuming that the bank is happy with such an arrangement your monthly cost remains the same and will do so in perpetuity you currently have a cash flow that enables you to pay down the principal on the loan and are putting some fairly significant amount of money towards that end now suppose that you were to lose your job which means a significant cut in the household income if this cut means that you ca n't afford paying down the mortgage at the same rate as before you can always call the bank and tell them to stop the extra payments until you get your ducks back in the proverbial row it 's also possible with a long history of paying on time and a loan significantly smaller than what the house would bring in in a sale that you could renegotiate the loan with an extended term which depending on the exact terms may lower your monthly cost further if the size of the loan is largely the same as or perhaps even exceeds the market value of the house the bank would be a lot more unlikely to cooperate in such a scenario it 's also a good idea to at the very least aim to be free of debt by the time you retire even if one assumes that the pension systems will be the same by then as they are now some do n't but that 's a completely different question you are likely to see a significant cut in cash flow on retirement day any fixed expenses which can not easily be cut if needed are going to become a lot more of a liability when you are actually at least in part living off your savings rather than contributing to them the earlier you get the mortgage paid off the earlier you will have the freedom to put into other forms of savings the money which is now going not just to principal but to interest as well what is important to consider is that paying off a mortgage is a very illiquid form of savings on the other hand money in stocks bonds various mutual funds and savings accounts tends to be highly liquid it is always a good idea to have some savings in easily accessible form some of it in very low risk investments such as a simple interest bearing savings account or government bonds despite their low rate of return before you start to aggressively pay down loans because particularly when you own a home you never know when something might come up that ends up costing a fair chunk of money

index funds do leech a free ride on the of active traders   consider what would happen if literally everyone bought index funds   for a company there would be no motivation to excel get listed all the index funds are forced to buy your stock now sit on your playing or otherwise scam loot the company   go bankrupt rinse wash repeat   this who cares who john is philosophy would kill the economy dead    somebody has to actually buy stocks based on research analysis and value   company managers need to actively fear respect and court those people   they do n't need to be mutual fund managers but they do need to be somebody   maybe activist investors like warren buffett will suffice   maybe retirement fund or endowment managers like or harvard can do this   better be somebody   i 'm all for index funds just saying only a fraction of the market 's capital can be in index funds before it starts into a tragedy of the commons

for question 1 at least some us based online brokers do permit direct purchases of stocks on foreign exchanges depending on your circumstances this might be more cost effective than purchasing us listed adrs one such broker is interactive brokers which allows us citizens to directly purchase shares on many different foreign exchanges using their online platform including in france for france i believe their costs are currently 0.1 of the total trade value with a 4 € minimum i should warn you that the ib platform is not particularly user friendly since they market themselves to traders and the learning curve is steep although accounts are available to individual investors ib also wo n't automatically convert currencies for you so you also need to use their foreign exchange trading interface to acquire the foreign currency used to purchase a foreign stock which has and minuses on the plus side their f x spread is very competitive but the interface is shall we say not very intuitive i ca n't answer question 2 with specific regards to us france at least in the case of ib though i believe any dividends from a eur denominated stock would continue to accumulate in your account in euros until you decide to convert them to dollars or you could reinvest in eur if you so choose

serious answer this would be a horrible idea for you so do n't do it   theoretical answer   this gets more complicated   if you are refusing to pay your student loans this is bad for the economy because you just destroyed the value associated with that payment   you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off     however you also stimulate the economy by buying goods   i 'm just an armchair economist but i would say that the detriment of not paying your debt is higher than the benefit of paying for the goods   now lets say you never say your not paying of your loans and instead just pay the minimum payment and buy the goods   now you are helping the economy because your debt is still generating money and you are injecting real money through your payment   so you essentially made more money for the economy   so long as the system believes you can pay of the debt the system is able to hold more money   this is actually why most credit companies want you to pay the minimum balance that and the interest earns them far more money than you borrowed

your gut feeling is absolutely spot on you should n't be worrying about pension now not at the age of 25 assuming that you 're not a in the middle of the most productive part of your career and already have a fat wad of crunchy banknotes under your pillow that you 're looking to set aside for a rainy day when you wo n't be able to play at your prime any longer that does n't mean you should n't invest nor that means that you must n't save there are several factors at play here   first of all as a young person you are likely to have a high tolerance for risk there is still plenty of time to recover should expected returns not even a pension fund with the most aggressive risk return strategy might just not quite do it for you you could invest into education instead improve health obtain a profitable skill create social capital by building connections pay for experience buy a house start a family or even a business next as a young professional you 're unlikely to have reached your full earning potential yet and due to the law of diminishing marginal utility a hundred pounds per month now have greater utility i.e. positive impact on your lifestyle than a seven hundred pounds will in 7 10 years time once your earnings that is to say it 's easier to save £ 700 month from £ 3000 and maintain a reasonable level of personal comfort than carve £ 100 from £ 1300 monthly income and last but not the least lets face it from a human point of view forty years is a very long investment horizon and many things might and will change one of the downsides of uk pensions is that you have very little control over the money until you reach a certain age i suggest saving up to build a cushion consisting of cash or near cash assets the size of the stash should be such that it is enough to cover all of your expenses from a minimum of 2 months to a maximum of a year the exact size will depend on your personal comfort level whatever social net you have parents wife partner and how hard it will be to find a new source of income should the current cease to produce cash on a strategic level you can start looking into investing any surplus cash into the foundation of what will bring joy and happiness into the next 40 years of your life your or your partners training and education is one of the most sensible choices whilst you 're young starting a family is another one both might help you reach you full earning potential much quicker finding what you love to do and learning how to do it really well cash can accelerate this process bringing you quicker there you want to be if you were a start up business in front of a huge market would you rather use cash to pay dividends or finance growth

a typical manufacturer buys raw materials produces a product using labor and energy at a specific cost with some waste and then sells the product to produce income a bank buys raw materials deposits by paying interest then uses labor and energy to turn a portion of the raw materials into their product loans they then receive income interest on those loans if the income exceeds the cost to buy and produce the loans taking into account losses due to delinquencies waste the bank company has made a profit the growing profits can lead to an increase in stock prices or the paying of dividends the search for more raw materials can lead to paying more for the raw materials or by buying other factories branches or even other bank companies

did i do anything wrong by cashing a check made out to trustee of    < 401k plan > and if so how can i fix it i thought i was just    getting a termination payout of the balance yes you did it was not made to you and you were not supposed to even be able to cash it both you and your bank made a mistake you made a mistake by depositing a check that does n't belong to you and the bank made a mistake by allowing you to deposit a check that is not made out to you to your personal account how do i handle the taxes i owe on the payout given that i had a    tax free 1099 two years ago and no 1099 now it was not tax free two years ago it would have been tax free if you would forward it to the entity to which the check was intended since that would not be you but you did n't do that as such there was no withdrawal two years ago and i believe the 401k plan is wrong to claim otherwise you did however take the money out in 2014 and it is fully taxable to you including penalties you should probably talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state my personal and unprofessional opinion is that you did n't withdraw the money in 2012 since the check was not made out to you and the recipient never got it you did withdraw money in 2014 since that 's when you actually got the money even if by mistake as such i 'd report this withdrawal on the 2014 tax return however as i said i 'm not a professional and not licensed to provide tax advice so this is my opinion only i strongly suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser to get a proper opinion and guidance on the matter if it is determined that the withdrawal was indeed in 2012 then you 'll have to amend the 2012 tax return report the additional income and pay the additional tax + interest and probably underpayment penalty

founder makes available 100 equity but uses a reasonable amount of the proceeds to pay him herself a salary or wage and from that salary invests in the same initial offering to acquire shares for him herself    i see several problems    what is a reasonable salary    also this leaves the door open to the following scam   founders say that they are going to follow this plan   however instead of buying shares they simply quit after being paid the salary   they use knowledge gained from this business to start a competitor   investors are left holding an empty company    tax consequences   the founder would pay income tax on the salary   by contrast if the founder instead sells shares that would be capital gains tax which is lower in many countries e.g. the united states    why would i want to invest in a business where the founders do n't believe in it enough to take a significant equity stake    consider the amazon.com example   jeff bezos makes a minimal salary around $ 80,000 a year less than many of his employees   but he has a substantial ownership position   if the company does n't make money he wo n't   would investors really value the stocks with a p e of in 2016 if they did n't trust him to make the right long term decisions    it 's also worth noting that most initial public offerings ipos are not made when the founder is the only employee   a single employee company instead looks for private investors often called angel investors   companies generally do n't go public until they are established in some way often making money   negotiating with angel investors is different from negotiating with the public   they can personally review the books and once invested tend to have input on how the money is spent    in other words this is mostly solving the wrong problem if you talk about ipos   this might make more sense with a venture as that replaces a few angel investors with many individuals   but most ventures tend to approach things from the opposite direction   instead of looking for investors they look for customers   if they offer a useful product they will get customers   if not they never get the money    beyond all this if a founder is only going to get a fair salary some of the time then why put in any sweat equity   this works fine if the company looks valuable after a year   what if it does n't   the founder is out a year of sweat equity and has nothing in return   that happens now too but the possibility of the big return offsets it   you 're taking out the big return    i do n't think that this is good for either founders or investors   the founder trades a potentially good or even great return for a mediocre return   the investors trade a situation where both they and the founder benefit from a successful company to one where they benefit a lot more than the founder   that 's not good for either side

terminology aside   your gains for this year in a mutual fund do seem low   these are things that can be quickly and precisely answered through a conversation with your broker you can request info on the performance of the fund you are invested in from the broker   they are required to disclose this information to you    they can give you the performance of the fund overall as well as break down for you the specific stocks and bonds that make up the fund and how they are performing talk about what kind of fund it is   if your projected retirement date is far in the future your fund should probably be on the aggressive side   ask what the historic average is for the fund you 're in   ask about more aggressive funds or less if you prefer a lower average but more stable performance   your broker should be able to adequately and in most cases accurately set your expectation also ask about fees   good brokerages charge reasonable fees that are typically based on the gains the fund makes not your total investment   make sure you understand what you are paying even without knowing the management fees your growth this year should be of concern   it is exceptionally low in a year that showed good gains in many market sectors   speak with your broker and decide if you will stick with this fund or have your ira invest in a different fund finally makes a great point in that your fund may perform well or poorly over any given short term but long term your average should fall within the expected range for the type of fund you 're invested in though not guaranteed most importantly actually talk to your broker   get real answers since they are as easy to come by as posting on stack

this was an interesting little article thanks for sharing it   however i 'm a bit by part of the analysis     the authors give some fairly substantial hints that the value they are providing is not the standard deviation but most of the respondents miss these hints   the answers for the annualized rate also suggest that many of the respondents knew how to compute this given the standard deviation   the authors then go on to say that basically all of the respondents gave the correct mathematical definition of the standard deviation   then they go on to say that   gt whatever reason there was for their error it did not result from ignorance of the concept   but this strikes me as both disingenuous and incorrect   on the contrary the most likely explanation would seem to be that most of them were not aware of the concept of mean absolute deviation probably because they had either never learned it or never had occasion to apply it   i agree that people even highly trained people tend to be very bad at probability just look up the hall problem for a primer on that   but i strongly disagree with the notion that this paper provides any evidence of this tendency as there seems to be a much stronger case for ignorance   this alternative is further supported by the authors assertion that   gt with respondents revealed that they rarely had an immediate understanding of the error when it was pointed out to them   again suggesting ignorance as the most not least likely culprit   i also found it odd that they asked the respondents specifically about the standard deviation definition but not about the mean absolute deviation despite the fact that the latter is almost certainly more obscure   to that last bit i just went through the textbooks i have on hand and this concept is not mentioned in either of the undergraduate statistics probability textbooks i own nor in the one undergraduate finance textbook i have   i 'm in machine learning and not finance but it is mentioned in just one of the four graduate level texts i have on applied statistics and probability once on one page in a textbook on bayesian statistics   and the wikipedia page is terrible   in short while this is an interesting little experiment and write up i think the analysis and conclusions are inappropriate and not supported by the evidence the authors provide   that does n't mean that their conclusions are incorrect just that i disagree with the notion that this paper them   this response ended up being way long

my question is how is this new value determined   does it go off of    the tax appraised value the tax assessors values are based on broad averages and are not very useful in determining actual home value the most defensible valuation outside of a sale is a professional appraisal real estate agents may or may not give you reasonable estimates but their opinions are less valuable than that of a professional appraiser additionally agents hoping to land you as a client even if you tell them you 're not trying to sell could be motivated to over estimate in many instances a few opinions from agents will be good enough but if there is any contention a professional appraisal will be better should you prior to your death get an independent appraiser to    appraise the value of the property and include that assessment of the    properties value with the will or something the real estate market fluctuates too much to make having an appraisal done prior to your death a practical approach in most circumstances you could make arrangements so that an appraisal would be scheduled after your death here 's a good resource on the topic estimating the value of inherited real estate

this is an interesting question that may actually be better suited to quant se first of all stock prices are random variables or to be more precise stochastic processes a time ordered string of random variables   the alternative to being stochastic is being deterministic and i doubt you believe that stock prices are deterministic meaning they are fully in advance   the fact that real world events drive the randomness has no bearing on whether or not it is random   so to start i think you have confused the technical definition of random with a concept now the heart of the question is whether stock prices are memoryless   ultimately this is an empirical question that has been addressed in many academic studies   the conclusion of most of this research is that stock prices are almost memoryless in the sense that the distribution of future stock prices displays very little dependence upon past although a few persistent anomalies remain   one of the most robust deviations from is the increase in the volatility of a stock following large declines   another is persistence in volatility   in general in fact the volatility is far more predictable than the mean of stock price changes   hence is a far stronger assumption than the efficient markets hypothesis the bottom line however is that the deviations from are relatively small   as such despite its limitations it is a decent working assumption in some contexts

no supply takes 5yrs to come on line from planting to harvesting the issue on the supply side has been 1 vanilla bean prices have been falling for some time so many farmers switched to other crops 2 50%+ of all vanilla bean is grown in which experienced a which damaged a bunch of the existing crop on the demand side people are switching from artificial to more natural ingredients which actually taste much better too     so there 's a significant demand supply imbalance which will correct but it could take a long time to do so    my problem is figuring out a viable shorting mechanism as the commodity is not publicly traded and the timeframe is long

there are several types of financial advisors some are associated with brokerages and insurance companies and the like their services are often free on the other hand the advice they give you will generally be strongly biased toward their own company 's products and may be biased toward their own profits rather than your gains remember anything free is being paid for by someone and if you do n't know who it 's generally going to be you there are some who are good but i could n't give you any advice on finding them others are not associated with any of the above and serve entirely as experts who can suggest ways of distributing your money based on your own needs versus resources versus risk tolerance without any affiliation to any particular company   consulting these folks does cost you or if it 's offered as a benefit your employer some money but their fiduciary responsibility is clearly to you rather than to someone else they are n't likely to suggest you try anything very sexy but when it comes to your primary long term savings exciting is usually not a good thing the folks i spoke to were of the latter type they looked at my savings and my plans talked to me about my risk tolerance and my goals picked a fairly standard strategy from their files ran simulations against it to sanity check it and gave me a suggested mix of low overhead index fund types that takes almost zero effort to maintain rebalance occasionally between funds has acceptable levels of risk and i admit i 've been lucky has been delivering more than acceptable returns nothing exciting but even though i 'm relatively risk tolerant i 'd say excitement is the last thing i need in my long term savings i should actually talk to them again some time soon to sanity check a few things they can also offer advice on other financial decisions whether when i might want to talk to charities about gift annuity plans whether roth versus traditional 401(k makes any difference at all at this point in my career and so on

there 's an old saying   never invest in anything that eats or needs maintenance this does n't mean that a house or a or private ownership of your own company is not an investment   it just points out that constant effort is needed on your part or on the part of somebody you pay just to keep it from losing value   common stock gold and money in the bank are three things you can buy and leave alone   they may gain or lose market value but not because of neglect on your part buying a house is a complex decision   there are many benefits and many risks other investments have benefits and risks too

what you are looking here is the cost of capital because that is what you are effectively giving up in order to invest in those loans in a discounted cash flow it would be the i in the denominator for instance instead of purchasing those loans you could have lent your money at the risk free rate not 100 true but typical assumption and therefore you are taking a slight risk in those loans for a higher return   there are several ways to compute that number the one most often used would be the rate if the bank were to lend that money in this way it would be the fed funds rate plus some additional risk premium

obviously there 's some due diligence and quantitative analysis however it 's mostly just what they can secure for how much and how quickly for instance if you had a bakery that was netting and needed 750,000 to open a new location the bank will give you the loan over 10 years at 1.1 well it 's probably a good idea to take on debt that 's a month i think   edit or issue debt yourself   however let 's say you 're merging with someone in the same industry they have a market cap of 10 billion your company has a market cap of 62 billion and revenue of billion a year it 's probably a good idea to secure with equity especially because you believe the merger will help you expand

for non australian residents dividends withholding tax rate is 30   depending upon your country of residence where there is a tax treaty in place to avoid double taxation then this can be reduced   note that only dividends that are are subject to this in australia if tax has already been paid by the company then they can distribute dividends as dividends for example if you owned shares in commonwealth bank of australia cba their most recent dividend from feb 2015 paid 2 april 2015   was $ fully   no withholding tax is applicable there is no capital gains tax for non residents on share transactions there are other tax events that related to large in a company > 10 with property holdings but i 'm guessing that is not an issue

you did n't have a situation of excess contribution if you have proof that someone in fidelity actually told you what you said you might try to recover some of your losses through a lawsuit however their first and main defense would be that they 're not in the business of providing tax advice and it is your problem that you asked random person a tax question and then acted on an incorrect answer by the way that only goes to say that anything you might read here you should as well take with a grain of salt the only one who can give you a tax advice is a licensed tax professional i explained it in details in my blog post but in short it is either an ea enrolled agent with the irs credentials or a cpa certified public accountant or attorney licensed in your state back to your question excess contribution to a ira is when you contribute in excess to the limits imposed for traditional ira in 2012 the limit was $ 5000 you contributed $ 4000 this means that you were not in excess there 's nothing they can correct the 1099-r you got seems to be correct and in order what you did have was a case of non deductible contribution non deductible contribution to your ira should have been reported to the irs on form 8606 non deductible contribution creates basis in your ira withdrawals from your ira are prorated to the relation of your basis to your total value and the taxable amount is determined based on that rate it is also calculated using form 8606 so in short you should have filed a form 8606 with your 2012 tax return declaring non deductible ira and creating $ 4000 basis and then form 8606 with your 2013 tax return calculating which portion of the $ 4000 you withdrew is non taxable if your total ira in all accounts was that $ 4000 then nothing would be taxable talk to a tax adviser you might need to amend your 2012 return or send the 2012 form separately if possible and then do some math on your 2013 return if 60 days have n't passed you might want to consider depositing the $ 4000 in a roth ira and perform what is called conversion

the calculations you suggest have some issues but i think they are not necessary to answer the question it sounds like you are buying the house either way so the question really is simply whether to pay toward your house first or your loan first   in that case the answer is simple pay whichever has the highest interest rate first   make the minimum payment on the other until the first is paid off   remember this and make it your mantra for the rest of your life   if you have any debts such as credit cards that charge a rate higher than the two options you have presented do them first now be careful as you compute the interest rates   most likely you can deduct interest on your mortgage so its effective interest rate is lower it is instead of r where t is your marginal tax rate for a while the cost of mortgage insurance will make your effective mortgage rate artificially high but it sounds like you intend to get to that 20 hurdle pretty fast so my guess is that this is not a big factor congratulations on your bonus and good luck with your new home

this answer is about the usa each time you sell a security a stock or a bond or some other asset you are expected to pay tax on the net gain it does n't matter whether you use a broker or mutual fund to make the sale you still owe the tax net capital gain is defined this way gross sale prices less broker fees for selling + cost of buying the asset the cost of buying the asset is called the basis price   you or your broker needs to keep track of the basis price for each share this is easy when you 're just getting started investing it stays easy if you 're careful about your record keeping   you owe the capital gains tax whenever you sell an asset whether or not you reinvest the proceeds in something else if your capital gains are modest you can pay all the taxes at the end of the year if they are larger for example if they exceed your wage earnings you should pay quarterly estimated tax the tax authorities ding you for a penalty if you wait to pay or six figure tax bills without paying quarterly estimates   you pay net capital gains tax if one asset loses money and another makes money you pay on your gains minus your losses if you have more losses than gains in a particular year you can carry forward up to $ 3,000 i think you ca n't carry forward tens of thousands in capital losses   long term and short term gains are treated separately irs schedule b has places to plug in all those numbers and the tax programs turbo etc do too dividend payments are also taxable when they are paid those are n't capital gains they go on schedule d along with interest payments the same is true for a mutual fund if the fund has ford shares in it and ford pays $ per share in march that 's a dividend payment if the fund managers decide to sell ford and buy tesla in june   the selling of ford shares will be a cap gains taxable event for you   the good news the mutual fund managers send you a statement sometime in february or march of each year telling what you should put on your tax forms   this is great they add it all up for you they give you a nice consolidated tax statement covering everything dividends their buying and selling activity on your behalf and any selling they did when you withdrew money from the fund for any purpose    some investment accounts like 401(k accounts are tax free you do n't pay any tax on those accounts capital gains dividends interest until you withdraw the money to live on after you retire then that money is taxed as if it were wage income if you want an easy and fairly reliable way to invest and do n't want to do a lot of tax form scrambling choose a couple of different mutual funds put money into them and leave it there they 'll send you consolidated tax statements once a year download them into your tax program and you 're done you mentioned riding out bad times in cash   no no not a good idea that investment strategy almost guarantees you will sell when the market is going down and buy when it 's going up that 's sell low buy high it 's a loser not even warren buffett can call the top of the market and the bottom   ned johnson fidelity 's founder definitely ca n't

it depends on individual preference there is no hard and fast rule    in general the recommendation would be not to spend much unless you have a sufficient money for a rainy day even after spending 10 k on a good car the minute you have more money you would feed tempted to upgrade before you are 25 yrs so save and buy a cheaper decent car and put the money away   but then someone would also say if you ca n't enjoy when you are young you may never get this opportunity to enjoy when you are old

you are vastly overestimating the rate of e commerce growth   here are a couple things to keep in mind   brick and mortar sales are still increasing just not as fast as e commerce sales   e commerce is still only ~10 of all retail sales   we may have an oversupply of retail square footage but there is still demand for a lot of the space retail vacancies are at a all time low

assuming the question is will they close it for inactivity alone the answer is nope unequivocally update < my answer is geared to credit cards issues by companies that deal in credit not merchandise i.e. store cards retailer cards etc   retailers like amazon etc want to sell goods and are in the credit card business to generate sales   banks and credit companies about whom i am referring make their money primarily on interest and secondarily on service charges either point of use charged to the vendor that accepts payment or fees charged to the user > the only major issuer i will say that it might be possible is discover because i never kept a discover card   i also do n't keep department store cards which might possibly do this but i do doubt it in either of those cases too my answer is based on having 2 amex cards and blue and multiple other visa mc 's that i never use and most of these i have not for over 10 + years since i am also presuming that you are also not talking about an account that charges a yearly or other maintenance fee   why would they keep the account open with the overhead statements and other mailings etc because you might use it   you might not be able to pay it off each month   because you might end up paying thousands in interest over many years   the pennies they pay for maintaining your account and sending you new cards with chip technology etc are all worth the gamble of getting recouped from you   this is why sales people waste their time with lots of people who will not buy their product even though it costs them time and money to prospect because they might buy naturally there are a multitude of reasons for canceling a card but inactivity is not one   i have no less than 10 + inactive cards one that has a balance and two i use infrequently   i really would not mind if they closed all those accounts but they wo n't so enjoy your amex knowing that your visa will be there when you need want it the bank that issues your visa is banking on it presuming you do n't foul up financially cheers
