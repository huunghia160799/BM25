okay i 'm going to give you my opinion based on experience not any technical understanding the options by themselves are pretty meaningless in terms of determining their value the business plan going forward their growth expectations the additional options to be authorized the additional preferred stock offers they anticipate even current estimated value of the company are some of the pieces of data you will be needing i also want to say something cynical like to hell with the stock options give me cold hard but that 's just me my experience two times so far has shown stock options to be worth very very little

it is difficult to value a private company most of the valuations is based on how one feels the idea would translate into revenue in some future time the vc firms take into account various factors to determine the price but more often then not its their hunch even vc do n't make money on all picks very few picks turn out to be stars most picks lose money they have invested few picks just return their money so if you feel that the idea product brand people are great and would someday make good money invest into it else stay away

for safety if something catastrophic happens to your bank and your money is in there you will lose any not covered by fdic so if you have a very large amount of money you will store it in bonds as its much less likely that the us treasury will go bankrupt than your bank i also literally just posted this in another thread certain rules and regulations penalize companies or institutions for holding cash so they are shifting to bonds and bills fidelity for example is completely converting its $ 100 billion dollar cash fund to short term bills its estimated that over $ 2 trillion that is now in cash may be converted to bills and that will obviously put upward on the price of them the treasury is trying to issue more short term debt to balance out the demand read more here

life would be nicer had we not needed lawyers but for some things you better get a proper legal advice this is one of these things generally the united states is a union of 50 different sovereign entities so you 're asking more about texas less about the us so you 'd better talk to a texas lawyer usually stock ownership is only registered by the company itself and sometimes not even that look up street name and not reported to the government you may get a paper stock certificate but many companies no longer issue those do n't forget to talk to a lawyer and a tax adviser in your home country as well you 'll be dealing with tax authorities there as well the difference between never heard of this term before and regular stocks is that the are not publicly traded as such many things that your broker does like tax statements at source withholding etc you and your company will have to do on your own if your company plans on paying dividends you 'll have to have a us tax id itin or ssn and the company will have to withhold the us portion of the taxes do n't forget to talk to a tax adviser about what happens when you sell the stock also since the company is not publicly traded consider how will you be able to sell it if at all

as best as i can understand your payout is based on your which    is also capped at that same $ 118,500 so trump 's payout should also be    equivalently small exactly proportional to this cap not sure what you want from bernie here but that is correct is it accurate to say that trump will be paid by social security as    though his actual income was $ 118,500 rather than his full income assuming trump does pay that much depends on how much of his income is actually subject to the fica se tax yes it is accurate however i believe what confuses you is the point bernie sanders made about people getting the same benefit while being rich bernie 's point was that trump and the likes do n't need the social security income while they 're still getting it social security is designed at least theoretically to be the safety net for people of age who can not provide for themselves thus it is not supposed to be you get what you paid system this is a political discussion though social security system by definition is based on a major principle of any socialist society we as a group should support those who can not support themselves thus bernie 's point is that we should n't support trump and the likes at all since they do n't need that money but they should still pay the tax to allow supporting those who do need but can not pay in

in this case trust the real estate agent negotiating experience is one of the things you selected them for especially if they 're suggesting a lower number than you expected since they get paid on commission and so may be biased the other way   part of their job is to look for hints about how motivated this seller is and what price they might accept as opposed to what price they hope to get   and remember that the default assumption is that the two parties will meet in the middle somewhere which means it 's customary to offer 10 less to signal that you could probably be talked into it if they drop the price about 5 this is like bridge hand bidding it 's a semi formalized system of hints about levels of interest except with fewer conventions and less rationality as far as the seller paying the closing costs that 's really part of the same negotiation and doing it that way makes the discussion more complicated for the seller since they need to figure out how much more to charge you to cover this cost if they offer great factor that into what you are willing to pay but i would n't assume it or ask for it edit yes unless you have engaged a buyer 's agent which i recommend for first time buyers and maybe all their fiduciary duty is to the seller but part of that duty is to make the sale happen if the price goes too high and you walk away neither the agent nor the seller make money a bad agent can be as bad as a bad car salesman sure but if you do n't like and mostly trust your agent you are working with the wrong agent that does n't mean you give them every bit of information the seller might want but it does mean you probably want to listen to their input and understand their before deciding what your own strategy will be

let me add a few thoughts that have not been mentioned so far in the other answers   note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use not for renting out there 's a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 year 's cold rents it is considered rather expensive i do n't know how localized this rule of thumb is but i know it for germany which is apparently the op 's country too there are obviously differences between buying a house flat for yourself and in order to rent it out as others have said maintenance is a major factor for house owners and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs which is closely related to financial risk exposure e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your day time job   this plays a crucial role for landlords i know they 're all small scale landlords and most of them do put in substantial work themselves i know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case i also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that nice kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants do n't move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance    my personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment i.e. not for immediate or future personal use i 'd say that the exact circumstances are very important if you are based in a region where the buying to rental price ratio is favorable you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house then why not if this is not the case some other form of investing in real estate may be better on the other hand investing in further real estate where you live in your own house means increased lump risk you miss diversification into regions where the value of real estate may develop very differently   there is one important psychological point that may play a role with the observed relation between being rich and being landlord first of all remember that the median wealth without pensions for germany is about 51 k€ and someone owning a morgage free 150 k€ flat and nothing else is somewhere in the 7th of wealth to put it the other way round the question whether to invest 150 k€ into becoming a landlord is of practical relevance only for rich in terms of wealth people also asking this question is typically only relevant for people who already own the home they live in as buying for personal use will typically have a better return than buying in order to rent but already people who buy for personal use are on average wealthier or at least on the track to become more wealthy in case of fresh home owners than people who rent this is attributed to personal characteristics and the fact that the downpayment of the mortgage enforces saving behaviour which is typically kept up once the house is paid and is anyways found to be more pronounced than for non house owners in contrast many people who decide never to buy a home fall short of their initial savings investment plans e.g. putting the 150 k€ into an etf for the next 21 years and in the end spend considerably more money and this group of people rarely invests into directly becoming a landlord   assuming that you can read german here 's a relevant newspaper article and a related press release

that depends on how you 're investing in them trading bonds is arguably riskier than trading stocks because it has a lot of the same risks associated with stocks plus interest rate and inflation risk that 's true whether it 's a recession or not holding bonds to maturity may or may not be recession proof or perhaps more accurately low risk as argued by depending on what kind of bonds they are if you own bonds in stable governments e.g. u.s. or german bonds or bonds in certain states or municipalities or highly stable corporations there 's a very low risk of default even in a recession you did n't see companies like microsoft google or apple going under during the 2008 crash that 's absolutely not the case for all kinds of bonds though especially if you 're concerned about systemic risk just because a bond looks risk free does n't mean that it actually is look how many aaa rated securities went under during the 2008 recession and many companies lehman brothers went bankrupt outright to assess your exposure to risk you have to look at a lot of factors such as the credit worthiness of the business how recession proof their product is what kind of security or insurance you 're being offered etc you ca n't even assume that bond insurance is an absolute guarantee against systemic risk that 's what got aig into trouble in fact they were writing credit default swaps cds which are analogous to insurance on loans basically the seller of the cds insures the debt promises some kind of payment if a particular borrower defaults when the entire credit market seized up people naturally started asking aig to make good on their agreement and compensate them for the loans that went bad unfortunately aig did n't have the money and could n't borrow it themselves hence the government bailout to address the whole issue of a company going bankrupt it 's not necessarily the case that your bonds would be completely worthless so i disagree with the people who implied that this would be the case they 'd probably be worth a lot less than you paid for them originally though possibly as bad as pennies on the dollar depending on how much under water the company was also depending on how long it takes to work out a deal that everyone could agree to my understanding is that it could take a long time before you see any of your money i think it 's also possible that you 'll get some of the money as equity rather than cash in fact that 's how the u.s. government ended up owning a lot of chrysler they were chrysler 's largest lender when they went bankrupt so the government ended up getting a lot of equity in the business as part of the settlement incidentally there is a market for securities in bankrupt companies for people that do n't have time to wait for the bankruptcy settlement naturally people who buy securities that are in that much trouble generally expect a steep discount to summarize

margin trades let you post a margin of a certain proportion of the value of the trade as collateral against the price of a trade and pay off the difference between the current price and the price that you bought at any losses incurred are taken from the margin so the margin has to be maintained as prices change in practice this means that when the price moves significantly from the buying price a margin call is triggered and the buyer has to increase their posted margin the vast majority of the foreign exchange trades done every day are margin trades as effectively are all spread bets margins get reset overnight whether or not a call has occurred

it 's also not really anything new    for a several decades a huge percentage of the population has been essentially living paycheck to paycheck and with essentially zero cash savings to cover emergencies   it 's possible that it is slightly worse now in the sense that with the pervasive use of credit amp debit cards etc few people deal in cash or change very often and so they do n't even have the old proverbial piggy banks or jars bottles filled with end of day pocket change that they can raid for $ 50 or $ 100   oh and that really has nothing to do with bubbles     edit plus another thought just the other day there was an article about how millennials are saving for retirement in higher amounts and at earlier ages than prior generations if that is true then a likely corollary would be that they are not engaged in plain old savings at the same rate i.e. what money they are stashing away is all heading to wall street and is difficult to access in an emergency and if they did access 401k savings it would likely be as a loan rather than paying the early withdrawal penalties amp taxes

if the billing cycle is 2 to 3 months it would mean banks have to give credit for a longer period and it makes the entire business less profitable as well as more risky compared to the monthly billing cycle for example the current monthly billing cycle with a date say of 14th means if you swipe your card on 1st day one would effectively get a credit for 30 + 14 around 44 days if you swipe on last day one would get a credit for 14 days on an average 22 days of credit if we make this 3 months the credit period would increase on an average 90 + 52 days from a risk point of view on monthly cycle if there is non payment its flagged much earlier compared to a 3 months cycle on offering different dates shop around in the older times the cycles were different however with individuals having several cards and trying to optimize every purchase to maximize credit period quite a few banks have streamlined it to monthly cycle shop around and some banks should be able to offer you different dates

let me do the math .6 not large = really tiny since not large = small etc   i suggest that even a small chance that you need to explain this to anyone in the future is a sign to avoid the risk yes there are times that it 's illegal a real estate office may not deposit escrow funds into anything but a segregated escrow account   in your case even if legal it messes up the books and can cost you more in grief than the tiny amount saves you in cash

this is n't as rigorous as it should be but may offer some useful insight into how big and small companies differ operationally putting apple aside larger companies tend to sell larger volumes of products even if they 're devices or turbines relative to what smaller companies can sell obviously in absolute terms as well   they are also able to negotiate volume discounts as well as payment terms   this allows them to finance sales through their supply chain   however their large direct competitors are able to do the same thing as well   competitive forces then drive prices down smaller businesses without these advantages of scale tend to have to charge higher margins since they have to pay directly and if their clients are large businesses finance the sale small businesses still have higher proportional costs of operation   sadly my reference here is a study i performed for the south african revenue service about ten years ago and not available online however the time taken by a small business to manage admin tax hr is a greater proportion of revenue than for larger companies if the small business is a start up with big investment from venture finance then they could subsidise their selling price run at a loss and try and gain scale   enough there is a fantastic article on this by joel ben and jerry 's vs. amazon for the average highly competitive smaller company the best choice is to chase design quality premium markets in order to justify the higher margins they have to charge    and that 's what makes apple interesting as a case study   they were a small company in the presence of giants intel microsoft ibm   they were forced to concentrate on design and premium markets in order to justify their need for higher margins   it almost did n't work but then they broke through   now they 're in the unique position of having gained scale but are still small enough relative to other electronics manufacturers to continue charging that premium by volume their sales are still relatively small but their margins make them a giant this type of variation from market to market makes developing some sort of solution very unlikely but the general requirement holds that smaller companies must charge higher margins in order to create equivalent profits to larger companies which must gain scale through volume

there 's several approaches to the stock market the first thing you need to do is decide which you 're going to take the first is the case of the standard investor saving money for retirement or some other long term goal he already has a job he 's not really interested in another job he does n't want to spend thousands of hours doing research he should buy mutual funds or similar instruments to build diversified holdings all over the world he 's going to have is money invested for years at a time he wo n't earn spectacular amazing awesome returns but he 'll earn solid returns there will be a few years when he loses money but he 'll recover it just by waiting the second is the case of the day trader he attempts to understand ultra short term movements in stock prices due to news rumors and other things which stem from quirks of the market and the people who trade in it he buys a stock and when it 's up a fraction of a percent half an hour later sells it this is very risky requires a lot of attention and a good amount of money to work with and you can lose a lot of money too the modern day trader also needs to compete with the high frequency trading desks of wall street firms with super optimized computer networks located a block away from the exchange so that they can make orders faster than the guy two blocks away i do n't recommend this approach at all the third case is the guy who wants to beat the market he 's got long term aspirations and vision but he does a lot more research into individual companies figures out which are worth buying and which are not and invests accordingly this is how warren buffett made it big you can make it work but it 's like starting a business it 's a ton of work requires a good amount of money to get going and you still risk losing lots of it   the fourth case is the guy who mostly invests in broad market indexes like 1 but has a little money set aside for the stocks he 's researched and likes enough to invest in like 3 he 's not going to make money like warren buffett but he may get a little bit of an edge on the rest of the market if he does n't and ends up losing money there instead the rest of his stocks are still chugging along the last and way is to treat it all like magic buying things without understanding them or a clear plan of what you 're going to do with them you risk losing all your money you also risk having it stagnate good to see you want to avoid it

you need to talk to the 401(k administrator or hr for the exact details typically you can only borrow 50 of your balance and can pay it back up to a ten year term some plans have different rules this is just a common offering   the larger issue is whether the loan prevents you from making further deposits till repaid this would cost you not just the growth in the account but the matched deposits for those years that would be a deal killer for me if that were the case i 'd drop my deposits to only get the match and save for a real deposit without the loan

tl;dr when everything is going great it 's not really a problem it 's when things change that it 's a problem finally home loans are extended over extremely long periods i.e. 15 or 30 years making any fluctuations in their value short lived even less reason to be obsessed over their current value relative to the loan your post is based on the assumption that you never move in that case you are correct being underwater on a mortgage is not a problem the market value of your house matters little except if you sell it or it gets the primary problem arises if you want to sell there are a variety of reasons you might be required to move in all of these scenarios it is a major problem if you can not sell your options generally are in the first option you will destroy your credit this may or may not be a problem the second is a major inconvenience the third is ideal but often people in this situation have money related problems student loans can deferred if needed mortgages can not a car is more likely to be a lower payment as well as a lower amount underwater generally the problem comes when people buy a mortgage assuming certain things whether that 's appreciation income stability growth etc when these change they run into these problems and that is exactly a moment where being underwater is a problem

in the case of a vehicle with a lien there is a specific place on the title to have a lien holder listed and the holder of the lien will also hold the title until the lien is cleared usually this means you have to pay off the loan when you purchase the vehicle if that loan is held by a bank meet the seller at the bank and pay the loan directly with them and have them send the title directly to you when the loan is paid this usually involves writing up a bill of sale to give to the bank when paying the loan the only thing you 're trying to avoid here is paying cash to the seller who then keeps the cash without paying the lien holder who then keeps the title and the motorcycle do n't pay the seller if they do n't have the title ready to sign over to you

stop order is shorter term for stop loss order   the point being that is intended as a protective measure   a buy stop order would be used to limit losses when an investor has sold a stock short   meaning that they have borrowed stock and sold it in hopes that they can take advantage of a decline in the stock 's price by replacing the borrowed stock later at a cheaper price   the idea is to limit losses due to a rising stock price   meanwhile a sell stop order would be used to limit losses on a stock that an investor actually owns by selling it before the price declines further the important thing to keep in mind about stop orders is that they turn into market orders when the stop price is reached   this means that they will be filled at the best available price when the order is actually executed   in fast moving markets this can be a price that is quite different from the stop price a limit order allows an investor to ensure that they do not buy sell a stock at more less than the specified amount the thing to keep in mind is that a limit order is not guaranteed to execute a stop limit order is a combination of a stop loss order and limit order in that it becomes a limit order instead of a market order when the stop price is reached links to definitions stop order stop limit order limit order market order

sure it is quite easy depending on income   if one receives a bonus that is high in relationship to their income it is very easy to max out a 401 k prior to when one intended   the later in the year such a bonus occurs the more likely that one will max out prematurely    if one only has a single employer in the year the custodial company will not accept amounts above the max so one need not worry about that case   if there is more than one employer a refund is typically issued with the appropriate tax withheld    assume that a person makes about 60 k per year   they intend to put 12k into their 401 k thus have their contribution set to 20   by the beginning of september they have 8 k into their retirement but they also receive a bonus of 50k.   their 401 k contribution for that bonus will be 10 k and thus they have maxed out their individual contribution for the year so they will not be able to contribute for the rest of the year including the first paycheck in september   they will miss out on any match that the company may supply   while that sucks it should be relieved by the bless of receiving such a large bonus

my theory is that for every stock you buy you should have an exit strategy and follow it   it is too hard to let emotions rule if you let your default strategy be let 's see what happens and emotional investing will almost never serve you well   so before buying a stock set a maximum loss and maximum gain that you will watch for on the stock and when it hits that number sell   at the very least when it hits one of your numbers consciously make a decision that you are effectively buying it again at the current price if you decide to stay in when you do this set a new high and low price and repeat the above strategy

i think your approach of looking exclusively at usd deposits is a prudent one here are my responses to your questions 1 it is highly unlikely that a usd deposit abroad be converted to local currency upon withdrawal the reason for offering a deposit in a particular currency in the first place is that the bank wants to attract funds in this currency 2 interest rate is a function of various risks mostly supply and demand central bank policy perceived risk etc in recent years low interest rate policy as led by u.s. european and japanese central banks has led particularly low yields in certain countries disregarding their level of risk which can vary substantially thus e.g. eastern europe has very low yields at the moment in spite of its perceived higher risk some countries offer depository insurance   3 i would focus on banks which are among the largest in the country and boast good corporate governance i.e. their ownership is clean and transparent and they are true to their business purpose thus ownership is key then come financials country depository insurance low external threat low war risk is also important most banks require a personal visit in order to open the account thus i would n't split much further than 2 3 banks assuming these are good quality

most of the work done as an analyst or associate depends on whether or not you are assigned to a deal at the time   if not you 're probably going to be working on pitch books which is basically putting together a firm template style powerpoint file pitching a company to a potential client   the pace is slower but the work is boring   if you 're on a deal then the stress level is raised as you have to respond to client demands and timing immediately   you are typically doing some basic forms of analysis modeling and then importing that into a powerpoint report   you are working on these reports endlessly turning review comments from associates vp 's and md 's   as you get higher up the chain you do more of the communicating to all the various parties to the deal third party diligence buy side etc and client facing activities   you can find a lot of good info on the finance industry on   i 'm personally in transaction services doing diligence work at a big4 and i 've always found wso to be a good resource for at least basic info   you obviously need to weed out the people who are don't know anything current students but plenty of guys actually in the industry post regularly

how is suggesting to them that they smoke cannabis instead of taking addictive pills that destroy lives a bad thing there is a huge crisis in the country it 's a massive problem where i live we do n't have a cannabis problem   people who think the choice of an addict not getting high and getting high are fooling themselves if they think 99 of addicts are going to choose that 's like preaching only education kids are going to fuck    in places where medical marijuana has been introduced the use of opiates plummets because they go for whatever drug is the path of least resistance what i recommend is that people who are addicted to and ca n't get off of them because they want the high but the high keeps them physically addicted is that they replace that high with something that does n't keep them physically addicted    that is n't calling them weak or stupid or any other thing with a negative connotation that you 've in your head that i did n't say it 's smart and it works in places where that is an option

interest is a fee that you pay in order to use someone else 's money once you 've made the deal pretty much anything you do that reduces the total interest that you pay does so by reducing the time for which you get to use their money as an extreme example consider a thirty year interest only loan with a balloon payment at the end if you pay it off after fifteen years you pay half as much interest because you had the use of the money for half as long the same thing happens when you make biweekly payments you reduce the total interest that you pay by giving up the use of some of the borrowed money sooner that 's not necessarily bad but it 's also not automatically good

gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways 1 as a means and 2 as an end   means takes the shape of currency in this form we value gold in the same way we value the dollar it allows us to purchase things we want as a medium of exchange gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange for example i would be valuing one of gold to be worth a dog if i traded a dog for one of gold the value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction gold as an end is valued for its own sake a good example of this is a who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic gold possesses this is closer to the true value of gold than using it as a means but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor you know what i could use right now a block of gold said no one ever   but even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake this is usually done because gold provides a function for example if people no longer want to jewelry then a will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends to sum up gold has a perceived value for most people and an intrinsic value to a select few for the time being

as you pointed out in reference to cost cutting fiduciary lawsuits come out when things go wrong when directors successfully increase stock value everyone including shareholders is happy    i 'm not sure exactly where the best place is to look for such cases but here 's what my google fu yielded   example the media business excerpts from ruling in paramount paramount is sold to viacom at a lower price than 's offer shareholders sue paramount claims they were looking out for long term but shareholders sued them for screwing them out of maximal share value   example law on the fiduciary duty of directors to maximize the wealth of corporate dodge v. ford motor co ford had a majority share in his company and wanted to stop paying dividends to shareholders so he could expand his business at trial ford testified to his belief that the company made too much money and had an obligation to benefit the public and the firm ’s workers and customers the court disagreed as his motor company was set up for profit not charity ford was ordered to resume paying dividends   interestingly i found many more lawsuits where corporations sacrificed long term for short term it seems once incorporated this is where the internal incentives and pressures lead many managers lawsuits are merely one of these pressures

this is a complicated subject because professional traders do n't rely on brokers for stock quotes   they have access to market data using level ii terminals which show them all of the prices buy and sell for a given stock    every publicly traded stock at least in the u.s. relies on firms called market makers   market makers are the ones who ultimately actually buy and sell the shares of companies making their money on the difference between what they bought the stock at and what they can sell it for   sometimes those margins can be in hundreds of a cent per share but if you trade enough shares well it adds up the most widely traded stocks apple microsoft bp etc may have hundreds of market makers who are willing to handle share trades   each market maker sets their own price on what they 'll pay the bid to buy someone 's stock who wants to sell and what they 'll sell the ask that share for to someone who wants to buy it    when a market maker wants to be competitive he may price his bid ask pretty aggressively because automated trading systems are designed to seek out the best bid ask prices for their trade   as such you might get a huge chunk of market makers in a popular stock to all set their prices almost identically to one another   other market makers who are n't as enthusiastic will set less competitive prices so they do n't get much maybe no business   in any case what you see when you pull up a stock quote is called the best bid ask price   in other words you 're seeing the highest price a market maker will pay to buy that stock and the lowest price that a market maker will sell that stock   you may get a best bid from one market maker and a best ask from a different one   in any case consumers must be given best bid ask prices market makers actually control the prices of shares   they can see what 's out there in terms of what people want to buy or sell and they modify their prices accordingly   if they see a bunch of sell orders coming into the system they 'll start dropping prices and if people are in a buying mood then they 'll raise prices market makers can actually ignore requests for trades whether buy or sell if they choose to and sometimes they do which is why a limit order a request to buy sell a stock at a specific price regardless of its current actual price that someone places may go unfilled and die at the end of the trading session   no market maker is willing to fill the order nowadays these systems are largely automated so they operate according to complex rules defined by their owners   very few trades actually involve human intervention because people ca n't digest the information at a fast enough pace to keep up with automated platforms so that 's the basics of how share prices work   i hope this answered your question without being too confusing good luck

if there are a lot of houses for sale can you be sure that in a year or two you can sell yours how long does the average house in that area stay on the market before it is sold what percentage of houses never get sold   if it ca n't be sold due to the crowded market you will be forced to rent the house the question for you then is how much rental income can you get compare the rental income to your monthly cost of owning and managing the house   one benefit to buying a house in a market that is easy to rent a house would be if you are forced to move quickly then you are n't stuck being 3 months into a 12 month lease   keep in mind that markets can change rather dramatically in just a few years housing costs were flat for much of the 90 's then up in the first half of the last decade and after a big drop they are one a slow climb back up but the actual path they are on depends on the part of the us you are in   the rule of thumb in the past was based on the fact that over a few years the price would rise enough overcome the closing costs on the two transactions unfortunately the slow growth in the 90 's meant that many had to bring checks to closing because the equity gained was n't enough to overcome the closing costs due to low down payment loans    the fast growth period meant that people got into exotic loans to maximize the potential income when prices were going up 10 20 a year   when prices dropped some found that they bought houses they could n't afford but could n't sell to break even on the transaction they were stuck and had to default on the mortgage   in fact i have never seen a time frame when the rule of thumb ever applied

i think the idea is freedom of the press goes to the guy who owns the press   in terms of false advertising that applies to an outright lie our paint lasts forever and it does n't there are all kinds of laws and precedent which protects advertisers from their own lies look up as an example judges figure you if you are stupid enough to believe for example any claim made regarding supplements alternative medicine natural foods and so on well too bad for you    it sucks but that s the way it is    even if for some reason preventing negative reviews were possible legally they 'd just use sock to post positive ones look at many of the comments concerning products on reddit can it be that so many people are passionate owners of tesla that any discussion of its many failings are immediately down    well there is the stupid factor i guess

futures exchanges are essentially auction houses facilitating a two way auction while they provide a venue for buyers and sellers to come together and transact be that a physical venue such as a pit at the cme or an electronic network such as globex they do n't actively seek out or find buyers and sellers to pair them together the exchanges enable this process through an order book as a futures trader you may submit one of two types of order to an exchange market order this is sent to the exchange and is filled immediately by being paired with a limit order    limit order this is placed on the books of the exchange at the price you specify if other participants enter opposing market orders at this price then their market order will be paired with your limit order in your example trader b wishes to close his long position to do this he may enter a market sell order which will immediately close his position at the lowest possible buy limit price or he may enter a limit sell order specifying the price at or above which he is willing to sell in the case of the limit order he will only sell and successfully close his position if his order becomes the lowest sell order on the book all this may be a lot easier to understand by looking at a visual image of an order book such as the one given in the explanation that i have published here stop orders for futures finally not that as far as the exchange is concerned there is no difference between an order to open and an order to close a position they 're all just buy or sell orders whether they cause you to reduce exit a position or increase establish a position is relative to the position you currently hold if you 're flat a buy order establishes a new position if you 're short it closes your position and leaves you flat

in some jurisdictions you can donate the development rights you and the family still own it but nothing can ever be built on it in some cases you will still be able to build a cabin or similar structure on a few acres but the bulk has to be left natural   the advantage is that by giving away the logging or other development rights the land loses much of its value thus reducing the tax value of the land there are some hoops that you need to jump through but this is not an unusual transaction another choice it to see if the land touches any similar conservation areas it can be possible to donate the land to the government or other conservation group but it would revert to the family if they ever tried to sell or develop the land because you do n't own it you would not have to pay taxes but and could still use it by donating the land to the same organization a your neighbors it can streamline the paperwork for people who want to through hike

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

in most cases of purchases the general advice is to save the money and    then make the purchase paying cash for a car is recommended over    paying credit for example for a house getting a mortgage is    recommended says who these rules of thumb hide the actual equations behind them they should be understood as not as the word of god the basics the basic idea is if you pay for something upfront you pay some fixed cost call it x where as with a loan you need to pay interest payments on x say i as well as at least fixed payments p at timeframe t resulting in some long term payment ix your assumption to some this obviously means upfront payments are better than interest payments as by the time the loan is paid off you will have paid more than x. this is a good rule of thumb like 's equations at low x high i and moderate t because all of that serves to make the end result ix > x. counter examples are there circumstances where the opposite is true here 's a simple but contrived one you do n't pay the full timeframe suppose you die declare bankruptcy move to another country or any other event that reduces t in such a way that xi is less than x. this actually is a big concern for older debtors or those who contract terminal illnesses as you ca n't squeeze those payments out of the dead this is basically manipulating the whole concept let 's try a less contrived example suppose you can get a return higher than i. i can currently get a loan at around 3 due to good credit but index funds in the long run tend to pay taking a loan and investing it may pay off and would be better than waiting to have the money even in some less than ideal markets this is basically manipulating t to deal with ix even less contrived and very real world suppose you know your cash flow will increase soon a promotion an inheritance a good market return it may be better to take the loan now enjoy whatever product you get until that cash flows in then pay it all off at once the enjoyment of the product will make the slight additional interest worth it this is n't so much manipulating any part of the equation it 's just you have different goals than the loan home loan analysis for long term mortgages x is high usually higher than a few years pay it would be a large burden to save that money for most people i is also typically fairly low p is directly related to i and the bank ca n't afford to raise payments too much or people will rent instead meaning p needs to be affordable this does not apply in very expensive areas which is why cities are often mostly renters t is also extremely long usually mortgages are for 15 or 30 years though 10 year options are available even with these shorter terms it 's basically the longest term loan a human will ever take this long term means there is plenty of time for the market to have a fluctuation and raise the investments current price above the remainder of the loan and interest accrued allowing you to sell at a profit as well consider the opportunity cost while saving money for a home you still need a place to live this additional cost is comparable to mortgage payments meaning x has a hidden constant the cost of renting often x + r > ix making taking a loan a better choice than saving up conclusion the general advice is a good heuristic for most common human payments we have relatively long life spans compared to most common payments and the opportunity cost of not having most goods is relatively low   however certain things have a high opportunity cost if you ca n't talk to hr you ca n't apply for jobs phone if you ca n't get to work you ca n't eat car and if you have no where to live it 's hard to keep a job house for things with high opportunity costs the interest payments are more than worth it

the advantage of an ira or 401k is you get taxed effectively one time on your income whereas you get taxed effectively multiple times on some of the money in a taxable account you have to consider it from the perspective of time value of money the concept that an amount of money now is the same value as a greater amount of money in the future and in fact if you put your money in an investment the principal at the start can be considered the same value as the principal + earnings at the end in both traditional and roth ira you pay taxes on the entire value of money once remember that the principal when depositing is the same value as the principal + earnings when withdrawing the only difference is when year deposited or year withdrawn so the main difference between the two is the tax rate when depositing vs. tax rate when withdrawing i 'll give you an example to demonstrate we will assume you invest $ 1000 of pre tax wages it grows at 5 per year there 's a 25 flat tax now and in the future you withdraw it after 20 years and withdrawals are not subject to any penalty

you do n't want to set up your investment account as a savings or spending budget account   there are a couple of reasons   first investment account balances change daily based on the market   if you set it up as a budget account then your budget category balances would need to have money added or removed from them daily as the market value changes   second because you are investing for retirement this money will be untouchable for many years there is no need to include that in your spending budget instead enter your monthly investment amount as an expense transaction not a transfer to another budget account   if for example you are sending $ 400 per month to your retirement account just enter that as a monthly $ 400 expense out of your checking account assigning it to a retirement category   that money then leaves your budget if you want to see the value of your investment account in ynab so that your net worth is accurate add the account as an investment account   the value will not affect your budget categories but it will affect the net worth on the all accounts page   either set it up as an online account so that the balance will update automatically or add it as a manual account and simply update the balance manually when you get your monthly statement

why would you trade a lower interest rate over a higher one   i would n't use the mortgage to pay off the car   also you should have loan lease payoff on your auto insurance which if the car is totaled means your loan would be paid by insurance   i do n't think you 'd be able to take advantage of that if your car payments become one with the mortgage   finally not all mortgage interest may be deductible also i ca n't think of any way you 'd be able to use the car loan to pay off the mortgage   you would n't be able to borrow more than the car is worth and for a new car it loses quite a bit of value immediately

it 's all about risk these guidelines were all developed based on the risk characteristics of the various asset categories bonds are ultra low risk large caps are low risk you do n't see most big stocks like coca cola going anywhere soon foreign stocks are medium risk subject to additional political risk and currency risk especially so in developing markets and small caps are higher risk more to gain but more likely to go out of business   moreover the risks of different asset classes tend to balance each other out some when stocks fall bonds typically rise the recent credit crunch being a notable but temporary exception as people flock to safety or as the fed adjusts interest rates when stocks soar bonds do n't look as attractive and interest rates may rise a bummer when you already own the bonds is the us economy with the dollar in the dumps while the rest of the world passes us by your foreign holdings will be worth more in dollar terms if you 'd like to work alternative asset classes real estate gold and other commodities etc into your mix consider their risk characteristics and what will make them go up and down a good asset allocation should limit the amount of down that can happen all at once the more conservative the allocation needs to be the less down is possible at the expense of the up as for what risks you are willing to take that will depend on your position in life and what risks you are presently are exposed to including your job how stable your company is and whether it could fold or do layoffs in a recession like this one whether you 're married whether you have kids where you live for instance if you 're a realtor by trade you should probably avoid investing too much in real estate or it 'll be a double whammy if the market crashes a good financial advisor can discuss these matters with you in detail

in most cases an rent with option to buy is structured as follows the renter buyer will place a deposit premium not the same as a security deposit that purchases the option the right to buy the home at a future date at a specific price the renter buyer will often pay extra rent in addition to market rent   many times this additional rent is contracted to be applied to the purchase price of the home the risks to the renter buyer are as follows also something to note many people will recommend that you use the additional rents to be applied specifically towards the downpayment   be wary of this   there are no institutional lenders available today that will allow the additional rent money to be applied towards your downpayment   that means you must come up with the downpayment in cash before closing   the additional rent payments can   be used towards the price    hope that helps   good luck

bank of america has been selling off their local branches to smaller banks in recent years   here are a few news stories related to this along with the branch buildings the local customers savings and checking accounts are sold to the new bank   it is interesting that you were told that your savings account is being sold but that your checking account will remain with   i guess it depends on the terms of the particular sale here are your options as i see it let the savings account move to the new bank and see what the new terms are like   you might actually like the new bank   if you do n't you can shop around and close your account at the new bank after it has been created close your account now before the move   if you have a different bank you 'd like to move to there is no need to wait since your checking account is apparently staying with bofa you could move all your money from your savings account to your checking account closing your savings account   then after mid august when the local branch switches to the new bank and everyone else 's savings account has moved you can call up bofa and tell them you want to move some of the money from your checking account into a new savings account if you really have your heart set on staying with bofa option 3 looks like a good easy choice to address your other concerns bank of america is a big credit card company so i doubt that your credit card is being sold off   your credit card account should stay as is   even if your savings account and checking account are at a different bank there is no need to switch credit cards your savings and checking accounts have nothing to do with your credit report or score so there is no concern there   if you end up wanting to switch to a new credit card with a different bank there are minor hits to your credit score involved with applying for a new card and closing your current card but if i were you i would not worry about your credit score in this   switch credit cards if you want a change and keep your credit card if you do n't

the forward curve for gold says little in my opinion about the expected price of gold the jan 16 price is 7.9 or so higher than the jan 12 price this reflects the current cost of money today 's low interest rates when the short rates were 5 the price 4 years out would be about 20 higher no magic there the site you linked to was in german so i looked and left i 'm certain if you pulled up the curve for platinum or silver it would have the identical shape that 7.9 rise over 4 years the yield curve on the other hand   is said to provide an indication of the direction of the economy a steep curve forecasting positive growth

and you have hit the nail on the head of holding gold as an alternative to liquid currency there is simply no way to reliably buy and sell physical gold at the spot price unless you have millions of dollars exhibit a the stock symbol gld is an etf backed by gold its shares are redeemable for gold if you have more than 100,000 shares then you can be assisted by an authorized participant read the fund 's details less than 100,000 shares no physical gold for you with gld 's share price being $ this would mean you need to have over 15 million dollars and be financially solvent enough to be willing to exchange the liquidity of shares and dollars for illiquid gold that you would n't be able to sell at a fair price in smaller denominations the etf trades at a different price than the gold spot market so you technically are dealing with a spread here too exhibit b the futures market accepting delivery of a gold futures contract also requires that you get 1000 units of the underlying asset this means 1000 gold bars which are currently $ each this means you would need $ that you would be comfortable with exchanging for gold bars which in contrast securitized gold gold in an etf for instance can be hedged very easily and one can sell covered calls to negate transaction fees hedge and collect dividends from the fund quickly any spread tax that you encounter from opening the position also leverage no bank would grant you a loan to buy 4 to 20 times more gold than you can actually afford but in the stock market 4 20 times your account value on margin is possible and in the futures market 20 times is pretty normal initial margin and maintenance margin effectively bringing your access to the spot market for physical gold more so within reach caveat emptor

the amount you contribute will reduce the taxable income for each paycheck but it wo n't impact the level of your social security and medicare taxes a 401(k plan is a qualified deferred compensation plan in which an    employee can elect to have the employer contribute a portion of his or    her cash wages to the plan on a pretax basis generally these    deferred wages commonly referred to as elective contributions are    not subject to income tax withholding at the time of deferral and    they are not reflected on your form 1040 pdf since they were not    included in the taxable wages on your form w-2 pdf however they    are included as wages subject to withholding for social security and    medicare taxes in addition employers must report the elective    contributions as wages subject to federal unemployment taxes you might be able to keep this up for more than 7 weeks if the company offers health dental and vision insurance your contributions for these policies would need to be paid for before you contribute to the 401k. of course these items are also pre tax so they will keep the taxable amount at zero if there was a non pretax deduction on your pay check that would keep the check at zero but there would be taxes owed this might be union dues but it can also be some life and disability insurance polices most stubs specify which deductions are pre tax and which are post tax warning if you get the company match some companies give you the maximum match for those 7 weeks then zero for the rest of the year others will still credit you with a match at the end of the year saying if you should get the benefit it is not required that they do this check the company documents you could also contribute post tax money which is different than roth 401 k for the rest of the year to keep the match going note if you are turning 50 this year or are already 50 then you can contribute an additional $ 5,500

the penny pink sheet stocks you tend to see promoted are the ones a with small public floats or b they are thinly traded   this means that any change in buy sell volume will have an outsized effect on the stock 's share price even when the underlying fundamentals are not so great   promoters are frequently paid based on how much they can move a stock 's price but such moves are not long lasting   they peter out when the trading volumes return to more normal ranges for the stock because all of the hype has died out there are some small cap nasdaq stocks which can be susceptible to promotion for the same reason they have small floats and/or are thinly traded   once someone figures out the best targets they 'll accumulate a position and then start posting all kinds of news on the web in an effort to drum up interest so they can sell off their position into the buying that follows    the biggest problem with penny pink sheet stocks is that they frequently fail to publish reliable financial statements and their ownership is of a dubious nature   in the past these types of stocks have been targeted by organized crime which ran their own pump and dump operations as a way to make relatively easy money   this may still be true to some extent today    be wary of investing in any publicly traded firm that has to use promoters to drum up investor interest because it can be a serious red flag   even if it means missing out on a short term opportunity research the company before investing   read its financials understand how it has behaved through its trading history learn about the products services it is selling   do your homework   otherwise you are doing the investing equivalent of taking your money and lighting it on fire remember there 's a good reason these companies are trading as penny pink sheet stocks and it generally has nothing to do with the notion the promoters will tell you that somehow the market has missed out on this amazing opportunity   pump and dump schemes which lie at the heart of almost all stock promotion rely on convincing you the investor that you 're smart enough to see what others have n't   i hope this helps good luck

gt vouchers pay the private schools what the public school would have received in the first place the public school does n't pay as much in taxes and has a government supported administration that cuts waste at every chance so the private schools collect all the voucher money figure out they ca n't turn a profit and go bankrupt sending all the kids they had enrolled back to the public schools or forcing another issuance of another voucher costing the school system double to triple for every kid that gets screwed that way which means the public school system does n't have that money in their budget either forcing further cuts    i have never considered this before i can see the issue with it you 've changed my view on vouchers being a good system   it also causes self segregation at the schools because all the affluent parent can afford to drive their kids to another school poor kids need a bus that 's not covered by a voucher so we end up with schools that are 90 black hispanic with only 50 speaking english in a county that is 66 white while around the corner is a 90 white school where only 5 speak spanish when over 25 of the population does and that 's just the racial demographics that are immediately obvious the poverty levels are harder to get data on   i do n't consider this is necessarily a bad thing though if schools are self segregated it allows for teachers to teach in a certain way that is better for their demographic    school security officer bob on a power trip or the delinquent in the hall the problem is the same fearing for safety when there really should n't be a problem   you do n't get either of those at schools where there is almost no poverty you will have the same problem in canada if you move to a school district that has a significant amount of poverty   gt;and i get the feeling you do n't live near a population center   i do n't live in a big city but i live in a suburban area

based on what you 've said i think buying a rental is risky for you it looks like you heard that renting a house is profitable and zillow supported that idea vague advice + a website designed for selling + large amounts of money = risky at the very least that does n't mean that rental property is super risky it just means that you have n't invested any time into learning the risks and how you can manage them once you learn that your risk reduces dramatically in general though i feel that rental property has a good risk reward ratio if you 're willing to put in the time and energy to learn the business then i 'd encourage you to buy property if you 're not willing to do that then rentals will always be a crap shoot one thing about investing in rental property is you have the ability to have more impact on your investment than you do dropping money in the stock market which is good and bad

the crucial insight is that the alternative to early exercise of an american call is not necessarily to hold it to expiry but to sell it and selling it at its value is always better than exercising it   note that this holds only for options on assets that do n't pay dividends here 's the proof using put call parity we know that at expiry t we have using a call and a put both struck at k = k if this is not clear to you consider the case where s is less than equal to or greater than k at maturity and go through each of them if the stock s does n't pay any dividends and there is no cost of carry etc we can replicate both sides now at time 0 we just buy one call sell one put that gives us the left hand side buy the stock and borrow money so that at time t we have to repay k that gives us the right hand side that means that now we only need to borrow df k where df is the discount factor and is less than one assuming the good old world where interest rates are positive thus c(0 = df k.   rearranging gives c(0 = df k +   that 's the value of the call if we sell it or hold it however if we exercise we only get = k now we see that c(0 > because we subtract less < k and add

you get paid interest on deposits because banks only keep a fraction of the deposits on hand the rest is put to other uses such as loaning money to others if you deposit money and yield 1 interest the bank is able to fund an auto loan at 5 by saving you are actually making more capital available in the marketplace fixed or durable assets like gold real property or durable goods are different their value is based on attributes such as demand gold oil or location real property if you bought an apartment in manhattan in 1975 it appreciated greatly in value over the course of 30 years but it did so because demand for apartments in new york city grew while the supply of apartments grew more slowly the government prints money for two core reasons think of it this way money is valuable because it is money

as other uses have pointed out your example is unusual in that is does not include any time value or volatility value in the quoted premiums the premiums you quote are only intrinsic values   for well in the money options the intrinsic value will certainly be the vast majority of the premium but not the sole component having said that the answer would clearly be that the buyer should buy the $ 40 call at a premium of $ 10   the reason is that the buyer will pay less for the option and therefore risk less money or buy more options for the same amount of money   since the buyer is assuming that the price will rise the return that will be realised will be the same in gross terms but higher in relative terms for the buyer of the $ 40 call    for example if the underlying price goes to $ 60 then the buyer of the $ 40 call would potentially double their money when the premium goes from $ 10 to $ 20 while the buyer of the $ 30 call would realise a potential 50 profit when the premium goes from $ 20 to $ 30 considering the situation beyond your scenario things are more difficult if the bet goes wrong   if the underlying prices expires at under $ 40 then the buyer of the $ 40 call will be better off in gross terms but may be worse off in relative terms if it expires above $ 30   if the underlying price expires between $ 40 and $ 50 then the buy of the $ 30 will be better off in relative term having lost a smaller percentage of their money

the s&p 500 index from 1974 to present certainly looks exponential to me 1974 is the earliest data google has   if you read jeremy siegel 's book there are 200 year stock graphs and the exponential nature of returns on stocks is even more evident   this graph only shows the index value and does not include the dividends that the index has been paying all these years   there is no doubt stocks have grown exponentially aka have grown with compound interest for the past several decades and compounded returns is definitely not a myth   the cagr on the s&p 500 index from 1974 to present has been ^ 1 40 1 here is another way to think about compounded investment growth when you use cash flow from investments dividends capital gains to purchase more investments with a positive growth rate the investment portfolio will grow exponentially   if you own a $ 100 stock that pays 10 dividends per year and spend the dividends every year without reinvesting them then the investment portfolio will still be worth $ 100 after 40 years   if the dividends are reinvested the investment portfolio will be worth $ after 40 years from the many years of exponential growth +

while it is a true loss as you 've determined is not a cash cost per se a cash cost would be a decrease in cash holdings   inflation does not take your cash balance it devalues it so it is an accrued loss central banks are extremely lazy in determining inflation so the highest resolution available at a public level is monthly   in the united states there is a small project that tries to calculate daily inflation rates and seems to do a decent job but unless if you are a customer of a particular financial institution you will suffer a lag   the small project refuses to make the data public in real time or even allow outside analysis in the uk the office for national statistics is responsible for consumer inflation statistics   the methodology is not readily available but considering the name it is most likely an inferior index instead of the optimal fisher index as it is in the us to calculate the accrued cost due to inflation simply multiply the amount of money held by the price index value at the beginning of the time held and divide by the price index value at the end of the time held for example to determine the amount of value lost since march 2014 multiply the money held by the price index value for march 2014 and divide by june 2014

they are entirely free to do whatever they want with the shares in particular they can sell them to whomever they choose no restrictions on who can sell when and to whom are a common thing with startups publicly traded companies are regulated in a much stricter way than private companies so until the ipo the sales are limited to the otc markets but even that can be restricted by bylaws for example ownership can only be limited to a group of investors approved by the board as an employee your grant was approved by the board but when you come to sell the buyer was not and the company may not agree to vet them bottom line is that it is not illegal to impose all kinds of restrictions on what the employees can do with their shares as long as the shares are not listed on a public stock exchange even after the company goes ipo with one class other classes may remain restricted

just to go against the grain here sometimes loaning money to friends is the right thing to do for example they had a loved one die and need the money to cover funeral expenses until the life insurance pays out here you may consider it your ethical duty to loan the money or you may not it does not make sense from a financial point of view you are unlikely to charge interest and you are taking all the risk but sometimes you put your financial prudence aside because being a good person and a great friend is more important it is true that the general rule should be not to loan money to friends and particularly never loan money you can not afford to lose but there are exceptions to every rule i 'll note that you may be best off with a plain english non contract make it absolutely as simple as possible as others have pointed out specify a repayment date or schedule note what happens if they miss the deadline specify interest if appropriate get it signed by you and the other person and make sure you consider what happens if your friend does n't honour the agreement for that kind of money it is also worth considering collateral

context my parents overseas japan sent me a little over $ 100,000 to    cover an expensive tuition payment and moderate living expenses in    2014 they are not us residents green card holders or citizens they did not remit the tuition payment directly to the school i am a    resident for tax this is enough to answer yes that 's basically the set of requirements for filing you received > $ 100 k from a non us person and you yourself are a us person you have to report it and unless it is taxable income it is a gift taxable income is reported on the form 1040 gifts are reported on the form 3520 the fact that in japan it is not considered a gift is irrelevant gift tax laws vary between countries some many do n't have gift taxes at all but the reporting requirement is based on the us law and the us definition of gift as i said above if it is not a gift per the us law then it is taxable income and then you report all of it regardless of the amount and pay taxes had they paid directly to the institution you would n't need to count it as income gift to you because you did n't actually receive the money so no income and it went directly to cover your qualified education expenses so no gift but this is not the case in your situation whether or not this will be reported by the irs back to japan i do n't know but it was probably already reported to the authorities in japan by the banks through which the transfers went through as to whether it will trigger an audit does n't really matter it was most likely reported to the irs already by the receiving banks in the us so not reporting it on your tax return either as income or on form 3520 may indeed raise some flags

it might seem like the pe ratio is very useful but it 's actually pretty useless as a measure used to make buy or sell decisions and taken largely on its own pretty useless becomes utterly and completely useless stocks trade at prices based on future expectations and speculation so that means if traders expect a company to double its profits next year the share price could easily double there are reasons it might not increase so much and there are reasons it could increase even more than that but that 's not the point the price is now double but the earnings is still the same so the pe ratio is double and this doubling is based on something some traders know or think they know but other traders might not know or not believe once you understand that what use is a pe ratio really the pe ratio of a company might be low because it is in a death spiral with many traders believing it will report lower and lower profits in years to come and the lower the pe ratio of a given company gets probably relatively the more likely it is to go bust if you buy a stock with a low pe ratio you must do so because you feel you understand the company understand why the market is viewing it negatively believe that the negativity is wrong or over done and believe that it will turn around equally a pe ratio might be high but be an excellent buy still because it has excellent growth prospects and potential even beyond what is priced in already lets face it someone has been buying at the price that 's put that pe ratio where is is right they might be wrong of course or not or they might be justified now but circumstances might change before earnings ever reach the current priced in expectation you 'll know next year probably to answer your actual question first you should now understand there is no such thing as a stock that is on sale just stocks that are priced broadly according to the markets consensus on its value in years to come the closest thing being a stock that is over sold but one man 's over sold is another man 's train crash remember so what to actually look for the only way to on average make good buy and sell decisions is to know about investing and trading buy some books i have 12 understand the businesses you propose to invest in and understand their which may also mean understanding national and international economics somewhat

careful   i would personally need a lot more than $ 5 more per hour to go from w-2 employment to 1099 employment   it boils down to two reasons 1 employers pay a huge amount of taxes on behalf of their employees and 2 you would have to pay all of your own withholding up front your current proposal from them does n't account for that there are also risks that you face as a 1099   on the first item your employer currently pays 6.2 of your social security tax you pay the other 6.2 if you go to 1099 status you will be self employed as an independent contractor and have to pay the full 12.4 out of your increased 1099 wages   on the second item your employer also does your withholding out of your paychecks based on what you tell them on a form w-4 if you 're disciplined enough to pay this out yourself in estimated taxes every time you get a paycheck great many people are n't and just see a much bigger paycheck with no taxes out of it and end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year   overall there are some other considerations like healthcare and other benefits these will not be available to you as a 1099 employee you can also be terminated unless you have a specific contract length with the company   as i see it not including any benefits you would receive you 're looking at less money in your pocket at $ as a contractor than at your $ your pay net social security deductions is $ 48 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = = as a 1099 $ you would net $ 50 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = =   then there are the rest of taxes etc to figure out your real take home pay   i 'm not a tax advisor but i would be very careful to get the whole picture figured out before jumping i would ask for a lot more with the added risk you would take as an independent too

see publication 505 specifically the section on annualized income installment method which says if you do not receive your income evenly throughout the year for example your income from a repair shop you operate is much larger in the summer than it is during the rest of the year your required estimated tax payment for one or more periods may be less than the amount figured using the regular installment method the publication includes a worksheet and explanation of how to calculate the estimated tax due for each period when you have unequal income   if you had no freelance income during a period you should n't owe any estimated tax for that period however the process for calculating the estimated tax using this method is a good bit more complex and confusing than using the short method in which you just estimate how much tax you will owe for the year and divide it into four equal pieces   therefore in future years you might want to still use the equal payments method if you can swing it   it 's too late for this year since you missed the april deadline for the first payment   if you can estimate the total amount of freelance income you 'll receive even though you might not be able to estimate when you 'll receive it you can probably still use the simpler method   if you really have no idea how much money you 'll make over the year you could either use the more complex computation or you could use a very high estimate to ensure you pay enough tax and you 'll get a refund if you pay too much

over on quantitative finance stack exchange i asked and answered a more technical and broader version of this question should the average investor hold commodities as part of a broadly diversified portfolio   in short i believe the answer to your question is that gold is neither an investment nor a hedge against inflation although many studies claim that commodities such as gold do offer some diversification benefit the most credible academic study i have seen to date should investors include commodities in their portfolios after all new evidence shows that a mean variance investor would not want to allocate any of their portfolio to commodities this would include gold presumably nevertheless many asset managers such as pimco offer funds that are marketed as real return or inflation managed and include commodities including gold in their portfolios   pimco has also commissioned some research strategic asset allocation and commodities claiming that holding some commodities offers both diversification and inflation hedging benefits

it is my opinion that part of having a successful long term relationship is being committed to the other person 's success and well being this commitment is a form of investment in and of itself the returns are typically non monetary so it 's important to understand what money actually is money is a token people exchange for favors if i go to a deli and ask for a sandwich i give them tokens for the favor of having received a sandwich the people at the deli then exchange those tokens for other favors and that 's the entire economy people doing favors for other people in exchange for tokens that represent more favors sometimes being invested in your spouse is giving them a back rub when they 've had a hard day the investment pays off when you have a hard day and they give you a back rub sometimes being invested in your spouse is taking them to a for a professional massage the investment pays off when they get two tickets to that thing you love at the small scale it 's easy to mostly ignore minor monetary discrepancies at the large scale which i think £ 50k is plenty large enough given your listed net worth it becomes harder to tell if the opportunity cost will be worth making that investment it pretty much comes down to will the quality of life improvements from that investment be better than the quality of life improvements you receive from investing that money elsewhere as far as answering your actual question of how should i proceed there is n't a one size fits all answer to this it comes down to decisions you have to make such as in theory it 's easy to say that everyone should be able to trust their spouse but in practice there are a lot of people who are very bad at handling money it can be worthwhile in some instances to keep your spouse at an arms length from your finances for their own good such as if your spouse has a gambling addiction with all of that said it sounds like you 're living in a £ 1.5 m house rent free how much of an opportunity cost is that to your wife has she been freely investing in your well being with no explicit expectation of being repaid this can be your chance to provide a return on her investment if it were me i 'd make the investment in my spouse and consider it rent while enjoying the improvements to my quality of life that come with it

you can not have off campus employment in your first year but investments are considered passive income no matter how much time you put into that effort obviously you need to stay enrolled full time and get good enough grades to stay in good standing academically so you should be cautious about how much time you spend day trading if the foreign market is also active in a separate time zone that may help you not to miss class or otherwise divert your attention from your investment in your own education i have no idea about your wealth but it seems to me that completing your degree is more likely to build your wealth than your stock market trades otherwise you would have stayed home and continued trading instead of attending school in another country

i use gnucash it 's a bit more like quickbooks than plain quicken but it 's not all that complicated probably the most difficult part is understanding the idea of income accounts   benefits for short term planning i use scheduled transactions if i 'm spending more than i have it 'll show up here every paycheck and dollar spent or invested is recorded with the exact date i anticipate it will happen 30 days in advance if that would overdraw my checking account the future minimum balance field will go negative and red this lets me move float to higher interest savings and retirement funds and avoids overdraft fees or other mishaps by looking 30 days ahead in detail i have enough time to transfer from illiquid assets for longer term planning i keep a spreadsheet around that plans out annual expenses if i 'm spending more than i earn it shows up here i estimate everything expenses savings taxes and income i need this because i have a lot of expenses that are far less frequent than monthly or paycheck ly the beauty of it is that once i 've got it in place i can duplicate the sheet and consider tweaks for say taking a new job or moving or even just changing an insurance plan probably less relevant for those with access to nhs especially when moving to take a new job it 's not as straightforward as comparing salaries and thus having a document for the status quo to start from lets you focus on the parts that changed

new zealand has a statute of limitations on debt of six years twelve years if it is a debt acknowledged in a deed probably not the case here if you have had no contact with the bank for that time the debt expires if you got convicted of a crime in relation to the debt e.g. fraud then that would fall under a different statute of limitations but a bank is n't going to bother doing that over $ 600 and the courts would probably not accept the case anyway

the most tax efficient way to get some cash would be to sell some stocks from the fidelity account that have the lowest capital gains the tax will typically be 15 of the capital gains this will be a one time cost which should save you money compared to paying 7.5 on the loan year after year tax on selling the stock options will probably be higher since you imply there would be high capital gains and some of the proceeds might even be taxed as income not capital gains

people are downvoting you but the reality is that a cushion is n't a bad idea   not a perpetual thing but until the op gets set up with a job place to live etc   they know the job is going to work out etc they might want to have some cash as they are likely not going to forgo eating etc that said i would treat it as money to be used in place of a credit card with the high rates etc    again i am not saying spend the money i am being realistic that it takes money to secure an apt and unless you can borrow cheaper than 6 elsewhere i know i could probably get unsecured money cheaper than that where i live but i do n't know the ops situation   i would n't invest it given the situation personally   if you have a great job it wo n't matter you will build up past 1200 soon and can then start to invest a portion of that cash   if you do n't then you should n't be risking debt money especially if your level of sophistication in the market has you here asking the question   that 6 savings is tax free as well so you need to gross it up based on your tax situation   also make note of any currency conversions that would need to happen so depending on what you want to invest in currency risk could be a real concern as well   one other reason i think getting down at least a portion of the debt could be good is simplification   ca n't spend money you do n't view yourself as having   some people might be more disciplined to reign in spending when they see a lower number in their account   i 'm personally not one of those people but again i would likely kill the debt off now just to have one less thing on my mind but only as soon as i am stable know where i am going to live have enough to eat and relatively sure that will continue in the future

the difference in interest is not a huge factor in your decision   it 's about $ 2 per month    personally i would go ahead and knock one out since it 's one less to worry about   then i would cancel the account and cut that card up so you are not tempted to use it again to address the comments cutting up the card is not the ultimate solution   the solution is to stop borrowing money get on a strict budget live on less than what you bring home and throw everything you can at this high interest debt    the destroying of the card is partly symbolic it 's a gesture to indicate that you 're not going to use credit cards at all or at least until they can be used responsibly not paying a dime of interest   it 's analogous to a recovering alcoholic pouring out bottles of booze   sure you can easily get more but it 's a commitment to changing your attitude and behavior yes leaving the card open will reduce utilization and improve or not hurt credit score but if the goal is to stop borrowing money and pay off the other card then once that is achieved your credit score will be significantly improved and the cancelling of the first card will not matter   the card really both cards should never ever be used again

it depends where you are going to live and how you are going to pay for your new accommodation if you are moving within the uk and intend to buy another house you run into the problem that you will find it hard to get a second mortgage if you rent out the house in kent you will probably have to change the mortgage basis on it to a mortgage that allows for letting normal residential mortgages exclude that entirely which would allow you to take out a residential mortgage it depends how much equity you have in the house if most of the value of the house is mortgaged then you 'll 1 find it hard to re mortgage on a commercial mortgage 2 may find it hard to cover the costs by letting and 3 are very sensitive to house prices falling also bear in mind that for the past three months in a row house prices in the uk have mostly either stagnated or fallen so you can not guarantee any increase in value of the house in kent what i 'm saying is there is no crystal ball that will tell you what 's financially the best thing to do talk to estate agents find out how much the house would sell for how much it would rent for talk to your mortgage lender and find out if they will let you rent it out talk to other mortgage lenders and find out how much a commercial mortgage would cost do the sums find out if renting the house would cover the costs in which case you can gamble on the housing market continuing to rise do n't rely on house prices continuing to rise as they have done before certainly where i live due to the number of new houses being built and other economic issues house prices have fallen over the past few months and may well continue to fall as more and more new houses come on the market

technically no there is very little security in the us for bank drafts with your bank account routing number it is very easy for people to draw funds without your authorization another thing people can do is buy stuff online with demand drafts essentially it works like a credit card number where the create an electronic version of a check to purchase things there is generally no password pin or signature requirement that said it is printed on every check you write so keeping it private is n't really practical i 'd make sure you trust anyone you give it to and watch your account statements closely an important thing to know is that a routing number is n't a one way deal if you give out the number for someone to wire you money they can just as easily draft on the account

i 'm going to take a different path than the other answers given how low interest rates are depending on your credit buying a house may be a great strategy   however i would not put more than 20 down   putting more than 20 down unnecessarily ties up cash that could be used more productively elsewhere you need to figure out your cash flow situation both for the near term and for the long term for the short term you probably wo n't need to help your kids with tuition   they will likely be able to get a combination of grants scholarships and loans that will cover the cost   however the loans are generally not low interest and that is a huge amount of debt for someone so young   if you want to help pay your kids tuition you should at least budget that amount now for the long term without any retirement savings you may be hurting in a couple decades   since you also do n't have a home your living situation may be a problem   buying a home today may be the prudent move because that will hopefully be an appreciating asset and with a 30 year mortgage you 'll own it outright by 75 which takes a big strain off of retirement costs $ 1400 a month in bills apart from rent mortgage with no kids in the house is this correct sounds high   i would also recommend looking at your basic expenses and seeing what you can do without if you are cash strapped

the whole point of the envelope system as i understand it is that it makes it easy to see that you are staying within your budget if the envelope still has cash in it then you still have money to spend on that budget category if you did this with a bunch of debit cards you would have to have a way to quickly and easily see the balance on that card for it to work there is no physical envelope to look in if your bank lets you check your balance with a cell phone app i guess that would work but at that point why do you need separate debit cards just create a spreadsheet and update the numbers as you spend the balance the bank shows is always going to be a little bit behind because it takes time for transactions to make it through the system i 've seen on my credit cards that sometimes transactions show up the same day but other times they can take several days or even a week or more so keeping a spreadsheet would be more accurate or at least more timely but all that said i can check my bank balance and my credit card balances on web sites i 've never had a desire to check from a cell phone but at least some banks have such apps my daughter tells me she regularly checks her credit card balance from her cell phone so i do n't see why you could n't do it with off the shelf technology side not not really related to your question i do n't really see the point of the envelope system personally i keep my checkbook electronically using a little accounting app that i wrote myself so it 's customized to my needs i enter fixed bills like insurance premiums and the mortgage payment about a month in advance so i can see that that money is already spoken for and just when it is going out besides that what 's the advantage of saying that you say $ 50 per month for clothes and $ 100 for gas for the car and $ 60 for snacks and if you use up all your gas money this month than you ca n't drive anywhere even though you have money left in the clothes and snack envelopes i mean it makes good sense to say the mortgage payment is due next week so i ca n't spend that money on entertainment i have to keep it to pay the mortgage but i do n't see the point in saying i ca n't buy new shoes because the shoe envelope is empty i 've accumulated $ 5000 in the shampoo account since i went bald and do n't use shampoo any more but that money is off limits for shoes because it 's allocated to shampoo

everyone is usually better off without insurance   a very few people are much better off with insurance   insurance is a gamble and when you lose you win   very few people lose badly enough to win   most people just pay money into insurance and never get as much back as they pay in   for most people in most lives insurance is a bad deal   the reason people crave insurance is because they can not calculate the probability of something bad happening as well as an actuary can do so   the gap in knowledge between you and and actuary is what make insurance providers rich and you poor   they are smart you are not   you think some terrible thing is going to happen to you they know it probably wo n't   so they sell you a product you probably will never need   anyhow most people ca n't understand probability and how to analyze risk so they wo n't get what i 'm saying here understanding the real cost of risk is the first lesson in understanding money and wealth   rich people usually understand the value and cost of risk   hence they only buy insurance when they expect to lose that is to win   we rich people do everything only when we know already we are going to win   we do n't gamble unless we are the house   when a self made rich man buys something its because he knows already he is going to come out ahead on it most probably

let me just add that while you do n't need to write the date received on the back of the check you could why let 's say someone was late in paying you and you wanted to document the fact that they were late i 've had late paying customers send me a check dated on the due date but really they just pre dated the check and sent it 60 days past due so let 's say i want to establish and document the pattern in case it becomes a future legal issue when you deposit or cash a check an image of the front and back is made and the person or company who issued the check will have those images stored as part of their transaction history it used to be that the original physical cancelled check was returned to the payer but that was another era so write the date received on the back next to the endorsement endorse the check and take a photo of the front and back along with the postmark on the envelope to document that they are a late payer this way if it ever becomes a he said she said issue you can easily show they have a history of paying late if the payer looks at their check images they 'll see your received date note next to the endorsement granted this is a lot of trouble for a unique situation in 20 + years of running a business i 've actually had the foresight to do this a handful of times with offenders and in only one case did it come in handy later on but boy was i glad to have those photos when i needed them

i do not know anything about retail investing in india since i am in the us however there are a couple of general things to keep in mind about gold that should be largely independent of country first gold is not an investment aside from a few industrial uses it has no productive value it is at best a hedge against inflation since many people feel more comfortable with what they consider real money that is not subject to what seems to be arbitrary creation by central banks second buying tiny amounts of gold as coin or bullion from a retail dealer will always involve a fairly significant spread from the commodity spot price the spot price only applies to large transactions retail dealers have costs of doing business that necessitate these fees in order for them to make a profit you must also consider the costs of storing your gold in a way that mitigates the risk of theft the comment by is on this point it appeared while i was typing this answer you might find this planet money piece on the process costs and risks of buying gold bullion in the us if you feel that you must own gold as an inflation hedge and it is possible for residents of india you would be best off with some kind of gold fund that tracks the price of bullion

i expect the company wanted to pay you for a product on a purchase order rather than as   a contract laborer whatever would they be willing to re issue the check to you as a sole proprietor of a business named abc consulting or anything like that you can register your sole proprietor business with the state using a doing business as dba or fictitious name and then open the bank account for your business using the check provided by the customer as the first deposit there is likely a smaller registration fee for the dba if they wo n't re issue the check and you have to go the llc route up $ 125 doing odd jobs or borrowing from a friend or parents seriously anyone can earn that amount of money in a week or two besides the filing fee for the llc your bank may require you to provide an operating agreement which is not required by the state the operating agreement can be simple or more complex if you have a partner even if it 's a spouse if you do have a partner it is essential to have such an agreement because it would specify the responsibilities and benefits allocated to each partner particularly in the event of equity distributions taking money out of the business or liquidating and ending the llc there are websites that will provide you a boilerplate form for operating agreements but if your business is anything more than just single member llc you should pay an attorney to draw one up for you so the wording is right it 's a safeguard against potential future lawsuits and while we 're at it do n't forget to obtain a ein equivalent to a ssn from the irs for your llc there 's no cost but you 'll have to have it to file taxes as a business for every year the llc exists and has income good luck

in the past 10 years there have been mutual funds that would act as a single bucket of stocks and bonds a good example is fidelity 's four in one the trade off was a management fee for the fund in exchange for having to manage the portfolio itself and pay separate commissions and fees these days though it is very simple and pretty cheap to put together a basket of 5 6 etfs that would represent a balanced portfolio what s even more interesting is that large online brokerage houses are starting to offer commission free trading of a number of etfs as long as they are not day traded and are held for a period similar to ntf mutual funds   i think you could easily put together a basket of 5 6 etfs to trade on fidelity or td ameritrade commission free and one that would represent a nice diversified portfolio the main advantage is that you are not giving money to the fund manager but rather paying the minimal cost of investing in an index etf overall this can save you an extra .5 1 annually on your portfolio just in fees here are links to commission free etf trading on fidelity and td ameritrade

i personally spoke with a questrade agent about my question to make a long story short in a margin account you are automatically issued a loan when buying u.s. stock with a canadian money whereas in a registered account e.g. rrsp the amount is converted on your behalf to cover the debit balance me what happens if i open an account and i place an order for u.s. stocks    with canadian money is the amount converted at the time of transfer    how does that work agent in a margin account you are automatically issued a loan    for a currency you do not have however if you have enough buying    power it will go through the interest on the overnight balance is    calculated daily and is charged on a monthly basis we do not convert    funds automatically in a margin account because you can have a debit    cash balance agent in a registered account the canada revenue agency does not allow a debit    balance and therefore we must convert your funds on your behalf    to cover the debit balance if possible we convert automatically    overnight for a registered account agent for example if you buy u.s. equity you will need usd to buy it    and if you only have cad we will loan you usd to cover for that    transaction for example if you had only $ 100 cad and then wanted to    buy u.s. stock worth $ 100 usd then we will loan you $ 100 usd to    purchase the stock in a margin account we will not convert the funds    automatically therefore you will remain to have a $ 100 cad credit and    a $ 100 usd debit balance or a loan in your account me i see it means the longer i keep the stock the higher interest    will be agent well yes however in a registered account there will be not    be any interest since we convert your funds but in a margin account there will    be interest until the debit balance is covered or you can manually    convert your funds by contacting us

your lack of numbers makes the question a difficult read   what i 'm hearing is i want a house requiring a mortgage my income   this alone is enough to suggest it 's a bad deal on a personal note when my wife and i bought our house it was 2.5x our income 20 down so the mortgage was exactly 2x income and my wife was convinced we were in over our heads   the use of a partner who will take a portion of the profit is interesting but does n't change the fact that you are proposing to live in a house that costs far too much for you if you are determined to buy such a house i 'd suggest you do it with the plan to rent out a room or two to roommates if you are living in an area where the cost of buying is so high the demand for rentals is likely high as well   absent a plan to bring ion more income i see no good coming from this heed the warnings posted in the other two answers as well

i would not argue if its more difficult its different and it much depends what kind of stocks you refer to i take large caps as example the players are different companies and even may hedge in the commodities futures market while in big caps this and other entities mainly invest of course there ’s hft in large caps too futures often come with way higher leverage lower spread and less commissions than stocks attracting retail and institutional speculators hft another big difference is that commodity prices react to all kind of news events stocks do too but not that much and frequent this kind of reactions big caps only do on earnings or on news directly affecting the company commodities are much more volatile on geo economic political news events this combined with higher leverage hft produces astounding moves   to sum it up the players are different and act different than in large stocks liquidity may be another thing

if you can afford it i would give her the money   it is likely that she will not pay you back and then you would lose a friend this friend can not afford the car   if you want to be a really good friend offer different options like buying a junker until she can save up for a nicer car based on your comment i am gathering the following sorry to beat a dead horse but lending the money is akin to giving her the money   so if you do n't want to give it to her then you ca n't lend it to her she has car fever she thinks she can not live her life without this car   she can and you know it   in a week or two she will have forgotten all about it since you can not really say no for whatever reason you can pocket veto the idea through distraction   make her do a lot more legwork and in the end she will probably forget about it so what i might suggest to her is that she goes to a credit union or a local bank to try for a car loan and see what they say   you might sweeten the deal by saying they typically have lower interest rates then the place that is offering the loan now   alternatively you should tell her to let the car deal sit for a couple of weeks to see if you can talk them down on price   the key is stalling so the next thing her now the dad in me is going to come out please consider yourself yelled at for these items have a nice day

maybe you can explain their position   it seems to me they should be in favor of   1 universal healthcare public or private for the reduced uncertainty and increased mobility to the working class    2 ending government subsidies of things like energy and farming so that the markets will properly transition and adjust based on the economic realities rather than manipulated markets    3 copyright reform to enable easier access to aged content by creators and the public at large including the creation of new businesses 4 infrastructure investments that fuel growth in the forms of market development and market access    5 industry based for things like waste management a la germany to preclude the need for the government to dictate the standards and practices while actually dealing with the problem   but as far as i have seen they are opposed to all of these things     for example in 1 above what i 've seen is that business likes to have the upper hand in the employer employee equation they like when employees ca n't up and leave because the children would lose health care   but the same informational that enable capitalism to function to their benefit are stifled in that case preventing the employment market from properly equalizing     to put it another way barriers to entry to prevent people from competing with you sounds great but it usually bites you your investors and everyone else in the ass because your products services are stagnant and you are n't competing   why do the so called fiscal conservatives seem to be okay with ass biting externalities and artificial barriers to entry

past results are not a predictor of future results there is no explicit upper bound on a market and even if individual companies values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term plus there 's been some   shift from managing companies for dividends to managing stocks for growth which will tend to increase the upward push trying to time the market to guess when it 's going to move in any particular direction is usually closer to gambling than investing the simplest answer remains a combination of buy and hold and dollar cost averaging buy at a constant number of dollars per month or whatever frequency you prefer and you will automatically buy more when the stock fund is lower less when it is higher that takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end personally i add a bit of contrarian buying to that i increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed since i had money i would n't need any time soon buy and hold and i was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that i was n't at significant risk of losing the investment that 's one of the things which causes me to be categorized as an aggressive investor even though i 'm operating with a very vanilla mix of mutual funds and not attempting to micromanage my money my goal is to have the money work for me not vice versa

having just gone through selling a car i can tell you that carmax will most likely not be the best solution i recently sold my 09 vibe which had a kbb and edmonds value private party sale of around $ 6k trade in value was around $ i took it to the local carmax for a quote and they came back with $ 3,500   refinancing is tricky banks have a set limit on how old a car they will finance many wo n't even offer financing if the vehicle has over 100k miles we looked at refinancing our other car and even getting the apr down over a point we would only have saved $ or so banks typically offer much higher interest rates for used non dealership cars and refinancing than they do for new cars or even used cars purchased from a dealership assuming you have 2 3 years left on your loan i do n't think that refinancing would save you enough to be worth considering carmax sells cars in 1 of 2 ways they are also up front with you about the process they do not reference kbb or edmonds or any other valuation tool other than their own internal system they either take the car it up a bit then resell it on their lot or they sell it at auction if they determine your car will be sold at auction then they will offer you a rock bottom price the determining factors that come into play include age of the car mileage and of course overall condition if you mini is still in good shape and does n't have a lot of miles then they may try to resell it on their lot for which they could offer you closer to personal sale price than trade in how many 2007 's are for sale in your area how much are they selling for i did sell them a truck back in 2005 and received $ 200 more than kbb valued it for but it was in great shape only a couple of years old relatively low mileage and it was in high demand god bless the south and their love for trucks i ended up selling my to another local car dealership they offered me $ after negotiating leaving the dealership then negotiating more over the phone it took me a day and a half and really very little effort i have several friends that have gone through the same thing with selling cars and all have had similar luck going to other dealerships where prices can be negotiated rather than carmax   carmax has no incentive to settle or forgive your loan if you really want to pay it off save up what you believe the difference will be then shop your car around the local dealerships and get prices for your mini remember that dealers have to turn a profit so be reasonable with your negotiation if you can find comparable vehicles in your area listed for $ then knock $ 1,500 off that price and tell the dealerships that 's what you want

it might be best to step back and look at the core information first   you 're evaluating an llc vs a corporation both corporate entities   both have one or more members and both are seen similarly emphasis on similar here they 're not all the same to the irs   specifically llc 's can opt for a pass through tax system basically seen by the irs the same way an s corp is put another way you can be taxed as a corporate entity or it 's p l statements can flow through to your personal taxes   when you opt for a flow through the business files and you get a separate schedule to tie into your taxes   you should also look at filing a business expense schedule schedule c on your taxes to claim legitimate business expenses good reference point here while there are several differences see this and this and this between these entities the best determination on which structure is best for you is usually if you have full time employ while you 're running the business   s corps limit shares shareholders and some deductions but taxes are only paid by the shareholders   c corps have employees no restrictions on types or number of stock and no restrictions on the number of shareholders   however this means you would become an employee of your business you have to draw monies from somewhere and would be subject to paying taxes on your income both as an individual and as a business employment taxes such as social security medicare etc from the broad view of the irs in most cases an llc and a corp are the same type of entity tax wise   in fact most of the differences between llcs and corps occur in how profits losses are distributed between members llcs are arbitrary to a point and corps base this on shares back to your question imho you should opt for an llc   this allows you to work out a partnership with your co worker and allows you to disburse funds in a more flexible manner   from wikipedia a limited liability company with multiple members that to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation 26 cfr 1 are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law hope this helps please do let me know if you have further questions   as always this is not legal or tax advice just what i 've learned in setting several llcs and corporate structures up over the years edit as far as your formulas go the tax rate will be based upon your personal income for any pass through entity   this means that the same monies earned from and llc or an s corp with the same expenses and the same pass through options will be taxed the same more reading llc and the law google group

when the index is altered to include new players exclude old ones the fund also adjusts the largest and i would say most important index funds are whole market funds like all world ex us or vt total world stock or all japan   and similarly for bonds reits etc   so companies do n't leave or enter these indexes very often and when they do by an initial offering or bankruptcy it is often at a pretty small value some older indices like the djia are a bit more arbitrary but these are generally not things that index funds would try to match more narrow sector or country indices can have more of this effect and i believe some investors have made a living from index arbitrage   however well run index funds do n't need to just blindly play along with this you need to remember that an index fund does n't need to hold precisely every company in the index they just need to sample such that they will perform very similarly to the index   the largest company in the s&p 500 is not likely to have all that much of an effect on the overall performance of the index and it 's likely to be fairly correlated to other companies in similar sectors which are also covered by the index   so if there is a bit of churn around the bottom of the index it does n't necessarily mean the fund needs to be buying and selling on each transition   if i recall correctly it 's been shown that holding about 250 stocks gives you a very good match with the entire us stock market

first please allow me to recommend that you do not try when financials do give expected results   it 's a sure path to disaster and illegality   the best route is to first check if accounts are being properly booked   if they are then there is most likely a problem with the business   anything out of bounds yet properly booked is indeed the problem now the reason why your results seem strange is because investments are being improperly booked as inventory therefore the current account is badly from the industry mean the dividing line for distinguishing between current and long term assets is one year although modern financial accounting theorists regulators have tried to that line so standards do not always adhere to that line therefore any for resale should be booked as inventory while those for as investment   it 's been some time since i 've looked at the standards closely but this used to fall under property plant equipment   generally it is a capital expenditure by the oldest definition    it is not necessary to obsess over initial bookings because inventory turnover will quickly resolve itself so a simple running or historical rate can be applied to the purchases the books will now appear more normal and better subsequent strategic decisions can now be made

the finance buff discusses why the roth 401k is often disadvantaged compared to a traditional 401k in the article the case against the roth 401k including the following reasons paraphrased contributions to the 401k come from the top of your highest tax bracket rate but withdrawals fill in from the bottom   for example suppose you are in the 28 tax bracket   every marginal dollar you contribute to the traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by cents   however when withdrawing the first $ of income is tax free from standard deduction and exemption 2014 numbers $ for married couples joint filing   the next dollars are at the 10 tax bracket and so on   this is an advantage for the traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing a reasonable assumption avoid high state income tax there are many states that have low or no state income tax   if you live in a state with a high income tax paying tax now through the roth 401k reduces the benefit of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate avoid triggering credit many tax credits e.g. student loan interest child tax credit hope credit roth ira eligibility etc begin phasing out as your income increases   contributing to the traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits when you starting running up against those limits as described in the article if these items do n't apply contributing to the roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification

would have some data though a bit old about open end funds vs an etf that would be one point secondly do you know that the math on your etf will always work out to whole numbers of shares or do you plan on using brokers that would allow fractional shares easily this is a factor as $ 3,000 of an open end fund will automatically go into fractional shares that is n't necessarily the case of an etf where you have to specify a number of shares when you purchase as well as consider are you doing a market or limit order these are a couple of things to keep in mind here lastly what if the broker you use charges account maintenance fees for your account in buying the mutual fund from the fund company directly there may be a lower likelihood of having such fees i do n't know of any way to buy shares in the etf directly without using a broker

there are two impacts first if the pound is dropping then buying houses becomes cheaper for foreign investors so they will tend to buy more houses as investments which will drive house prices up second in theory you might be able to get a mortgage in a foreign country let 's say in euro and you might hope that over the next few years the pound would go up again and the euros that you owe the foreign bank become worth less

the expense ratio is stated as an annual figure but is often broken down to be taken out periodically of the fund 's assets in traditional mutual funds there will be a percent of assets in cash that can be to cover the expenses of running the fund and most deposits into the fund are done in cash in an exchange traded fund new shares are often created through creation redemption units which are baskets of securities that make things a bit different in the case of an etf the dividends may be reduced by the expense ratio as the trading price follows the index usually expense ratios can vary as in some cases there may be initial waivers on new funds for a time period to allow them to build an asset base there is also something to be said for economies of scale that allow a fund to have its expense ratio go down over time as it builds a larger asset base these would be noted in the prospectus and annual reports of the fund to some degree spdr annual report on page for the russell 3000 etf notes its expense ratio over the past 5 years being the following 0.20 0.20 0.22 0.20 thus there is an example of some fluctuation if you want a real world example

unfortunately not even if the credit card balance is positive i.e. customer has overpaid the credit card account you can not withdraw cash for free as any cash withdrawal is subject to interest even if repaid in full at the end of the month the clarity credit card is one of the best cards for overseas spending as its load free no fees for purchases abroad and it gives near perfect exchange rates if your balance is positive you start at £ 0 then fund that credit card account from your bank account £ 500 you can then spend on your credit card and when your next bill is due at the end of the month they will use that extra £ 500 sitting in your account first and ask for the remainder from you i.e.     scenario 2 it is better in my opinion to set up a direct debit to always clear out the full amount on your credit card that way you have cash in your bank account for emergencies getting £ 500 back from a credit card will take a few days to process as opposed to having the ability to withdraw cash from the 24/7 and once the direct debit is paid automatically at the end of the month there are no fees voila your credit card is almost like a debit card spend on it when you like it gets paid automatically no hassle no worries this approach does take a careful mindset though as you need to know your credit limits and also you need to ensure your bank account has enough to pay off the direct debit at the end of the month otherwise those darn fees will get you and hurt your credit rating for cash spending you will want to either take cash with you check online here for best rates get the money well in advance to avoid fees also in some countries the exchange rate is better there than in the uk google will help you here if you do nt like the idea of carrying large sums of cash with you can use a prepaid card like which is one of the better ones out there the other well known ones are fairfx and travelex cash passport

commonly get good payouts from these things   first when companies are in some of bankruptcy or financial distress they are forced to pay more to retain certain personnel due to the nature of the situation if the executives left then nobody would be willing to come in and wind up the assets of the company it would end up costing even more money in the long run because you wo n't get talented people and you will have to bring in people with little to no knowledge of your company or your industry   second bankruptcy law provides very clear guidelines for the priority of different creditors and this is tied into the incentives that we want to encourage if secured creditors did not get priority then they would never lend and we would not have economic growth the reason equity shareholders are last in priority is because they took on the risk of owning the company

many companies actually just issue new shares for employee compensation instead of buying back existing ones so actually the share price should go down because the same value is now diluted over more shares in addition this would not necessarily affect companies with many employees than those with fewer employees because companies with more employees tend to be bigger and thus have more shares among which the change in demand would be distributed also i think many companies do not issue shares to employees every pay day but just e.g. once every quarter

you 're right things can get a little out of hand on reddit the prior post is gone now so i ca n't really remember but the gist of what i meant earlier was that your logic did n't line up in that the price of a stock is indicative of it 's value but does n't equate to it 's value the price is a combination of the perceived intrinsic valuation of the company as well as sentiment the price can go up if people are buying but it does n't necessarily mean the company 's value or financial conditions are improving though it can it 's a common trap to fall into and can lead one to ignore for example revenues falling or other metrics deteriorating merely because the stock price continues up so it must be getting better and better   sorry not a very coherent response if you 're unsure feel free to pm me

if the fee is paid directly from the account then unfortunately no you can not deduct it it 's probably too late now but in the future you can ask the financial institution if they will allow you to write them a separate check to cover the fees if they allow that then you can preserve your tax free account balance and potentially deduct the fees too more details here update as discussed in the comments below a strict interpretation of the irs description of deductible investment expenses may not include expenses for a roth ira even if they are paid outside of the account however there seems to be conflicting interpretations of this irs rule so i would advise speaking to an accountant or the irs directly for clarification but even if you determine you can not deduct the fees paying for them outside of the roth is still a good idea because it enables you to maintain a higher balance in your tax advantaged account

the thing you need to keep in mind is that if you take on debt you need to have a plan to pay it off and execute on it   you also need to understand what your carrying cost is what you will pay in finance charges every month   there are times when you need to take on debt in order to be a productive person   for example in many places in the us you need a car in order to have a job   it 's ludicrous for someone to assert that you should n't take on any debt in order to get a reliable vehicle   that does n't mean you go out and lease the car that you can get on your income in this case i 'd say it 's a bit of a grey area   could you live in an apartment for a while   perhaps   many people would have a hard time living like that and it could affect your ability to perform at work   i would argue that buying a decent mattress to sleep on falls under the same category as getting a car so that you can work   you do n't want to be missing work because your back is in from sleeping on the floor or a worn out mattress as far as the rest of it goes it really depends on how fast you can pay it off   if you are looking at more than a few months 6 tops to pay off the purchase in full you should reassess   realize that the interest you are paying is increasing the cost of the furniture and act accordingly   as mentioned you can often get 0 financing for a limited period   understand that if you do n't pay off the entire balance in that period you will normally be retroactively charged interest on the entire starting amount and that interest rate will likely be quite high the problem with credit is when you start using it and continually growing the balance   it 's easy to keep saying that you will start paying it off later and the next thing you know you are buried   it 's not a big one time purchase by itself that normally gets people into trouble it 's continual spending beyond their means month after month

i went to morningstar 's performance page for fusex 's s&p 500 index fund and used the compare tool to compare it with and as well as fidelity emerging markets fund   according to the data there outperformed fusex in 2012 outperformed in 2010 and outperformed fusex in both 2010 and 2012   when looking at and 15-year trailing returns both and outperformed fusex what does this mean   it means it matters what time period you 're looking at   us stocks have been on an almost unbroken increase since early 2009   it 's not surprising that if you look at recent returns international markets will not stack up well   if you go back further though you can find periods where international funds outperformed the us and even within recent years there have been individual years where international funds won as for correlation i guess it depends what you mean by low   according to this calculator for instance and fusex had a correlation of about over the last 15 years   that may seem high but it 's still lower than say the correlation between fusex and small cap   it 's difficult to find truly low correlations among equity funds since the interconnectedness of the global economy means that bull and bear markets tend to spread from one country to another   to get lower correlations you need to look at different asset classes e.g. bonds so the answer is basically that some of the funds you were already looking at may be the ones you were looking for   the trick is that no category will outperform any other over all periods   that 's exactly what volatility means it means the same category that in some periods will underperform in others   if international funds always outperformed no one would ever buy us funds   ultimately if you 're trying to decide on investments for yourself you need to take all this information into account and combine it with your own personal preferences risk tolerance etc anecdotally i recently did some simulation based analyses of vanguard funds using data from the past 15 years   over this period vanguard 's emerging markets fund comes out far ahead of us funds and is also the least correlated with the s&p 500   but again this analysis is based only on a particular slice of time

note that many funds just track indexes in that case you essentially do n't have to worry about the fund manager making bad decisions in general the statistics are very clear that you want to avoid any actively managed fund there are many funds that are good all in one investments if you are in canada for example canadian couch potato recommends the tangerine investment funds the fees are a little high but if you do n't have a huge investment one of these funds would be a good choice and appropriate for 100 of your investment if you have a larger investment to the point that tangerine 's mer scares you a little you still may well look at a three or four fund or etf portfolio you may choose to use an actively managed fund even though you know there 's virtually no chance it 'll beat a fund that just tracks an index long term in that case i 'd recommend only a small portion of your portfolio to this fund many people suggest speculating with no more than 10 of your combined investment note that other people are more positive on actively managed funds

consider that the bank of course makes money on the money in your escrow it is nothing but a free loan you give the bank and the official reasons why they want it are mostly bs they want your free loan nothing else as a consequence to let you out of it they want the money they now can not make on your money upfront in form of a fee that explains the amount it is right their expected loss by letting you out unfortunately knowing this does n't change your options either way you will have to pay that money either as a one time fee or as a continuing loss of interest as others mentioned you can not calculate with 29 years as chances are the mortgage will end earlier by refinancing or sale then you are back to square one with another mandatory escrow so paying the fee is probably not a good idea if you are an interesting borrower for other banks you might be able to refinance with no escrow you can always try to negotiate this and make it a part of the contract if they want your business they might agree to that

ponzi schemes or pyramid schemes are based on paying earlier investors from the money invested by the later ones for ponzi scheme the idea is generally to distribute some high consistent dividend payout based on the inflow of money from new investors as long as new investors are coming the scheme can be sustained for quite some time see the madoff 's example that over decades in the mean time the scheme operator can take some of the investment money to himself legally as fees and salary illegally as the scheme operator does n't actually have to put in any money other than some organizational expenses however at some point the new investors money wo n't be enough to pay all the existing investors inevitably sooner or later since the dividend payout grows with each new investor and there are no infinite exponential amount of new investors to cover for it that 's when the $ + hits the fan and sons of the start ending up hanging from the ceiling pyramid scheme is built on similar idea but the dividend payout varies based on the level of the investor i.e. the investor gets paid based on how many new ones he brought in and how many new ones rooted from them thus the incentive to bring new investors is directly shifted to the investors themselves the here are at the top and get the most payouts from all the rest of the participants they themselves usually put no or very little investment however the end result is the same could n't possibly be enough investors to sustain this model forever and it will inevitably fail at some point when such a scheme fails the paying fund ends up being bankrupt either due to cashflow problems not enough money in to pay money out or because all the money dries out usually both how to detect if the reports are not falsified which in most cases they are you 'll see clearly that there 's no actual investment income in the cash flow but the reports are usually falsified to conceal this exact fact so that 's where the independent auditors and regulatory oversight come in handy generally if an investment fund does n't have a reputable independent auditor stay away

what keshlam said is correct in bookkeeping terms what you are doing is transferring value from some kind of cash account which may in turn be backed by a loan to an asset effectively you are exchanging one asset for another that asset you are exchanging to is the land that you are buying which has some value and which should end up on the asset side of your balance sheet unfortunately particularly with fixed assets where no two ones are alike such as land it 's often very hard to know the exact value unless and until you sell it an appraiser can get you an estimate but only sealing a deal with an actual buyer can get you an exact value and at that point the asset is no longer yours

keep in mind that the federal reserve chairman needs to be very careful with his use of words   here 's what he said it is arguable that interest rates are too high that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates ca n't go below zero we have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce we have an economy where the amount of investment in durable goods spending is far less than the capacity of the economy to produce that suggests that interest rates in some sense should be lower rather than higher we ca n't make interest rates lower of course they only can go down to zero and again i would argue that a healthy economy with good returns is the best way to get returns to savers so what does that mean when he says that we ca n't make interest rates lower that does n't mean that it is n't possible he 's saying that our demand for goods is lower than our ability to produce them negative interest would actually make that problem worse if i know that things will cost less in a month i 'm not going to buy anything the fed is incentivizing spending by lowering the cost of capital to zero by continuing this policy they are eventually going to bring on inflation which will reduce the value of the currency which gives people and companies that are sitting on money an dis incentive to continue hoarding it

i did read the article i 'm very surprised that such a simple and alternative idea was poorly received but i have a feeling it 's because you did n't read my response carefully enough the 3 5 years which you took to mean the training time was presented as the commitment in return for free training which i expected would take around 6 12 months the candidates suggested would already have master 's degrees in other fields and so it 's to be expected they 'll need around 30 60 hours to train them to an academic level full time this should only take a year    an h1-b visa takes around 6 months to process and when you factor in the amount of time it takes someone to actually move from a foreign country it can easily be faster to train than transport in any case you could do both while you transition to a training process   here 's an article on the processes that i am discussing where peter is interviewed by the wharton business school the gist of it is that because companies control every aspect of the hiring and job creation process it is a large part of the fault on their shoulders when they ca n't find the right person      thanks for playing

you 're speaking as a private individual if you owe money to a friend or family member iow if it 's a personal loan from someone you personally know then yes there is an absolute moral obligation to pay it back if at all possible but the big banks are not people you know they treat you like a set of no more and no less you are an opportunity for them to make money they will take from you all they can legally get or less than legally if they can get away with it they have no feeling of personal banks are not humans even if humans work for them they follow the rational path of greatest profit in the most immediate term without the slightest concern for your humanity or needs

your employer 's matching contribution is calculated based on the dollar amounts you end up putting in the nature of your 401(k contribution whether pre tax or roth after tax doesn't matter with respect to how their match gets calculated and their match always goes into a pre tax account even if you are contributing after tax the onus is on you to choose a contribution amount that maximizes your employer match regardless of the nature of your contribution maximizing your employer match using roth after tax contributions will eat up more of your annual gross salary but as long as you are willing to do that then you wo n't leave free employer match money on the table roth after tax contributions do n't get the tax deduction inherent in a pre tax contribution the tradeoff is that you end up with less take home pay per period if you contribute the same number of dollars on a roth after tax basis to your 401(k as opposed to on a pre tax basis for instance to make a maximum $ 18,000 roth after tax contribution to a 401(k it 's going to cost you a lot more than $ 18,000 of your annual gross salary to net the same $ 18,000 number on the flip side the roth money is worth more in retirement than pre tax money because it wo n't be subject to taxes then however 401(k plan contribution amounts are almost always expressed as a percentage of gross salary i.e. in pre tax terms even when electing to make after tax contributions so when electing after tax one is implicitly accepting that the contribution will cost more than the percentage of gross salary because you 'll need to pay the tax on a gross amount that would yield the same number of dollars but as an after tax amount

hmm this would seem to be impossible by definition   the definition of an index fund is that it includes exactly the stocks that make up the index once you say except for then what you want is not an index fund but something else it 's like asking can i be a vegetarian but still eat beef umm no there might be someone offering a mutual fund that has the particular combination of stocks that you want resembling the stocks making up the index except with these exclusions that would n't be an index fund at that point but etc there are lots of funds out there with various ideological criteria i do n't know of one that matches your criteria i 'd say search for the closest approximation you can find you could always buy individual stocks yourself and create your own pseudo index fund depending on how many stock are in the index you are trying to match and how much money you have to invest it may not be possible to exactly match it mathematically if you would have to buy fractions of shares if the number of shares you had to buy was very small you might get killed on broker fees and i 'll upvote 's answer for being a pretty close approximation to what you want

i do n't know which online casino we are talking about but i would venture to say that online casinos in general are probably not the most trustworthy of businesses   caution is certainly in order   that having been said this is n't an e mail from a stranger that contacted you out of the blue you obviously trust them enough to have deposited some money with them and it seems that they now owe you money let 's assume for the moment that they are legitimate and that they sincerely want to pay out your winnings   if they are to pay you via a wire transfer they would need your account number and routing number   this information is on every check that you write   in addition if this is an international transfer they would also need your bank 's swift number or possibly an iban code it does seem odd that they would pay you a partial payment with a check but the rest has to be done via a wire transfer   you could request that they send the remainder as a check but i would imagine that if they refuse to send you a check there is nothing you can do about it if you decide to go ahead with the wire transfer you could open up a new savings account with your bank first   then you could provide the account number for this new account and if they are intending to clean out your account there will be nothing in it   for extra protection when you set up the account you could ask the bank if they can set up a savings account that will accept incoming wire deposits but no outgoing electronic withdrawals either way when you deposit the check you have and you receive this wire transfer do n't spend this money for a while   just let it sit in your account you could transfer it to your main account if you like and wait a few weeks   that way if there is a problem with these payments and your bank insists on the money back you will not be in trouble   if they send you more than they owe you and ask for some of it back it will be a clear indication of a scam   do n't send them any money back after a few weeks you should be in the clear   good luck by the way online gambling is a terrible idea   the fact that you do n't trust the casino to pay out should tell you a lot about this industry   after you receive these winnings or even if you do n't the best advice i can give you is to stop gambling

a common response to poor labour conditions is if you do n't like your job leave and get a better one    however in idaho the state is trying to deregulate aspects of the labour market it 's making it easier for companies to enforce non compete agreements meaning you literally can not leave for a competitor if you do n't like your employer    that 's a natural consequence of labour markets it lets the companies with enormous budgets push around workers who are at the same time having their ability to organise into unions and bargain collectively undermined by companies who use said economic power to lobby against regulations that protect workers    so free market away but do n't convince yourself that a lack of regulation will somehow magically lead to a utopian allocation of resources where everyone gets what they need    in a totally unregulated market the wealth only trickles one way and it 's not down

the next phase   by       one mind boggling question is this good for the economy   20   september   2012   thursday ph    i want to share this to all the brilliant economists in this world    let 's talk on qe     by   m.   qe is not a cure it is a qe is synthetic no more no less qe is artificial it can not and will never hold water qe is only a temporary relief not an outright total solutions qe is absolutely not a guaranty not an assurance for recovery or growth qe is a very good tool this acts as an oxygen to a dying patients to breathe qe is now and forever taking away the oxygen the patient will going to die qe is a big balloon continues to expand amplify waiting to explode to burst qe will keep you moving today but not for the rest of your life qe is the more you move the more you get sucked down qe will bring joy today later it will bring tears pouring in your eyes that could not stop qe is worthless injecting precious blood highly precious dollar to a zombie economy a economy an absolute waste qe is brainless simply do not know what will going to be the consequences to the economy do not have the idea of what will going to be the final result qe is only a dream being over optimistic that one day everything will go back to normal that at the end of the day the economy will recover and finally would realize growth qe is just a fantasy meaning punching the moon the stars thinking it will resolve the year 2008 economic meltdown qe is an investment yes a massive investments to a dying economy absolutely wrong investments qe will keep you running it is like a ticking time bomb qe is not good for the economy the government acts or play as an investor instead of the businessman qe is being very kind and generous to businessman while keeping the country the state 's economy at stake or in jeopardy qe is putting more money to a business supporting the company to stay to exist for the time being and later on will literally closed shop qe is killing the mighty precious dollar slowly but surely qe is hide and seek like suze orman of cnbc say 's show me the money qe is treasure hunting ultra rich millionaires billionaires is keeping it they hide it where are those precious dollars making the economy sick crippled dead qe is a money making machine printing press once the economy becomes weak all they have to do is just print qe is putting plenty of money to a basket full of holes truly very few will benefit and so many will going to suffer   this is inequality   disparity is very disturbing counter to a good economy qe is experimental trial and error testing probability never done before qe is good at the start year 2008 after spending investing releasing trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars big companies millions of jobs were blessed saved rescued   and like magic america the wealthiest and most powerful country in the   universe is now going to act again today to spend invest release again and again and again and again trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars for the economy to keep moving my god what an abnormal cycle of the economy qe is a wild guess absolutely speculative before only big businesses huge companies are at stake   today it is now the whole country is at risk   not yet talking of the whole wide world with special mention to my my beloved country the philippines   this is certainly   absolutely domino effect   no one not one will ever be spared qe is very before only america needs to be saved to be today all countries is in distress suffering badly needs a rescue qe is keeping inflation very low yes absolutely for today but not for tomorrow   the medicine that they used during the 2008 economic slump is luckily still moving   meaning still working    but once this medicine starts to slowdown and begins to die down   you may call all the saints above   and the true inflation you are looking for searching for will surely and definitely come into your midst    inflation will going to kill us all qe is a wrong medicine temporary patch or qe is it is just an easy money and definitely not a hard earned labor generated money qe is a gamble trillion dollars is at stake if we are lucky the dying person or the economy will live if we are not lucky the dying person will die the economy will going to collapsed and still we have to pay all the debts as long as we live qe is the economy today is at the mercy of qe   the economy is captive hostage by qe interest rates is a lose lose situations keeping it zero   the u.s.a government will lose trillions   and trillions of dollars that is badly needed   now raising this rates will surely and definitely starts   the u.s.a markets and precisely the world economy to react pulling down the unstable economies   of the whole world to jeopardy   now which one would you like to choose again which one would you prefer qe is trial and error a complex complicated solutions   healing one part of the body and the other part will swell and burst qe is evaporation using taxpayers money pension funds retirement benefits and all entitlements is going to fade will vanished in thin air qe are waiters simply waiting day and night for growth for recovery qe is it dries up the u.s.a treasury qe is debt a never ending debt keep in mind there is no such thing as unlimited debt or debt unlimited do n't be fooled qe will going to keep you in good sleep but will wake you up bankrupt qe is not an answer it is the culprit qe is universal it was copied all over the world worldwide qe is an absolute solutions yes for all dumb economists a hopeless desperate solutions qe to be specific is going back again to the 1930 's depression or the great depression part 2 yes precisely but with a big bang qe before is only a staggering risk today it is now debt simple as it keeps on giving birth by the hour the minutes the seconds and after eight long years the final   the end result is massive pure debt very sorry to say not growth and or definitely not recovery qe is a dying move no one not one ever dared to affirm to attest to certify that this is a correct solutions qe is mad it will make you crazy because of debt qe is the only options yes absolutely when your big brains is not working qe is easing the pain correct for a very short period of time but will going to destroy the economy in the long or short run qe is history it will you forever and ever qe what more can i say    fb

first some general advice that i think you should consider a good rule of thumb on home buying is to wait to buy until you expect to live in the same place for at least 5 years this period of time is meant to reduce the impact of closing costs which can be 1 5 of your total buying selling price if you bought and sold in the same year for example then you might need to pay over 5 of the value of your home to realtors lawyers this means that for many people it is unwise to buy a home expecting it to be your starter home if you already are thinking about what your next presumably bigger home will look like if you buy a townhouse expecting to sell it in 3 years to buy a house you are partially gambling on the chance that increases in your 's value will offset the closing costs mortgage interest paid increases in home value are not a sure thing in many areas the total costs of home ownership are about equivalent to the total costs of renting when you factor in maintenance i notice you do n't even mention renting as an option make sure you at least consider it before deciding to buy also do n't buy a house expecting your life situation to make up the difference in your budget if you 're expecting your girlfriend to move in with you in a year that implies that you are n't living together now and maybe have n't talked about it even if she says now that she would move in within a year there 's no guarantee that things work out that way taking on a mortgage is a commitment that you need to take on yourself no one else will be liable for the payments as for whether a townhouse or a detached house helps you meet your needs better do n't get caught up in terminology there are few differences between houses that are universal are cheaper smaller and have condo associations with monthly fees to pay for maintenance on joint property but that is something that differs on a case by case basis do n't get tricked into buying a 1,100 sq ft house with a restrictive hoa instead of a 1,400 sq ft free hold townhouse just because townhouses have a certain reputation the only true difference between a house and a townhouse is that 1 or both of your walls are shared with a neighbor everything else is flexible

stated plainly it 's a benefit companies are not required to offer you any compensation above paying you minimum wage but benefits attract higher quality employees   i think a big part of it is that it is the norm employees want it because of the tax benefits employees expect it because almost all reputable companies of any significant size offer it you could run a great company but if you do n't offer a 401k plan you can scare away good potential employees it would give a bad impression the same way that not offering health insurance would

what you 're pretty systematically failing to appreciate is the pain felt by people during structural unemployment   yes they should get an education but guess what they 're probably too old for it to be worth or so far behind on the education ladder that it 'd be a real struggle   maybe they should move to a city where there are jobs but moving is expensive and so is living in a city   the libertarian arguments here have the same problem as the more extreme arguments about civil rights   yes the equilibrium will converge to a society without discrimination where people get educated because low skilled jobs do n't pay much anymore etc   but those arguments completely neglect the pain of getting from here to there   maybe you think the government always screws things up despite pretty glaring arguments to the contrary and maybe you think the free market always ends up with the most efficient solution despite some pretty glaring examples to the contrary but that still does n't mean that inefficient government programs that cost the future gdp whatever that means ca n't be an appropriate means of reducing the overall suffering of the populace in both the short and long term

you have two problems money exchange commissions and currency risk commissions are always exorbitant first you must find the cheapest way to get your money converted to the foreign currency and into your brokerage account the absolute cheapest way may involve some research and financial institution also i 'd forget about anything other than usd for the foreseeable future any other foreign currency will probably have higher commissions and a weaker market once you have that down you must avoid needlessly exchanging currencies keep a balance in the foreign currency keep all dividends and capital gains there and only take local money out of your brokerage account right before using it   that means of course that you need to keep enough local currency to pay taxes on any gains etc as for currency risk there are two solutions one solution is to buy your risk away using forex you sell an amount of usd lots that is mostly equivalent to your current investments and then just make sure you do n't get margin calls i 'm not sure just how cheap your rates would be in the uae but on average your investments should still have positive returns the other solution is to just stop seeing exchange rate fluctuations as losses if you had usd 100k and now you have usd how are you losing money exchange rates can go the other way just fine you know and holding usd is a good way to hedge against your country going south
