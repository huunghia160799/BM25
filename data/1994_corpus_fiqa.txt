short answer yes but this is not done through the deductions on schedule a. this can happen if the employer creates a flexible spending account fsa for its employees this can be created for certain approved uses like medical and transportation expenses a separate account for each category you can contribute amounts within certain limits to these accounts e.g. $ 255 a month for transportation with pre tax income deduct the contributions and then withdraw these funds to cover your transportation or medical expenses they work like a deductible ira except that these are spending and not retirement accounts basically the employer the role of ira fsa actually trustee and does the supporting paperwork

you can not deduct expenses directly   however your employer may participate in programs to allow you to make a pretax deduction capped at $ 255 per month to pay for certain commuting expenses   for personal car commuters the main category is to pay for parking    irs guidelines qualified transportation benefits this exclusion applies to the following benefits a ride in a commuter highway vehicle between the employee 's home and    work place a transit pass qualified parking qualified bicycle commuting reimbursement you may provide an employee with any one or more of the first three    benefits at the same time however the exclusion for qualified    bicycle commuting reimbursement is n't available in any month the    employee receives any of the other qualified transportation benefits

no   regular w2 employees can not deduct housing or transportation costs related to their employment    however in the us many employers offer parking and/or transit fsa programs which are usually collectively referred to a commuter benefits fsa programs this is particularly common among larger employers with locations in major metropolitan cities   under commuter benefits fsas employees can defer up to $ 255 per month from their gross pay tax free for parking and/or transit expenses   eligible expenses include things like bus and train passes or parking at a train or bus station   these are money in money out arrangements so expenses can only be claimed against contributions that have been made unlike a health fsa   though like a health fsa contributions are subject to use it or lose it provisions these programs must be sponsored by the employer for an employee to take advantage of them though   some jurisdictions mandate that employers above a certain threshold must offer commuter benefits

you can not deduct commute expenses regarding your specific example something to consider is that if the standard of living is higher in san francisco presumably the wages are higher too therefore you must make a choice to trade time and some money for commuting costs for even more money in the form of higher wages for example if you can make $ 50 k working 2 hours away from sf or $ 80 k working in sf and it costs you $ 5 k extra per year in commute costs you still come out ahead by $ 25 k minus taxes if it ends up costing $ 20 k more to live in sf due to higher rent mortgage food etc some people choose to trade 4 extra hours of commuting time to put that extra $ 20 k in their pocket it 's sort of like having an extra part time job except you get paid to read watch tv sleep on the job assuming you can take a train to work

when i have a question about my income taxes the first place i look is generally the giant book of income tax information publication 17 officially called your federal income tax this looks to be covered in chapter 26 on car expenses and other employee business expenses it 's possible that there 's something in there that applies to you if you need to temporarily commute to a place that is n't your normal workplace for a legitimate business reason or other business related travel but for your normal commute from your home to your normal workplace it has this to say   commuting expenses    you can not deduct the costs of taking a bus subway or taxi or of driving a car between your home and your main or regular place of work these costs are personal commuting expenses you can not deduct commuting expenses no matter how far your home is from your regular place of work you can not deduct commuting expenses even if you work during the commuting trip

you would n't know it 's value enterprise value without knowing its cash balance   the equation    ev = market cap + minority interest + preferred stock + debt cash   enterprise value is the value of the company to all shareholders creditors preferred stock holders common stock holders   so taking on debt could either increase or decrease the ev depending on the cash balance of the company   this will have no effect directly on the market cap it will however effect the present value of its future cash flows as the wacc will increase due to the new cost of debt interest payments higher risk of bankruptcy less flexibility by management

we live in a community and as citizens we all have the right to shop in public shops and eat in public restaurants if that right is abridged then freedom is abridged and the freedom to enjoy the public services of one 's community is far more important than the freedom to deny services due to one 's prejudice either way someone loses a bit of freedom which is more important according to you the freedom to do what you will with your property outweighs any and all possible consequences of exercising that freedom this is a very extreme viewpoint i know because i once held it   start a business and get back to us   yeah i did that 15 years ago and still going and i actually hire people you may not want to make too many assumptions about the person you are debating as a business owner i would happily choose a world in which i had to hire the best qualified candidate regardless of my over one in which other business owners could arbitrarily refuse me services that are offered to the general public just because of who i am   gt;if a person is refused service for any reason they can find another store shop or vendor   and what if all the stores in your town have similar policies am i to drive to the next town every time i need to go shopping what if all the shops within 1000 miles have discriminatory policies how am i to live the only reason you can make this argument is because of the success of the civil rights act if it was repealed today you would likely be able to avoid racist restaurants and shops by going elsewhere if it had never existed that would not be the case   gt;there is no equal opportunity in life for success   that is why i very specifically said that all citizens must have a realistic opportunity for success and not that there should be equal opportunity impossible or equal outcomes ridiculous and counter productive what must be avoided is the creation of an economic status quo that ensures the poor remain poor and the rich remain rich such a status quo is just slavery without the even if the government is not enforcing the status quo it can be just as hard to break free from   acts by government are always far worse than acts in the private sector   it is the results of the act of force that matters not its source or methodology this once again is an argument from pure ideology because you believe that government force is always worse than the private sector you are unable to see examples of how the private sector can limit our freedoms in even worse ways simply stating that government acts of force are always worse does not prove it so   gt;that 's exactly where your sewer leads   i would argue that the centers of poverty you listed are much more a symptom of the systematic undercutting of education social services and other support systems that once gave the a realistic way to improve their lot in life now with blue collar wages on the decline and public education gutted poverty gets more entrenched and harder to overcome you really think it 's going to get better for these people if we take away the minimum wage do away with public schools food stamps medicaid is there any point at which lack of social mobility becomes a more damaging than minor economic regulations is it ok to effectively return to the feudal system if it means nobody will ever have one penny taxed from them and given to someone who was n't born rich nobody made you get born poor so there 's no force and therefore everything is right and good such a shallow view of our moral obligations as members of a society   we live in a society extreme will lead only to self destruction just as fast as extreme the only rational view is to analyze the facts weigh the benefits and consequences to any given policy and make decisions without any preconceived notion of what the solution should look like in the case at hand i and the vast majority of people think the minor inconvenience of not being able to make discriminatory hiring decisions is far by the benefits of not having large segments of the population chronically unemployed and impoverished because their race   the only effective argument against this would be to posit a way in which the benefits of this policy could be achieved or without the use of government coercion and that i have n't seen   better grow up fast on this one   remember you are talking to someone who thought and argued exactly the same viewpoint you are now espousing for 10 years i was even a delegate to the national libertarian convention once i was a true believer i did grow up

buy and hold is still a winner an investor who used index funds and stayed the course could have earned satisfactory returns even during the first decade of the 21st century by by burton g. malkiel in the wall street journal on november 18 2010 the other useful technique is rebalancing keeping the portfolio asset allocation consistent with the investor 's risk tolerance for example suppose an investor was most comfortable choosing an initial allocation of 60 equities 40 bonds as stock and bond prices change these proportions will change as well rebalancing involves selling some of the asset class whose share is above the desired allocation and putting the money into the other asset class from 1996 through 1999 annually rebalancing such a portfolio improved its return by 1 and 1/3 percentage points per year versus a strategy of making no changes mr. malkiel is a professor of economics at princeton university this op ed was adapted from the upcoming 10th edition of his book a random walk down wall street out in december by norton

the pots will be negligible however this capital could be used better elsewhere if i was to withdraw them you wo n't be able to withdraw the money notwithstanding the recent pension freedom changes money put into a pension is still inaccessible until age 55 at the very earliest and probably later by the time you get there you should have been advised of this every time you enrolled into a scheme although it may well have been buried in something you were given to read the best you can do and what i would recommend although of course this post is n't advice is to transfer the pensions to a personal pension for example a sipp wherein you will be able to control where the money is invested most sipp providers will gladly help you with such transfers would it be beneficial to keep these smaller pots with their respected schemes the reason i suggest transferring is that leaving the funds in workplace schemes that are no longer being contributed to is a way of finding yourself invested in poorly performing neglected funds earning money for no one beyond the scheme provider

margin trades let you post a margin of a certain proportion of the value of the trade as collateral against the price of a trade and pay off the difference between the current price and the price that you bought at any losses incurred are taken from the margin so the margin has to be maintained as prices change in practice this means that when the price moves significantly from the buying price a margin call is triggered and the buyer has to increase their posted margin the vast majority of the foreign exchange trades done every day are margin trades as effectively are all spread bets margins get reset overnight whether or not a call has occurred

the currency market more often referred as forex or fx is the decentralized market through which the currencies are exchanged to trade currencies you have to go through a broker or an ecn there are a lot 's of them you can find a small list of brokers here on forex factory they will allow you to take very simple position on currencies for example you can buy eur usd by doing so you will make money if the eur usd rate goes up ie euro getting stronger against the us dollar and lose money if the eur usd rate goes down ie us dollar getting stronger against the euro in reality when you are doing such transaction the broker borrows usd sell it to buy eur and place it into an euro account they will charge you the interest rate on the borrowed currency usd and gives you the interest and the bought currency eur so if you bought a currency with high interest rate against one with low interest rate you will gain the interest rate differential but if you sold you will lose the differential the fees from the brokers are likely to be included in the prices at which you buy and sell currencies and in the interest rates that they will charge give you they are also likely to gives you big leverage to invest far more than the money that you deposited in their accounts now about how to make money out of this market that 's speculation there are no sure gains about it and telling you what you should do is purely subjective but the forex market as any market is directed by the law of supply and demand amongst what impacts supply and demands there are also and i do n't want to judge your friends but from experience peoples are likely to tell you about their winning transaction and not about their loosing ones

many of my friends said i should invest my money on stocks or something else instead of put them in the bank forever i do not know anything about finance so my questions are first let me say that your friends may have the best intentions but do n't trust them it has been my experience that friends tell you what they would do if they had your money and not what they would actually do with their money now i do n't mean that they would be malicious or that they are out to get you   what i do mean is why would you take advise from someone about what they would do with 100k when they do n't have 100k i am in your financial situation more or less and i have friends that make more then i do and have no savings or that will tell you to get an ira and so but do n't have the means discipline to do so do not listen to your friends on matters of money that 's just good all around advise is my financial status ok if not how can i improve it any financial situation with no or really low debt is ok i would say 5 of annual income in unsecured debt or 2 3 years in annual income in secured debt is a good place to be that is a really hard mark to hit it seems you have hit it so your good right now you may want to plan for the future immediate goals that i always tell people are 6 months of income stuck in a liquid savings account then start building a solid investment situation and a decent retirement plan this protects you from short term situations like loss of job while doing something for the future    is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor is it worthy how would she he help me rather it 's worth it or not to use a financial adviser is going to be totally opinion based personally i think they are worth it others do not i see it like this unless you want to spend all your time looking up money stuff the adviser is going to have a better grasp of money stuff then you because they do spend all their time doing it that being said there is one really important thing to consider that is going to be how you pay the adviser the following are my observations you will need to make up your own mind   free avoid like the plague these advisers are usually provided by the bank and make their money off commission or kickbacks that means they will advise you of the product that makes them the most money not you   flat rate these are not a bad option but they do n't have any real incentive to make you money usually they do a decent job of making you money but again it 's usually better for them to advise you on products that make them money per hour these are my favorite they charge per hour usually they are a small shop and will walk you through all the advise they advise what 's best for you because they have to sit there and explain their choices they can be hard to find but are generally the best option in my opinion    of money these are like the flat rate advisers to me they get a percentage of the money you give them to manage because they already have your money they are more likely to recommend products that are in their interest that said there not all bad or profit these are the best see notes later they get a percentage of the money they make for you they have the most interest in making you money they only get part of what you get so there going to make sure you get the biggest pie so they can get a bigger slice notes in the real world all advisers are likely to get kickbacks on products they recommend make sure to keep an eye for that also most advisers will use 2 3 of the methods listed above for billing something like of profit + $ x per hour is what i like to see you will have to look around and see what is available   just remember that you are paying someone to make you money or to advise you on how to make money so long as what they take leaves you with some profit your in a better situation then your are now and that 's the real goal

during the actual decline there 's very little money to be made and a lot to lose when housing prices tank everybody loses the banks are exposed to higher risk of mortgage defaults insurers start having to pay out more for gas leaks claiming over leveraged homes     realtors starve because their commissions go down even as foreclosures put more homes on the market and people faced with financial uncertainty will stay put in their current homes instead of moving elsewhere and and contractors go broke because nobody wants to spend cash on a new home or major reno that looks like a losing investment there can be some bright spots smaller hardware stores will make money as people do relatively small diy projects to improve the condition of their current home the larger stores get this business too but it tends to be more than offset by the loss of contractor business far more lucrative and something the and true values do n't really get in on of course the grave robbers do well gold buyers pawn shops repo firms these guys eat well when other people are defaulting on loans or have to sell their stuff for fast cash most of these businesses are not publicly traded one thing that was seen was increased revenues at discount retailers like wal mart dollar general etc when things are bad people in the middle class who had avoided these stores for image or morality reasons learn to swallow their pride and buy discount store brands for half the price of national brand names that lessens the blow felt by the discount retailers as overall consumer spending decreases the pie shrinks but the discount retailers get a bigger slice of the mandatory spending on food clothing etc and the higher level retailers get it in the shorts when the pie starts to grow again as consumer spending picks back up the discount retailers retain their percentage for a while as the fickle middle class can afford to buy more from the discount retailer but ca n't yet afford to take their business back to the shopping mall stores this produces a flatter offset price graph for discount retailers through the business cycle they do n't lose as early or as much as everyone else in a major downturn and they turn it around sooner while everyone else may still be on the way down but as everything gets better for everyone on the upswing it 's less great for the discount guys as they start losing customers and their dollars to competitors with better stuff even as the ones they keep spend more this does n't generally manifest as a true negative correlation but it can be a good hedge the number one money making investment in a tanking economy is gold when things go down the crapper everyone wants gold so if you see the train wreck coming far enough in advance you can make a big move to gold and really make some money off that investment for instance when the first about arm adjustments and mass defaults reached the public consciousness in gold bullion jumped from about $ 400 to over $ 700 in a nine month period it cooled off again in 06 07 but only to about $ and then in late 07 it steadily climbed to peak at $ even if you got in late an investment of $ 1000 in july 07 in bulk gold would have netted you $ 650 in one year that 's a 65 apy then the economy hit bottom and a lot of investors gold for investments they thought would pull back out of their holes quickly for just a little while in 08 gold was down to $ 700 again then came all the government reports unemployment not home prices still declining a lot of banks still hiding just how bad their position was if you had seen that it was going to be bad bad bad like a lot of now billionaire hedge fund investors did a $ 1000 investment in gold in july 05 and then cashing out at the tops of the peaks and buying back in at the major would be worth almost $ 4000 today that 's a 400 return over 7 years or an annual average yield of 57 there simply has n't been anything like that in the last 7 years

you do n't state where you are so any answers to this will by necessity be very general in nature how many bank accounts should i have and what kinds you should have one transaction account and one savings account you can get by with just a single transaction account but i really do n't recommend that these are referred to with different names in different jurisdictions but the basic idea is that you have one account where money is going in and out the transaction account and one where money goes in and stays the savings account you can then later on as you discover various needs build on top of that basic foundation for example i have separate accounts for each source of money that comes into my personal finances which makes things much easier when i sit down to fill out the tax forms up to almost a year and a half later but also adds a bit of complexity for me that simplicity at tax time is worth the additional complexity for someone just starting out it might not be and of course it is completely unnecessary if you have only one source of taxable income and no other specific reason to separate income streams how much percentage wise of my income should i put into each one with a single transaction account your entire income will be going into that account having a single account to pay money into will also make life easier for your employer you will then have to work out a budget that says how much you plan to spend on food shelter savings and so on how do i portion them out into budgets and savings if you have no idea where to start but have an appropriate financial history as opposed to just now moving into a household of your own bring out some old account statements and categorize each line item in a way that makes sense to you do n't be too specific four or five categories will probably be plenty these are categories like living expenses rent electricity utilities food and eating out everything you put in your mouth savings do n't forget to subtract what you take out of savings and so on this will be your initial budget if you have no financial history you are probably quite young and just moving out from living with your parents ask them how much might be reasonable in your area to spend on basic food a place to live and so on use those numbers as a starting point for a budget of your own but do n't take them as absolute truths always have a miscellaneous expenses or other line in your budget there will always be expenses that you did n't plan for and/or which do n't neatly fall into any other category allocate a reasonable sum of money to this category this should be where you take money from during a normal month when you in some budget category your savings should be a last resort not something you tap into on a regular basis if you find yourself needing to tap into your savings on a regular basis adjust your budget accordingly figure out based on your projected expenses and income how much you can reasonably set aside and not touch it 's impossible for us to say exactly how much this will be some people have trouble setting aside 5 of their income on a regular basis without touching it others easily manage to save over 50 of their income do n't worry if this turns out a small amount at first get in touch with your bank and set up an automatic transfer from your transaction account to the savings account set to recur each and every time you get paid you may want to allow a day or two of margin to ensure that the money has arrived in your account before it gets taken out of the amount you determined that you can save on a regular basis then try to forget that this money ever makes it into your finances this is often referred to as the pay yourself first principle you wo n't hit your budget exactly every month nobody does in fact it 's more likely that no month will have you hit the budget exactly try to stay under your budgeted expenses and when you get your next pay unless you have a large bill coming up soon transfer whatever remains into your savings account spend some time at the end of each month looking back at how well you managed to match your budget and make any necessary adjustments if you do this regularly it wo n't take very long and it will greatly increase the value of the budget you have made should i use credit cards for spending to reap benefits only if you would have made those purchases anyway and have the money on hand to pay the bill in full when it comes due using credit cards to pay for things is a great convenience in many cases using credit cards to pay for things that you could n't pay for using cash instead is a recipe for financial disaster people have also mentioned investment accounts brokerage accounts etc this is good to have in mind but in my opinion the exact savings vehicle type of place where you put the money is a lot less important than getting into the habit of saving regularly and not touching that money that is why i recommend just a savings account if you forgot a large bill coming up or for any other good reason need access to the money it wo n't be at a time when the investment has dropped 15 in value and you face a large penalty for withdrawing from your retirement savings once you have a good understanding of how much you are able to save reliably you can divert a portion of that into other savings vehicles including retirement savings in fact at that point you probably should also i suggest making a list of every single bill you pay regularly its amount when you paid it last time and when you expect the next one to be due some bills are easy to predict $ rent is due the 1st of every month and some are more difficult the electricity bill is due on the 15th of the month after i use the electricity but the amount due varies greatly from month to month this is n't to know exactly how much you will have to pay but to ensure that you are n't surprised by a bill that you did n't expect

the way i see it corporation tax is not fundamentally different from vat they are both a tax on revenue minus expenses just what those expenses are is different i think the main advantage of corporation tax is that it allows capital expenditure to be spread over several years although as i said this makes it more complicated and i believe that there are some capital allowances for vat as well   one advantage of vat is that sales in one country are taxed in that country before the money can be sent abroad it seems simple and fair to split the tax burden between jurisdictions according to how many sales were made in each

assuming by your username that you are dutch and this concerns invoices under dutch law there are a couple of ways to go about it first of all we do n't have small claims court the way the us does that would make life a lot easier but we do n't    you can go all legal on him and go through court procedures the first step would probably be the wiki though there are some limitations to what you can do there you do n't need to have a lawyer at the but chances of fucking up are high if you do n't have experience or some experienced help it 's also likely to eat up more of your time than it 's worth and even if you get a favorable judgement there 's still the matter of collecting    the second option which nearly all companies in the netherlands use is to turn it over to an collections agency for either a fee or a percentage they 'll go after the usually tacking that fee onto the money owed so it should n't cost you too much the downside is that again they 're not always successful if the non paying person is either extraordinarily already in a lot of debt or if you 're looking at him her it going bankrupt or being in debt counseling which in some cases comes with legal protections    the third way if it 's a viable debt but you 're willing to take a loss in exchange for money now is to sell off the debt to a factoring agency they 'll assess it and pay out the open invoice to you minus costs and/or a percentage depending on how they view their odds of collecting on it it 's then their debt and they 'll go after the original debtor without you ever needing to bother with it again    it 's a tough position to be in i 've had to write off some invoices over time some only a some in the range when a major customer of mine went tits up and i just happened to have an interesting conversation yesterday with someone who 's more into the commercial side of my line of work i learned that some relatively big name potential clients are looking more and more like a debt ridden empty shell   so they went on the list of companies to keep a sharp eye on in case i do business with them    in future cases keep on top of payment start reminding as soon as they miss their pay by date as the first documented step towards taking action against them and if it 's a common problem try looking at factoring companies or insurance against non payment it will cost you some margin but increase your security

first is storage which is a big and a detrimental headache security is another big headache investing in precious metal has always been an investment opportunity in the countries in the east i.e. india and china because of cultural reason and due to absence of investment opportunities for the less fortunate ones it is n't the case so in the west secondly what is the right an opportune moment is open to question when the economy is up and running that is probably the time to buy i.e. people would like to put money in use rather than store the saying goes the other way when the economy is stagnating then there is also the case of waiting out the bad periods to sell your gold and silver if you do want to buy precious metals then use a service like rather than doing those yourself it takes care of the 2 big headaches i mentioned earlier

you are correct that barring an equity capital raise your money does n't actually end up in the company however interest in their stock can help a company in other ways management board members hopefully own shares or options themselves thus knowing that green policies are favorable for the stock price as your fund might buy shares can be quite an incentive for them to go   companies with above average company share performance are also often viewed as financially healthy and so creditors tend to charge lower interest for companies with good share performance   lastly a high share price makes a company difficult to take over as all those shares have to be acquired and at the same time makes it easier for the company to perform takeovers themselves as they can finance such acquisitions by issuing more of their own shares there is also the implication that money flowing towards such green companies is money flowing out of away from polluting companies for these dirty companies the inverse of the previous points can hold true of course on the other hand there is quite an argument to be made that large enough green funds should actually buy substantial positions in companies with poor environmental records and steer the company towards greener policies but that might be a hard sell to investors

if you 've already got emergency savings sufficient for your needs i agree that you 'd be better served by sending that $ 500 to your student i personally house the bulk of my emergency savings in cds because i 'm not planning to touch it and it yields a little better than a vanilla savings account to address the comment about liquidity   in addition to my emergency savings i keep plain vanilla savings accounts for sudden expenses   to me emergency means lost job not new water pump for my car i have other budgeted savings for that but would spend it on a credit card and reimburse myself anyway so liquidity there is n't even that important    the 18 month cds i use are barely less liquid than vanilla savings and the penalty is just a couple months of the accrued interest   when you compare a possible early distribution penalty against the years of increased yield you 're likely to come out ahead after years of never touching your emergency savings unless you 're budgeted such that a car insurance deductible is an emergency expense emergency funds should be guaranteed and non volatile   if i lose my job 90 days of accrued interest is n't a hindrance to breaking open some of my cds and the process is n't so daunting that i 'd meaningfully harm my finances liquidity in 2017 and liquidity in whatever year a text book was initially written are two totally different animals   my very illiquid brokerage account funds are only one transaction and 3 settlement days less liquid than my very liquid savings account   there 's no call the bank sell the security wait for it to clear my brokerage cuts a check mail the check cash the check etc   i can go from apple stock on monday to cash in my hand on like thursday   on the web portal for the bank that holds my cds i can instantly transfer the funds from a cd to my checking account there net of a negligible penalty for early distribution   to call cds illiquid in 2017 is silly

in this equation the withdrawal rate is the percent you must pull from your savings to meet your expenses for example if your savings is $ 100,000 and you need $ 10,000 annually for your living expenses then your withdrawal rate would be 10 where 10k is 10 of 100k   to complete this formula you need to know how much savings you need to be financially independent before you can use this formula to find out how long it will take you

my doubt is whether bank of india gives any explicit incentives to banks to offer cheaper home loans currently no in the past loan against gold was considered priority sector lending loans to poor and agriculture etc every bank need to lead around 25 to priority sector hence quite a few banks gave loans relatively cheaper to todays rate rather than giving it as farm loan that almost never get recovered it is no longer the case now as loan against gold is not considered priority lending if it were just demand supply i feel that gold loans should have been cheaper   it is demand and supply there are quite a few reasons for this

i 'm a manager of a charity shop so work with a wide range of unpaid volunteers which requires an especially soft touch most of the time everyone is different or people will just leave   it takes longer but the overall results are better and more long lasting     think of it like pushing a boat from the with your hand always applying a small pressure to get the boat to gradually move where you want rather than ramming into the side of a boat with a truck sure it 'll get you there quicker but will cause lasting damage   it 's also best to take it slow as you need time to learn the business and people   be clear about your approach with your boss managing their expectations is important   anyway here is what i 've learnt in my first year or so doing this job plus things i 've learnt along the way in my previous career as a software engineer radical career change where i 've managed people and been managed   1 be yourself   do n't pretend to be someone you 're not everyone will see right through you in an instant   you 'll change over time as you get used to managing people that 's fine but always be yourself through that   1 say thank you to everyone at the end of each day as you say goodbye   mean it   think of all the work they 've done today for you   1 spread the shit evenly   every job has crap parts make sure you and everyone else gets their fair share and no more   i regularly hoover clean the bathroom wash up and so on   1 ask do n't tell   if you orders people will do them but they 'll put no effort into it and you 'll distance yourself from them   ask if they could do something for you   it 's a nobody ever says no unless there is an issue which you need to deal with anyway   1 pick your battles   is it worth moaning at someone for that little   or can you get over that message another way   i.e. i do n't like people having drinks on the till counter so when i take over to cover for them for a break i just move it   after a while no drinks appear on the counter   1 be honest   if you do n't know say so ask for input   weigh up the options out loud then pick one explain why and go for it or better yet get the person that thought of it working with you not for you to implement it   if you 're wrong hold your hand up and try the other   1 always take responsibility when things go wrong that is actually your job   when things go well use you and   if things go badly sometimes i sometimes we but never   1 always be pro active with money   if you owe your staff money for any reason chase them to give it to them never let them chase you   if there even might be any problems at all with money let everyone know as soon as you know   go out of your way to ensure they get what they 're owed now not later   i just did this today actually i forgot to do expenses for someone and switched over the till so there was n't enough cash in the new till to cover it so i just took it from the money to bank and marked down why there was a discrepancy on the paperwork and will do the same tomorrow when that does n't match by the opposite amount   i should not do this at all but it 's the right thing to do   1 listen carefully   often employees have problems but wo n't bring them up either they do n't think anything will get done or they do n't want to get someone in trouble or something else   however if you listen and observe carefully often there are clues to the things that are bothering them and you 'll find ways to tackle them   1 do n't run a team meeting until you know everyone if you can avoid it   you do n't know shit about how the company works who the people are what makes them tick what they do and so on   all you 'll do is come across as a bit of a tool and distance yourself from them as boss   when you do run one just guide it do n't lead it   always hand over control of the conversation as much as possible except of course where you 've got things that they need to hear   1 never joke about your power   i.e. do n't mess about saying how you 'll fire them if blah or how you 'll give them all the shit work or mention pay etc   i had a boss that did that when drunk not in a serious way at all and he was very widely hated for pretty well nothing other than that   it served as a constant reminder that he 's separate from us   1 give people room but do n't be taken for a ride   if someone is late once fine i would n't even mention it   late again maybe i 'd make a light joke of it   late again we 'll have a chat always listen to what they have to say is there any way you can help   but do n't be taken for a ride   i 've had people pick me up on being late the very first time i was late and you know what i was more late for that job from then on than i 've ever been before or since   1 try to get your employees to come up with ideas to move the business forwards   it 's very easy to look at a business and say we need this that and the other doing like this   but you need to get your employees to buy into it or they just wo n't do it properly   it 'll be like getting blood out of a stone to start with but if you 're patient and support their ideas most people will come around   you need their input as they know their job better than you   1 edit always be clear what you want from people when   speak with them about the before hand to make sure they 're comfortable with it and think it can be done in the time   so many times i 've been given tasks with unrealistic deadlines the manager has n't wanted to listen to my protests then wonders why it did n't get done in time   it 's crazy really wanting something to be possible does n't make it so   a not so quick example   one volunteer said to me that we should halve the price of all the fiction books to .99 to compete with other shops   i personally do n't think that 's a good idea our shop has better quality stock and is much more organised but i have no evidence to the contrary and i honestly do n't really know so i say go for it and support it completely as a good idea   we tried it for a month and we made exactly the same amount of money sold twice as many books but no extra cash   so it was valuable to do and we discovered that maybe 1.49 might be a good option to try   but far more importantly they saw their ideas put into action right away and saw the results of that   it empowered them which is incredibly important for a wide variety of reasons that are too much to go into here but basically it makes them feel more respected enjoy their job more think more about the business and so on you know what it 's like when you 're empowered how good it feels   however it 's being empowered with the support that 's important something which you personally going into your new job do n't feel you have which leads to the anxiety and so on i 'm sure you 're feeling now   do n't put your employees in that position if you can help it   there is also another reason why i outright supported their idea from the offset   it did n't work although we did n't loose anything and i thought it would n't but i can say we tried   it was n't down to that one person they did n't feel bad that it did n't work because i was right behind it and it 's my job to take responsibility   if it had been their idea that had failed they would n't give any ideas ever again and everyone else would be put off too   as soon as anyone tries to take personal responsibility and they will stick to your guns in supporting them stronger than ever   now we 're getting a lot of ideas all the time they 're having in depth discussions amongst each other they 're pro active and so on   as a business we 're doing much better now because of it profits are up 15 from last year and we 've only just begun to kick things off and that 's going against a national trend downwards   we 've had several critical changes to our shop layout back room organisation results reporting stock handling processes and so on all from volunteer ideas and feedback   so the 15 is actually the tip of the iceberg what we 've got in place now should allow us to grow more quickly too   and remember you can make suggestions too of course but they 're just that suggestions   suggest them to your employees speak with several of them then get back to them when you 've made a decision   do n't say i 'm thinking of trying this say i was just thinking what about this   do you think it would work and talk about it   think of arguments against your idea see if they counter them and so on   now how many of these changes did i think of before hand and want to enact   about half so we 've got a significant number of successful ideas that i personally had n't thought of everyone 's happier and working harder for the business and we have a bright future   i have more ideas too and people listen to and respect them now just like i have with them   i think that 's the key to it all really   show your employees respect and they 'll show you it in return

i traded futures for a brief period in school using the platform now part of optionsxpress which is in turn now part of charles schwab they had a virtual trading platform and apparently still do and it was excellent since my main account was enabled for futures this carried over to the virtual account so i could trade a whole range of futures options stocks etc i spoke with optionsxpress and you do n't need to fund your acount to use the virtual trading platform however they will cancel your account after an arbitrary period of time if you do n't log in every few days according to their customer service there is no inactivity fee on your main account if you do n't fund it and make no trades i also used stock for a class and despite finding the occasional bug or website performance issue it provided a good experience i received a discount because i used it through an educational institution and customer service was quite good probably for the same reason but i do n't know if those same benefits would apply to an individual signing up for it   i signed up for about seven years ago when i was in secondary school and it 's completely free unfortunately you get what you pay for and the interface was poorly designed and slow furthermore at that time there were no restrictions that limited the number of shares you could buy to the number of outstanding shares so you could buy as many as you could afford even if you exceeded the number that physically existed while this is n't an issue for large companies it meant you could earn a killing trading highly illiquid pink sheet stocks because you could purchase billions of shares of companies with only a few thousand shares actually outstanding i do n't know if these issues have been corrected or not but at the time i and several other users took advantage of these to rack up hundreds of trillions of dollars in a matter of days so if you want a realistic simulation this is n't it   investopedia also has a stock simulator that i 've heard positive things about although i have n't used it personally

if the rate is the same then clearing one card to zero does have one advantage getting your grace period back generally when you owe money on your credit card and you make a new purchase that new purchase get charged interest starting on day one but if you are not carrying   a balance in other words you pay off the charges every month then new purchases are n't charged until you fail to pay the balance by the due date that grace period can be 25 to 55 days depending where you are in the billing cycle having one clean card will allow you to use that card when you have no other choice lets say you have an emergency car repair while away from home you do n't have $ 500 in cash so you put it on the clean card when you get home you know that you can pay the bill and not have been charged interest

why are banks all of a sudden providing people their credit scores for free because it is a really good idea    on an abc bank website it has   check your credit score for free button   you click it   not only will it come up with a credit score but it could also trigger a marketing workflow   if it is direct mail email or a phone call a banker could contact you for help with a debt product   this marketing could also be targeted say a person with a high score could be targeted for a mortgage   a person with a low or medium score could be targeted for ways and products to improve their score now if you run xyz bank and not do the same you are losing a competitive advantage to banks that offer this   not only will your customers be less happy but you will lose a great marketing opportunities    face it the only people that worry about their credit score are people that are in the market to borrow   which again is more information   if you have someone that never checks their credit score or has their credit frozen then it is wise not to market to them debt products

the three basic needs are food clothing and shelter housing falls into the third category because it is basic housing takes up a large part of one 's disposable income the rule of thumb is that you should n't spend more than 25 of your income on rent or mortgages and that is income before taxes anything much more than that takes up too much of one 's budget you simply can't double housing 's share of the budget from 25 to 50 whereas it 's easy to go from 1 to 2 for say a cellphone upgrade in the long run housing prices are constrained by the size of people 's housing budgets which in turn are tied to incomes nowadays that includes foreign buyers so there may be a case where west coast housing prices are driven up by asian buyers or florida housing by buyers from latin america driving americans out of local markets

unfortunately 100 of these issues are directly related to private industry ’s willingness to use any tool to get the upper hand   it is unwise to hand the keys to thieves just because the cops are corrupt   it is equally unwise to hand power to private corporations just because the government is corrupt   however as i have often noted before when you find you are stuck between two options it means you are failing to observe all the variation and you can manipulate in between and around those options   you are failing to see the middle ground and your surroundings as opportunities   there must be a measure that will satisfy both our views   we must simply observe more nuances in our subject matter   a quote i have heard from engineers   the hardest problem is framing the issue in such a way that it can be solved   a.k.a our choice of perspective most often defines our limitations and a change of perspective changes those limitations

assuming that the conversion was completely non taxable i.e. your traditional ira was 100 basis then the converted money can be taken out at any time whatsoever no 5 year or age stuff without tax or penalty similar to directly contributed money for withdrawing conversions and rollovers within 5 years of the conversion or rollover the penalty only applies to the part of the conversion or rollover that was taxable since in this case the conversion was completely non taxable there is no penalty on the withdrawal however note that the ordering of the conversion money is not the same as for contribution money and this may be significant in some cases when you take money out of roth ira it goes 1 contributions 2 rollovers and conversions and 3 earnings however money within 2 is then further divided by year with rollovers and contributions for earlier years ordered before rollovers and contributions for later years and then within each year the taxable rollover and conversion money are ordered first before the non taxable money so what does that mean well suppose you made a roth ira conversion that was taxable one year and then the next year you make a contribution if you withdraw a little bit it comes from the contribution which is ordered first which means no penalty now suppose in that second year you had a backdoor roth ira contribution instead of a regular contribution if you withdraw the first year 's conversion is ordered first and since it 's within 5 years there 's a penalty it 's still true that withdrawing the backdoor roth ira has no penalty but you do n't get to that money until you finish the other one if you 've never made a taxable conversion before then this issue does n't exist

bank have their own capital deposits from depositors and lend money to borrowers    in a liquidity problem it is typically that either the borrowers are taking time to repay they are not yet or there is more pressure on withdrawals from depositors or there is a short term of mismatch between deposits and loans in all these valid scenarios fed does lend out the banks to met these short terms obligations    banks fail when the losses are actually booked in comparison to the overall capital or loss would materialize for example the mortgage crisis in us meant that quite a few banks the actual loss had materialized or would have any ways materialized in such situations the short term leading does not help and they would burn it out anyways as the borrowers are not paying back any time soon

no it 's a $ 10k withdrawal you net what you net after federal and state taxes   ira it has a similar penalty free $ 10k withdrawal option for home purchase   so this might give faster access once you decide   given the choice between a withdrawal and a loan i 'd take the loan as soon as you are with the new employer ask hr about the rules for participating in their 401(k and rules for their loans if for whatever reason it wo n't work for you take $ 10 k and transfer to the ira and the rest into the 401(k if the 401(k has good investments and low cost   my answer focuses on the desire to withdraw the money a loan is better than a withdrawal better than both is a delay and saving all you can for the downpayment after the closing i 'd be mindful of spending save all you can to retirement accounts and pay this loan off over the time good for you

gt a marketing guy who as a teenager invented a color ray tube design that almost beat sony to a patent on the trinitron display   or so the entirely unsubstantiated urban myth claims   except it really does n't hold any water at all sculley was born in    first of all there was a whole host of patents underlying sony 's trinitron the early ones were applied for by physicist lawrence in circa 1960 when sculley would have been 21 and which sony then bought from lawrence in circa 1966 sculley aged 27 when sony really began developing a practical version of what finally became the trinitron display which they then filed multiple other patents on starting in circa 1967 by which time sculley would have been 28 + and by which time he was already out of college bachelor 's and an mba and working for pepsi and moreover there is no way that sculley would have known about sony 's patent application until after it was issued which i believe was in circa 1970 by which time sculley would have been 30 + years old   btw source for sony tech talk semiconductors devices   and if you go with the other version of this story that it was n't a trinitron but rather the original color tv idea well then it becomes even less plausible since first had a working crt based electric electronic color television in patented a refined version in and public demonstrated it in the fall of wiki when sculley would have been aged lt 1 year 2 years old and 5 years old respectively     and of course the fcc was already reviewing of the cbs and color tv systems in august of television broadcasting television monitor tube when sculley would have been age 10   so about the only semi plausible color tv would be the models that were commercially introduced when sculley was actually a teenager either the or the more well known both of which started selling at retail stores in the spring of gawker media image the year when sculley would have just turned 15 in april but which both had rather obviously been in development and having patents filed and planning for several years prior according to filing amp licensing patents since 1946 in other words long before sculley had reached an age that can plausibly be called a teenager   pretty much like the rest of sculley 's claims regarding his technology ideas and inventions it 's all bullshit that was come up with during after his time at apple in order to make him look sound like someone other than a colored sugar water marketing guy   at best he maybe had a crude idea for a color tv tube probably after reading some magazine article on how a plain crt works and maybe there is even some of truth to the fact that his dad not a technical guy either thought it had enough possible merit to warrant visiting a patent attorney who probably wisely informed dear old dad to put his checkbook away and then somehow junior got the idea and maybe even started telling the tale that he had been beaten to the patent office by xx days and of course now as he got older he probably found out how implausible his story was so he had to update revise it and he has since so thoroughly his own memory that the claim would now be that not only was it a color tv idea but it was a better color tv why it was the same as the trinitron alas bullshitting even in such a blatant form is not a crime even gullible people into repeating said bullshit is also not a crime   gt;he also did a pretty good job the mobile amp internet revolution in hindsight it does n't seem impressive   he did n't foresee anything he simply repeated and attempted to claim credit for things that had been in existence or development by a multitude of others while he was busy pushing pop

definitely get a lawyer to write up all the details of the partnership in a formal agreement if your ex does not want to do this that is a bad sign you both need to be clear about expectations and responsibilities in this partnership and define an exit strategy in the case one of you wants out this is the most fair to both parties generally what is common is that property is split cleanly when the relationship ends i would strongly recommend you both work towards a clean split with no joint property ownership how this looks depends on your unique situation to address your questions 2 and 3 you have two roles here tenant and owner   as a 50 owner you are running a business with a partner   that business will have assets home income expenses and profit you basically need to run this partnership as a simple business   all the rent income your rent and the other tenant 's should go into a separate account the mortgage and all other housing expenses are then paid from only this account any excess is then profit that may be split 50/50 all expenses should be agreed upon by both of you either by contract or by direct communication you should see a financial professional to make sure accounting and taxes are set up properly under this system your ex could do work on the house and be paid from the business income however they are responsible to you to provide an estimate and scope of work just like any other contractor if you as a joint owner agree to his price he then could be paid out of the business income this reduces the business cash flow for the year accordingly you can probably see how this can get very complicated very fast there is really no right or wrong answer on what both of you decide is fair and best for the sake of simplicity and the least chance of a disaster the usual and recommended action is to cleanly split all property good luck

as your financial situation becomes more complex it becomes increasingly more difficult to keep track of everything with a simple spreadsheet   it is much easier to work with software that is specifically designed for personal finances a good program will allow you to keep track of as many accounts as you want   a great program will completely separate the different account balances location of the money from the budget category balances purpose of the money   let me explain when you set up the software you will enter in all of your different bank accounts with their balances   perhaps you have three savings accounts and two checking accounts   it does n't matter   when you are done entering those the software will total them up and the next job you have is assigning this money into different budget categories your spending plan   for example you might put some of it into a grocery category some into an entertainment category some will be assigned to pay your next car insurance bill and some will be an emergency fund   these categories are completely customizable and your budget can be as broad or as detailed as you wish   when you deposit your paycheck you assign that new income into budget categories as well   it does n't matter at this point which accounts your money are located in the only thing that matters is that you own this money and you have access to it   now you might want to use a certain account for a certain budget category but you are not required to do so   for example your grocery category money will probably be in your checking account since you will be spending from it regularly   your emergency fund will hopefully be in an account that earns a little higher interest once you take this approach you might find you do n't need as many bank accounts as you thought you did because the software does the job of separating your money into different accounts for different purposes i 've written before about the different categories of personal finance software   ynab mvelopes and everydollar are three examples of software that will take this approach of separating the concepts of the bank account and the budget category

the issues of trading with unsettled funds are usually restricted to cash accounts   with margin i 've never personally heard of a rule that will catch you in this scenario   you wo n't be able to withdraw funds that are tied up in unsettled positions until the positions settle   you should be able to trade those funds   i 've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds but that does n't mean there is n't a broker somewhere that does brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions however since margin is basically offering you a line of credit   you should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules i 'd guess that you may have heard about restrictions that apply to cash accounts and think they may also apply to margin accounts   if that 's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally try searching for these terms you should be able to find a lot of clear resources on those terms   here 's one that 's current and provides examples on a margin account you avoid these issue because the margin essentially a loan from your broker provides a cushion additional funds that avoid the issues   it is possible that if you over extend yourself that you 'll get a margin call but that seems to be different than what you 're asking and maybe worth a new question if you want to know about that

when you invest say $ 1000 in say 100 shares of a mutual fund at $ 10 per share and the price of the shares changes   you do not have a capital gain or loss and you do not have to declare anything to the irs or make any entry on any line on form 1040 or tell anyone else about it either you can brag about it at parties if the share price has gone up or bitter tears into your cocktail if the price has gone down but the irs not only does not care but it will not let you deduct the paper loss or pay taxes on the paper gain   what you put down on form 1040 schedules b    and d is precisely what the mutual fund will tell you on    form 1099-div and form 1099-b no more no less if you did not report any of these amounts on your previous    tax returns you need to file amended tax returns both    federal as well as state a stock mutual fund invests in stocks and the fund manager may buy and sell some stocks during the course of the year if he makes a profit that money will be distributed to the share holders of the mutual fund that money can be re invested in more shares of the same mutual fund or taken as cash   and possibly invested in some other fund this   capital gain distribution is reported to you on form 1099-div and you have to report sit on your tax return even if you re invested in more share of the same mutual fund and the amount of the distribution is taxable income to you similarly if the stocks owned by the mutual fund pay dividends those will be passed on to you as a dividend distribution and all the above still applies you can choose to reinvest etc the amount will be reported to you on form 1099-div and you need to report it to the irs and include it in your taxable income if the mutual fund manager loses money in the buying and selling he will not tell you that he lost money but it will be visible as a reduction in the price of the shares the loss will not be reported to you on form 1099-div and you can not do anything about it   especially important you can not declare to the irs that you have a loss and you can not deduct the loss on your income tax returns that year when you finally sell your shares in the mutual fund you will have a gain or loss that you can pay taxes on or deduct say the mutual fund paid a dividend of $ 33 one year and you re invested the money into the mutual fund buying 3 shares at the then cost of $ 11 per share you declare the $ 33 on your tax return that year and pay taxes on it two years later you sell all 103 shares that you own for $ 10.50 per share   your total investment was $ 1000 + $ 33 = $ you get $ from the fund and you will owe taxes on $ $ = $ you have a profit of $ 50 on the 100 shares originally bought and a loss of $ 1.50 on the 3 shares bought for $ 11 the net result is a gain of $ you do not pay taxes on $ as the profit from your original $ 1000 investment you pay taxes only on $ remember that you already paid taxes on the $ 33 the mutual fund will report on form 1099-b that you sold 103 shares for $ and that you bought the 103 shares for   an average price of $ = $ per share the difference is taxable income to you if you sell the 103 shares for $ 9 per share say    then you get $ out of an investment of $ for    a capital loss of $ 106 this will be reported to you    on form 1099-b and you will enter the amounts on    schedule d of form 1040 as a capital loss what you actually pay taxes on is the net capital gain if any after combining all your capital gains and losses for the year if the net is a loss you can deduct up to $ 3000 in a year and carry the rest   forward to later years to offset capital gains in later years but your unrealized capital gains or losses those that occur because the mutual fund share price goes up and down like a while you grin or grit your teeth and hang on to your shares are not reported or deducted or taxed anywhere it is more complicated when you do n't sell all the shares you own in the mutual fund or if you sell shares within one year of buying them but let 's stick to simple cases

consistently beating the market by picking stocks is hard professional fund managers ca n't really do it and they get paid big bucks to try you can spend a lot of time researching and picking stocks and you may find that you do a decent job i found that given the amount of money i had invested even if i beat the market by a couple of points i could earn more money by picking up some gigs instead of spending all that time researching stocks and i knew the odds were against me beating the market very often different people will tell you that they have a sure fire strategy that gets returns the thing i wonder is why are you selling the information to me rather than simply making money by executing on your strategy if they 're promising to beat the market by selling you their strategy they 've probably figured out that they 're better off selling subscriptions than putting their own capital on the line i 've found that it is easier to follow an asset allocation strategy i have a target allocation that gives me fairly broad diversification nearly all of it is in etfs i rebalance a couple times a year if something is too far off the target i check my portfolio when i get my quarterly statements lastly i have to echo johnfx 's statement about keeping some of your portfolio in cash i was almost fully invested going into early 2001 and wished i had more cash to invest when everything tanked lesson learned in early 2003 when the djia dropped to around 8000 and everybody i talked to was saying how they had sold off chunks of their 401k in a panic and were staying out of stocks i was able to push some of my uninvested cash into the market and gained ~25 in about a year i try to avoid market timing but when there 's obvious panic or euphoria i might or over allocate my cash position respectively

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

this is not a mistake this is done for out of network providers and mainly when the patient is an anthem member be it blue shield or blue cross even though an assignment of benefits is completed by the patient and all fields on the claim from or are completed assigning the benefits to the provider anthem has placed in their policy that the assignment of benefits the patient signs is null and void   no other carrier that i have come across conducts business in this manner is it smart absolutely not they have now consumed their member 's time in trying to figure out which provider the check is actually for the member now is responsible for forwarding the payment or the patient spends the check thinking anthem made a mistake on their monthly premium at some point odds are slim and is now in debt thousands of dollars because they do n't check with anthem   it creates a huge mess for providers not only have we anthem for payment but now we have to chase the patient and 50 of the time never see the payment in our office it creates more phone calls to anthem but what do they care they are paying pennies on the dollar for their representatives in the philippines to read from a script   anthem is the second largest insurance carrier in the us their profit was over 800 million dollars within 3 months the way they see it we issued payment so stop calling us it 's amazing how they can accept a but not follow the guidelines associated with it   your best bet and what we suggest to patients either deposit the check and write your a personal check or endorse and forward i personally would deposit the check and write a personal check for tracking purposes however keep in mind that in the future you may depend on your bank statements for proof of income e.g. social security and imagine the work having to explain and prove a $ 20,000 deposit and withdraw within the same month

if i have a house that its market value went from $ 100k to $ 140k can i get heloc $ 40 k maybe the amount that you can borrow depends on the market value of the house so if you already have $ 100k borrowed against it it will be tough to borrow another $ 40k without paying a higher interest rate since there is a real risk that the value will decrease and you will be underwater    can i again ask for heloc after i finish the renovation in order to do more renovation and maybe try to end up renovating the house so its value raises up to $ 500k i doubt you can just renovate a house and increase its market value from $ 140k to $ 500k.   much of a house 's value is determined by its location and you can quickly a neighborhood   if you put $ in improvements in a neighborhood where other homes are selling for $ 140k you will not realize nearly that amount in actual market value   people that buy $ 500k houses generally want to be in an area where other homes are worth around the same amount    if you want to to a major renovation such as an addition i would instead shop around for a home improvement loan   the main difference is that you can use the expected value of the house after improvements to determine the loan balance instead of using the current value once the renovations are complete you roll it and the existing mortgage into a new mortgage which will likely be cheaper than a mortgage + heloc the problem is that the cost of the improvements is generally more than the increase in market value   it also helps you make a wise decision versus taking out a $ 40k heloc and spending it all on renovations only to find out that the increase in market value is only $ 10k and you 're now underwater so in your case talk to a contractor to plan out what you want to do which will tell you how much it will cost   then talk to a realtor to determine what the market value with those improvements will be which will tell you how much you can borrow   it 's highly likely that you will need to pay some out of pocket to make up the difference but it depends on what the improvements are and what comparable homes sell for

in 1929 the dow jones industrial average peaked at roughly 390 just prior to the great depression it did not return to that level again until 25 years later in 25 years is a long time to go without any returns especially if you are a retiree there is no easy answer with investing trying to time the tops and bottoms is widely regarded as a foolhardy endeavor but whenever you invest you expose yourself to the possibility of this scenario the only thing i highly recommend is not to base your decision on the historical returns from 1975 to 2000 that the other answers have presented these returns can be explained by policy changes that many are coming to understand are unsustainable the growth of our debt income inequality and monetary manipulation by central banks are all reasons to be skeptical of future returns

the risk other than losing principal especially when rates go up is capital gains as with any mutual fund this one might need to sell assets for cashflow in which case the taxes on the sales are shifted to the investors so you may end up with the fund losing value due to price fluctuations yet you 'll have capital gains probably with a significant short term part since the maturity periods are relatively short to pay taxes on to what extent that may happen depends on the fund 's cashflow influx of money vs. withdrawals capital gains reduce your basis since no money is actually distributed but if you hold the fund for more than a year you lose the difference between the short term and the long term tax for the short term portion of the gains

most of the investors who have large holdings in a particular stock have pretty good exit strategies for those positions to ensure they are getting the best price they can by selling gradually into the volume over time putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason let 's say you have 100,000 shares of a stock and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them take your profits and ride off into the sunset   so you call your broker or log into your brokerage account and put them up for sale   he puts in an order somewhere the stock is sold and your account is credited seems simple right   well not so fast professionals i 'm keeping this simple so please do n't beat me up for it the way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as market makers   these are entities which sit between the markets and you and your broker and when you want to buy or sell a stock most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker   if you work with a large brokerage firm sometimes they 'll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts but that 's another story it is normal for there to be many sometimes hundreds of market makers who are all trading in the same equity   the bigger the stock the more market makers it attracts   they all compete with each other for business and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock google apple and microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks it is very competitive   the way the makers compete is on price   it might surprise you to know that it is the market makers not the markets that decide what a stock will buy or sell for each market maker sets their own prices for what they 'll pay to buy from sellers for and what they 'll sell it to buyers for   this is called respectively the bid and the ask prices   so if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock   the prices you see for stocks are what are called the best bid and best ask prices   what that means is you are being shown the highest bid price what you can sell your shares for and the best ask price what you can buy those shares for because that 's what is required   that being said there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher   many times there will be a big of market makers all at the same bid ask or within fractions of a cent of each other all competing for business   trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can the point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at   they adjust those prices based among other factors on how much buying and selling volume they 're seeing   if they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then they 'll start marking down their bid prices   this keeps them from paying too much for shares they 're going to have to find a buyer for eventually and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell   conversely if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system they 'll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains since they 're selling you shares they bought from someone else presumably at a lower price   but they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades   sneaky eh depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company you 're selling and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the share 's price if the block is large enough then it 's possible it will not all sell to one market maker or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price this is a pretty complex subject as you can see and i 've cut a lot of corners and oversimplified much to keep it   but the short answer to your question is it depends hope this helps good luck

futures contracts are a member of a larger class of financial assets called derivatives derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets financial or real other kinds of derivatives are call options put options fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds bonds etc   a futures contract is a contract that specifies the following just like with any other contract there are two parties involved one party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price the other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset there is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract the language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract the agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract   so answer your question buying on june 1 a futures contract at the futures price of $ 100 with a maturity date on august 1 means you commit to paying $ 100 for the underlying asset on august 1 you do n't have to pay anything upfront futures price is simply what the contract the underlying asset will exchange hands for

first off the jargon you are looking for is a hedge a hedge is an investment position intended to offset potential losses gains that may be incurred by a companion investment the other answers which point out that put options are frequently used as a hedge are correct however there are other hedging instruments used by financial professionals to mitigate risk   for example suppose you would really prefer that foo corporation not go bankrupt perhaps because they own you money because you 're a bondholder or perhaps because you own them because you 're a stockholder or maybe you have some other reason for wanting foo corp to do well to mitigate the risk of loss due to bankruptcy of foo corp you can buy a credit default swap a cds is essentially a bet that pays off if foo corp goes bankrupt just as insurance on your house is a bet that pays off if your house burns down    finally do n't ever forget that all insurance is not just a bet that the bad thing you 're insuring against is going to happen it is also a bet that the insurer is going to pay you if that happens   if the insurer goes bankrupt at the same time as the thing you are insuring goes bad you 're potentially in big trouble

the main reason as far as i can see is that the dividends are payments with which the shareholders may do what they want capital that the company has no use for does not make a significant positive return on investment as you pointed out yes the company could accrue interest but that is not going to make the company large sums of cash while the company may be great at making shoes maybe even the best in the world does n't mean they are good investors sure they could dabble at using their capital to invest in other equities but they do n't because they just want to focus on making shoes if the dividend goes to the investors they can do what they wish be it reinvest in the company or invest elsewhere other companies that may make good use of the capital and create significant returns on it are one such example that is the rational answer beyond that one of the main reasons is that people like the feeling of receiving dividends it might not be the answer you are looking for but many people prefer companies that pay dividends for no rational reason over companies which grow their asset value

specifically on the subject of maxing out your 401k there are several downsides the employer match usually only applies to the first 6 some employers offer no match at all you listed the match as a pro but i think it should be pointed out that you can usually get this benefit without maxing out your plan the investment options are limited usually there is at least one fund available from all the common investment classes but these may not be your preferred funds if you were able to choose for yourself fees can be very high if you are working for a small to medium size company the fees for each fund will often be higher than for the same funds in a plan offered by a large company fees are usually related to the dollar amount of assets under management each person has a different tax situation so if you are single and making 6 figures you might still be in the 25 bracket even after maxing out your 401k but the same person filing jointly with a spouse that makes less could get down to the 15 bracket with a smaller contribution i meet my retirement savings goals without maxing out the 401k as long as the amount is above the employer match amount my second priority is to funnel as much money as possible in to my ira because i get lower fees and better investment options from vanguard

allowances are calculated as your total deductions divided by the tax year 's personal exemptions as mentioned above it is a multiplier for 2015 the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $ 12,600 and each of you gets 1 personal exemption $ 4,000 in 2015 that 's a total of $ 12,600 + or $ divide this by the personal exemption and you get roughly 5 allowances now say your employer offers health insurance and a 401(k plan your total health insurance or cafeteria contributions are $ 2,000 for the year and your total 401(k plan contributions are $ 6,000 for the year this would give an additional $ 2,000 + $ 6,000 = $ 8,000 divided by $ 4,000 = 2 allowances thus you would file with 7 allowances note that tax credits are not included in the allowance calculation that is because they do not affect your taxable income but rather directly reduce your taxes due

i interned for about six months at a firm that employed a few technical analysts so i 'll try to provide what little information i can since the bulk of the intra day trading was decided technical analysts had two main functions this basically boils down to my answer to your question there are still enough people trading firms etc who believe in candlestick charting and other visually subjective patterns that if you notice a trend pattern etc before the majority of traders observing you may be able to time the market successfully and profit this is becoming increasingly dangerous however because of the steps i outlined above over time the charting patterns that have been proven effective often in many firms individually since the algorithms are all proprietary are incorporated into computer algorithms so the traders you 're competing with to see the pattern are increasingly low latency computer less than a few blocks from the exchange summary candlestick charting along with other forms of subjective technical analysis has its believers and assuming enough of these believers trade the standard strategies based on the standard patterns one could conceivably time the market with enough skill to anticipate these traders acting on the pattern and therefore profit however the marginal benefits of doing so are decreasing rapidly as computers take over more trading responsibility   caveats   i know you 're in australia where the market penetration of hf algo traders is n't as high as in the us so it might be a few more years before the marginal benefits cease to be profitable that being said if various forms of technical analysis proved wildly profitable in australia above and beyond profits available in other markets rest assured that large american or british trading firms would already have moved in   my experience is limited to one trading firm so i certainly ca n't speak for the industry as a whole i know i did n't address candlestick charts specifically but since they 're only one piece of visual technical analysis i tried to address the issue as a whole   this somewhat ties into the debate between fundamental or technical analysis which i wo n't get into investopedia has a short article on the subject as i said i wo n't get into this because while it 's a nice debate for small traders at large trading firms they do n't care they want to make profit and any strategy that can be vetted whether it 's fundamental technical or will be vetted   i want to add more information to my answer to clear up some of the misconceptions in the comments including those talking about biased studies and a lack of evidence for or against technical analysis and candlestick charts i 'll explore this relationship further down   it 's important to keep in mind that charting methods including candlestick charts are visually subjective ways of representing data and that any interpretations drawn from such charts should ideally represent objective technical indicators a charting method is only as good as the indicators it 's used to represent therefore an analysis of the underlying indicators provides a suitable analysis for the visual medium in which they 're presented   one important study that evaluates several of these indicators is foundations of technical analysis computational algorithms statistical inference and empirical implementation by lo and lest anyone accuse its authors of bias i should point out that not only is it published by the national bureau of economic research a highly reputable organization within economics and finance but also that the majority of its authors come from mit 's sloan school which holds a reputation second to none this study finds that several technical indicators e.g. head and shoulder double bottom and various rectangle techniques do provide marginal value they also find that although   human judgment is still superior to most computational algorithms in the area of visual pattern recognition technical analysis can be improved by using automated algorithms since this paper was published in 2000 computing power and statistical analysis have gained significant ground against human ability to identify and exploit for visual pattern detection like candlestick charts   second i suggest you look into david 's book evidence based technical analysis applying the scientific method and statistical inference to trading signals he finds similar results to the lo et al paper in that some technical indicators do add value to the investment process but those that do are those that can be represented mathematically and thus programmed directly into trading algorithms thus bypassing visual tools like candlestick charts   he describes how studies including lo et al have found that head and shoulders patterns are worse than random i.e. you would earn higher returns if you simply traded at random that point is worth than repeating if a day trader is using a candlestick chart and using head and shoulders patterns as part of their he 's rolling the dice when he uses that pattern and returns that come from its application come from chance this reminds me of that old story about a company that sends out predicting the results of sports games complete with strategies and data to back up the predictions the company sends out several versions of the every game each predicting a different winner given a large enough sample size by the end of the season there are a few people who have received a that accurately predicted the winner for every game and they 're convinced the system is perfect the others were n't so lucky however relying on candlestick charts and ta patterns that are from the pre computerized era is reassuring to some traders and gives them a sense of control and beating the market but how long will chance remain on your side this is why i maintain that visual tools like candlestick charts are a slowly dying medium they certainly still add value to some trading firms which is why bloomberg terminals still ship with this functionality built in but as more and more research shows automated algorithms and statistical indicators can provide more value it 's also important to think about whether the majority of the value added by visual tools like candlestick charts comes in the form of profit or a sense of security to traders who learned the field using them over the past few decades   finally it 's extremely important to realize that the actions of retail investors in the equities market can not begin to represent the behaviors of the market as a whole in the equities markets alone trading firms and institutional investors dwarf retail investors and the difference in scale is even more vastly pronounced in derivatives and currency markets the fact that some retail investors use candlestick charts and the technical indicators they hope them provides nothing but minor anecdotal evidence as to their effectiveness

this is incentive financing simply put the car company is n't in the business of making money by buying government bonds they 're in the business of making money by selling cars if you are qualified from a credit standpoint and want to buy a $ 20k car on any given sunday you 'll typically be offered a loan of between 6 and 9 let 's say this loan is for three years and you can offer $ 4000 down payment and/or trade the required monthly payment on the remaining $ 16k at the high end of 9 is $ which over 3 years means you 'll pay $ in interest now that may sound like a good chunk of change and for the ordinary individual it is possibly enough that you decide not to buy today now let 's say all other things being equal that the company is offering 0.9 incentive financing same price same down payment same loan term your payments over 3 years decrease to $ and over the same loan term you would only pay $ in interest you save over $ in interest over three years which for you is again a decent chunk of change theoretically the car company 's losing that same $ in interest by offering this deal and depending on how it 's getting the money it lends you most financial companies are middlemen getting money from bond buying investors who expect a rate of return that could be a real loss and not just opportunity cost but that incentive got you to walk in their door and not their competitor 's it helped convince you to buy the $ 20,000 car the gross margin on that car price minus direct costs is typically 20 for the dealer plus another 20 for the manufacturer so by giving up the $ 2,000 on the financing side the dealer and manufacturer just earned themselves 4 times that much on top of that by buying that car you 're committing to buy the parts for the car a side business with even higher margins of which the car company gets a pretty big chunk you may even be required to use dealer service while the car 's under warranty in order to keep the warranty valid another when you get right down to it the loss from the incentive financing is drowned in the gross profits they make from selling the car to you now in reality it 's a fine balance the percentages i mentioned are gross margins earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization sales general and administrative costs basically just revenue minus direct cost of goods sold add in all these side costs and you get a net margin of only about 3.5 of revenue so your $ 20k car purchase may only make the car company 's stakeholders $ 700 on the sale plus slightly higher net margins on parts and service over the life of the car because incentive financing is typically only offered through the company 's own financing subsidiary the loss is n't in the form of a cost paid but simply a revenue not realized but it can still move a car company from net positive to net negative earnings if the program is too successful this is why not everyone does it and not all at the same time if you 're selling enough cars without it why give away money   typically these incentives are offered for two reasons to clear out old cars or excess inventory or to maintain ground against a competitor 's stronger sales numbers keeping cars on a lot ready to sell is expensive and so is not having your brand driving around on the street turning heads and their name on the minds of potential customers

if you are a permanent resident and it was n't taken away or abandoned then you are a resident alien for u.s. tax purposes one of the two tests for being a resident alien is the green card test being a resident alien means all your worldwide income is subject to u.s. taxes regardless of where you live or work that does n't necessarily mean you need to actually pay taxes on your income again if you 've already paid it you may be able to use the foreign tax credit to reduce your taxes by the amount already paid to a foreign government but you need to report it on u.s. tax forms just like income from the u.s. and you can then apply any tax credits that you may qualify for as a resident alien you file taxes using form 1040 you are required to file taxes if your income for a particular year is above a certain threshold this threshold is described in the first few pages of the 1040 instructions for each year for 2013 for single filing status under 65 it is $ 10000 the only way you can legally not file is if your income the whole year was below this amount you should go back and file taxes if you were required to but failed to having filed taxes when required is very important if you want to later on it is also one component of demonstrating you 're maintaining residency in the u.s. which you 're required to do as a permanent resident being outside the u.s. for a long time or else you 'll lose your permanent residency even filing taxes might not be enough as your description of your presence in the u.s. shows you only go there for brief periods each year not really living there you 're lucky you have n't lost your green card already any time you go there you run a great risk of them noticing and taking it away

we need more info to give a better answer but in short if you assume you will make $ 0 in other employment income next year there is a huge tax benefit in deferring 50k until next year total tax savings would probably be something like $ 15k rough estimate if you took the rrsp deduction this year you would save something like 20k this year but then you would be taxed on it next year if you withdraw it probably paying another 5k the year after ie you would get about the same net tax savings in both years if you contributed to your rrsp and withdrew next year vs deferring it to next year   on a non tax basis you would benefit by having the cash today so you could earn investment income on your rrsp but you would want to go low risk as you need the money next year so the most you could earn would be something like 3 the real benefit to the rrsp contribution is if you defer your withdrawal into your retirement because you can further defer your taxes into the future earning investment income in the meantime but if you need to withdraw next year you wo n't get that opportunity

you can do either a 1099 or a w-2   there is no limitations to the number of w-2s one can have in reporting taxes   problems occur with the irs when one forgets to report income   even if one holds only one job at a time people typically have more than one w-2 if they change jobs within the year the w-2 is the simplest way to go and you may want to consider doing this if you do not intend to work this side business into significant income    however a 1099 gig is preferred by many in some situations   for things like travel expenses you will probably receive the income from these on a 1099 but you can deduct them from your income using a schedule c.   along these lines you may be able to deduct a wide variety of other things like travel to and from the client 's location equipment such as computers and office supplies and maybe a portion of your home internet bill   also this opens up different retirement contributions schemes such as a simplified employee pension    this does come with some drawbacks however   first your life is more complicated as things need to be documented to become actual business expenses   you are much more likely to be audited by the irs   your taxes become more complicated and it is probably necessary to employee a cpa to do them   if you do this for primary full time work you will have to buy your own benefits   most telling you will have to pay both sides of social security taxes on most profits   keep in mind that a good account can help you transfer profits to dividends which will allow you to be taxed at 15 and avoid social security taxes so it really comes down to what you see this side gig expanding into and your goals   if you want to make this a real business then go 1099 if you are just doing this for a months and a few thousand dollars go w-2

stock basically implies your ownership in the company if you own 1 ownership in a company the value of your stake becomes equal to 1 of the valuation of the entire company dividends are basically of company 's profits to its shareholders by holding stocks of a company you become eligible to receiving dividends proportional to your ownership in the company dividends though are not guaranteed as the company may incur losses or the management may decide to use the cash for future growth instead of it to the shareholders for example let 's say a company called abc inc is listed on nyse and has a total of 1 million shares issued let 's say if you purchase 100 stocks of abc your ownership in abc will become let 's say that the share price at the time of purchase was $ 10 each total investment = stock price number of stocks purchased = $ 10 100 = $ 1,000 now let 's say that the company declares a dividend of $ 1 per share then   dividend yield = dividend stock price = $ = 10 if one has to draw analogy with other banking products one can think of stock and dividend as fixed deposits analogous to stock and the interest earned on the fixed deposit analogous to dividend

cfds should not be used as a buy and hold strategy which is risky enough doing with shares directly however with proper money and risk management and the proper use of stop losses a medium term strategy is very plausible   i was using cfds in the past over a short time period of usually between a couple of days to a couple is weeks trying to catch small swings with very tight stops i kept getting due to my stops being too tight so had too many small loses for my few bigger wins and yes i lost some money almost $ 5k in one year i have recently started a more medium term strategy with wider stops trying to catch trending stocks i have only recently started this strategy and so far have 2 loses and 3 wins just remember that you do get charged a financing fee for holding long position overnight buy for short position you actually get paid the funding fee for overnight positions my broker charges the official interest rate + 2.5 for long positions and pays the official rate 2.5 for short positions so yes cfds can be used for the longer term as long as you are implementing proper money and risk management and use stop losses just be aware of the implications of using margin and all the costs involved

you receive a 1099-misc for the value of the car you claim that as income even though you received goods rather than cash when you sell the car it would be much like selling any and would cause no tax consequence unless the sale price was much different than the value when you sell the car you may have received more or less than the value of the car likely less if you sold it for more then you might need to claim the additional money as income perhaps short term capital gains if you sold it for less but to a friend or relative then you might think you could claim a loss but the tax collector would just claim that you had given them a gift and attempt to collect the tax from them contest winners often have the frustration that they are taxed at the full value of the won even though they would not value the item at that amount and contest prizes often do not sell for the full value stated on the 1099 and often for much less marginal tax rates were higher prior to reagan and when a contest winner would sell an item for 80 of the value they often paid most of the proceeds to taxes

where goes the delta to the sea of course   your question is very valid and for once i think most of the answers are too involved into mechanical details and are badly missing the big picture   at the risk of over simplifying things let me try to describe the situation in broad strokes inflation the volume of money grows faster than production including services   deflation production increase faster than the volume of money   imagine an economy with 10 products and $ 10 1 product = $ 1 in an inflationary scenario money available increase $ 20 for 10 products 1 product = $ 2   in a deflationary scenario money available decrease $ 5 for 10 products 1 product = $ 0.5   so far it 's pretty textbook now onto the stuff that you do n't usually read in textbooks time   say 10 people are attending an auction each with $ 10 bucks 10 items are for sale $ 100 and 10 items item price is $ 10 now if just before opening the bidding you go around and give each person $ 40 every one has $ 50 each product sells for $ 50 that 's the picture people have of inflation prices have increased but everybody has more money so it comes down to the same thing   now let 's bring this example closer to reality you have to distribute $ 400 so the total amount of money is $ 500 which means that the normal price of each item should be $ 50 now imagine that instead of giving money to everyone at the same time you started by giving $ 40 to 1 guy who was hanging out in front the auction starts while you go around distributing the money the first guy manages to buy 2 items at $ 10 each now there is $ 480 in the market and only 8 items making each item $ 60 on average the next guy to get money manages to snap 2 items at $ 15 6 items left and $ 450 in play each item now costs $ 75 and keep increasing in price as things move along people who get the money early buy items under their real value and people who get paid at the end pick up the tab because by then there are only a few items left back to reality while inflation means that wages eventually increase and they do actual purchasing decrease for most people due to this simple trick employees are pretty much at the end of the chain income tax another major source of signal loss is income tax it works by brackets as you certainly know simplifying again because i am lazy take a guy who earns $ 100 pays no taxes can buy 100 products at $ 1 each now put in some inflation he earns $ 500 he pays $ 50 in taxes and can buy 90 products at $ 5 each by the time he earns $ 10,000 he can only buy 50 products on account of income tax so this is another area where you are bleeding purchasing power and why income tax which was originally presented as a tax for the ultra rich is now a fact of life for most people except the ultra rich of course   money as debt next stop money itself money is created as debt in our society at the risk of over simplifying things again let 's say bank a has $ 1000 in assets in the fractional reserve system our current system bank a can lend out many times over that amount let 's say $ 9,000 for a total of $ 10,000 much more in reality and of course it lends that money at interest when bank a has made $ 10,000 available through 10 interest loans the total amount of money has increased by $ 10,000 but when the loans are paid back $ 11,000 must be paid to the bank so the net result of the operation is that $ 1,000 get taken out of the market   this system explains why almost all companies and governments have huge debts and why most of the world 's large companies belong to financial institutions of some kind and why most of the world 's wealth rest in very very few hands   to fully answer your question and provide details and references and names one would have to write a book or 5 there is a lot more than can be said on the subject and of course all the examples given here are extremely simplified but i think they illustrate the key issues pretty well   bottom line is that our system is designed that way our economic system is rigged and the delta out on automatic

that 's unlikely to be a good move   after the penalties you would have roughly $ to apply to your debt   but then what   you 'd still have $ 100k of debt with no change in your income situation   you would be sacrificing half of your retirement fund to reduce your debt by only a third two points from your question are notable   first you say your current job makes you eligible for loan forgiveness   second you say you love what you do   given that it sounds like it 's likely you 'll remain in your current job long enough to have your loan forgiven   i would see this as a major reason to stick it out until that time   it wo n't be painful from a work perspective since you like the work in contrast to someone who grinds through a job they dislike just to have their loan forgiven but only from a budget perspective   also since your income is less than $ 75k you may be able to deduct the interest on a student loan payment on your taxes see publication 970 the blow somewhat according to your numbers your loan payment is a bit over 10 of your income   that is not pleasant but it does n't seem out of the question that you could make it work through judicious budgeting   it would depend on other aspects of your lifestyle and expenses which you do n't mention in the question and which might go in a separate question if you start wondering how to do that budgeting

while you have asked for general principles i am going to seize onto a specific example you gave in order to illustrate the difficulties here argentina argentina 's bonds are probably not safer than us treasuries argentina is presently in the business of seizing foreign oil businesses while championing leftist causes at the very least this indicates an elevated level of political risk s&p which affirmed argentina 's ratings five notches into junk territory at b said policies such as those enacted since the country 's october presidential election could also weaken argentina 's macroeconomic framework and external liquidity actions of this type continue to shorten the economic planning horizon in the country and contribute to argentina 's deteriorating economic and political links with the international community s&p lowers argentina outlook to negative the wall street journal 23 april 2012 you 're not going to be able to capture that sort of a risk with raw budget numbers it 's hard enough to figure out creditworthiness for a business for an entire nation it 's even harder that 's why credit rating firms as faulty as they may be employ dozens of people to try and figure this sort of thing out additionally there is a currency risk associated with buying bonds denominated in foreign currencies it does n't matter much if $ nation repays all its bonds if they have so much inflation that the repayment is worth half of what it used to be nor is it much help if your own nation 's currency rises in value while your investment 's value is stable elsewhere ultimately the value of a bond is how much money am i actually going to get back and while operating a budget surplus is n't a bad sign in and of itself it 's hardly the complete picture a fair accounting of the relative creditworthiness of any two nations needs to unite two massive fields of study macroeconomics and politics it is possible that the right sort of degree in economics risk management or a similar field of study could prepare you to know exactly what sort of research is necessary to make a meaningful analysis now if you just want some commentary on which bonds are safe to buy ask a credit rating agency for example read standard and poor 's sovereign ratings or find a mutual fund which may invest in international bonds at its own discretion and have someone else make the decisions

the coupon should save you $ 10 either way assuming that you meet the criteria for using the coupon you 're figuring out the discount based on the cost of the food alone   you should be including the tip in your calculations yes they 're tacking on something that is otherwise optional but that 's because enough people forget that the server works just as hard regardless of whether there 's a coupon involved or not   so restaurants build the tip in to keep employee morale up which in turn encourages them to keep a good level of service up i guess it gets down to how much you tip   if you typically do n't tip which would be rather then yes you do lose money with a $ 60 meal   if you tip 18 then you save exactly $ 10 $ $ 10.00 = $   if you normally tip 10 15 a customary range then it 's somewhere in between edit following littleadv 's discussion on this question i am assuming that the 18 goes directly to the and is more or less expected if it does n't in which case one might choose not to tip at all because it would just line the pockets of the restaurant owner then you 're absolutely correct in figuring out the value of the coupon by treating the 18 as a tax

the reality that the share price did not move shows that there is nothing nefarious going on   it is most likely some mutual fund their position to another fund    you can commonly see the play out at market openings if you have access to level ii data   you will see a big block sitting on both sides of the same bid ask   if you put in a higher bid or vice versa the two positions will move to match yours   and when the market opens their trade will be transacted before yours even though you are thinking well i put in my bid first   obviously they have agreed to swap and agreed to use whatever value the market decides

first let me answer the question the best way i can i do n't know if there are any studies other than those that have already been mentioned now let 's talk about something more interesting you do n't need to base your behavior on any study even if it is scientific let 's pretend for example that we could find a scientifically valid study that shows that people spend 25 more when using a credit card than they do when spending cash   this does not mean that if you use a credit card you will spend 25 more   all it means is that the average person spending with a credit card spends more than the average person paying cash   but there are outliers   there are plenty of people who are being frugal while using a credit card and there are others who spend too much cash   everyone 's situation is different   the idea that you will automatically spend less by using cash would not be proven by such a study when hearing any type of advice like this you need to look at your own situation and see if it applies to your own life   and that is what people are doing with the anecdotal comments   some say yep i spend too much if i use a card others say actually i find that when i have cash in my wallet i spend it on junk   and both are correct   it does n't matter what the study says the average person does because you are not average now let 's say that you are a financial counselor who helps people work through disastrous financial messes   your client has $ 20,000 in credit card debt and is having trouble paying all his bills   he does n't have a budget and never uses cash   probably the best advice for this guy is to stop using his card and start paying cash   it does n't take a scientific study to see that this guy needs to change his behavior for what it is worth i keep a strict budget keeping track of my spending on the computer   the vast majority of my spending is electronic   i find tracking my cash spending difficult and sometimes i find that when i have cash in my wallet it seems to disappear without a trace

no free lunch you can not receive risk free interest on more money than you actually put down the construct you are proposing is called carry trade and will yield you the interest difference in exchange for assuming currency risk negative expectation in the long run one would expect the higher yielding currency to devalue faster at a rate that exactly negates the difference in interest net profit is therefore zero in the long run now factor in the premium that a forex broker charges and now you may expect losses the size of which depends on the leverage chosen if there was any way that this could reliably produce a profit even without friction i.e. roll over transaction costs spread quants would have already arbitraged it away in my experience true long term roll over costs in relation to interest are a lot harder to compute than for example the cost of a stock transaction this makes the whole deal very as to the idea of artificially constructing a usd usd pair i regret to tell you that such a construct is not possible for further info see this question on carry trade why does currency carry trade work

in the uk you have an allowance of £ 40,000 per annum for tax relief into a pension this amount includes both your and your employer 's contributions if you earn more than £ 150,000 per annum this allowance starts to reduce and if you earn less than the allowance your allowance is limited to what you earn you can also carry over unused allowance from up to 3 years previously if you stick within this allowance you wo n't pay tax on your pension contributions if you go over the excess will be subject to tax salary exchange normally lets you avoid the national insurance value of your contribution being taxed if you paid your own money into your pension without going through salary exchange your contributions would have the 20 basic rate of tax credited to them and if you 're a higher rate taxpayer you could reclaim the difference between the basic rate of tax and the higher rate of tax you pay but the national insurance you 've paid on your own money would not be you ca n't get the money back you 've paid into your pension till you are are 58 given that you are 27 now the minimum age has risen from its historic 55 for your age group   that 's the pension trade off you forgo tax now in the expectation that once retired you will be paying tax at a lower rate because your income will be lower and you are much less likely to be subject to higher rate taxation in return for locking in your money till you 're older your pension income will be subject to tax when you eventually take it there are other options such as isas which have lower annual limits £ 20,000 currently and on which your contributions do not attract tax relief but which are not taxed as income when you eventually spend them isas and pensions are not mutually exclusive so if you have the money you can do both it 's up to you to determine what mix of savings will be appropriate to generate income for your eventual retirement if you are living in some other country when you retire your pension will be paid net of uk tax you might then be able to claim or pay any difference between that and your local tax rate depending on what agreement exists between the uk government and the other country 's government

depending on the state this might not be possible loans are considered contracts and various states regulate how minors may enter into them for example in the state of oregon a minor may not enter into a contract without their parent being on the contract as well so you are forced to wait until you turn 18 at that time you wo n't have a credit history and to lenders that often is worse than having bad credit i ca n't help with the car other than to recommend you buy a junker for $ and just live with it for now but you could certainly get a secured credit card or line of credit from your local bank the way they are arranged is you make a deposit of an amount of your choosing generally at least $ 200 for credit cards and $ 1,000 for lines of credit and receive a revolving line with a limit of that same amount as you use and pay on this loan it will be reported in your credit history if you start that now by the time you turn 18 you will have much better options for purchasing vehicles

you pay tax on the entire amount not just the capital gains    when cashing out such a plan you would pay the top marginal tax rate on the full amount plus another 10 in penalties   it is very likely that the additional income of the balance withdrawal will increase your top marginal rate    it is impossible to come up with a precise answer as we do n't know the following however you can take a concept away from this that is important   you will be taxed and penalized on the entire 401 k balance not just the capital gain    in the best case scenario that is you had little or no income in a given year   under current tax law you would owe about 31 of your 401 k balance in taxes   as this is such an inefficient use of money most authors recommend against it except in the case of extreme circumstances

it 's just a question of priorities   in short yes   you could do the job   successfully and workout 2 hours a day if and only if working out is your primary and essentially only non work activity and you therefore prioritize the hell out of it   you have hours in the week a figure all junior bankers know all too well   you do the math on working hours sleep and working out and see how much is left for everything else in your life not much    perhaps this is obvious by now but you 'd have to be a complete fool to spend any time cooking cleaning or doing laundry   you will be making at least $ 150k w/ bonus would you rather spend your vanishingly small amount of non sleep work workout time cleaning or attempting to maintain some friendships   outsource the crap you do n't want to do   that 's the only way to make analyst life work especially if you want to devote material time to staying in shape   by the way when people say they work 100 hours it starts to lose some meaning   basically at some point you just flip the counting around and calculate how much time you 're sleeping out of the office and assume the rest is work   that 100 hours definitely includes meals probably travel time to from home and probably could include a workout during the day or early evening

when you are placing an order with an online broker you should already know what exchange or exchanges that stock trades on for example if you look up under yahoo finance notice how news corp is traded both on the asx and the nasdaq the difference is the shares traded on the asx have the extension that is how you know the difference between them when you are putting orders in with your online broker you will need to select the exchange you wish your order to go to if your broker allows trading on multiple exchanges so you should always know which exchange your order goes to

investors purchase additional shares all the time every investor that adds money to their investments does this every paycheck or every month investors do this every time they reinvest dividends interest or capital gains they also buy and sell shares when they decide to rebalance their portfolio   whether you are investing via a broker mutual fund or etf the investment company can handle this issue you do want to know how they want you to specify which shares you want them to sell the laws in your country may specify a default procedure or what needs to be done if you want to use another procedure or if you are allowed to change once you have specified a procedure

off the top of my head i do n't know of any publicly traded companies that routinely earmark distributions as return of capital but theoretically it 's certainly applicable to any publicly traded company the wikipedia article gives one situation in which a publicly traded company may use return of capital public business may return capital as a means to increase the debt equity ratio and increase their leverage risk profile since return of capital is a distribution it shrinks the firm 's equity thus increasing its leverage investopedia also has an article dividend facts you may not know that gives an example of when return of capital might be used sometimes especially in the case of a special large dividend part of the dividend is actually declared by the company to be a return of capital in this case instead of being taxed at the time of distribution the return of capital is used to reduce the basis of the stock making for a larger capital gain down the road assuming the selling price is higher than the basis for instance if you buy shares with a basis of $ 10 each and you get a $ 1 special dividend 55 cents of which is return of capital the taxable dividend is 45 cents the new basis is $ and you will pay capital gains tax on that 55 cents when you sell your shares sometime in the future a company may choose to earmark some or all of its distribution as return of capital in order to provide shareholders with a more beneficial tax treatment the irs describes this different tax treatment distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not dividends a return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company a return of capital reduces the basis of your stock these distributions do n't necessarily count as taxable income except in some instances once the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero any further non dividend distribution is capital gain the irs also states a distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution does not have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits in this case the firm is lowering its equity because it 's paying distributions out of that equity instead of accumulated earnings profits a company may use return of capital to maintain a distribution even in times of financial difficulty   in the context of closed end funds however return of capital can be much more complicated and can affect the fund 's performance and reputation in numerous ways also jb king is correct in you that return of capital is not the same thing as return on the latter is a method for valuing a company and determining how efficient a company is where it comes to using its resources to quote jb king 's comment again

basically there are 2 ways you can make money from an investment through income eg rent or dividends and through the price of the investment going up capital growth or gains most people associate negative gearing with investment properties but it can be done with shares and other investments where you borrow money to buy the investment and it produces an income of some sort if the investment does not produce an income then you can not negative gear it using a property as an example in australia if all your expenses each month loan interest payments council and water rates insurance and/or strata advertising and management fees depreciation and maintenance expense are greater than your income rent then you are negative gearing the investment property this is a monthly loss on your investment which can be used to offset and reduce the amount of tax you pay during the year so most people negative gearing an investment property will get a nice sum back when they do their tax returns the problem with negative gearing is that you have to lose money in order to save some tax so as an example if you are on a marginal tax rate of 30 for every $ 1 you lose from the investment property you will save in tax if your marginal tax rate is 45 then will save in tax for every $ 1 lost on the investment property thus negative gearing becomes more tax effective the higher your income and tax bracket but you are still losing money overall the problem is that most novice investors buy an investment property for the main purpose of reducing their taxes this can be dangerous because the main reason to buy any investment should be that you consider it to be a good investment not to save you tax because if the investment is not a good one then you will not only lose money on the income side but also on the capital side negative gearing should be looked at as a bonus or additional benefit when a good investment to buy not as the reason to buy the investment

i do n't think so in your case unless the account generates so much interest income that it became reportable i do n't know the exact limit but i think it 's in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars you might get a 1099 form if it generates over $ 10 of interest income but you do n't have to file taxes if your overall income is too low anyways the us does not typically tax assets only income there are some states florida is the only one i can think of that has odd tax treatment of intangible assets but i doubt that would apply in your case if this were a large enough amount usually over $ 10,000 it might trigger some reporting requirements possibly by your home country

i kinda thought it had something to do with losing 2.6 million jobs in 2008 now that 's a lot of revenue gone oh also the bush tax cuts   all the more reason to keep increase spending by 5 10 a year right how about we create an envionment that yields more jobs rather than increasing the taxes of those left because that worked so well for social security originally supported by 5 10 employees per 1 receiving benefits now it 's only supported by 2 employees per 1 receiving ultra sustainable   gt;so almost 10 of our deficit i 'd say that 's a good start    10 of our deficit so the amount of debt interest we 'll pay this year a drop in the bucket either way spending is the real culprit   gt;i do agree we spend way too much on the pentagon but pretty sure that went up a lot without our two unfunded republican wars    and now we 're in a half dozen active and secret conflicts pakistan syria libya all the more reason for obama to immediately remove us from those wars but he has n't he has expanded them and our military costs keep going up it 's not about this is n't the right time to withdrawl it 's about his corporate masters being the same as the bush corporate masters telling him to continue it 's about oil gas and the pipelines and projection of power that comes with it obama has continued and expanded the same policies as bush he can not hide behind well bush was worse he ca n't say that because it is nt true infact we 're killing more peasants in other countries than ever just with military industrial complex built drones   gt;there 's also the unfunded bush medicare prescription drug plan    yep that prevents the government from negotiating prices on prescriptions for a token   $ 10 billion rebate but which will yield $ 10 trillion in revenues over the next 15 years sounds like a great roi while the costs of drugs is in the us   so what did obama do he fed that industry another 30 million new customers without so much as any discount the government purposely stays out of the negotiation of price why because the bill was written by insurance industry and healthcare industry executives like most bills are healthcare is nice but its the cost of healthcare that is the issue if the cost was more reasonable you would nt even need insurance but because they can charge $ 70 for a single pair of rubber gloves when the market price on a box is $ 5 10 we can plainly see the cost of medical care in the us is bloated and we get much less than comparative countries    obama is just like bush he has enriched the various industries the only difference between bush and obama are which industries are enriched you 'll notice i did n't mention enrichment of citizens because they are an afterthought obama only needs to sell the program to citizens he sold it we bought it   gt;you ca n't seriously think putting those people back in charge will lead to good things   no i do n't think republicans or people like bush or romney are necessarily good for us either the thing i have a problem with is that people like you think obama is any different he 's not new president same as the old president new speech writer new cabinet stuffed with corporate cronies and former lobbyists but business as usual and orders from corporate and private masters

gt between rise in productivity and rise in wages   but that does n't even pass the logic test so i do n't know why it 's routinely hauled out as something that 's supposed to be meaningful   if employees are more productive you need less of them   if you need less there is more supply and demand i.e. wages goes down   add into that people living and working longer and there is less competition for labor in most markets       there was a relationship from 1945 to 1970 but not because they are linked   just because that was the benefit of being the world 's healthiest economy and superpower following a major war   it was never meant to last

well depends but on average the stock market has historically returned somewhere around 10 per year   note this can vary wildly from year to year see so it would be roughly 2.8 years to get your 30 if you happen to get the average market return for those 3 years but the chances of that happening exactly are slim to none   you could end up with + 50 or -30 over that ~3 year period of time so the calculation does n't do you that much good for that short period of time but if you are talking a span of 30 years then you could plan using that as a very rough ballpark good rule of thumb is you should n't put any money in the stock market you think you will need anytime in the next 5 years formula to figure out total gain would be   principal x 1 + rate of return ^ years

what he said was   term returns show fat tails in their distribution   this means that in the short run rare events in the stock market like huge up and downswings happen much more often than you would expect given the circumstances   term returns converge towards a gaussian distribution    this means that long term changes in stock prices show about the level of swings you would expect to see   gt;the authors think there 's a connection between this and the long memory of i.e. that the of absolute volatilities also has a fat tail   auto correlation is the idea that an event is closely related or depends upon a previous event   it should n't be a surprise that prices can depend on previous prices   contrast this with a coin toss   each time you toss the coin the result is independent of any previous result   normally you would use an estimate of auto correlation to test the randomness of your time series   unless you have good reason to do otherwise you use the standard normal or gaussian distribution to do so   some previous study or perhaps this one may have found that the distribution of their auto correlation estimates for volatility change in prices   is not normally distributed but rather that extreme values happen more often than would be expected fat tail   these guys find a correlation between the short term return fat tails the normally   distributed long term returns and a previous finding that the auto correlation of volatility may have fat tails and they think that these things could be more than simply coincidence

why do people talk about stock that pay high dividends   traditionally people who buy dividend stocks are looking for income from their investments most dividend stock companies pay out dividends every quarter every 90 days if set up properly an investor can receive a dividend check every month every week or as often as they have enough money to the ex dates there is a difference in high $ $ amount of the dividend and the yield   a $ 1/share dividend payout may sound good up front but how much is that stock costing you if the stock cost you $ 100/share then you are getting 1 yield if the stock cost you $ 10/share you are getting 10 yield   there are a lot of factors that come into play when investing in dividend stocks for cash flow keep in mind why are you investing in the first place growth or cash flow arrange your investing around your major investment goals do n't chase big dollar dividend checks do your research and follow a proven investment plan to reach your goals safely

i have a capitalone credit card and every two or three weeks capitalone bank sends me checks that can be used almost anywhere including a deposit into my own checking account if i wish or to pay taxes or utility bills etc the amount thus borrowed is counted as a balance transfer as if i   were paying off another credit card balance and it will be charged 0 interest for a year   the catch is that unless i pay off the next monthly statement in full by the due date i will be charged interest on all new purchases from the day that they post to the account till the day they are paid off no more grace period etc   all this will continue until that loan amount is paid off in full   so i either would have to i pay off all the purchases made this month plus the minimum monthly payment shown on the next monthly statement and give up use of the card till that 0 balance is all repaid or ii pay interest on new purchases    it might be worth checking on the capitalone credit card site if such an offer is available to you   if so get a check from them pay off the invoice using that check actually i would strongly recommend depositing the money in your local bank and writing them your personal check for the amount to be paid and then pay off next month 's bill in full etc

if you sold the stock for a profit you will owe tax on that profit whether it is taxed as short term or long term capital gains depends on how long you held the stock before selling it presumably you 're going to invest this money into mutual funds or something of that sort those may pay dividends which can be reinvested and will grow in value you hope just as the individual stock shares would you hope assuming the advice you 've been given is at all reasonable there 's no need for buyer 's remorse here you 're just changing your investing style to a different point on the risk versus return curve if you have to ask this question i tend to agree that you should do more homework before playing with shares in individual companies unless you 're getting shares at employee discount in which case you should still seriously consider selling them fairly quickly and reinvesting the money in a more structured manner in a very real sense your job is itself an investment in your employer if they ever get into trouble you do n't want that to hit both your income and investments

no we did not apply for the loan so this is why we thought it was a bit strange a company just sending you a real check for $ it does not say anywhere in big red letters that it is a loan probably something in very small letters on a back of a paper   this is really horrible especially if your customers do pay you by check and small business relies on online statement to determine who paid what i can easily imagine a small outfit that just takes all the checks to the bank cash them and then use online statement to update their books    i do not see how it is helpful to businesses to receive pre approved credit that is so poorly marked especially in the age of electronic transfers   i am trying to understand why i feel so offended by this and i guess it all comes down to disgust i refuse to believe that any serious company would use these sort of tactics and instead of us spending more time developing a better product we have to put more time and effort into ensuring we do not fall victim to this

most etfs are index funds meaning you get built in diversification so that any one stock going down wo n't hurt the overall performance much you can also get essentially the same index funds by directly purchasing them from the mutual fund company to buy an etf you need a brokerage account and have to pay a transaction fee buying only $ 1000 at a time the broker transaction fee will eat too much of your money you want to keep such fees way down below 0.1 pay attention to transaction fees and fund expense ratios   or buy an equivalent index fund directly from the mutual fund company this generally costs nothing in transaction fees if you have at least the minimum account value built up if you buy every month or two you are dollar cost averaging no matter what kind of account you are using keep doing that even if the market values are going down especially if the market values are going down   if you can keep doing this then forget about certificates of deposit at current rates you can not build wealth with cds

there are several issues with paying for furniture and appliances with 0 credit instead of paying with cash when you pay with 0 credit you might be tempted to spend more on something than you would have if you paid with cash because it feels like free money and you 've justified in your mind that the extra you earn will help pay for the more expensive item businesses do n't offer 0 credit for free and they do n't lose money on the deal   when you shop at a store that offers 0 credit you are generally overpaying for the item   by shopping at a store that does not offer 0 credit you might be able to get a better price your savings account is likely earning very little interest   you might invest the money you intend for your purchases in a place that gets better returns but in most of these places the returns are not guaranteed and you might not do as well as you think 0 loans typically come with lots of conditions that have very heavy penalties and interest rate hikes for late payments   you can mitigate this risk by setting up automatic payments but things can still go wrong   your bank might change your account number making the automated payment fail   as you mentioned you might also forget to put the proper amount of money in the account   a single mistake can negate all of the tiny gains you are trying to achieve ultimately the decision is yours of course but in my opinion there is very very little to gain with buying something on 0 credit when you could be paying cash

its kind of a dumb question because no one believes that you can earn 8 in the short term in the market but for arguments sake the math is painfully easy   keep in mind i am an engineer not a finance guy so the first payment will earn you one month at 8 the second two   in effect three months at 8 on 997   you can do it that way because the payments are equal 997 .08 3 = earnings 20 so with the second method you pay 997 3 20 =

there are many different kinds of sec filings with different purposes   broadly speaking what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose   the page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings you can get more info one of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10-k which is as wikipedia says a comprehensive summary of a company 's financial performance   this includes info like earnings and executive pay one example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is form 4 which is a disclosure of insider trading   people with a privileged stake in a company executives directors and major shareholders can not legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a form 4   some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if for instance the ceo of google buys a bunch of twitter stock they may have some reason for thinking it will go up so maybe you should buy it too   whether such inferences are accurate and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them i.e. whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up is debatable my personal opinion would be that for an average retail investor sec filings is unlikely to be useful   the reason is that an average retail investor should n't be investing in individual companies at all but rather in mutual funds or etfs which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk   sec filings are made by individual companies so it does n't generally help you to read them unless you 're going to take action related to an individual company   it does n't generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you do n't have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings to decide which company to take action on   if you have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings you 're probably not an average retail investor   if you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues you might benefit from reading sec filings   however if you are n't already reading sec filings you 're probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues that said if you 're a currently average investor with big dreams it could be to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them   you could for instance allocate a play money fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like   if you make some money great if not oh well   realistically though there are so many people who make a living reading sec filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a diamond in the rough unless you also make a living by doing it every day it 's sort of like asking should i read boating monthly to improve my sailing skills   if you 're asking because you want to rent a cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then sure it ca n't hurt   if you 're asking because you want to enter the america 's cup you can still read boating monthly but it wo n't in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the america 's cup

so how often do investors really lose money the short answer is every day let 's first examine your assumptions if the price of the share gets lower the investor can just wait until    it gets higher what are the chances that it wo n't forever or for    years there are many stocks whose price goes down and then down further and then to zero the most apparent example is of course enron the stock went from about $ 90 per share to zero in about 18 months for it to have been sold at $ 90 obviously someone had to buy it almost no matter where they sold it they lost money if they did n't sell it when the stock was worthless they lost money there are more modern examples of companies that are declining in a rapidly changing market for example sears holdings is getting beat down by amazon and many other on line retailers i suspect that if you buy it today and wait for it to go higher you will be disappointed the more common way to lose money is to either not have a plan or not stick to the plan disciplined investors typically plan to buy quality stocks at a fair price and hold them long enough for increasing sales and profits to bring the stock price up if later he hears a bit of bad news about his stock and decides to sell out of panic or fear and become a trader instead of keeping to the plan to remain a disciplined investor he is likely to lose money he will lose because no one can predict accurately that a stock is going down and will never recover nor can he predict accurately when a stock is going up and will never falter the chance of bankruptcy especially for huge companies like apple is    really low as i see it but i may be wrong thousands of people lost billions of dollars thinking that about enron too i too believe apple is a fine stock with excellent prospects but technology changes and markets change twenty or thirty years from now it may be a different case

the current stock price you 're referring to is actually the price of the last trade   it is a historical price but during market hours that 's usually mere seconds ago for very liquid stocks whereas the bid and ask are the best potential prices that buyers and sellers are willing to transact at the bid for the buying side and the ask for the selling side   but think of the bid and ask prices you see as tip of the iceberg prices   that is the bid is an indication that there are potential buyers bidding $ for up to 200 shares   their bids are the highest currently bid and there are others in line behind with lower bid prices   so the bid you 're seeing is actually the best bid price at that moment   if you entered a market order to sell more than 200 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a lower price the ask is an indication that there are potential sellers asking $ for up to 1000 shares   their ask prices are the lowest currently asked and there are others in line behind with higher ask prices   so the ask you 're seeing is the best asking price at that moment   if you entered a market order to buy more than 1000 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a higher price a transaction takes place when either a potential buyer is willing to pay the asking price or a potential seller is willing to accept the bid price or else they meet in the middle if both buyers and sellers change their orders note there are primarily two kinds of stock exchanges   the one i just described is a typical order driven matched bargain market and perhaps the kind you 're referring to the other kind is a quote driven over the counter market where there is a market maker as johnfx already mentioned   in those cases the spread between the bid ask goes to the market maker as compensation for making a market in a stock   for a liquid stock that is easy for the market maker to turn around and buy sell to somebody else the spread is small narrow   for illiquid stocks that are harder to deal in the spread is larger wide to compensate the market maker having to potentially carry the stock in inventory for some period of time during which there 's a risk to him if it moves in the wrong direction     finally if you wanted to buy 1000 shares you could enter a market order in which case as described above you 'll pay $   if you wanted to buy your shares at no more than $ instead i.e. the so called current price then you would enter a limit order for 1000 shares at $   and more to the point your order would become the new highest bid price until somebody else accepts your bid for their shares   of course there 's no guarantee that with a limit order that you will get filled your order could expire at the end of the day if nobody accepts your bid

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

gt the bpp 's inflation measure is markedly different from the government 's the economists average all the prices online meaning the basket of goods is whatever you can buy on the web some items like books are most often bought online others like cats are not plus the researchers do not weight certain items prices even if they tend to make up a larger proportion of household spending   see that last line is where the problem with this alternate independent system lies   it may not adjust the prices in the same manner as the cpi but it operates on an equally flawed assumption which at it 's fundamental root is still the same as the hedonic adjustment   the fact that dvd 's may have dropped from $ 20 to $ 5 each or that last years nearly obsolete model of a laptop computer tablet or cell phone has likewise dropped from $ 500 to $ 250 and in that sense just like the cpi excluding things like gas amp from the core inflation rate the bpp similarly creates a false picture of inflation as being just a crude aggregated average of price changes   the problem that the cpi or other indices include weighting and adjustments it is that the weighting and adjustments are biased and they have been altered many times over the past decades and the methodology being used is one that is biased to create a lower inflation rate one that a reduction in lifestyle quality of goods as being an acceptable change rather than a sign amp signal of the actual problem   thus far the bpp has tracked the cpi closely   yes it has extremely closely   so closely in fact that it belief

where are you operating your business and how is it structured dba llc how do you plan on taxing the business    you can purchase whatever hardware you want and resale at whatever price you want you may be able to contact a vendor and open a dealer account this means they 'll will give you a price break if you purchase x amount of volume but this may require more upfront capital    warranty will probably be best to be done under your name most manufacture warranties require proof of purchase from an approved vendor if you 're buying and reselling at a higher cost then the original receipt will show your profits likewise you can sale the hardware at cost and make all your money on labor this would allow you to pass the warranty responsibility to the customer depending on the customer ’s site you may have to mount your routers and access points in hard to reach places   the customer might prefer to call you and have you take care of it from there    the way i would do it structure the installations by square footage and predicted users the greater the square footage the more hardware you ’ll need    offer a remote support plan at a reasonable rate for you will provide tear 1 support which can include troubleshooting dead access points remotely changing network names and providing up to x amount of network reports offers network monitoring for free in their suite you would just be interpreting this information for issues that require you to come to site you can charge x amount of dollars per visit plus parts and labor i would offer on the spot replacement for hardware under warranty for a very small fee and then you can ship off the defective hardware and have it replaced    if you do purchase with amazon i know they offer extended plans on a lot of their electronics it would be worth considering these plans and adding the cost to the hardware you ’re reselling most of these plans simply write you a check for defective hardware after you ship them in    i would highly suggest going with a business structure that protects your personal assets such as an llc i recommend this because you will be proving a service to other people and you may be blamed for damages if you are found to be at fault they company takes the hit not you    edit also you can take advantage of amazon 's two day shipping when a customer contracts you for a job simply ask for 50 deposit and a 4 day notice when you receive the deposit place the order on amazon for the hardware this will mean less money out of your pocket

in this type of strategy profit is made when the shares go down as your main position is the short trade of the common stock the convertible instruments will tend to move in about the same direction as the underlying what it can be converted to but less violently as they are traded less lower volatility and lower volume in the market on both sides however they are not being used to make a profit so much as to hedge against the stock going up since both the bonds and the preference shares are higher on the list to be repaid if the company declares bankruptcy and the bonds pay out a fixed amount of interest as well both also help protect against problems that may occur with a long position in the common stock   essentially the plan with this strategy is to earn fixed income on the bonds whilst the stock price drops and then to sell both the bonds and buy the stock back on the market to cover the short position if the prediction that the stock will fall is wrong then you are still earning fixed income on the debt and are able to convert it into stock at the higher price to cover the short sale eliminating or reducing the loss made on the short sale effectively the profit here is made on the spread between the price of the bond accounting for the conversion price and the price of the stock and that fixed income is less volatile except usually in the junk market than stock

i 'll add this to what the other answers said if you are a renter now and the real estate you want to buy is a house to live in then it may be worth it in a currency devaluation rent may increase faster than your income   if you pay cash for the home you also have the added benefit of considerably reducing your monthly housing costs this makes you more resilient to whatever the future may throw at you a lower paying job for instance or high inflation that eats away at the value of your income   if you get a mortgage then make sure to get a fixed interest rate in this case it protects you somewhat from high inflation because your mortgage payment stays the same while what you would have had to pay in rent keeps going up an up in both cases there is also taxes and insurance of course and those would go up with inflation   finally do make sure to purchase sensibly a good rule of thumb on how much you can afford to pay for a home is 2.5x your annual income i do realize that there are some areas where it 's common for people to buy homes at a far greater multiple but that does n't mean it 's a sensible thing to do   also i 'll second what said if you 're really worried about the euro collapsing it might give you some peace of mind to move some money into uk gilts or us treasuries just keep in mind that currencies do move against each other so you 'd see the euro value of those investments fluctuate all the time

hart 's answer regarding the difference between an index and a stock aside remember that dividend yield is a passive measure   it takes the announced dividend which is a $ amount and divides it by the current market price    so you ca n't assume that if you buy a stock that had a dividend yield of 4 for $ 100 that you 're guaranteed 4 of the stock price in dividends   if the price of the stock doubles you 'd still get $ 4 but the yield would drop to 2   or the company could reduce or even suspend its dividends which would reduce the yield if the stock price stayed flat for an index like the s&p it 's easier to measure dividends on yield terms rather then $ terms since you 'd have to own shares in every single company to get that amount but on average the stocks in the s&p 500 pay x% in dividends which are typically quarterly some pay more than that some less and some none at all

plus you already have money in a 529 plan that is meant for college expenses and can not be used to pay student loans use that money for what it 's for i disagree with as a current college student i would say to take out loans most of the time i am against loans though   so why there are very few times you will receive loans at 0 interest for 4 + years you have money saved currently but you do not know what the future entails if you expend all of your money on tuition and your car breaks down what do you do you can not used student loans to pay for your broken car student loans as long as they are subsidized serve as a wonderful risk buffer you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit with an additional caveat being to get a credit card in general debt loans credit cards are non beneficial but you have to establish debt to allow others to know that you can repay establishing this credit rating earlier than later is critical to cheaper interest rates on say a mortgage   you have made it through you have watched your expenses and you can pay your debt finish it if you do it right you will not have loans when you graduate you will have a stunning credit rating and you will have enjoyed college to its fullest potential remember you only really go through it once but this is contingent on   good luck   edit i did not realize the implication of this penalty which made me edit the line above to include to the extent you can per year for now student loan repayment is n't considered a qualified educational expense this means that if you withdraw from a 529 to pay your debts you may be subject to income taxes and penalties source furthermore   currently taxpayers who use 529 plan money for anything other than qualified education expenses are subject to a 10 federal tax penalty source my advice with this new knowledge save your 529 if you plan on continuing higher education at a more prestigious school if you do not use it later in your undergraduate years

tax rates do make a difference between whether to invest here or in ireland the rate of return would be lower in a place where you pay higher taxes as taxes are a cost the investment is going to happen sure it just depends on where that occurs    and then secondly the money that american businesses profit overseas stays overseas instead of being repatriated because the taxes are too high to justify paying them before reinvesting the money in the economy this is a problem because it means jobs for everyday americans going to another country where due to the other country is already more attractive in terms of labor costs due to our high price levels here in the us

correct long short strategies should have zero beta with the stock market but this is intentional and investors in true hedged funds seek this portable alpha as a complement to their long only sleeve in the portfolio   my question is if for example you are long low p e stocks and a short high p e stocks what creates the alpha your portfolio should have zero beta i believe in the long run this long short p e strategy generates basis points of return per year un pages faculty   is not reasonable to assume if returns from long only investing is driven by beta and investors use 6 to 12 discount rates in their valuation models then an an un levered long short strategy should always under perform a long only strategy in the long run the purpose of long short strategies is not to beat long only investing it is to create portable wiki   in fact at a high level of abstraction the average long short strategy should not earn a return greater than the risk free rate in the long run because the strategy has zero beta

first you mentioned your brother in law has $ 100,000 in stock options fully vested do you mean his exercise cost would be $ 100,000 i.e. what he 'd need to pay to buy the shares if so then what might be the estimated value of the shares acquired options having vested does n't necessarily mean they possess value merely that they may be exercised or did you mean the estimated intrinsic value of those options estimated value less exercise cost is $ 100,000 speaking from my own experience i 'd like to address just the first part of your question have you treated this as you would a serious investment in any other company that is have you or your brother in law reviewed the company 's financial statements for the last few years other than hearing from people with a vested interest quite literally to pump up the stock with talk around the office how do you know the company is btw as an option holder only your brother in law 's rights to financial information may be limited will the company share these details anyway or if he exercised at least one option to become a bona fide shareholder i believe he 'd have rights to request the financial statements but company bylaws vary and different jurisdictions say different things about what can be restricted beyond the financial statements here are some more things to consider the worst case risk you 'd need to accept is zero liquidity and complete loss if there 's no eventual buy out or ipo the shares may effectively be worthless even if there is a private market willing buyers may quickly dry up if company fortunes decline contrast this to public stock markets where there 's usually an opportunity to witness deterioration exit at a loss and preserve some capital of course with great risk may come great reward do your own due diligence and convince yourself through a rigorous analysis not hopes dreams that the investment might be worth the risk

it depends on the size of the payroll not on the number of employees   probably you need to file form 941 quarterly under this scenario   you may or may not need to deposit taxes more frequently   if you must deposit then you need to do it electronically i this from the instructions for form 941 if your total taxes line 10 are less than $ 2,500 for    the current quarter or the preceding quarter and you    did not incur a $ 100,000 next day deposit obligation    during the current quarter you do not have to make a deposit to avoid a penalty you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely if you are not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $ 2,500 and your liability for the preceding quarter was not less than $ 2,500 make deposits using the or monthly rules so you wo n't be subject to failure to deposit penalties if your total taxes line 10 are $ 2,500 or more for the    current quarter and the preceding quarter   you must    make deposits according to your deposit schedule see    section 11 of pub 15 circular e for information and rules    about federal tax deposits i would say that probably for two employees you need to deposit by the 15th of each month for the prior month but you really need to check the limits above and the deposit schedule in pub 15 as referenced above based on your actual payroll size note that if you have a requirement to deposit that must be done either through or by wire transfer   the former is free but requires registration in advance of your first payment they mail you a pin that you need to log in and it requires that you get your payment in by the night before   the latter does not incur a charge from the irs but your bank will likely charge you a fee   you can do the wire transfer on the due date however so it 's handy if do n't get into in time this is all for federal   you may also need to deposit for your state and then you 'll need to check the state 's rules

after collecting information via web searching the comments above and a additional call to boa i have concluded the following to the best of my knowledge zelle transfers are final irreversible as jay mentioned above funds are subtracted from the sending account before the transfer is made therefore it eliminates sending funds that do not exist i validated this information with boa and the boa representative said that once a zelle transfer is initiated and the receiving party has received the funds it can no longer be canceled funds received by the receiving party is credited immediately i will note that the boa representative was a boa representative and not a zelle representative i say this because the representatives seemed to be slightly weary in answering my questions about zelle as if he was looking up the information as we spoke if someone is reading this and plans to transfer huge amount of cash from a highly likely malicious user i would recommend contacting zelle or your personal bank directly to further validate this information zelle from what i can find is a fairly new technology i could not find a zelle contact number via the web for questioning so i can only rely on the knowledge on my boa representative

my understanding i am not a lawyer or tax expert is that you are not allowed to work for free but you can pay yourself minimum wage for the hours worked there are probably national insurance implications as well but i do n't know the main thing is though that if hmrc think that you 've set up this system as a tax avoidance scheme then they 're allowed to tax you as though all the income had been yours in the first place if you are considering such a setup i would strongly advise you to hire a qualified small business accountant who will be familiar with the rules and will be able to advise you on what is and is not possible sensible falling outside the rules even inadvertently leaves you liable to a lot of hassle and potentially fines etc

a fair number of micro finance organisations have been listing recently and appear to be offering good yields   so you could simply buy their stock rather than investing directly is an indian micro financier that went public just a few weeks ago the interest rates charged can be extremely high to match the low yield per lender   as has been mentioned kiva does n't return interest to the lender   however kiva does n't lend directly either   they on lend to local who will lend at whatever interest rate the local market will bear the range of interest rates applied to micro credit loans can be   45 to 85 in africa 30 in india and a jaw dropping 155 in mexico however these high rates of return have attracted an absolute of investors in mexico more than 300 micro credit banks compete for business chuck the founder of transparency is concerned that there is an bubble lenders are starting to take out more loans than they can afford and banks are doing little to curb that appetite for debt   sound familiar so you may not want to lend directly but definitely consider looking at listed in places like brazil and india   as usual though study the company carefully

the most obvious example would be a situation where a company is growth constrained but cash flow positive it may have enough cash flow to service $ 10 million of debt but it needs to build a new facility that will cost $ 20 million there is the option to raise debt and equity or just raise equity and move quicker to getting that facility up and running    there are also situations where debt is used to replace equity i.e. dividend or leveraged share redemption

the article best stock fund of the decade focus from the wall street journal in 2009 describe the highest performing mutual fund in the usa between 2000 and 2009 the investor return in the fund what the shareholders actually earned was abysmal why because the fund was so volatile that investors panicked and bailed out locking in losses instead of waiting them out the reality is that almost any strategy will lead to success in investing so long as it is actually followed a strategy keeps you from making emotional or knee jerk decisions btw beware of anyone selling you a strategy by telling you that everyone in the world is a failure except for the few special people who have the privilege of knowing their secrets link removed as it 's gone dead

there some specific circumstances when you would have a long term gain option 1   if you meet all of these conditions then you 've got a long term gain on the stock   the premium on the option gets rolled into the capital gain on the stock and is not taxed separately   from the irs if a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss the gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock option 2 if you did n't hold the underlying and the exercise of the call that you wrote resulted in a short position you might also be able to get to a long term gain by buying the underlying while keeping your short position open and then crossing them to close both positions after one year in other words do n't buy to cover just buy so that your account shows both a long and a short position in the same security   your broker probably allows this but if not you could buy in a different account than the one with the short position   that would get you to this rule as a general rule you determine whether you have short term or long term capital gain or loss on a short sale by the amount of time you actually hold the property eventually delivered to the lender to close the short sale option 1 is probably reasonably common   option 2 i would guess is uncommon and likely not worthwhile i do not think that the wash sale rules can help string along options from expiration to expiration though   option 1 has some elements of what you wrote in i find that paragraph a bit confusing but the wash sale does not help you out

yeah i 'll take the challenge how trustworthy these are and what are their sources of income these are in fact two separate questions but the answers are related how trustworthy as trustworthy as they 're clear about their own sources of income if you can not find any clue as to why what for and how they 're paying you you probably should walk away what 's too good to be true usually is indeed too good to be true for those of the sites that i know of their sources of income it is usually advertisements and surveys to get paid you have to watch advertisements and/or answer surveys i know of some sites who are legit and pay people not money but gift cards airline miles etc for participating in surveys my own kaiser in california in fact pays small amounts to members who participate in enough surveys so its legit are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income not something you could live off but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to starbucks what do i need to consider tax wise usually the amounts are very low and are not paid in cash while it is income i doubt the irs will chase you if you do n't report the $ 20 amazon gift card you got from there it should strictly speaking be reported probably as hobby income on your tax return most people do n't bother dealing with such small amounts though in some cases like the i mentioned its basically a rebate of the money paid you pay your copays deductibles etc since the surveys are only for members you basically get your money back not additional income this is in fact similar to credit card rebates is there a best practice for handling the income if we 're talking about significant amounts more than $ 20 30 a year then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses and report it as any other business income on your taxes schedule c. is there a good test to determine what is and is n't a scam as i said if it looks too good to be true it most likely is if you 're required to provide your personal financial information without any explanation as to why what it will be used for and why and what for you 're going to be paid i 'd walk away otherwise you can also check internet reviews bbb ratings ftc information and the relevant state agencies and consumer for example whether they 've heard of that particular site and what is the information they have on it a very good sign for a scam is contact information do they have a phone number to call to is it in your own country if its not in your own country definitely go away for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the uk but listed address is in los angeles ca a clear sign of a scam if they do have a phone number try it talk to them call several times and see how many different people you 're going to talk to if its always the same person run and hide do they have an address if not walk away if they do look it up is it a a virtual office or do they have a proper office set up which you can see on the map and in the listings as their office and of course your guts if your guts tell you its a scam it very likely is

the biggest but still temporary ding you 'll see on your credit score from opening a new account is from the low average and low minimum account age   this will have a stronger effect than the hard pull of the credit report which is still a factor but not much of one if you only have 1 2 pulls in the past couple years    having a lower average account age increases your risk to lenders   your average will go up by one month per month and each time you open an account it will suffer a drop proportional to the number of accounts you already had open before   so if you want to have a more solid credit score that stays strong in the face of new accounts in the future it 's better to open a few more accounts now assuming you can ride out the temporary drop in score and are n't planning to go e.g. mortgage shopping in the very near future    having an additional line of credit will also likely cause your credit card utilization total balance total credit limit expressed as a percentage to decrease which would tend to increase your credit score the age factor unless your utilization is already extremely low which it probably is given your monthly account payoffs   there are various credit score out there from places that show you your credit score and you can put in a hypothetical new card account to see the immediate likely impact for your particular situation    you identified other costs such as risk of fraud and fees   you should check your statements once in a while even if you 're not using the card just to make sure no one else is   the bit of additional time required for this is a nonzero cost of having an open credit card account   so is the additional hassle of dealing with having the card stolen etc if you carry it in your wallet and your wallet 's stolen if you have an account with zero activity for some number of years the bank may close it automatically and that can reflect negatively on a credit report as a bank closure of the account the reason is often   check your terms and conditions and/or have some activity every so often to prevent this from happening    some of the otherwise most attractive credit cards have monthly or annual fees which will cost you and you wo n't want to close those because it would then reduce your credit score e.g. by reducing the total available credit and increasing your utilization percentage so the solution is do n't apply for credit cards that have monthly annual fees   there are plenty of good cards without those fees with a credit score that high you can get cards that have some very good benefits and rewards programs as well as some with great introductory offers   though i 'm not familiar with details of amazon 's offer $ 80 cash up front with nothing else seems unlikely to be among your best options   i would think that for at least some of the fee free cards available to you the benefits exceed the costs and you could cash in some of the benefits of your good credit record to get those benefits i.e. this is one of those things you work hard to build good credit for while also building your long term reputation for repayment reliability    also be aware as you shop around for cards that credit card companies pay fairly high referral fees to websites that send customers their way so if you want you can think about who you 're supporting when you click the link that takes you to an application you complete and choose to support a site you think is providing a useful consumer focused service    as factors affecting your credit score in addition to payment history i.e. making regular payments as agreed on the new account will help you equifax lists

in addition to all the points made in other answers in some jurisdictions including the uk where i live the consumer credit laws require the lender to allow the borrower to pay off the loan at any time if the lender charges interest and the borrower pays off the loan early then the lender loses the interest that would have been paid during the rest of the loan period however if the actual interest is baked into the sale price of an item and the loan to pay for it is nominally 0 then the borrower still pays all the interest even if they pay off the loan immediately if you think this game is being played then you can ask for a cash discount or similar wording i once had problems with a car salesman who thought i meant a suitcase full of used £ 20s meaning you want to avoid paying the interest as you are not taking a loan

historically most economists considered a sustained negative interest rate impossible for just the reason you describe an investor could outperform a bond with a negative interest rate by simply hoarding cash for background see wikipedia by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis however demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible first of all note that the zero lower bound on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative it 's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate rather than the real interest rate that is on the rate before adjusting for inflation in most situations the real interest rate is more economically meaningful as it 's the real interest rate that measures the market 's preference for stuff now as opposed to stuff later there 's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market as i stated earlier what creates the zero lower bound is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds even though that lower bound applies it 's not strict hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it consequently investors who strongly prefer stuff later to stuff now are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs if it were significantly negative however you 're right that no sane investor would buy such a bond

from investopedia a stock split is usually done by companies that have seen their share    price increase to levels that are either too high or are beyond the    price levels of similar companies in their sector the primary motive    is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though    the underlying value of the company has not changed from wikipedia it is often claimed that stock splits in and of themselves lead to    higher stock prices research however does not bear this out what    is true is that stock splits are usually initiated after a large run    up in share price stock splits do increase the liquidity of a stock    there are more buyers and sellers for 10 shares at $ 10 than 1 share at    $ 100 some companies have the opposite strategy by refusing to split    the stock and keeping the price high they reduce trading volume    berkshire hathaway is a notable example of this something more to on why warren buffett is against stock splits

some lenders will work with you if you contact them early and openly discuss your situation   they are not required to do so   the larger and more corporate the lender the less likely you 'll find one that will work with you my experience is that your success in working out repayment plan for missed payments depends on the duration of your reduced income   if this is a period of unemployment and you will be able to pay again in a number of months you may be able to work out a plan on some debts if you 're permanently unable to pay in full or the duration is too long you may have to file bankruptcy to save your domicile and transportation   the ethics of this go beyond this forum as do the specifics of when it is advisable to file bankruptcy research your area find debt counselling   they can really help with specifics   speak with your lenders they may be able to refer you to local non profit services   be sure that you find one of those not one of the predatory lenders posing as credit counselling services   there 's even some that take the money you can afford to pay divide it up over your creditors allowing you to keep accruing late partial payment fees and charge you a fee on top of it   to me this is fraudulent and should be cause for criminal charges the key is open communication with your lenders with disclosure to the level that they need to know   if you 're disabled long term they need to know that   they do not need to know the specific symptoms or causes or   they need to know whether the social security administration has declared you disabled and are paying you a disability check   if this is the case you probably have a case worker who can find you resources to help negotiate with your creditors

hard to say in general it depends on the actual numbers   first you need to check the suggested retail price of a new car and the price that you can actually get it for the difference between these prices is between non existing and huge depending on the car some dealers will sell you a car that has done 50 miles for a huge rebate that means they ca n't sell their cars at full price but do n't want to reduce the price used cars can be quite expensive compared to a new car or not also depending on the brand   estimate that a brand new car should drive 12 years and 200,000 miles without major repairs go for a car with generous warranty or check reviews to make sure you are buying a long lasting car calculate the cost per year since you prefer driving a nicer new car increase the cost for the first four years and reduce the cost for the last four years with that information check what the used car costs and if that is reasonable assuming 12 years life a six your old car should be quite a bit less than 50 of a new one   you can improve your cost a bit if your annual mileage is low you might find a rather new car with huge mileage quite cheap which will still last many years or if your annual mileage is excessively high you can look for a car that is a bit older with low mileage   anyway paying 70 of the price of a new passenger car for a used car that is six years old you say < 7 years so i assume six years seems excessive it would mean the first user effectively paid 30 of the new price to drive the car for six years and you pay 70 to drive another six years estimated you 'd be much much better off buying a new car and selling it for 70 after six years

if all of the relocation expenses are paid by your employer to the moving companies then you should not have any tax liability for those payments relocation expenses should be treated as normal business expenses by your employer note i emphasize should because it 's possible that your employer could consider it income to you but companies generally do not go out of their way to classify normal business expenses as income since it costs both them and you more money in taxes as a side note the reason your company is paying these expenses directly is probably to lessen the likelihood of these expenses being questioned in an audit in comparison to if they cut you a reimbursement check which could get more scrutiny

the pension is indeed the clear winner and you have n't missed anything it 's easiest to just compare everything in current numbers as you 've done and ignore investment opportunities given you expect to pay off your student loan in full you should consider the repayment as a benefit for you too so the balance is between £ 580 after tax and £ in your pension as you say under the current tax regime you 'd probably end up with £ in your pocket from the pension some harder to value considerations you might consider there 's political risk associated with the pension as laws may change over the years but the government has so far not shown any inclination to penalise people who have already saved under one set of assumptions so hopefully it 's reasonably safe i 'm certainly taking that view with my own money paying more towards your student loan or your mortgage is equivalent to investing at that interest rate guaranteed if you do the typical thing of investing your pension in the stock market the investment returns are likely higher but more risky in today 's interest rate environment you 'd struggle to get a safe return that 's anywhere near the mortgage rate so if you 're very risk averse that would tilt the balance against the pension but i doubt it would be enough to change the decision your pension might eventually hit the lifetime allowance of £ 1mn after contributions and investment growth if that 's a possibility you should think carefully about the plan for your contributions if you do go over the penalties are calibrated to cancel out the difference between higher rate and basic rate tax i.e. cancelling out the tax benefits you outlined but not the national insurance benefits but if you do go over the amount of money you 'd have mean that you might also find yourself paying higher rate tax on some of your pension income at which point you could lose out the lifetime allowance is really complicated there 's a about it here if you want to understand more

ianal but no this is not sound legal advice there are a few things that stick out to me as fishy first off you are calculating the 3 safe harbor on the 2017 compensation limit of $ but limiting yourself to $ 53k in total contributions which is the 2016 limit it 's hard to tell what tax year you 're working in here if you 're planning for 2017 fine but if you 're wrapping up 2016 then you need to use 2016 limits secondly and this is something i think your counsel should know already you do n't take employer contributions out of gross wages box 1 on the w-2 they are n't even reported there in the first place with your base scenario the 2 employees w-2s would look like this employee a 's w-2 gross wages box 1 = = employee b 's w-2 gross wages box 1 = 0 = elective deferrals are the only thing that should come out of wages not the sh 3 or match thirdly retirement plan expenses really are n't an above the line expense they are not included in cost of goods sold even if you establish a pool for that expense it 's still not a direct cost attributable to the production of whatever your company sells also employee b should not have to contribute to the retirement account of employee a the only situation i can see where employee a and b would be required to fund the match equally were if employee a b are both 50 owners and the company has no funds of its own with which to fund the match the company has obligated itself to fund the match and if the company does n't have any money then the money still has to come from somewhere ie the owners pony up more funds for the match they promised their employees it just happens that the employees are also the owners even in this situation though i still stand behind my first 3 points

if you set a savings amount now and leave it totally fixed you 're likely to massively or   what is more likely is that you will adjust either your savings or your retirement expectations as things go along   if it turns out you have $ 10 m 2010 dollars at age 50 perhaps you 'll retire early and if you have $ 10k perhaps you 'll buckle down and work much longer or save much more so i think what you are looking for is an assurance that if you budget to save x% of your salary over n years and you get an after inflation after tax return of y% pa you will eventually be able to retire on an income equivalent to of your working income   it 's pretty easy to calculate that through a future value formula    for instance one set of values that works is saving 20 of income 5 real return 30 years = final income of 66 of working income   or save half your income and within 14 years you can retire and keep spending the amount you were previously spending   resist the temptation to crank up the assumed return until you get the value you want i think it would be great hubris to try to make this very precise   yes probably you will get raises of course there are taxes to take into account probably higher while you 're saving inflation and returns will vary from year to year et   you can guess at them   but they 'll change and there are bigger things that are unpredictable your personal life your health the economic future of your career or industry   i reckon this simple formula is about as good as you will get

another thing to consider is how much longer you wish to stay in this home what you will do with it when you move i had planned on doing exactly this but we are more likely to keep our home when we move out and use it as rental property   if we went down this route we would have a lot of equity   perhaps even paid off in our home but would have little left to save towards the next home down payment

1 the majority of credit and loans do not go to publicly traded companies    2 companies can and do trade commodities with paper    3 ca n't keep up with all the crazy you are spouting    smart people lose their shirt in commodities all the time it 's not a fun place to play if you really believe the majority of publicly traded companies are going to lose their value then invest in them when they do money always has to go somewhere insurance pensions governments businesses do n't like to just have cash sit there because nothing happens you can point to apple etc but they 're making acquisitions anyways they need to buy and sell and will always have to do it    my last piece of advice look up the hunt brothers

changes in graduated income tax rates do n't necessarily drive how you should allocate money to a traditional vs roth account true for both ira or 401k what does drive this decision is what your income tax rate is now compared to what you believe your rate will be when you retire so if you expect the tax rate change to still be in effect when you retire it does n't matter if the change is a tax increase or decrease your previous allocation could likely remain the same this means that if congress passed the change effective immediately it would be too late for you to make a meaningful adjustment but if congress passes the change effective next year then most likely your tax rate will decrease for next year meaning you are probably better off switching all roth allocations to traditional and then switching them back to whatever allocations you have now for next year the reverse would be true if you knew about an upcoming tax increase in which case you would load up roth this year and then switch back to whatever you had for next year that being said regarding after the fact considerations i suppose it would be fair to say that if the country is accustomed to a higher tax rate and then rates are dropped if spending is not cut to make up for it then rates would likely have to go up again in the future to make up the difference if you believe that will happen then roths would become a little more attractive since rates would be lower than what you expect them to be when you retire as a side note if you ever had reason to believe that congress was going to move away from the graduated income tax structure all bets are off for example if the income tax was replaced with a tax on spending such as the then in the interim period roths would become worthless and you 'd want to switch to until the change went into effect and then once in effect both roths and would be pointless

no offer is too low you can always offer more but you ca n't offer less once you have made your first offer and there is always another great deal just around the corner the more enthusiastic you are about buying this property the less your negotiating power will be the has already been on the market for a long while so the vendor may be getting desperate to sell so their negotiating power is already lessened know what the market is in the the area and offer at least 10 below the market if it is a weak market then offer at least 20 below market note the list price is usually more than the market price so offer as low as possible and you can always offer more if you think it is still a good price treat it like a game and have some fun do n't stress out if you miss out there will always be a better deal just around the corner

you can only deduct with the 2 agi threshold expenses that you 've actually incurred i.e. you actually paid for equipment or services provided and can show receipts for the payment at the request of the employer i.e. you did n't just decide on your own to buy a new book or take a class your employer told you to with business necessity i.e. it was in order for you to do your job and you were not reimbursed by your employer i.e. you went somewhere and spent your after tax money on something employer explicitly told you to pay for and you did n't get reimbursed for that from your story these conditions do n't hold for you as i said in the comments i strongly suggest you talk to a lawyer your story just does n't make any sense and i suspect your employer is doing something very fishy here

the decision as to what counts as income is up to the bank you 'll need to ask them whether or not rental income can be included in the total i can offer some anecdotal evidence when i applied for a mortgage to buy my home i already had a rental property with a buy to let mortgage on it initially the bank regarded that property as a liability not an asset because it was mortgaged however once i was able to show that there was a good history of receiving enough rent they chose to ignore the property altogether i.e. it was n't regarded as a liability but it was n't regarded as a source of income either more generally as says residential mortgages are computed based on affordability which is more than just a multiple of your salary to answer your specific questions covered above it 's up to the bank if you 're married and you do n't have a written tenancy agreement and you 're not declaring the rent on your tax return then it seems unlikely that this would be regarded as income at all conversely if your partner is earning why not put their name on the mortgage application too buy to let mortgages are treated differently while it used to be the case that they were assessed on rental income only nowadays lenders may ask for proof of the landlord 's income from other sources note that a btl can not be used for a property you intend to live in and a residential mortgage can not be used for a property you intend to let to tenants at least not without the bank 's permission

until the card act credit card rules required that merchants had no minimum purchase requirement to use a card new rules permit a minimum but it must be clearly posted   update stores can now refuse small credit card charges is an excellent article which clarifies the rules it appears that these rules apply to credit not debit cards so to be clear the minimum do not apply to the op as he referenced using a debit card   superiority hm i 'd be a bit embarrassed to charge such small amounts although when cash in my wallet is very low i may have little choice note and disclaimer i am 48 30 years ago when i started using cards there were no pos machines credit card transactions had a big device that got a card imprint and the merchant looked up to see if your card was stolen in a big book they got weekly monthly times have changed and debit cards may be faster especially if with cash you give the cashier $ for a $ transaction but the guy entered $ 5 already this often takes a manager to clear up

good question it seems to me that there is no minimum order size for shares trading on the lse please note i could n't find an definite answer but according to the international order book document see from the lse page 7 question 7 would respondents support a revision of the minimum order     size of 50 units    whilst there was    limited support for a low value based    minimum order size the   majority of    respondents requested its complete    removal   this was   incorporated into    the september 2010 quarterly review as    per service   announcement    and as from 20 september 2010 the    minimum   order size in all    securities has been 1 unit even though not all trading on the lse is performed on this system it would be very if the international stocks can be traded in any size while domestic stocks will have an minimum size further consider looking to the times and sales of various stocks here you can find an example those trades also suggest that there is no minimum order size for example i just saw an executed trade with an size of 13 at last look at the interactive brokers no relationship with exchange list at here you can click on various stock names and in the window that opens look for size parameters and the size increment i could only find stocks with an size increment of 1 i.e. you can trade anything with a minimum of 1 stock and more needs to be in steps of 1 stock even though i could n't find official information on the lse site like a for beginners or such it does seem to me that you can trade any size you want on lse   please note that mutual funds and illiquid otc stocks which do n't have an continuous market can have different rules so double check with your broker

can you afford to replace your home if it suffers major damage in a fire or earthquake   is your home at risk of flooding   in the united states one can purchase insurance for each of these risks but the customer has to ask about each of them   most default american homeowners policies cover fire and wind damage but not earthquake or flooding   i am not sure about hurricane or damage your most cost effective insurance against fire earthquake or flood damage is to prevent or minimize such damage   practical measures can not completely eliminate these risks so homeowners insurance is still a good idea unless you are so rich you can easily afford to replace your home   but you can do things like your most cost effective health insurance is to have clean water wash your hands before handling food eat including enough protein vitamins and minerals exercise regularly and not smoke   your medical insurance can cover some of the inevitable large medical expenses but can not make you healthy

where did all this money come from   investing in a currency whether it 's bitcoin gold usd or another country 's currency is a risky investment because the average trader loses money after transaction fees this is not true of the stock market since successful companies actually produce wealth so in short money made from selling bitcoin comes from the people buying your bitcoins why has bitcoin performed so well over the past year this is an extremely difficult question to answer but i can point out some of the most prominent factors this last point is one of the biggest with all the recent hype more and more people want to try to get in on the action no one can tell when or if the bubble will pop though

like for example i use transferwise to send $ x to my dad 's account in india would it show my name as the depositor that would depend from bank to bank it may or may not show your name would it be considered as income for my dad assuming your parents are indian residents for tax purposes no it would be considered as gift gifts between father and son are tax free in india and there is no limit any special care precaution to take before using such services not really just to be safe keep a copy of the transfer instruction details of debit to you account etc so that if there is enquiry you have all the data handy edit clarifying the comment if you are resident alien in us for tax purposes you would be liable to gift tax not your parents as they are indian residents and would follow indian tax rules as per irs the liability of gift tax is on donor subject to limit of $ 14000 per year per donee so you and your wife can gift your father and mother $ 14000 each i.e. $ each year anything more will be taxable or can be reduced from the overall estate limit
