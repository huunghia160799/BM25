there are always little tricks you can play with your credit card for example the due date of your statement balance is not really set in stone as your bank would like you to believe banks have a tos where they can make you liable to pay interest from the statement generation date which is a good 25 days before your due date on your balance if you do n't pay off your balance by your due date however you can choose to not pay your balance by your due date upto 30 days and they will not report your late payment to credit agencies if they ask you to pay interest you can negotiate yourself out of it as well although not sure if it will work every time if you make it a habit be careful though not all banks report your credit utilization based on your statement balance dcu for example reports your credit utilization based on your end of the month balance this can affect your short term credit score history and mess around with your chances of pulling off these tricks with the bank these little tricks can effectively net you more than 60 days of interest free loans but i am not sure if anyone will condone this as a habit especially on this website

i think this stuff was more valid when grace periods were longer for example back in the 90 's i had an card with a 35 day grace period many business used diner 's club charge cards because they featured a 60 day grace period there are valid uses for this as joetaxpayer stated if you are benefiting from tricks like this you probably have other problems that you probably ought to deal with

well i answered a very similar question credit card payment date where i showed that for a normal cycle the average charge is n't due for 40 days the range is 35 55 so if you want to feel good about the float just charge everything the day after the cycle closes and nothing else the rest of the month why is this so interesting it 's no trick and no secret   by the way this is n't likely to be of any use when you 're buying gas groceries or normal purchases but i suppose if you have a large purchase say a big tv $ 3000 this will buy you extra time to pay it would be of me to not clearly state that anyone who needs to take advantage of this trick is the same person who probably should n't use credit cards at all those who use cards are best served by charging what they can afford to pay at that moment and not base today 's charges on what paychecks will come in by the due date of the credit card bill

but bad with money also means not hoarding money it means putting it back into the real economy buying goods and services they may not necessarily need but that provide livelihoods for others   but i think you 're right   people in america feel poor when they compare themselves to the super rich but in reality we do spend on stuff we do n't need and have far more income per labor unit then in some other countries     if a person shares housing with others buys their clothes from the goodwill and grows their own food in their garden and does n't waste electricity water and spend money on entertainment and stuff they do n't need it really is possible to get by on very little    still this is n't a recipe for peace and prosperity of a society

the simple answer could be that one or more people decided to buy by people i do n't mean individual buyers of 100 shares like you or me but typically large institutional investors like fidelity who might buy millions of shares at a time or if you 're talking about a human person perhaps someone like warren buffett in a thinly traded small cap stock that typically trades a few hundred shares in a day an order for thousands could significantly move the price this is one situation where more or less average people could move a single stock

it depends on how the program is run if the company runs the program out of treasury stock shares that are authorized but not issued then there are n't any shares being purchased on the open market    because of that the share price would n't be affected     if you look in your employer 's annual report you will probably find how the program is run and how many shares are issued annually under that program by comparing that to the daily trading volume of the company 's stock you can gauge whether there 's any likelihood of the share price being affected by the employee purchases that is of course if shares are being purchased on the open market   for example here is books a million 's program as described in their 2011 annual report employee stock purchase plan    the company maintains an employee stock purchase plan under which shares of the company ’s common stock are reserved    for purchase by employees at 85 of the fair market value of the common stock at the lower of the market value for the    company ’s stock as of the beginning of the fiscal year or the end of the fiscal year on may 20 2010 the stockholders of the    company approved an additional 200,000 shares available for issuance under the plan bringing the aggregate number of    shares that may be awarded to 600,000 of the total reserved shares and shares have been    purchased as of january 29 2011 january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 respectively this describes an instance of the employee purchase program being run from stock not open market purchases from it we can tell shares were issued during the past fiscal year   as their average daily volume is shares if the program were run from a single open market purchase it would have potential to move the market   one would think though that a company running it from open market purchases would spread the purchases over a period of time to avoid running up the price on themselves

there are not as many options here as you fear if you have no other investments outside this 401 k it is even easier outside accounts include ira roth ira taxable investments mutual funds etf individual stocks employee stock purchase plans amount make sure you put enough in to get all the company match i assume that in your case the 9 will do so but check your documents the company match will be with pre tax funds   roth vs regular 401 k most people in their lifetime will need a mix of roth and regular retirement accounts you need to determine if it is better for you to pay the tax on your contributions now or later which accounts if you are going to invest in a target date fund you can ignore the rest of the options the target date fund is a mixture of investments that will change over the decades calculate which one fits your expected retirement date and go with it if you want to be able to control the mix then you will need to pick several funds the selection depends on what k investments you have now here is what i considered the best advice   decide roth or regular and just put the money into the most appropriate target date fund with the roth regular split you want then after the money starts flowing into your account research the funds involved the fees for those funds and how you want to invest then move the money into the funds you want do n't waste another day deciding how to invest just get started the best part of a 401 k besides the match is that you can move money between funds without worrying about taxes if you realize that you want to put extra emphasis on the foreign stocks or mid cap just move the funds and redirect future contributions

both types of plans offer a tax benefit   a traditional ira allows you to invest pre tax money into the account and it grows tax free once you withdraw the money it then gets taxed as though it were income based on the amount you withdraw for that calendar year a roth ira has you invest post tax money and also grows tax free however when you make withdraws in retirement that money is then tax free   neither plan is right for everybody if you have a very high income now and plan on being in a smaller tax bracket later when you 'll be making withdraws then the traditional ira is better if you will be in a higher bracket later then the roth ira will serve you more depending on the way you manage your retirement investing you can likely invest in both if you are unsure as to which would be better the same type of investments should be able to be within each type

you can think of the situation as a kind of equilibrium   if the market values stock based on the value of the company then from an individual point of view it makes sense to value stock the same way as an illustration imagine that stock prices were associated with the amount of at the company 's location rather than the assets of the company   in this imaginary stock market it would not benefit you to buy and sell stock according to the company 's value   instead you would profit most from buying and selling according to the weather like everyone else   whether this system or the current one   would be stable in the long term is another matter entirely

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

when you say that you are not sure what amount of money would make a difference in the future it indicates that you have not clearly identified your long term financial goals consider monthly budgeting to be one of the stepping stones to long term financial planning how much you can afford depends not only on your savings and income but also your future expenses if you want to buy a house in 2 years for example you may want to scrimp and save just a little longer to secure a larger down payment if you want to retire early then similarly saving money now should bring you not short term financial wealth but long term security how much you can afford will depend on how your current financial situation matches up with your future goals the rules of thumb you listed ie of income may be good starting places but that does n't mean they are the right answer for you in your current situation

if you can afford the cost and risk of 100 shares of stock then just sell a put option   if you can only afford a few shares you can still use the information the options market is trying to give you see below a standing limit order to buy a stock is essentially a synthetic short put option position 1   so deciding on a stock limit order price is the same as valuing an option on that stock options and standing limit orders are hard to value and the generally accepted math for doing so the black scholes merton framework is also generally accepted to be wrong because of black so rather than calculate a stock buy limit price yourself it 's simpler to just sell a put at the put 's own midpoint price accepting the market 's best estimate options market makers whole job and the purpose of the open market is price discovery so it 's easier to let them fight it out over what price options should really be trading at the result of that fight is valuable information use it sell a atm put option every month until you get exercised after which time you 'll own 100 shares of stock purchased at this will typically give you a much better cost basis several dollars better versus buying the stock at spot and it the valuation math onto the options market   meanwhile you get to keep the cash from the options premiums as well disclaimer markets do make mistakes   you will lose money when the stock drops more than the option market 's own estimate if you ca n't afford 100 shares or for some reason still want to be in the business of creating synthetic options from pure stock limit orders then you could maybe play around with setting your stock purchase bid price to approximately see your statistics book for how to set 1 standard deviation gives you a 30 chance of a fill 2 gives you a 5 chance etc disclaimer the above math probably has mistakes do your own work   it 's somewhat invalid anyway because stock prices do n't follow a normal curve so standard deviations do n't really mean a whole lot   this is where market makers earn their keep or not if you still want to create synthetic options using stock limit orders you might be able to get the options market to do more of the math for you try setting your stock limit order bid equal to something like this where is the strike price of a put option for the equity you 're trading   which option expiration and strike you use for depends on your desired time horizon and desired fill probability   to get probability you can look at the delta for a given option   the relationship between option delta and equity limit order probability of fill is approximately disclaimer there may be math errors here   again do your own work also while this method assumes option markets provide good estimates see above disclaimer about the markets making mistakes

the crude estimate of missing jobs rises to about   you think 75k jobs is a blip   and that is out of a employment elasticity   as people continue to ask for higher minimum wage by law that elasticity will undoubtedly increase   there is no question about it   i mean sure those who keep their jobs are better off no one doubts that but there will surely be more unemployment     edit sorry i took so long to respond had to do some other things and i wanted to make sure i gave the article you sent a good read

other than the exchange risk one more thing to consider is interest rate risk and the returns you are generating from your money if it is lying around in a current account with no interest then it is rational to keep it where you intend to or aus now if your money is working for you earning interest or has been invested in the market then it seems reasonable that you should put it where it earns the maximum for you but that comes with a rider the exchange risk you may have to bear if you are converting between the currencies do the returns earned by your money cancel out the fx rates moving up and down and still leave you with a positive return compared with what you would earn if your money was where you stayed consider the below scenarios do evaluate all your options before you transfer your money

you can make a start to learn how to make better investing decisions by learning and understanding what your current super funds are invested in does the super fund give you choices of where you can invest your funds and how often does it allow you to change your investment choices each year if you are interested in one area of investing over others eg property or shares then you should learn more on this subject as you can also start investing outside of superannuation your funds in superannuation are taxed less but you are unable to touch them for another 30 to 35 years you also need to consider investing outside super to help meet your more medium term goals and grow your wealth outside of super as well if you are interested in shares then i believe you should learn about both fundamental and technical analysis they can help you to make wiser decisions about what to invest in and when to invest   above is a chart of the asx200 over the last 20 years until january 2015 it shows the rate of change roc indicator below the chart this can be used to make medium to long term decisions in the stock market by investing when the roc is above zero and getting out of the market when the roc is below zero regarding your in your investments most would say that yes because you are still young you should be aggressive because you have time on your side so if there is a downturn in your investments then you still have plenty of time for them to recover i have a different view and i will use the stock market as an example refer back to the chart above i would be more aggressive when the roc is above zero and less aggressive when the roc is below zero how can you relate this to your super fund if it does provide you to change your investment choices then i would be invested in more aggressive investments like shares when the roc crosses above zero and then when the roc moves below zero take a less aggressive approach by moving your investments in the super fund to a more balanced or capital guaranteed strategy where less of your funds are invested in shares and more are invested in bonds and cash you can also have a similar approach with property learn about the property cycles remember super funds usually invest in commercial and industrial property rather than houses so you would need to learn about the commercial and industrial property cycles which would be different to the residential property cycle regarding your question about if you can increase your knowledge and skills in investing then yes switching to a smsf will give you more control and possibly better returns however i would avoid switching your funds to a smsf right now two reasons firstly you would want to increase your knowledge as mentioned above and secondly you would want to have at least $ 300,000 in funds before switching to a smsf or else the setup and compliance costs would be too high as a percentage of your funds at the moment $ 70,000 you do have time on your side so whilst you are increasing your funds you can use that time to educate yourself in your areas of interest and remember a smsf is not only an investment vehicle whilst you are building your funds during your working life but it is also an investment vehicle when you are retired and it becomes totally tax free during this phase where any investment returns are tax free and any income you take out is also tax free

gt first of all any boat or yacht is a terrible investment the depreciation is horrendous   can you explain why the depreciation is this way i do n't know much about yachts or boats so i honestly do n't know why would a boat depreciate faster more than any other large asset is it because technology is improving too quickly because wear and tear on boats is particularly great even after minimal use or because of the relative impossibility of keeping the boat maintained at a comparative speed to its depreciation   enough my dad has a boat and the cost of and maintenance is far greater than they joy he gets out of it that said i was unaware of the quick depreciation thing

well first off good luck getting many rational responses to a hypothetical economics question this sensitive lol    so in the interest of a purely academic exercise and expressly not any form of recommendation or road map for application let 's dig in   you would need to clarify a few things in order to assess the economic impact of adding slaves to your society   1 is the supply of slaves limited   2 is the ownership of slaves limited to a small sector of society or available at large to a wide portion of society   3 do your slaves represent a net increase to population or are you some percentage of your population   4 does the nature of work that slaves are capable of compete directly with or effect the employment levels of your population   5 is the level of and relative cost of automation robotics and artificial intelligence in your society advanced to the point where slaves would even be beneficial   6 does your society have the means of enforcement security and technological or otherwise to control a population of slaves over the long term   7 are other countries namely your trading partners also introducing slaves   8) what are the costs of acquiring housing feeding and maintaining slaves they are not zero cost   its not possible to answer the question without those answers but note that the addition of slaves is most likely deflationary in economic terms as you are increasing productive capacity at an assumed lower cost at the same time you are most likely some percentage of conventional paid workers thereby increasing unemployment which if the phillips curve still applies edges us towards lower inflation or deflation

currently when implied volatility is spoken the black scholes merton model is implied   this model has been shown to be deficient thus the variance gamma model should be used however as nearly no one uses it can be assumed that bs is still being implied the bs formula has multiple variables   some are external to the underlying in question   the rest are internal when all but one variable is known or assumed the last variable can be calculated so if one has the price of the underlying and all else except the volatility the volatility can be calculated thus implied if one selects an implied volatility and all variables except the underlying price is known the underlying price can be calculated for the present one uses the current price of the underlying to calculate the implied volatility   for future option prices one assumes an implied volatility at a later date to calculate a possible price for prices not at the money the bs model is extremely   the model can better determine a potential future price

i would say the real story is less about the implications of low vol but rather what has caused it imo that would be   1 lots of money chasing a handful of investments     a loose monetary policy     b wealth effects from fantastic returns since the     c consolidation in various sectors health energy tech   2 rise of low cost index funds all inflow go into the large of the market so volatility across stocks is    3 various externalities of expansionary fed policy     a resulting low bond yields lead to larger flows into equities      b low cost of debt feeding buybacks      c it has been sustained for so long it has had stabilizing effect i.e. predictability is good for markets and business decision making    these factors make for an interesting story because what happens when some component of this system begins to show cracks what happens when this low vol feedback loop ceases nobody knows but it will not continue ad infinitum not all doom and gloom but it wo n't be the market we are used to today

here is a simple way to analyze the situation go to your bank or credit union website and use their loan calculator with their current real interest rates and down payment requirements enter the rate and number of years enter different values for the loan amount to get the monthly payment to the level you want $ 400 today for my credit union the max loan would be about $ 9,500 keep in mind there may be taxes registration fees and down payment on top of this jump ahead two years the loan is paid off the car is owned free and clear you will be able to sell it and get some money in your pocket   if you go for a longer term loan to keep the payments under your goal the issue is that in two years you might be upside down on the loan the car may be worth less than the remaining balance on the loan your equity would be negative

i think there are two questions here a is it better to continue living with your parents while you save up for a bigger down payment on a house or to move out as soon as possible b is it better to pay off a student loan and make a smaller down payment on the house or to keep paying on the student loan and use the cash for a larger down payment on the house regarding a this is mostly a personal priorities question you do n't say if you 're paying your parents anything but even if you are it 's likely a lot less than the cost of your buying your own home it is almost certainly economically better to stay with your parents but do you like living with your parents and do they like having you around or are they pushing you to move out are you fighting with them regularly do you just like the idea of being more independent if you 'd prefer to have your own place how important is it to you is it worth the additional cost these are questions only you can answer regarding b you need to compare the cost of the student loan and the mortgage loan start with the interest rates of each for the mortgage loan if your down payment is below a certain threshold 20 last time i bought a house you have to pay for the lender 's mortgage insurance so add that in if applicable if you are paying points to get a reduced interest rate factor that in too then whichever is more expensive that 's the one that you want to make smaller if one or both are variable rate loans well you say the student loan is fixed than you have to guess what the rates might be in the future

there is a lot misinformation in this thread that i 'd like to clear up in fact you 're more than welcomed to pm me if you wish to see any backup to the statements i 'm about to make    first i 'd like to say that as an uber lyft driver the experience has been nothing short of i normally work in the l.a. and areas of so cal and the amount of interesting super successful and wonderful people i meet on a daily basis is off the charts it 's as if i 'm some sort of talk show host on wheels    initially i applied for lyft as the social and community angle of its service intrigued the hell out of me i 'm an outgoing guy and i 'm also an artist of some type who receives a royalty check only once a month instead of doing and begging for money i thought doing lyft would be a great idea instead so far my customers have been nothing short of an inspiration anyway after passing a background check a driving test with my mentor a driving record check alongside submitting all my documentation license registration insurance and a quick vehicle inspection my car is rather new and in great condition i was hired quickly    that same day i decided to get to work quickly see how the whole system works as soon as i got to the destination i wanted to get to i got my first call on my phone within 5 minutes i use my gps and rush to pick my customer up while obeying all traffic laws of course after a couple of minutes of chit chat i come to find out my first lyft customer ever is an uber recruiter she likes my car and my approach so she hands me a uber black bag with an iphone a car charger and a mount i asked her if this means i have to work exclusively for uber she says nope   my eyes then light up like some medieval lights in the sky chicken little for the ancient aliens approved phenomena when i realize i 'll have access to both customer bases just one week removed from not being able to pay my phone bill    after submitting a background check a driving record check and pretty much all the stuff lyft asked for i was driving for both uber and lyft a week after i was hired for lyft    the good news for you the consumer is that both companies are being cut throat because they want your money there 's never been a better time to hitch a ride on the cheap both companies have thrown millions of dollars over the past couple of months through social media   driver bonuses and other venues so you 're able to get a free ride or a deep discount off a long ride   if you have n't tried both services now 's the time do n't want to risk getting a dui just for driving down a couple of blocks to your favorite bar this weekend you 'll probably be able to get a free ride there if you gently for specials and pay between $ 7 13 for the trip back better than getting your car losing your license and paying $ 10,000 + in penalties and court fees eh you have no idea how many poor i take to and from work who ca n't drive because they just got a and who are now $ 25 35 per ride just to get to where they got ta go      insurance   as for insurance both companies have given me supplemental insurance i have full coverage on my car for when i 'm off the clock which was required at time of hiring btw so here 's how the insurance for lyft and uber works    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability    1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury   1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury   1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination    excessive liability amp um   1 up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive    1 up to $   $ 2500 deductible    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability   1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury 1

collision amp comprehensive   up to $ $ 1000 deductible   other than the deductible as you can see both plans are pretty much the same which in my opinion should be more than enough    services amp expectations   both apps are easy to use and within 5 10 minutes sometimes much sooner there 've been many times where i get a call and the customer is on the sidewalk a few feet from where i was parked waiting for my next call both passengers and drivers adhere to a rating system as of today if either driver or passenger fail to maintain a rating of 4.6 and above they risk being booted from using the app so it 's important that drivers know what the hell they are doing like being courteous respectful professional clean and know how to use a gps while driving accurately and safely and/or knowing their routes and passengers should also be polite respectful very important since drivers are n't also do n't be so drunk that you either pass out or throw up in the back and make sure that if your bring your friends along for the ride that they adhere to the code of conduct expected of passengers i 've run into numerous instances where an otherwise perfect passenger gets dinged for their drunk and/or rude friends     also as a driver for your insurance to work do n't ever end a drive early because you made a wrong turn or were late for a pick up you 're risking an insurance hiccup in the event of an incident and passengers should also make sure that their driver has their app online throughout the entire trip as well as making sure the driver 's pic of him her and his her car match the profile you see on the app    as for safety i 've yet to hear from a passenger they felt they were ever in immediate danger did they get a creepy vibe from one of their drivers sure not everyone is a social butterfly and there has been an of ex cab drivers going over to uber which is good cause the service is getting pro drivers with experience but could prove detrimental since they 're gon na have a hard time competing with lyft on the charisma side of things    however i 've already numerous accounts from young women in hollywood who are now refusing to call for a yellow cab or taxis on hollywood blvd and sunset and the surrounding areas due to unwelcome sexual advances by drivers looking to take advantage of their sometimes solitary and drive home it 's and great to hear whenever you drop one of these young women off at their places and they thank you for being both professional courteous welcoming and above all else trustworthy all while paying a fraction of the cost of what a cab would normally run at that time of night    my personal experience in summary   i 'm literally having the time of my life my other job requires me to interact with humanity pick its brain and then express those experiences to everyone else in an positive and inspirational manner what better way to do it while earning some decent money than driving around for uber and lyft    these services are without a doubt revolutionary and are being used and employed by both young and old men and women struggling students and strategically utilized by incredibly wealthy and successful hollywood types and investment bankers it 's cheap reliable and very fun too it 's also bringing back the long lost art of human interaction and conversation back into our daily lives    so far so good and it breaks my heart whenever i hear misinformation and astroturfing about these services throughout the internet and i 'm supremely as to how certain municipalities are colluding with taxi cab lobbies to prevent uber and lyft and other ride share services from competing fairly at a time where cities are desperate to ease reduce dui 's and make sure their citizens are happy and are left with more money in their

on the one hand the author says this   gt;the seizing of land from individuals by government without just compensation deserves to be called tyranny   then in the next breath says this   owners merely need to pay the communities from which they receive benefits through their exclusive use of land the exact market value of the benefits that they receive   there is no way to pay the communities except through some form of representation government   so what the author is stating is that people who gain value of the land they use must pay the government a fair market value for that use   also known as taxation   but the author takes it one step further all land should be in the hands of the representatives of the community government and everyone must lease said land from the community government     yeah that will work well

gt this seems like correlation and not causation somebody who 'll never overdraw their account wo n't bother getting overdraft protection   i would actually say that makes it a causation rather than merely a correlation   why because people who sign up for overdraft protection are less likely to be careful about their account balances or their spending habits see they have overdraft protection so why worry and therefore more likely to overdraw their accounts and to do so frequently   by contrast people who do not have or reject overdraft protection are more likely to monitor their account balances and control limit their spending in order to maintain a healthy balance   btw i highly doubt this is news to the banks they are almost certainly well aware of the phenomenon which is one reason they promote their overdraft protection

does the 5 year rule apply on the after tax 401k > roth 401k > roth    ira conversion of the 20000 including 10000 earnings that was    originally pre tax no the after tax amounts are not subject to the 5 years rule the earnings are how does this affect roth ira withdrawal ordering rules with respect    to the taxable portion of a single conversion being withdrawn before    the non taxable portion taxable portion first until exhausted to better understand how it works you need to understand the rationale behind the 5-year rule consider you have $ 100 k in your ira traditional and you want to take it out just withdrawing it would trigger a 10 k statutory penalty on top of the taxes due but you can use the backdoor roth ira right so convert the 100 k and then it becomes after tax contribution to roth ira and can be withdrawn with no penalty one form filled ad 10 k saved to block this loophole here comes the 5 years rule you can not withdraw after tax amounts for at least 5 years without penalty if the source was taxable conversion thus in order to avoid the 10 k penalty in the above situation you have a 5-year cooling period which makes the loophole useless for most cases however amounts that are after tax can be withdrawn without penalty already even from the traditional ira so there 's no need in the 5 years cooling period the withdrawal attribution is in this order roth ira rollovers are sourced to the origin e.g. if you converted $ 100 to the roth ira at firm x and then a year later rolled it over to firm y it does n't affect anything and the clock is ticking from the original date of the conversion at firm x. 5-year period applies to each conversion rollover from a qualified retirement plan see here distributions are applied to the conversions in fifo order so in one distribution depending on the amounts you may hit several different incoming conversions the 5 years should be check on each of them and the penalty applied on the amounts attributable to those that do n't have enough time 5-year period for contributions applies starting from the beginning of the first year of the first contribution that established your roth ira plan the penalty applies to the amounts that were included in your gross income when conversion occurred i.e. does n't apply on the amounts converted from after tax sources note the difference from the traditional ira distributions from pre tax sources are prorated between the non deductible basis amounts and the deductible earnings amounts taxable that is why the taxable amounts are first in the ordering of the distributions
# 288968
in the same way that you are taxed on the actual amount of money you convert from the traditional ira to the roth ira rather than on the amount of money that you initially contributed to your 401(k or on the amount of money that you rolled over to your traditional ira that converted amount becomes the contributions to your roth so 3 is the correct answer it does n't matter how you accumulated the money in the first place as long as the irs has had the opportunity to dig their into it it counts as a contribution to your roth

you should talk to a lawyer one solution i can think of is using a trust keep in mind that that may complicate things non trusts are taxed on income not distributed and trust means you effectively keep the of the stock if you do n't mind paying taxes on the dividends and keep the stocks in a living trust that would be imho the simplest solution that would however invoke the gift estate tax at the value of the stock when the ownership actually passes to the intended i.e. you die gift the stock to the child it would be very hard to pay the gift tax now and avoid getting the ssn and opening an account for the child with it

well the first one is based on the formula for continuously compounded present value while the second one is the periodically compounded variant   typically the continuously compounded models represent the ideal as the compounding period of time valued money shrinks towards zero and the discount rate or interest rate if positive stays constant over the time period examined the periodic equation 's results approach that of the continuously compounded equation those two assumptions a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest that allow simplification to the continuous form are usually incorrect in real world finance virtually all financial institutions accrue interest monthly for a variety of reasons including simpler bookkeeping and less money paid or owed in interest they also unless prohibited by contract accrue this interest based on a rate that can change daily or even more based on what financial markets are doing most often the calculation is periodic based on the average daily balance and an agreed rate that if variable is based on the average daily rate over the previous observed period so you should use the first form for fast calculation of a rough value based on estimated variables you should use the second form when you have accurate periodic information on the variables involved stated alternately use the first form to predict the future use the second form in retrospect to the past

you 'd need to talk with an attorney familiar with social security or an appropriately qualified ssa representative to be sure but all signs point to the idea that unfortunately social security does not work the way your father was told it would and if he does n't file to receive benefits the reality is actually much worse than throwing away free money however this is not due to a complete misunderstanding of the system social security does work the way he thinks in some instances just that the rules do n't apply to his exact situation first of all retroactive benefits come in a few forms file and suspend to get a lump only if you really need it before the age of 70 only in this method you apply for retirement but you tell the ssa to suspend delay your benefits you are entitled to full lump sum of the payments you deferred but at a cost of getting lower monthly benefits permanently and that also lowers spousal and dependent children 's benefits too if those could apply to your dad but note that at the age of 70 social security will stop deferring the payments and start paying you the full maximum retirement benefit monthly with no lump sum this is a kind of emergency insurance policy for those who want to try to defer retirement benefits but who want the opportunity to cash out and get the money they would have been getting just in case you can get up to 6 months of retroactive benefits such as if you wait past your exact retirement age to apply for benefits but no more we can not pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past as for after death benefits an estate can only get benefits that were already due to be paid which generally means a person died and did not get their benefits for that month so ssa can re issue a check to the estate following these rules but as a person can not be due a lump sum payment after age 70 for more than 6 months at most the estate will only be able to get at most 1 6 months of payments and 6 months is doubtful you 'll need to ask a lawyer if that much would even be possible if your father was below 70 and wanted to file and suspend the question of lump on death would be more complex and i do n't know that answer but once you are past 70 this does n't matter any more as you are n't due a lump anymore given the above we 've established pretty clearly that if you do n't claim your benefits within 6 months after age 70 any months of payment you would have gotten are just forfeited to the system but if you claim the benefits and stick them in the bank can they be taken well if a lawsuit is really a worry then yes these accumulated funds can required to pay a debt but this potential for loss can be protected against without forfeiting the benefits entirely this is not very common but if your father does n't need the money now he may be able to deposit some of the money into a special partially lawsuit protected format of the roth ira which has no age limits as detailed here if he never gets sued that 's ok it 's still his money if he passes away the value goes to his estate and does not disappear and he does n't forfeit any of his earned retirement benefits finally i would like to share one last thing with you and your father these benefits are n't free he has been paying a portion of his paycheck for decades into social security and now he is eligible for the maximum amount of benefits per month that he will qualify for and if he wants to keep working he loses no benefit and the amount could potentially even go up that 's up to him but not filing for benefits now will mean that all this money he 's been paying in for decades will just be lost they 'll basically just be a tax he 's paid out to other retirees his estate which means you kids wo n't get any of it either that 'd just be a waste for everyone involved if you have continued doubts or questions i would n't hesitate to consult a specialist lawyer or talk with the ssa directly to make sure this is all correct it 's his money and he has earned his benefits for many years i very much hope he gets to enjoy as much of them as he can

i kind of hate piling on with another opinion but this is too long for a comment i did what you are thinking of doing i would at least try renting it for a couple years so long as the primary risks of renting are mostly related to unexpected costs and bad tenants you 've got a very healthy income so as long as you maintain a nice emergency fund it does n't sound like keeping this property as a rental will be too much risk if the rental market is strong where your house is then you have a better chance of avoiding bad tenants i like to keep my rent a little lower than the max i think it could go for to attract more applications and hopefully find someone who will be a good longer term tenant tax free gains so long as you lived in your house 2 of the last 5 years you can sell without paying capital gains tax on your profit so you could try renting it for 2 years and then sell that was a key for me when i converted my first house to a rental i liked that flexibility there 's still the typical renting risks associated but it 's not a lifelong commitment you can get 2 years of increased equity appreciation tax free or you could find you enjoy it and keep it for the long haul

all rules have unintended consequences   the more complex the the more difficult it is to predict the outcome   the choice is fundamentally to constantly change the rules and pile rules on top of rules or simplify the rules and make them more permanent    if what the mp was suggesting was tax code simplification in order to reduce the unintended side effects then i would call this smart   however adding extra rules and making the tax code and more difficult to follow i believe makes the intent of the law harder to follow undermining the purpose of creating the new rules

you seem to have a grasp of the basic principles involved but your estimation of the risk you are taking seems a bit low your non investment reserves are unlikely to cover your expenses for more than a month so the chance that you would need to sell investments to cover additional expenses is high you mention that i am flexible with the cash on hand amount for instance for about three months i put a very tight spending investing freeze on my life because i knew i 'd be leaving jobs and moving i already had the other job lined up those savings presumably went toward moving expenses as your usual savings were insufficient in the event that you are laid off suddenly you might find yourself in the same position again with added unplanned expenses like fees for breaking a lease your current plan involves selling investments to cover the gap based on your age you have probably only invested in a predominantly positive market so the chance that you might need to sell investments for cash seems like a reasonable trade off for the added potential gains your perception might change if the markets go south and you are forced to sell into a down market possibly at a significant loss you also do n't indicate if your investments are currently sufficient to cover an extended period of unemployment you are taking on a lot of risk under your current plan essentially you are trading possible investment gains for flexibility and time by making small changes like saving at least enough to move as you did previously you can give yourself time to react to job loss or other unexpected financial need rather than give the traditional emergency funds advice i suggest you look at the broader picture the total amount of savings risk is up to you but you should consider your current savings as insufficient to rely on as a safety net

50 dollars euros is a very small amount to invest the first time i ever bought stock i picked a winner it went up by about 40 in the first few months i sold it and lost money how i only bought 10 shares at $ 7.50 each the profit was less than the two commissions for buying and selling about $ 17 a piece if you are thinking of buying individual stocks you simply need to save up more money before it will be practical if you are not trying to beat the market which is probably not something an amateur like you or i should attempt then you should consider low cost index funds i have money in mutual funds some of which have as low as a $ 100 minimum investment i have moved entirely away from picking stocks it was a good experience and i could afford to lose the money but as a long term strategy it just was not working for me note this is coming from an american if this somehow does not apply in europe

in this case the market interest rate is the discount rate that sets equal the market price current value of the bond to its present value to find the market interest rate which is also referred to as promised yield ytm you would have solve for the interest rate in the bond price formula a market price of bond is the sum of discounted coupons and the terminal value of the bond most spreadsheet programs and calculators have a rate function that makes possible finding this market interest rate first see this for finding a coupon paying bond price the coupon payments are discounted so is the par value of the bond and sum of such discounts is the market price of the bond the tvm functions in excel and calculators make this possible using the following equation let us take your data 9 $ 100,000 coupon with 5 years remaining to maturity with market interest rate of 10 bonds issued in the us mostly pay two coupons per year thus we are finding the present value of 10 coupons each worth $ 4500 and par value of $ 100,000 the semi annual market interest rate is or 5 the negative sign indicate money going out of hand now solving for rate is only possible using numerical methods and the rate function is programmed using newton method to find one of the roots of the bond price equation this rate will be the periodic rate in this case semi annual rate which you have to multiply by 2 to get the annual rate do remember there is a difference between annual nominal rate and an annualized effective rate to find the market interest rate   if you do n't have excel or a financial calculator then you may opt to use my version of these financial functions in this javascript library

you do n't deduct transaction fees but they are included in your cost basis and proceeds which will affect the amount of gain loss you report so in your example the cost basis for each of the two lots is $ 15 10 $ share price plus $ 5 broker fee   your proceeds for each lot are $ 27.50 $ 30 2 $ 5   your gain on each lot is therefore $ 12.50 and you will report $ 12.50 in and $ 12.50 in ltcg in the year you sold the stock year 3    as to the other fees in general yes they are deductible but there are limits and exceptions so you would need to consult a tax professional to get a correct answer in your specific situation

assuming the data you 're referring to is this line the difference might be related to the different exchanges on which the stock trades   finra could be listing the reported volume from one exchange while the nasdaq data might be listing the volume on all exchanges this is an important distinction because is a canadian company that is listed on the toronto stock exchange and the nyse the q at the end of the line stands for nasdaq according to finra 's for those data my guess is that the finra data is only reporting the volume for the nasdaq exchange and not the total volume for all exchanges toronto nasdaq nyse etc while the data straight from nasdaq oddly enough is reporting the total volume however finra could also face reporting discrepancies since it 's a regulatory body and therefore might not have the most up to date volume data that the various exchanges can access   i do n't know if it 's related or not but looking at the nasdaq historical data it looks like the volume on march 6 the day you 're asking about was much lower than the volume in most of the days immediately before or after it for all i know something might have happened that day concerning that particular stock or the market as a whole i do n't remember anything in particular but you never know

plenty of retired people do stay in the us for longer than 60 days and do n't pay taxes in this irs document 60 days stay appears to be the test for having a substantial presence in the us which is part of the test for determining residency however the following is also written even if you meet the substantial presence test you can be treated as a nonresident alien if you are present in the united states for fewer than 183 days during the current calendar year you maintain a tax home in a foreign country during the year and you have a closer connection to that country than to the united states   in other words if your property in the us is not your main one you pay tax in another country and you stay there less than half the year you should be treated as a non resident i am not a lawyer and this is not advice this irs webpage describes the tax situation of nonresident aliens as i understand it if you are not engaged in any kind of business in the us and have no income from us sources then you do not have to file a tax return you should also look into the subject of double tax agreements if your home country has one and you pay taxes there you probably wo n't need to pay extra tax to the us but again do n't take my word for it

that stranglehold is because of the small margins in the business when you put cabs on the road there are only a few models to work with the lease model where the company puts as many cabs on the road as possible the commission model where they balance fleet size and demand and the medallion model where you have a lot of individual operators    the lease model sounds nice for the customers because there 's excess cabs compared to demand but drivers are n't going to pay $ 160 300 a shift to not make any money so even still the cab company has limit the number of cabs they put on the road   in any case once you add up all your costs for gas maintenance licensing and insurance you 're left with a very small margin sure a cab company could 3x the number of cabs it normally does at night during the bar rush but the other 16 hours of the day they 're sitting on the lot not doing anything because there is n't as high of demand during the day that costs money and if the cabs are n't working they 're not paying for themselves   thus the market finds a balance between what supply there is depending on time of day and how much it costs to support a fleet of that size the only outside effect on the market equilibrium is how many taxis a city will license i really do n't like the medallion model because of this the medallion owners love it because they 're sitting on upwards of $ 500k asset in some cities

j gruber 's consulting reports for the various states minnesota wisconsin etc     and the article it addresses which included some numbers from the reports     note that gruber has made a whole spectrum of claims from initially claiming that premiums would go down for a consulting agreement with the obama administration to later revisions showing significant increases to varying degrees depending on the individuals specific demographic to wit   ’s new reports are in direct contrast obama ’s words and with claims gruber himself made in 2009 then the economics professor said that based on figures provided by the independent congressional budget office health care reform will significantly reduce not increase non group premiums   gt;during his presentation to wisconsin officials in august 2011 gruber revealed that while about 57 percent of those who get their insurance through the individual market will benefit in one way or another from the law ’s an even larger majority of the individual market will end up paying drastically more overall   the application of tax subsidies 59 percent of the individual market will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent gruber reported   gt;the reason for this is that an estimated 40 percent of wisconsin residents who are covered by individual market insurance do n’t meet the affordable care act ’s minimum coverage requirements under the affordable care act they will be required to purchase more expensive plans   for his own explanation for the expected health insurance rate hikes gruber told that his reports reflect the high cost of folding state high risk pools into the federal government 's exchange without using the money the state was already spending to subsidize those high risk pools   note emphasis added     note 2 to begin with an average increase of 31 qualifies as significant hell it 's a lot more than merely significant that 's a huge increase and secondly that is an average meaning that while some of the people in that 59 will probably not see such a high increase a fairly large segment and per the provisions of the act versus current premium calculation methods we know these will be young healthy singles and especially males will face increases that are substantially higher than 31 and in fact will probably be in the nature of double or triple previous premiums as would be required in order to meet another provision of the act that highest premiums for older pool members can not be higher than 3x that of the youngest lowest tier premiums and if the company is to balance the books it can only bring down the one end if it makes a compensating increase at the other end   none of that is rocket science and it is entirely predictable the only things that would be odd would be that anyone should expect anything different and that gruber 's initial claims of across the board lower costs were ever accepted in the first place

my revised bottom line advice offer to send a 2nd payment preferably in the form of money order or cashier 's check for the difference you are agreeing to pay i can not imagine any reason why they would object to this there is no fee to cash a check there 's less risk of error and less work involved alternatively offer to send a new check only once the other has been returned do n't issue one more full amount check while the other is still outstanding there is a good reason not to accept partial payment by them which is that accepting a partial payment of a debt comes with a varieties of strings attached depending on the nature of the debt such as with court processes may need to be etc they likely want to avoid such a situation but this does not provide any support for why they ca n't just take a second payment and then cash it all at once as a single full settlement of the debt in a perfect world you could skip all the non sense by simply having your bank put a stop payment on the old check before sending a new one unfortunately this might not work with 100 accuracy but in your case if the partial payment is a significant amount of money to you i 'd go ahead and spend the $ 20 40 to put in the order now as an extra safety on them not doing what they claim if for some incredibly stupid reason you ca n't handle this with a 2nd payment instead of one single full one it turns out banks have lots of surprising and stupid rules like stop payments on a check expiring in 6 months and they may even cash stale checks over a year old no guarantee of a stop being successful etc the real rule is they might cash the check unless you close the account sigh this is one of many reasons i never ever use checks i am not aware of any law that requires a check to be physically returned if requested or proof or destruction provided or anything like that it 's a large part of the reason why we have the ability to stop payment on a check and so void it through the bank without having any physical access to the check but this process is spotty and imperfect and can not be relied upon you can request them to do whatever you like like void it and send it back or destroy it and they can just refuse or say they 'll do it and then just not do it and you have no real useful recourse the main goal should be to avoid losing money if someone accidentally or intentionally cashes both checks so you can ask or demand refuse to pay until they return the check etc and they can respond more or less any way they want as a final piece of future advice consider no longer using checks for purposes like this switch to using something like a cashier 's check or money order offered by your bank which by their very nature takes the money out of your account immediately all ongoing connection to your bank account and is effectively like cash with the added benefit of a paper trail keep the stub and and receipt from the cashier 's check money order in case it is lost or they claim they did n't get the money

a debenture is a security document this means that the bond is secured over assets under english law you can issue bonds which if defaulted upon you can enforce your security against the issuer i.e. the company which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company 's assets    as for a floating charge i 'll first explain what a fixed charge is say you 're a bank a lender and you lend £ 1000 to x. you take security by way of a fixed charge over x 's photocopy machines x is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender 's consent this means that if x can not pay up the loan you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines sell them and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default   a floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate e.g. x 's stock of potatoes x sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you ca n't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons you ca n't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato when an event of default occurs i.e. you do n't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement the floating charge and becomes a fixed charge thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back   random examples but makes sense   source future english solicitor

why would people sell below the current price and not within the range of the bid ask there are many scenarios where this is deliberate but all of them boil down to the fact that the top level 's bid does n't support the quantity you 're trying to sell or is otherwise one scenario as an example you 're day trading both sides but at the end of the day you accumulated a rather substantial long position in a stock   you do n't want to or are n't allowed be exposed overnight however   what do you do you place an order that is highly likely to go through altogether   there 's several ways to achieve that but a very simple one is to look at the minimum bid level for which the bid side is willing to take all of your shares then place a limit order for the total quantity at that price   if your position does n't fit into the top level bid that price will well be lower than the current bid footnotes 1 keyword quote stuffing 2 keyword overnight margin aka margin as opposed to intraday margin this is highly broker dependent exchanges do n't usually distinguish between intraday and overnight margins instead they use the collective term maintenance margin

it depends on which grants qualified for   it depends on which grants you apply for   it depends on how good your application makes you look by the criteria of fund and how good every other candidate 's application makes them look   it depends on how much money the sponsor can afford to give out this year   the way to estimate this is to research what funds you can apply for and run an expectation value based on your best guess of how much they 'll pay and the odds of being selected   the way to get a real answer is to apply do the best you can and see what happens welcome to your first taste of the real world many questions do not have simple answers even as estimates your guidance may be able to give you some advice on what to apply for and how likely you are to get it but in the end you wind up applying for whatever you can applying to a number of schools and making a final decision after all the answers have come back

i use moneystrands formerly called but mostly just to track expenses and look at reports on my spending habits it has some really pretty charts with the ability to drill down into categories and sub categories or graph monthly spending for any custom date range it does a half decent job of auto categorizing the imported bank transactions and you can set up additional rules for common vendors but i still have to do some manual work after each import it does a good job of integrating my credit cards bank accounts and i can even manually add cash transactions it has some basic budgeting capabilities but they 're not very useful for someone who needs to carefully budget thier monthly spending another one i 've heard about is mint.com but it only supports american banks last i heard anyway

if your primary goal is no minimized fees there are 3 general options as i see it   based on the fact that you want some risk interest only investments would not be great consider 2 interest equals only $ 1,500 annually and since the trust can only distribute income that may be limited based on the fact that you seem to have some hesitation on risk and also limited personal time able to govern the trust which is understandable i would say keep your investment mix simple by this i mean creating a specific portfolio may seem desirable but could also become a headache and in my opinion not desirable for a trust executor   you did n't get into the personal situation but i assume you have a family close connection to a young person and are executor of a trust set up on someone 's death that not be the case for you but given that you are asking for advice rather than speaking with those involved i assume it is similar enough for this to be applicable you do n't want to set yourself up to feel emotionally responsible for taking on too much risk impacting the 's life negatively therefore investing in a few limited index funds seems to match what you 're looking for in terms of risk reward and time required one final consideration if you want to maximize annual distributions to the 's consider that you may be best served by seeking high dividend paying stock although again probably do n't do this on a stock by stock basis unless you can commit the time to fully manage it returns in the form of stock increases are good but they will not immediately provide income that the trust can distribute if you also wish to grow the corpus of the trust then stock growth is okay but if you want to maximize immediate distributions you need to focus on returns through income dividends interest rather than returns through value increase

in general the short answer is to use sedar the canadian database that compiles financial statements for canadian companies the financial statements for pacific energy corp can be found here   the long answer is that the data might be missing because in canada each province has their own agency to regulate securities yahoo might not compile information from such a wide array of sources if other countries also have a decentralized system yahoo might not take the time to compile financial information from all these sources there are a myriad of other reasons that could cause this too however   this is why sedar is useful it 's the canadian equivalent of the sec 's edgar database and it maintains a sizeable database of financial statements

first it 's not always the case that etfs have lower expenses than the equivalent mutual funds   for example in the vanguard family of funds the expense ratio for the etf version is the same as it is for the admiral share class in the mutual fund version   with that in mind the main advantages of a mutual fund over an equivalent etf are from a long term investor 's point of view the main disadvantage of mutual funds relative to etfs is the minimum account sizes   especially if the fund has multiple share classes i.e. where better classes get lower expense ratios you might have to have quite a lot of money invested in the fund in order to get the same expense ratio as the etf    there are some other differences that matter to more active investors e.g. intraday trading options etc but for a passive investor the ones above are the major ones   apart from those mutual funds and etfs are pretty similar   personally i prefer mutual funds because i 'm at a point where the fund minimums are n't really an issue and i do n't want to deal with the more aspects of etfs for investors just starting out the lower minimum investment for an etf is a big win as long as you can get commission free trades which is what i 've assumed above

obviously you should not buy stock when the option is to pay down your debt however your question is different should you sell to reduce debt that really depends on your personal situation if you were planning to sell the stock anyway go ahead and reduce your loans check out how the stock is doing and what the perspectives are if the stock looks like it 's going down sell do you have savings unless you do i should advise to sell the stock at any rate if you do have savings are they earning you more in percentage than your loans if they are keep them

thanks for replying i think we are talking at cross purposes though in your original example you were talking terms of a promise to pay at a future time in that example the asset might be destroyed but the promise to pay would still be binding under typical laws of obligations and so a court could enforce the to pay unless perhaps the promise was itself eg by being contingent on the asset the apples being harvested ie not being destroyed so my question was really whether such a contingent promise really amounts to creating new money as is suggested by the original example i do n't see a promise of this nature can be akin to creating money it is a new bargain entered into by two or more parties

i wonder if these two concepts are compatible or mutually exclusive   the minimum wage should provide a decent living standard above the poverty line we should have as close to zero unemployment as possible   if those two statements are not compatible with each other then i do n't see how prohibiting eligible members of the workforce from an opportunity is at all desirable   yes this would mean that some individuals would be earning less money than it would take to make a decent living but those individuals know who they are we do n't   which means that they have the ability to make choices concerning their lives that we should n't try to anticipate   if minimum wage is not a decent wage for what they need they need to adjust their situation to change that   minimum wage was never intended to be a livable wage only the lowest amount you could pay someone   i would argue that if someone has been stuck earning minimum wage for more than 2 years they 're doing something wrong   either they 're not trying to advance or they 're not looking for a better job

the real estate industry today is highly exploitative you 're right but there are currently nothing stopping rents from rising the major controls in place are are primarily supply constraints which would lower prices if removed by allowing small entrepreneurial developers and builders to create new housing more easily there 's also nothing to stop institutional investors from buying up all the housing right now but those investors are generally not looking for high growth they 're looking for stable returns apartment buildings are viewed as similar to blue chip stock portfolios in that regard low growth but also low risk   the reason capitalism would n't lead to monopoly is that it takes work both to gain resources and to retain them and the most reliable way to retain them is to reinvest them in the economy investment permits new businesses to grow and new industries to form it 's precisely because the economy is n't limited to a fixed size that wealth of one group does n't require to poverty of others new value creation is the core of the theory and nearly every living person has at least some capital their body and mind to begin employing toward value creation   i recommend reading henry 's economics in one lesson if you 'd like to understand the theory behind why and how free market capitalism is supposed to work

it is highly unlikely that this would be approved by a mortgage underwriter    when the bank gives a loan with a security interest in a property a lien they are protected if the borrower does not repay the loan the property can be foreclosed on and sold and the lender is made whole for the amount of the loan that was not repaid    when two parties are listed on the deed then each owns an undivided 50 share in the property   if only one party has pledged the property as surety against the loan then in effect only 50 of the property is   this means that the bank is unable to recoup its loss    for a fictional highly simplified concrete example suppose that the house is worth $ 100,000 and adam and are listed on the deed but adam is the borrower for a $ 100,000 mortgage   adam owes $ 100,000 and has an asset worth $ 50,000 which he has pledged as security for the loan while owes nothing and has an asset worth $ 50,000 which is entirely   if adam does not pay the mortgage the bank would only be able to foreclose on his $ 50,000 half of the property leaving them exposed to great risk    there are other legal and financial reasons but overall i think you 'll find it very difficult to locate a lender who is willing to take that kind of risk   it 's very complicated and there is absolutely no up side    also speaking from experience from which i was protected because of the bank 's underwriting rules and echoing the advice offered by others on this site do n't bother trying   commingling assets without a contract either implicit by marriage or explicit by well a contract is going to get you in trouble

i feel that op 's question is fundamentally wrong and an understanding of why is important the stock market as a whole in the usa has an average annualized return of 11 that means that a monkey throwing darts at a board can usually turn 100 k into over three million in thirty five years the analog i 'm drawing is a 30-year old with 100 k randomly picking stocks will be a multi millionaire at 65 so to be good at investing in the stock market you need to be better than a monkey most people are n't why what mistakes do people make and how do you avoid them a very common mistake is to buy high sell low this happened before and after the 08 's recession people rushed into the market beforehand as it was reaching its peak sold when the market bottomed out then ignored the market in years it was getting returns a bogle approach for this is to simply consistently put a   part of your income into the market whether it is raining or shining paying high fees going back to the monkey example if the monkey charges you a 2 management fees which is low by canadian standards the monkey will cost you one million dollars over the course of the thirty five years if the monkey does a pretty good job it is a worthy expenditure but most humans including professional stock pickers are worst than a monkey at picking stocks another mistake is adjusting your plan many people when the market was giving bull returns before the 08 's crash happily had a large segment of their wealth in stocks they thought they were risk tolerant crash happened they moved towards bonds then bonds returns were comically low while stocks soared had they had a plan almost any consistent plan they 'd have done better another genre of issues is just doing stupid things do n't buy that penny stock do n't trade like crazy do n't pay 5 $ commission on a 200 $ stock order do n't fail to file your taxes   another mistake and this burdens a lot of people is that your long term investments are for long term investing what a novel idea you 're 401 k does n't exist for you to get a loan for a home many people do liquidate their long term savings do n't especially since people who do make these loans or say i 'll pay myself back later do n't

no one of the key ideas behind a corporation is that an investor 's liability is limited to the amount he invests i.e. the amount of stock he buys this is the primary reason why small businesses become corporations even though one person owns 100 of the stock then if the business goes broke he wo n't lose his house fund etc he 'll lose everything he had in the business but at least there 's a limit to it in some countries there are other ways to achieve the same results like creating a limited company but that 's another story

well as you can guess economic growth has a positive effect on the economy as a whole and tends to be measured in the change of a countries gdp gross domestic wiki    wiki unemployment is the rate of people unemployed who should be working currently high unemployment is bad as it shows there are people who could be making money who would then spend it thus boosting gdp and inflation and adding to a countries economy   wiki inflation is an increase in the price of goods and is measured by a standardized basket of goods as people spend more and the economy up prices rise you want a low but positive level of inflation target rate in most developed countries is about 2 per year at this level demand for goods is high and people are spending but too much higher and prices will pass the level people are willing to pay for the goods and the economy could and have a downturn   read the wikipedia articles i linked they 'll help a lot feel free to ask any more questions you have

you can learn very little from it company directories are often given share options or shares as a bonus and because of that they are unlikely to buy shares when they sell shares you 'll hear people shouting so and so sold his or her shares they must know something bad about the company   the truth is that you ca n't eat or drink shares if that company director owning shares worth a million dollars wants to buy a new ferrari he will find that ferrari does n't give free cars to people owning lots of shares he actually has to sell the shares to get the money for the car and that 's what he does

i 'm pretty sure that the banks here will only allow a joint account with either all citizens or all foreign resident or tourists you may be able to do something with since they have a us branch in nyc what many people do who are us citizens is open a bank account either at a physical branch or online and then it can be managed all online make sure no monthly balance fees or atm fees etc if you need to transfer money most banks will buy a us check i have done this with or you can go to the atm and pull out a few thousand from the usa account and deposit it right back into the israeli account   my wife and i did this when we first arrived discount bank seemed to have no fees for pulling money out and a good usd ils rate just make sure you do n't have foreign transaction fees high rates on the us account if you need to deposit checks for him you can use the remote deposit feature and just take a picture

it 's a tough question because there is society and individual to consider and the society 's effects on the individual   currently employers do n't have to provide insurance they do it to compete in the employee marketplace employers have an advantage over employees in that regard because they can procure insurance at a lower cost that employees can and they get tax breaks for doing so employers providing health insurance get a more stable relationship with their employees because employees always hold great value in having an employee who provides good benefits   the company i work for provides good benefits but suppose tomorrow they told me hey we 're not providing benefits anymore but we 'll bump your salary to what your benefits are worth plus enough to compensate for the tax break we get so now everything is equal to what it was before but i have to go out and find my own insurance which is a hassle but presumably because of the ppaca i can get a good value and carry this insurance with me wherever i go and never have to mess with changing every time i change jobs   but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up and they 've essentially pocketed the difference or passed it on to their customers now people have less money to buy health insurance and those near the bottom will now have to rely on the government to assist with providing health insurance   this is the way it works now with the minimum wage a recent report found that walmart employees rely on welfare to the tune of $ billion a fuels inequality epidemic taking advantage of our safety net while the company makes $ 15 billion in profit so 18 of walmart 's profits are an indirect subsidy from the us taxpayer which comes to about $ 48 per us citizen or about $ a year for the top 50 of wage earners   even so i think i 'd prefer to get my whole compensation package in one shot all else being equal that last part is important though i would need to get all the breaks my employer gets for providing myself with health insurance

the idea is that the premiums or costs associated with the plan are a business expense you know that already   the distinction here is that employees do n't pay premiums they elect to contribute the company sponsors a plan the employees then choose to accept less salary in order to participate in the employer 's plan   the idea is that you 're foregoing income why is the employee not taxed on this cost   one major reason is that the employee has no say in and often no idea what the gross costs are some find out if they ever receive cobra election paperwork there are more benefits than strict healthcare that are section 125 eligible   the government has a vested interest in keeping the population healthy and when the erisa laws and section 125 were written it was and still is a pretty low friction way to get health insurance out to more people   at this point taking away the tax break from the employees would be a huge government take away from most of the population   try to get a politician to take something away from taxpayers why does n't the deduction exist in kind to people buying individual coverage   ask your legislators   there are thousands of preferential tax treatment where some industry will get some sort of benefit or break   i 'm not sure what leads you to think there needs to be some supremely logical reason for this to exit

this would be my suggestion i would approach the problem thinking about the loss of monthly income you as a couple will be facing due to your wife 's change to a part time job and divide that loss between the two of you this means that if she goes from 2200 to 1100 monthly you 'd be losing 1100 per month   to share this loss you could repay your wife your part of the loss 550 so both of you are 550 euro down however this 550 loss is a bigger burden for your wife than it is for you so this amount could be adjusted to make up for this inequality   to make calculations simple and avoid developing a complicated model you could give the 800 euro above your 3k to your wife for as long as she has to work part time

the answer on the canadian government 's website is pretty clear   most employees can not claim employment expenses you can not deduct the    cost of travel to and from work or other expenses such as most tools    and clothing however that is most likely related to a personal vehicle there is a deduction related to public transportation   you can claim cost of monthly public transit passes or passes of    longer duration such as an annual pass for travel within canada on    public transit for 2016 the second sleeping residence is hard to justify as the individual is choosing to work in this town and this individual is choosing to spent the night there it is not currently a work requirement   as always please consult a certified tax professional in your country for any final on personal and corporate tax laws and filings

you left out the part where i said cities use it as a source of revenue meaning there are two factors at play the city limiting the number of medallions drives up their auction price because there 's high demand and the cab companies trying to extract enough profit from the medallion to be worth it the city decides how many medallions to release just like in nyc they auction off permits for hot dog vendors which are ironically similarly priced imagine for a moment they gave vendor licenses to everyone who wanted to open a stand in central park you would n't even be able to see the park   i would n't really say it 's fair to call it a stranglehold more of wringing the last drop out of because you 're dying of thirst   personally i think the medallion model is bullshit in that sense i 'm all for a regulated free market where supply and demand find an equilibrium within the rules in reality you only find the medallion model in large markets which is n't really representative of the taxi industry as a whole

if your savings account linked to the mortgage account is an 100 offset account then you do n't need to put extra funds into the mortgage account apart from the minimum payments which is done automatically any funds you have in an 100 offset acount reduces the amount of interest you have to pay on the mortgage   so if your mortgage is $ 100,000 and you have $ 10,000 in the offset account then you only pay interest on $ 90,000 within the mortgage also the funds in the offset account are at call any time as it is simply a savings account you can have all your pay go into it and have direct debits set up for all your bills this way you will benefit from maximising the amounts in your offset account and reducing the amount of interest you pay on your mortgage if your current linked savings account is not an 100 offset account ask your bank if you can change it over to one that is if they do n't have offset accounts for that particular mortgage account ask them if they have a different mortgage account with offset accounts if they ca n't help you then shop for a bank or lender that does i am currently with anz and they have a product with 100 offset account and about 0.7 below the standard variable rate and there are plenty more similar products out there

as of now in 2016 is is safe to assume that mortgage rates would should not get back to 10 what would the rates be in future is speculation it depends on quite a few things overall economy demand supply liquidity in market etc chances are less that rates would show a dramatic rise in near future does this mean that one should always buy a house only when mortgage rates are low is it worth the wait if the rates are high right now nope house purchase decision are not solely based on interest rates there are quite a few other aspects to consider the housing industry your need etc although interest rate do form one of the aspect to consider specially affordability of the emi   is refinancing an option on the table if i made a deal at a bad time when rates are high this depends on the terms of current mortgage most would allow refinance there may be charges breaking the current mortgage note refinance does not always mean that you would get a better rate many mortgages these days are on variable interest rates this means that they can go down or go up how can people afford 10 mortgage well if you buy a small cheaper less expensive house you can afford a higher interest rate

it 's going to be quite a challenge to give a definitive answer to any why question about law and especially so for a question about tax law one would need to try to dig up statements made by the legislators and/or their and debating the law as it is tax law is already inconsistent in many ways why are there people who ca n't contribute to a roth ira directly but can contribute to a traditional and then immediately convert it to roth why are maximum limits for 401(k plans and iras separate rather than being one combined retirement savings maximum in the absence of some specific legislative statements saying that it was set up this way for some specific purpose one must assume that it was written with the some goals as all tax law as a compromise between various ideas trying to accomplish some specific purpose feel free to add in some level of inefficiency and it being hard to completely understand the entirely of the tax law which leads to things perhaps not being as tidy as one might hope for but there 's no reason to think that the people the tax advantages for hsa plans had any reason to use 401(k plans as a template or wanted them to accomplish the same goals

just to be clear to start beta is a statistical property   so if your beta is 0.8 over a period of time   stock x moved on average 0.8 for a point move in the index we might hope this property is persistent and it seems to be fairly persistent predictable but it does n't have to be also it is important to note this is not a lag in time   beta is a measure of the average size of a move in the stock at the same time as a move in the index   in your example both the stock and index are measured at end of day   you can say that the stock lags behind the index because it does n't grow as quickly as the market when the market is growing but this is not a lag in time just a lag in magnitude    people do occasionally calculate betas between a stock and lagged in time market prices but this is not the commonly used meaning of beta   this might actually be a more useful measure as then you could bet on the future of the stock given what happened today in the market but these betas tend to be much more unstable than the version and hard to trade on when you calculated beta you choose a time scale in this case daily   so if your calculation is on a day to day basis then you have only tested the relationship on a day to day basis not for instance on a week to week basis   now day to day and week to week betas are often related and are generally reasonably close but they do not have to be   there can be longer term effects only picked up on the longer scale    stock x could day to day with a average beta of 1 to the stock market but could have even a negative beta year to year with the market if the stock is counter cyclical to longer scale trends on the market   so beta can change with the time scale used in the calculation

i 'm pretty sure you already know this so i 'm probably just wasting time you know i ca n't think of a better analogy to the whole global warming debate than this 97 number a misleading statistic that means nothing is used to mislead the public the origin of this number was a survey of over 10,000 earth scientists in climate related fields a few years back first it was a non scientific survey and only 3000 people bothered to respond the two questions were   the first when compared with levels do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen fallen or remained relatively constant few would be expected to dispute this the planet began out of the little ice age in the middle 19th century the industrial revolution that was the period since the last real ice age ended roughly 10,000 years ago 97 of skeptics would answer yes to this   the 2nd do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures so what constitutes significant does changing include both cooling and warming and for both better and worse and which contributions does this include land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation once again many skeptics would answer yes   surprisingly of the 3000 respondents only 82 answered yes to both questions so there is your real consensus well this was n't acceptable of course so they through the 3000 and found 79 that they classified as climate scientists 76 of 79 responded yes to the first question what the heck we have real published scientists who do n't even think the earth has warmed so then 2 of the 3 who answered no to the first question did n't answer the second question i think it is fair to say that if they think there was no warming then they did n't feel that mankind had contributed but for the survey they just reported 75 of 77 97 plus responded yes to the 2nd question so even using their own picking of a subset of 3000 that got the answer they wanted they still cheated and reported the 97 statistic since the honest 95 answer did n't sound good enough to them now that 's the true origin of the statistic and you could probably get 90 of skeptics to agree to the two questions   and none of the questions address the real thing being debated what is the real feedback going to be from co2 warming you ca n't even get a consensus on whether it will be positive or negative

what you 're describing is a non deductible traditional ira   that is what happens when your employer 401 k or your high income from using a traditional ira the normal way    yes non deductible traditional iras are stupid    now let 's be clear on the mechanism behind the difference   there 's an of tax law that the same money ca n't be taxed twice   this is baked so deep into tax law that it often is n't even specified particularly   the irs is not allowed to impose tax on money already taxed i.e. the original contribution on an nd trad ira   so this is not a new kind of ira it is simply a trad ira with an   but then some say so are deductible traditional iras when compared to the roth    the real power of an nd trad ira is that it can be converted to roth at all income levels   this is called the roth backdoor   it combines three factors contribute to an nd trad ira stick it in a money market sweep fund and a week later convert to roth pay taxes on the 17 cents of growth in the sweep fund since the rest was already taxed   the net effect is to work the same as a roth contribution not tax deductible becomes a roth and is not taxed on distribution    if you already have traditional ira money that you contributed that was n't taxed this really screws things up   because you ca n't segment or lifo your ira money the irs considers it one huge bucket and requires you draw in proportion eek suppose you contribute $ 5000 to an ira in a non deductible mode   but you also have a different ira funded with pretax money that now has $ 45,000    as far as irs is concerned you have one $ 50,000 ira and only $ 5000 10 is post tax    you convert $ 5000 to roth and irs says 90 of that money is taxable since it 's the same pool of money   you owe taxes on all of it less the $ 500 fraction that was pre taxed and $ 4500 of already taxed ira remains in the account   the math gets totally out of hand after just a couple of conversions    your best bet is to convert the whole at one time and to avoid a monstrous tax hit do this in a gap year

typically labor is a company 's largest expense so when a company receives tax cuts that does n't translate to more hiring long term if the company expands it might but it could also choose to invest in a better or different products maybe more efficient business processes or invest in overseas operations additionally labor has a diminishing value just because we could hire more people to make more things does n't mean we should    side note in many states the largest employers are the state local governments schools public services etc and healthcare providers   this tax cut is great for people that are already invested or high income earners because it lowers the overall tax brackets and aligns capital gains to those so say i had a million dollars invested and earned a yearly 10 dividend return i 'd earn 100k in dividends and pay 25 as income tax source   however something like 50 of all americans are invested in the stock market only the top 10 average investments close to a million in investments example above and 38 of all investments are owned by the 1 source   tax cuts while popular would n't ever help stimulate consumer spending esp considering the amount of consumer debt that exists ~1 trillion what these tax cuts would do create more debt for tax payers

here is another explanation of an sma   sma refers to the special memorandum account which represents neither equity nor cash but rather a line of credit created when the market value of securities in a reg t margin account increase in value   for example assume the market value of securities purchased at a cost of $ 10,000 on margin at 50 increase in value to $ 12,000   this $ 2,000 increase in market value would create sma of $ 1,000 which provides the account holder the ability to either 1 buy additional securities valued at $ 2,000 assuming a 50 margin rate without depositing up additional funds or 2 withdraw $ 2,000 in cash which may be financed by increasing the debit balance if the account holds no cash    it should be noted that while an increase in market value over original cost creates sma a subsequent decline in market value has no effect on sma   sma will only decline if used to purchase securities or withdraw cash and the only restriction with respect to its use is that the additional purchases or withdrawals do not bring the account below the maintenance margin requirement sma will also increase on a dollar for dollar basis in the event of cash deposits or dividends more details at

so many answers here are missing the mark   i have a $ 100k mortgage because that is n't paid off i ca n't buy a car   that 's really misguided logic you have a reasonably large amount of college debt and did n't mention any other it 's a really big deal what kind of debt this is   is it unsecured debt through a private lender is it a federal loan from the department of education let 's assume the worst possible reasonable situation   you lose your job and spend the next year plus looking for work   this is the boat numerous people out of college are in far far far far more than the unemployment rates indicate   federal loans have somewhat reasonable indentured servitude but i digress repayment strategies you can base the payment on your current income through income based and income continent repayment plans   if you 're through a private lender they still expect payment   in both cases because the us hit students with ridiculous lending practices your interest rates are likely 5 10 or even higher given your take home income is quite large and i do n't know exactly the cost of living where you live you have to make some reasonable decisions   you can afford a car note for basically any car you want   what 's the worst that happens if you ca n't afford the car   they take it back if you can afford to feed yourself house yourself pay your other monthly bills you make so much more than the median income in the us that i really do n't see any issues what you should do is write out all your monthly costs and figure out how much unallocated money you have but i 'd imagine you have enough money coming in to finance any reasonable new or used car   keep in mind new will have much higher insurance and costs but if you pick a good car your headaches besides that will be minimal

the total value of the stock market more or less tracks the total value of the companies listed in the stock market which is more or less the total value of the us economy since very few industries are nationalized or dominated by privately held companies the us economy has consistently grown over time thanks to the wonders of industrialization the discovery of new markets new natural resources etc   thus the stock market has continued to grow as well will it forever   no   the united states will not exist for ever   but there 's no obvious reason it wo n't continue to grow at least for a while though of course if i could accurately predict that i would be far richer than i am why do other countries not have the same result   china is its own ball of wax since it 's a sort of market sort of command economy   japan has major issues economically right now and does n't really have the natural or people resources it also had a huge market bubble a while back that it 's never recovered from and many european countries are doing fine   german 's index was at around 2500 in 2004 and is now at nearly   that 's pretty fast growth if you go back further there was a crash ending in around 2004 you can see around the fall of the berlin wall it was still around 2000 even going that far back that 's about an 8 annual bump   the ftse was also around 2000 back then around 8000 now which is around 5 annual growth    many of these indexes were more seriously hurt than the us markets in the two major crashes of this while the us markets fell a lot in 2008 they did n't fall nearly as much as many smaller markets in 2002 so had less to recover from   both dax and ftse suffered similar falls in 2002 to 2008 and so even though during good periods they 've grown quite quickly they have n't overall done as well as they could have given the crashes

i am actually partial to the idea of negative taxation systems here in australia we have the work for the dole program which is essentially what the author describes but it is inefficient and it would be far more efficient to dramatically reduce the minimum wage and introduce a negative tax rate or rather bracket the tax rate such that it enters negative territory at some point this way employers can afford to employ more staff and people would still be compensated through the tax system and end up reasonably well off so long as the compensation is fair i do n't see how this is not preferable to a tax and transfer system where the government taxes with one hand and gives with the other

no i think you are misunderstanding the math stock splits are a way to control relatively where the price per share can be for a company as companies can split or reverse split shares which would be similar to taking dimes and giving 2 nickels for each dime each is 10 cents but the number of coins has varied this does n't create any additional value since it is still 10 cents whether it is 1 dime or 2 nickels   share repurchase programs though are done to prevent dilution as executives and those with incentive stock options may get shares in the company that increase the number of outstanding shares that would be something to note

it is unlikely that buying 100 shares will have any effect on a stock 's price unless the stock 's average trading volume is incredibly low   that being said no matter how many share you buy there 's no way to know what the impact on the price will be because that 's only one factor in how shares are priced   if anyone could figure out the answer to your question then they 'd be extremely rich because they 'd simply watch for big share trades and then buy those stocks on the way up the market makers who actually execute the trades are the ones who set the prices and most stocks have multiple market makers trading the stock so the bid ask you see is the highest bid and lowest ask   the market makers set the price based on what the trend of the stock is   if for instance there 's a large number of sell orders against a stock the market makers will start dropping the bid prices as they fill execution orders and as they see buy orders increase they 'll raise ask prices as they fill execution orders   the market makers earn the difference between what they paid to buy someone 's stock who was selling and what they get from someone else who buys it this is a simplified explanation so pro traders do n't beat me up grin so basically it takes quite a bit of share volume in one direction or another to affect a stock 's price   i can guarantee a trade would n't even be noticed by market makers i hope this helps good luck

as observed there is no answer that will fit all but below are some considerations your monthly requirement is 5000 so you have 3000 left to pay the monthly instalments emi however if you do pay 3000 you will have no money left for any other activities holidays etc till your emi is finished set off a sum let us say 500 1000 per month you shall have to decide for other expenses the rest of the money in this case 2000 2500 you can pay as monthly emi if you indicate that your monthly emi to the bank they will be able to tell you how much of loan you are eligible for and for how long the emi would last this is your benchmark if this loan amount is 750,000 or more you do not need to put in your own money so the decision then becomes how fast you want to pay off your loan and as accordingly you shall utilize your 500,000 however if the emi will not cover a loan of 750,000 more likely case you have options between the following a. max out on your loan that 2000 2500 emi month in terms of years as well as amount can get you and put the rest from 500,000 b. min your loan in terms of amount and time and put your entire 500,000 c. the middle ground is to balance between the loan and your own money which is the best approach there is no figure here that works for all you have to take the decision based on your circumstances however in general the shorter the loan term in years better it is as in aggregate you pay less money to the bank if you are 1 2 months away from buying the house one exercise you could do is to keep the emi money in a separate bank account and see how you fare with the residual cash this would give you a good reality check hope this helps thanks

mhoran answered the headline question but you asked could someone shed some light on and differentiate between a retirement account and alternative savings plans retirement accounts can contain nearly anything that one would consider an investment yes there are exception not the topic for today so when one says they have an s&p fund or etf and some company issued bonds etc these may or may not be held in a retirement account   in the us when we say retirement account it means a bit more than just an account earmarked for that goal it 's an account 401(k 403(b ira etc that has a special tax status money can go in pre tax and be withdrawn at retirement when you are in a lower tax bracket the roth flavor of 401(k or ira lets you deposit post tax money and never pay tax on it again if withdrawn under specific conditions   in 2013 a single earner pays 25 federal tax on taxable earnings over $ but a retiree with exactly $ 46 k in gross income who then has $ 10 k in standard deduction plus exemption has a tax of $ less than 11 average rate on that withdrawal this is the effect of the deductions 10 and 15 brackets   as with your other question there 's a lot to be said about this topic no one can answer in one post that said the second benefit of the retirement account is the mental i have retirement money not to be touched emergency money used for the broken down car or appliance replacement and other funds it does n't feel bad to tap for spending vacations etc nothing a good spreadsheet ca n't handle but a good way to keep things physically separate as well    i answered as if you are in us but the answer works if you rename the retirement accounts eg canada has similar tax structure to the us

real estate potentially has two components of profit the increase in value and the ongoing returns similar to a stock appreciating and its dividends    it 's possible to buy both badly and in the case of stocks there are studies that show the typical investor lags the market by many percent   real estate is not a homogeneous asset class a $ 200 k house renting for $ 1,000 is a far different investment than a $ 100 k 3 family renting for $ 2,000 total rents both exist depending on the part of the country you are in   if you simply divide the price to the rent you get either or this is an oversimplification and of course interest rates will push these numbers in one direction or another it 's safe to say that at any given time the ratio can help determine if home prices are too high a bargain or somewhere in between   as one article suggests the median price tracks inflation pretty closely and i 'd add that median home prices would track median income long term   to circle back yes real estate can be a good investment if you buy right find good tenants and are willing to put in the time   note buying to rent and buying to live in are not always the same economic decision the home buyer will very often buy a larger house than they should and turn their own profit into a loss e.g. a buyer who would otherwise be advised to buy the $ 150 k house instead of renting is talked into a bigger house by the real estate agent the bank the spouse the extra cost of the $ 225 k house is the 1/3 more cost of repair utilities interest etc it 's identical to needing a 1000 sq ft apartment but grabbing one that 's 1500 sq ft for the view

it is my understanding that banks pay less than the going rate on savings accounts and require that the person who takes out a loan pay more than the going rate that is how the bank gets its money   usually the going rate is affected by the current inflation rate but that has not been true for the last few weeks so that means that typically the money you have in the bank is gradually losing purchasing power as the bank typically pays you less than the inflation rate   so if you want your money to keep pace with inflation or do a bit better then you should buy bonds

in general yes if interest rates go higher then any existing fixed rate bonds and hence etfs holding those bonds become less valuable the further each bond is from maturity the larger the impact as you suggest once the bonds do mature the fund can replace them at a market price so the effect tails off the bond market has a concept known as duration that helps reason about this effect roughly it measures the average time from now to each payout of the bond weighted by the payout the longer the duration the more the price will change for a given change in interest rates the concept is just an approximation and there are various slightly different ways of calculating it but very roughly the price of a bond will reduce by a percentage equal to the duration times the increase in interest rates so a bond with a duration of 5 years will lose 5 of its value for a 1 rise in interest rates and of course vice versa for your second question it really depends on what you 're trying to achieve by diversifying this might be best as a different question that gives more detail as it 's not very related to your first question short term bonds are less risky but both will lose value if the underlying company is in trouble gilts government bonds are less risky than corporate bonds

would n't this be part of your investing strategy to know what price is considered a good price for the stock   if you are going to invest in company abc should n't you have some idea of whether the stock price of $ 30 $ 60 or $ 100 is the bargain price you want   i 'd consider this part of the due diligence if you are picking individual stocks   mutual funds can be a bit different in automatically doing fractional shares and not quite as easy to analyze as a company 's financials in a sense i 'm more concerned with the fact that you do n't seem to have a good idea of what the price is that you are willing to buy the stock so that you take advantage of the volatility of the market etfs would be similar to mutual funds in some ways though i 'd probably consider the question that may be worth considering here is how much do you want to optimize the price you pay versus adding $ x to your position each time   i 'd probably consider estimating a ballpark and then setting the limit price somewhere within that   i would n't necessarily set it to the maximum price you 'd be willing to pay unless you are trying to ride a hot etf using some kind of momentum strategy   the downside of a momentum strategy is that it can take a while to work out the and i do n't use one though i do remember a from msn money that did that kind of trading regularly

automatic can be extremely risky and the closer to the money the options are the riskier their are it is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk   since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option it 's solvency policy is already risky regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible if there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary accounts after exercise for deep in the money exercised options a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying the next decision should be based upon risk and position selection   first if the position is no longer attractive it should be closed   since it 's deep in the money simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt if the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one 's liability policy and of course to margin limits in a margin account closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade   if the positions are closed on any business day after the there will be no penalty or restriction cash option accounts while this is possible many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account and the sharebuilder options account agreement seems ambiguous but their options trading page implies the upgrade in a cash account equities are not marginable so any margin will trigger a margin call   if the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100 equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid so during a call exercise the or 's broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price and any deficit is financed with debt thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would to a forced exercise as a call holder one could short the underlying but this will be more expensive and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud   the least expensive way to trade out of options positions is to close them themselves rather than take delivery

this is a great question precisely because the answer is so complicated it means you 're starting to think in detail about how orders actually get filled executed rather than looking at stock prices as a mythical the market the market price is a somewhat deceptive term the price at which bids and asks last crossed filled is the price that prints i.e. that is what you see on a market price data feed in reality there is a resting queue of orders at various bids asks on various exchanges   source larry harris a size of 1 is = 100 shares so at first your order will sweep through the standing queue of fills let 's say you are trading a low volume stock and let 's say someone from another brokerage has set a limit order at a ridiculous price part of your order may sweep through and part of it get filled at a ridiculously high price or maybe either the exchange or your broker execution mechanism somehow will protect you against the really high fill let 's say your broker hired who guarantees a certain vwap also people change their bids asks in response to what they see others do your size will likely be marked as a human counterparty by certain players other players might see that order differently let 's say it was a 100 size maybe people will decide you must know something and decide they want to go the same direction as you rather than take the opportunity to exit and maybe some super fast players will in and out of the filling process itself there is more to it because what if some of the resting asks are on other venues what if both you and some of the asks match with someone who uses the same broker as you not only do exchange rules come into play but so do national regulations tl;dr you will get filled with price slippage if you send in a big buy order it will sweep through the resting asks but also there are complications

unfortunately it is not possible for an ordinary person to become an accredited investor without a career change gaining any legal certification in investments typically require sponsorship from an investment company which you would be working for there are reasons why these kinds of investments are not available to ordinary people directly and you should definitely consult an ria registered investment adviser before investing in something that is n't extremely standardized traded on an major exchange the issue with these kinds of investments is that they are not particularly standardized in terms of legal structure settlement terms registered investment advisers and other people who manage investments professionally are theoretically given specific training to understand these kinds of non standard investments and are theoretically qualified to analyze the legal documentation of these make well informed investment decisions and make sure that their investors are not falling into any kind of pyramid scheme   there are many many kinds of issues that can arise when investing in startups what of the the company 's profits are you entitled to how long can the company go without paying you a dividend do they have to pay you a dividend at all how liquid will your investment in the company be unfortunately it is common for startups to accept investment but have legal restrictions on their investors ability to sell their stake in the business and other non standard contract clauses for example some investment agreements have a clause which states that you can only sell your stake in the business to a person who already owns a stake in the business this makes your investment essentially worthless the company could run for an exponential amount of time without paying you a dividend if you are not able to sell your stake in the company you will not be able to earn any capital gains either the probability of a startup eventually going public is extremely small so in this scenario it is likely you will end up gaining no return investment though you can be happy to know you helped a company grow   overall the restrictions for these kinds of investments exist to protect ordinary folks from making investing their savings into things that could get them burned if you want to invest in companies on build a relationship with an ria and work with that person to invest your money it is easier less risky and not all that more expensive

great questions the fact that you 're thinking about it is what 's most important i think a priority should be maximizing any employer match in your 401(k because it 's free money second would be paying off high interest debt because it 's a big expense everything else is a matter of setting good financial habits so i think the order of importance will vary from person to person that 's why i ordered the priorities the way i did employer matching is the easiest way to get more income with no additional work and paying down high interest debt is the best way to lower your long term expenses after that continue to maximize your income and savings and be frugal with your expenses avoid debt take a vacation once in a while too

i work at bats chi x europe and wanted to provide some clarity answers to these questions bats chi x europe is a recognised investment exchange so it is indeed a stock exchange   sometimes the term equity market could be used when explaining our business but essentially we are a stock exchange   as some background bats chi x europe was formed by the acquisition of chi x europe by bats trading in november 2011 at the time of the acquisition each company operated as a trading facility for the trading of pan european equities via a single trading platform the category of was introduced by markets in financial instrument directive in 2007 which introduced competition in equities trading and allowed european stocks to be traded on any european platform until 2007 many european stocks had to be traded only their local exchanges due to so called concentration rules following the acquisition bats chi x europe became the largest in europe offering trading in more than 2,000 securities securities by september 2013 across 15 major european markets on a single trading platform   in may 2013 bats chi x europe received recognised investment exchange status from the uk financial conduct authority meaning that bats chi x europe has changed from an status to full exchange status in response to question 1 the equities traded on bats chi x europe are listed on stock exchanges such as the lse but also listed on the other european exchanges the term third party equities is not particularly useful as all stock trading in europe is generally a second hand   business referred to as secondary market trading at the time of listing a firm issues shares trading in these shares after the listing exercise is generally what happens in equity markets and these shares can be bought and sold on stock exchanges across europe secondary market trading describes all trading on all exchanges or that takes place after the listing in response to question 2 bats chi x europe trades over stocks on its own trading platform when trading on bats chi x europe orders are executed on their own platform and will not end up of the lse order books or platform the fact that a stock was first listed on the lse does not mean that all trading in this stock happens via the lse however settlement process ensures that stocks end up being logged in a single depository this means that a stock bought on bats chi x europe can be offset against the same stock sold on the lse   in response to question 3 as noted above bats chi x europe received recognised investment exchange status from the uk financial conduct authority in may 2013 meaning that bats chi x europe has changed from an status to full stock exchange status as an exchange bats chi x europe is authorised to offer primary and secondary listings alongside its existing business   according to the of european securities exchanges bats chi x europe has been the largest equity exchange in europe by value traded in every month so far in 2013 in august of european equities trading in the 15 markets covered were traded on bats chi x europe in july and august the average notional value traded on bats chi x europe was around € 7.2 billion per day hope this information is helpful

rule of law   the rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation as opposed to being governed by decisions of individual government officials it primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society particularly as a constraint upon behaviour including behaviour of government officials the phrase can be traced back to 16th century britain and in the following century the scottish samuel used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings john wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r business about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

yes w4 determines how much your employer will withhold from your wages leaving everything at default would mean that your salary is your only taxable income and you only take default deductions your employee will calculate your tax withholding based on that but if your salary is > 200k i assume that you have other income investment capital gains interest on your bank account which you will have to pay taxes on you 're probably going to have some deductible expenses business partnership expenses mortgage interest donations college funds etc as well so it is very likely unless you 're really not smart about money that you have more to do with your taxes than just the employers withholding

point being the problem has n't been fixed the deficit went from enormous in 2009 to simply large today   it 's never going to be paid back   the main issue to consider is that today the united states is the third largest oil producer in the world and the largest natural gas producer thanks to hydraulic fracturing most of this surge happened during the obama administration spurred on by relatively high energy prices   without the fracking boom the us economy would still be considered in a commentary oil and gas boom gdp   the $ 300-$400 billion yearly increase in output from oil and gas production economy growth would still be negative manhattan institute senior fellow mark mills shows the extent these industries have contributed to u.s. growth in his new report where the jobs are small businesses unleash energy employment boom   the us manufacturing sector also benefits from this indirectly as low energy costs thanks to suddenly abundant natural gas keeps domestic production affordable without the fracking boom the us economy would be in a european type situation in fact european companies move their manufacturing capacity to the us citing low american gas natural gas boom attracting manufacturing us overseas take advantage cheaper   the problem with all of this is that we know that fracking is not sustainable it depends on very high oil prices which consumers simply ca n't afford to continue paying without oil prices rising the industry is forced to enter further and further into debt part of the reason oil prices are so high in the first place right now is because of speculative traders who expect oil prices to rise higher in the future which is unlikely to happen   when obama claimed that there is 100 years worth of natural gas in the us he was wrong if he really believes that story himself it 's going to lead him to take bad decisions by basing an economy on hypothetical cheap energy that wo n't be there in the future the gdp contribution by the fracking industry is going to evaporate at which point you 're left with a massive debt you ca n't pay back

just like pete for me a simple budget is good my budget is probably more complicated than some but for medical expenses i only have one budget item titled medical   however if you 've already been breaking it out further than that and you are happy with it there is no need to change now   something you can do is to separate your budget categories from your money accounts here 's what i mean let 's say that last year at this time before the fsa you had $ 500 total allocated to your various medical budget categories this year you can do the same the only difference is that $ 300 of that just happens to be in your fsa and $ 200 is in whatever account you kept your medical money in last year then when you have your next medical expense you 'll subtract it from one of your medical budget categories which tells you how much you have left to spend on medical expenses and you 'll also subtract it from whichever account you actually spent the money so you know your current account balances you 'll want to spend your fsa money first since it 's use it or lose it if that seems like a lot of work a good budgeting software program such as ynab everydollar or mvelopes will do most of the accounting for you separating your budget category balances from your bank balances they allow you to split up your money without having to worry about which account you are paying from

he did n't sell in the normal way that most people think of when they hear the term sell he engaged in a perfectly legitimate technique known as short selling in which he borrows shares from his broker and sells them immediately he 's betting that the price of the stock will drop so he can buy them back at a lower price to return the borrowed shares back to his broker he gets to pocket the difference he had about $ 37,000 of cash in his account since he borrowed shares and sold them immediately at $ 2/share he got $ 16,800 in cash and owed his broker 8400 shares so his net purchasing power at the time of the short sale was $ 37,000 + $ 16,800 4800 shares $ 2/share as the price of the stock changes his purchasing power will change according to this equation he 's allowed to continue to borrow these 8400 shares as long as his purchasing power remains above 0 that is the broker requires him to have enough cash on hand to buy back all of his borrowed shares at any given moment if his purchasing power ever goes negative he 'll be subject to a margin call the broker will make him either deposit cash into his account or close his positions sell long positions or buy back short positions until it 's positive again the stock jumped up to $ the next morning before the market opened during before hours trading his purchasing power at that time was $ 37,000 + $ 16,800 8400 shares $ = since his purchasing power was negative he was subject to a margin call by the time he got out he had to pay $ to buy back the 8400 shares that he borrowed making his purchasing power this $ was money that he borrowed from his broker to buy back the shares to fulfill his margin call his huge loss was from borrowing shares from his broker note that his maximum potential loss is unlimited since there is no limit to how much a stock can grow evidently he failed to grasp the most important concept of short selling which is that he 's borrowing stock from his broker and he 's obligated to give that stock back whenever his broker wants no matter what it costs him to fulfill that obligation

absolutely this study should be taken into account as the study suggests there should be further study into the possible link between glyphosate and i would go as far as to say the science of just about anything moderately complex is never settled and continued research and study is always warranted and encouraged especially when it impacts our wellbeing   however i would point out that this study spends a great deal of time explaining that while an association is possible there are also many other factors that may be falsely leading them to that interpretation   in the end this paper stops far short of making a concrete link between glyphosate and any form of cancer the state of california on the other hand is making a very definitive statement that they know glyphosate causes cancer i do n't think we know this at all and the data in support of such a conclusion is extremely limited and weak at this point

the safest investment is probably a money market fund originally i said a tips fund but they appear to be riskier than i had thought   but you might not want to invest everything there because the returns are not going to be great   high returns come with high risk the best portfolio has some percentage which may be 0 of your money in a safe asset like a money market and some in a risky portfolio this percentage may also be zero for some people   you should consult your own risk aversion and decide how much money to put in each   if you are super risk averse put almost all of it in the money market   if you want a little more return put more of it in the risky portfolio   this is a fundamental result of finance theory what 's the risky asset   a fully diversified portfolio of bonds and stocks   people do n't agree on exactly what the weights should be   the rule of thumb back in the day was 60 stock and 40 bonds   these days lots of financial planners recommend 120 minus your age in stock and the rest in bonds   but no one really knows what the perfect weights in the risky portfolio should be the rules of thumb i just gave have little or no theoretical foundation so you have to choose for yourself what you think makes sense

so 's initial plan was to have your dad pay money to supposedly help her get the gold chest after he would have paid there would have been another complication and more yet someone to bribe a plane ticket to buy transport to arrange customs to handle whatever the list would last as long as there 's money to take even if he does not have much money the appeal of his share of the treasure could have been enough to tempt him to spend money he ca n't or borrow etc once she found out that he does n't have any money and/or is apparently not willing to send any she switched to a different scam she would send him a large check have him deposit it on his bank account transfer most of the money minus his generous share to her once the money is transferred the check will bounce end result 0 in the account before the transaction minus a lot afterwards it 's quite simple if an e mail from a perfect stranger includes any of the following keywords it 's a scam

the flaw in your reasoning is that you are assuming that renting a house is easy and automatic who is going to manage the property your parents what are you going to do if the tenants burn the place down start having drug parties there or secretly have 6 cats who piss everywhere so noone will ever want to rent it again what are you going to do when the house goes for a year and you have to pay a year 's worth of mortgage payments with no rental income what are you going to do when some deadbeat decides to stop paying the rent but wo n't move out and when you try to evict him he goes to court to stop you you going to fly to nj to make the court appearances unless you sell your existing house or your parents buy you out then you need to stay you should not attempt to own two houses at once with one of the houses located not where you are at that will not turn out well also just as an aside 30-year mortgages are not an investment they are a way to lose money usually people get them because they want a big beautiful house that they can not afford so they borrow the money that is not investing that is wasting money to live in luxurious circumstances if you want to become wealthy buy a property you can afford not something that you have to string out payments for 30 years

as you have n't specified country will try and answer more in general whole life insurance but it seems to be the first thing any financial adviser is trained to sell the commission structure is such that it makes more attractive for a financial adviser to sell whole life plus for most buyers its easier to sell whole life compared to term the way guarantees are worded differ from policy to policy most of them do not give any guarantee its the adviser where there is guarantee it would be similar to a interest on bank deposit debt fund plus there are various terms used in the policy the guarantee may not be on sum assured but on the policy value that would be low in essence you are right on investing the difference into any save instruments like bank deposits certain debit funds government bonds retirement funds etc that would essentially give you more returns than what s promised in the whole life policy

in my opinion the average investor should not be buying individual stocks one reason why is that the average investor is not capable of reading financial statements and evaluating whether a stock is overpriced or underpriced as such they 're often tempted to make buy sell decisions based solely on the current value of a stock as compared to the price at which they bought it the real reasons to buy or sell a stock is the expectation of future growth of the company or continued profit and expected dividends if you are n't able to analyze a company 's financial statements and business plan then you really are n't in a position to evaluate that company 's stock price so instead of asking whether to sell based on a recent drop in stock price you should be investigating why the stock price is falling and deciding whether those reasons indicate a trend that you expect to continue   if you buy and sell stocks based solely on recent trends in the stock price you probably will end up buying stocks that have recently risen and selling stocks that have recently fallen in that case you are buying high and selling low which is a recipe for poor financial outcomes

i could be wrong but i doubt that bernie started out with any intention of defrauding anyone really   i suspect it began the first time he hit a quarter when his returns were lower than everyone else 's or at least not as high as he 'd promised his investors they 'd be so he the numbers and lied to get past the moment thinking he 'd just make up for it the next quarter   only that never happened and so the lie carried forward and maybe grew as things did n't improve as he expected it only turned into a ponzi because he was n't as successful at investing as he was telling his investors he was and telling the truth would have meant the probability that he would have lost most of his clients as they went elsewhere   bernie could n't admit the truth so he had to keep up the fiction by actually paying out returns that did n't exist which required constantly finding new money to cover what he was paying out   the source of that money turned out to be new investors who were in by people already investing with bernie who told them how great he was as a financial wizard and they had the checks to prove it i think this got so far out of hand and it gradually dragged more and more people in because such things turn into black holes swallowing up everything that gets close had the 2008 financial crisis not hit then bernie might still be at it   the rapid downturns in the markets hit many of bernie 's investors with margin calls in other investments they held so they requested redemptions from him to cover their calls expecting that all of the money he 'd convinced to leave with him really existed   when he realized he could n't meet the flood of redemptions that was when he up and the bubble burst could he have succeeded by simple investing in berkshire   probably   but then how many people say that in hindsight about them or amazon or google or any number of other stocks that turned out similarly grin   taking people 's money and parking it all in one stock does n't make you a genius and that 's how bernie wanted to be viewed   to accomplish that he needed to find the opportunities nobody else saw and be the one to get there first   unfortunately his personal crystal ball was wrong and rather than taking his by admitting it to his investors his pride and ego led him down a path of deception that i 'm sure he had every intention of making right if he could   the problem was that moment never came keep in mind one thing   the $ 64 billion figure everyone cites is n't money that really existed in the first place   that number is what bernie claimed his fund was worth and it is not the amount he actually defrauded people out of   his actual cash intake was probably somewhere in the $ 20 billion range over that time   everything else beyond that was nothing more than the returns he was claiming to get for his clients   it 's what they thought they had in the bank with him rather than what was really there

the answer to this question is related to another question how would i invest in uber given that uber is a privately held company the average investor can not directly buy stock   however there are some indirect methods that you can use to invest in uber and as a result it is also possible to indirectly short uber one method is to invest in or short companies that invest in uber   alphabet google goog owns some as well as microsoft msft toyota adr and other companies   theoretically you could short these companies as a hit to uber would be bad for those companies another method would be to look at uber 's competitors   think about what companies would do well if uber went under   lyft perhaps although it is so similar to uber that if one has trouble the other may as well   perhaps instead you might invest in a traditional taxi company or a company that provides services to taxi companies such as medallion financial corporation mfin keep in mind that either investing or shorting any of these is not really the same as investing shorting uber   it provides you some exposure in uber but your investment is also affected by many other things that have nothing to do with uber for more information see the investopedia article ways to invest in uber before it goes public for the record i do n't recommend that you do any of this

the reason comcast i 'll just say comcast when i mean tv providers like comcast dish cox etc bundle channels is because they get to sell advertising on those channels   each channel or group of channels like disney charges comcast for the of broadcasting it   that is abc and hbo and so forth ask comcast for a certain $ $ per year month fortnight etc     comcast then takes really popular channels like hbo and bundles them up with shitty channels like and the oxygen network   comcast then sells advertising based on those   so if you want to advertise to middle aged white women in the mid morning oxygen you have to also pay for advertising on hbo at the same time which drives up the price comcast can ask   the popular channels are essentially loss leaders     in turn however oxygen can say hey you 're making a of money advertising on our channel comcast   pay us more or we pull the channel    this cycle continues and is part of the reason cable tv prices keep going up   some other reasons are over the top greed   for your model to work a single subscription fee would have to replace the income earned from ads and maintain the same price paid to each network   since comcast can no longer force people to pay for oxygen when all they want is hbo the prices for the non popular channels skyrocket as people stop paying for them    the shitty networks are n't willing to take the risk of cutting their revenue streams off and will most certainly write into their agreements with comcast and no streaming    the super popular networks do n't need the extra income and feel like streaming would diminish their brand so they add in similar no streaming clauses

according to the answers to this question you generally are n't taxed on gains until you sell the asset in question none of those answered specifically for the u.k. so perhaps someone else will be able to weigh in on that to apply those ideas to your question yes your gains and losses are taxable if you originally traded something worth $ 100 for the bitcoins then when you converted back to dollars you received $ 200 you would have a $ 100 gain simply on the foreign exchange trade that is this $ 100 of income is in addition to any income you made from your business selling goods

pre qualification is only a step above what you can do with a rate payment calculator   they do n't check your credit history and credit score they do n't ask for verification of your income or verify that you have reported your debts correctly they also do n't guarantee the interest rate but if you answer truthfully and completely and nothing else changes you have an idea of how much you can afford factoring in the down payment and estimates of other fees taxes and insurance you can get pre by multiple lenders then base your decision on rates and fees   you want to get pre approved they do everything to approve you you can even lock in a rate you want to finalize on one lender at that point because you will incur some fees getting to that point then knowing the maximum amount you can borrow including all the payments taxes insurance and fees you can make an offer on a house once the contract is accepted you have a few days to get the appraisal and the final approval documents from the lender they will only loan you the minimum of what you are pre approved for and the appraisal minus down payment also do n't go with the lender recommended by the real estate agent or builder they are probably getting a kick back based on the amount of business they funnel to that company

well keep in mind until the housing crash fannie and freddie made money they received no help from the federal gov't the whole idea of the secondary mortgage market was to keep money flowing to home buyers and everyone who bought a home benefited via rates a few points lower than if banks had to keep all the capital on hand to back all the loans   both these institutions worked well for about 40 years the here was that ratings agency rated these bonds as aaa when in fact they were junk that 's who failed in their due diligence and really should be held accountable as if they were rated junk the banks would have no one to buy them except at junk bond interest rates meaning they would n't have made these loans to people who could n't really afford houses the rating agencies were supposed to be neutral of the debt and instead they essentially took what amounts to bribes from the banks to rate them highly

you can negotiate a no penalty for early payment loan with dealerships sometimes dealerships will often give you a better price on the car when you finance through them vs paying cash so you negotiate in a 48 month finance after you 've settled on the price then you negotiate the no penalty for early payment point they 'll be less likely to try to raise the price after you 've already come to an agreement   my dad has said he does this when buying cars but that could just be hearsay and has said he will negotiate on the basis of a long term lease nail down a price then throw that clause in then pay the car off in the first payment   disclaimer um not a great way to do business though if you plan to purchase a new car every 2 3 years from the same dealer do it once and you 'll have a note in their crm not to either a offer price reductions for financing or b offer no penalty early payment financing

not directly nintendo but a company would want its share price to be high if it wants to sell its stock e.g. on ipo or on subsequent offerings however if they want to buy back some shares it would be in their interest to get more stock for the buck there may of course be derivative values associated with a high share price e.g. if they bet on the price or have agreements with investors for particular to be reached employees might hold shares and be motivated by share price increases so a decrease may not be desired unless they are into some kind of insider trading buy low sell high and last over valued share prices may undermine trust in a company and failing to inform shareholders sufficiently may be outright illegal besides those reasons related to law funding sales public relations and company image companies should be pretty much independent from their own share prices in contrast to share distribution

at least in the us a cashier 's check is just like a regular personal check only it 's guaranteed by the bank itself so the person accepting it can be pretty certain the check wo n't be returned for insufficient funds if the check is genuine most banks therefore have a policy for cashier 's checks that is very similar to their policies on regular checks and money orders if you are a member with an account in good standing they 'll make all or part of the money available to you according to their fund availability policy which is usually anywhere from immediately to 7 10 days with amounts over $ 5,000 banks will tend to put a hold on the funds to ensure it clears and they get their money if you are not a member then many banks will refuse to cash the check at all unless the cashier 's check is drawn on on that brand of bank so if the cashier 's check is issued by say chase bank chase banks will usually be willing to cash out the entire check to you immediately with properly provided id because the bank is guaranteed by them they are able to check their system and ensure the check is real and can clear the check instantly this policy is n't just up to individual banks entirely as it is defined by united states federal banking policies and federal regulations on availability of funds if you really must cash the check without a holding period and won't can't have a bank account of your own to perform this then you will generally need to go into a branch of the bank that is guaranteeing the check to be able to cash it out fully right away note that since the check might be issued by a bank with no branch near you you should have a back up plan generally banks will allow you to setup a special limited savings only account to deposit your check even if you do n't have a checking account so if no other option works you might try that as well the funds availability policies are the same but at least you 'll be able to cash it generally in 10 days time and then close the account and withdraw your money

some proportion of the costs of a policy have little to no relationship to miles driven   think of costs of underwriting and more especially sales marketing client acquisition costs auto insurance is n't in the same league as non term life insurance where the commissions and other selling expenses typically exceed the first year 's worth of premiums but the funny tv ads and/or agent commissions are n't free as well as general business overhead also as noted by quid some proportion of claim risk is n't correlated to distance covered think theft flood fire etc there are also differences in the miles that are likely to be driven by a non commercial vehicle for hire driver who puts 25k miles a year vs. one who puts 7k per year   the former is generally going to be doing more driving at higher speeds on less freeways while the latter will be doing more of their driving on crowded urban roads   the former pattern generally has a lower expected value of claims both due to having fewer cars per road mile fewer and driveways and also having any given collision be more likely to result in a fatality paralysis or other lifetime disability claims are generally going to exceed what the insurer would pay out on a fatality

i do n't have anything definitive but in general positions in a company are not affected materially by what is called a corporate action corp actions can really be anything that affects the details of a stock common examples are a ticker change or exchange change ipo ie a new ticker doing a split or merging with another ticker all of these events do not change the total value of people 's positions if a stock splits you might have more shares but they are worth less per share a merger is quite similar to a split the old company 's stock is converted two the new companies stock at some ratio ie 10 shares become 1 share and then converted to the new symbol shorting a stock that splits is no different you shorted 10 shares but after the split those are now 100 shares when you exit the position you have to deliver back 100 new shares though dollar for dollar they are the same total value i do n't see why a merger would affect your short position the only difference is you are now shorting a different company so when you exit the position you 'll have to deliver shares of the new company back to the brokerage where you borrowed the shares you shorted

you do not realize gains or losses until you actually sell the stock   after you sell the initial stocks bonds you have realized the gain   when you buy the new different stocks you have n't realized anything until you then sell those there is one exception to this called the wash sale rule   from investopedia.com with the wash sale rule the irs disallows a loss deduction from the    sale of a security if a substantially identical security was purchased within 30 days before or after the sale   the    wash sale period is actually 61 days consisting of the 30 days before    and the 30 days after the date of the sale for example if you bought    100 shares of ibm on december 1 and then sold 100 shares of ibm on    december 15 at a loss the loss deduction would not be allowed    similarly selling ibm on december 15 and then buying it back on    january 10 of the following year does not permit a deduction the    wash sale rule is designed to prevent investors from making trades for    the sole purpose of avoiding taxes

conservative = on the side of a higher ev to the business because if you 're someone looking to acquire the business for example and let 's say we 're talking about a business that has debt which trades at a discount it 's more conservative to assume that the debt ca n't necessarily be restructured   to use an extreme example as you 're valuing the business would it be conservative or aggressive to assume that the debt got magically wiped out altogether so that 's why i 'm saying that it 's more conservative to use the book value of the debt

doing what you suggest may actually be helpful today you have wealth of and debt of 140k for net wealth of 5k your interest incurred is $ and your interest earned is $ for a total loss of $ just below the 491 $ you are saving so your total saving is $ currently however even though in total you have more money each month than the month before you are getting more debt and thus more interest to pay each month your interest earned is increasing much slower that $ you are currently able to save by the time you hit 51 that has become $ and is still dropping by 60 your debt has overtaken your retirement savings that $ 5 net worth you have now is gone if you were to withdraw money from your retirement to pay off your debt with the $ penalties you would have wealth of 70k and debt of for a net wealth of i.e. net debt obviously the above is not good however you reduce your monthly interest paid to $ while also reducing your interest earned to $ 102 this is a total loss of $ so you are saving $   note that in this case your $ 491 monthly repayment is higher than the interest you have to pay on the account this means that each month your interest payment becomes lower thus you pay off more and more each month your balance would be getting better each month and at a faster rate each month your net wealth would be back in positives and above your wealth on your current trajectory before you hit 62 by 65 you will have $ 9000 of net wealth if you use your retirement savings now as opposed to $ 9000 net debt if you do n't and just adding a few things on to the end 1 this is just the maths of it and does not take into account your behaviour if having that debt accruing is helping to motivate you to give up on luxuries then this analysis does not apply i am assuming that the $ is literally all you can save and that no matter what changes you will always deposit that $ 491 if you do not think you can continue to deposit that $ 491 if you stop seeing such high interest accruing then do not do this 2 i am assuming your interest earned on your ira is 1.75 if this is not the case then please let me know and i can adjust my numbers accordingly from 3 i 'm assuming all numbers you mentioned are accurate and will stay constant interest rates may not 4 this is not professional financial advice i am just a person on the internet   5 this goes without saying and will probably go down as well as let them eat cake did but saving more money each month will be a more powerful risk free way to get out of this problem work a 2nd job cut costs however you can 6 sorry if you were looking for something more motivational or sugar coated   7 best of luck feel free to ask any questions graph below in red is your current trajectory and blue is if you withdraw from your retirement to pay off your debt

we frequently get whole insurance vs term insurance questions and most of the answers will support term insurance   we get questions regarding getting insurance before there is a need in case there is a problem getting it later and for most people it does n't make sense to over insure early you have asked from a slightly different position you have a more solid reason to be concerned about your health you do n't have a need now and ca n't estimate what your need will be or when it will be those numbers you quote may seem high but when you do n't know how many kids you may have or what you will need to protect against they may turn out to be inadequate when you do need the insurance you need to sit down with a fee only financial planner they can lay out your options today and as your situation changes   then as the years go by have that plan the fee only planner will not tell you what company to buy insurance from or what funds to invest in but they will help you decide what types of protection and investment you need

let me just add that while you do n't need to write the date received on the back of the check you could why let 's say someone was late in paying you and you wanted to document the fact that they were late i 've had late paying customers send me a check dated on the due date but really they just pre dated the check and sent it 60 days past due so let 's say i want to establish and document the pattern in case it becomes a future legal issue when you deposit or cash a check an image of the front and back is made and the person or company who issued the check will have those images stored as part of their transaction history it used to be that the original physical cancelled check was returned to the payer but that was another era so write the date received on the back next to the endorsement endorse the check and take a photo of the front and back along with the postmark on the envelope to document that they are a late payer this way if it ever becomes a he said she said issue you can easily show they have a history of paying late if the payer looks at their check images they 'll see your received date note next to the endorsement granted this is a lot of trouble for a unique situation in 20 + years of running a business i 've actually had the foresight to do this a handful of times with offenders and in only one case did it come in handy later on but boy was i glad to have those photos when i needed them

here is a simple example of how daily leverage fails when applied over periods longer than a day it is specifically adjusted to be more extreme than the actual market so you can see the effects more readily you buy a daily leveraged fund and the index is at 1000 suddenly the market goes crazy and goes up to 2000 a 100 gain because you have a 2x etf you will find your return to be somewhere near 200 if the etf did its job then tomorrow it goes back to normal and falls back down to 1000 this is a fall of 50 if your etf did its job you should find your loss is somewhere near twice that 100 you have wiped out all your money forever you lose the stock market does not in practice make jumps that huge in a single day but it does go up and down not just up and if you 're doing a daily leveraged etf your money will be gradually eroded it does n't matter whether it 's 2x leveraged or leveraged or inverse or anything else do the math get some historical data run some simulations you 're right that it is possible to beat the market using a 2x etf in the short run but the longer you hold the stock the more ups and downs you experience along the way and the more opportunity your money has to decay if you really want to double your exposure to the market over the intermediate term borrow the money yourself this is why they invented the margin account your broker will essentially give you a loan using your existing portfolio as collateral you can then invest the borrowed money increasing your exposure even more alternatively if you have existing assets like say a house you can take out a mortgage on it and invest the proceeds this is n't necessarily a good idea but it 's not really worse than a margin account investing with borrowed money is investing with borrowed money and you might get a better interest rate actually a lot of rich people who could pay off their mortgages do n't and invest the money instead and keep the tax deduction for mortgage interest but i digress remember that assets shrink liabilities loans never shrink if you really want to double your return over the long term invest twice as much money

it looks like the rate on that first loan is 6 2/3   when i look at $ principal and a $ 500 payment i 'm seeing a long term 24 years not 60 but not good either   yes as you pay a bit of principal the next payment has less interest and even more principal   i hope your degree is in a field that 's lucrative or that you 're able to get a job that qualifies you for loan forgiveness over time i 'm sorry that advice might seem weak but aside from that the best i can offer is to live well beneath your means i.e. continue to live like a student and make additional payments   as far as bi weekly goes the lender may not accept partial payments set aside the money every two weeks and when you have extra money just make an extra payment amount toward principal   to pay this off as fast as possible i 'd make as high an extra payment as i could each month to the loan with the higher rate if the rates are the same pay it off to the one with the lower balance   with respect to the debt followers of the david say the rates are simply close say .25 apart with the lower balance having the lower rate if you were to pay this one first it would occur sooner of course and free up that monthly payment helping your cash flow but it comes at a cost   note if as noah suggests the rates are the same i 'd advise to make all extra payments toward the lower balance that will get you to the point where you 've freed up that cash flow for other purposes whether it 's to focus on the higher loan or anything else you need this for

the reason you would want to report to all three is because lenders do n't usually query all three thus it may be that your negative mark will be missed by a future lender because that lender did n't query the agency you chose to report to generally it is cheaper to report to more agencies than to query more agencies and since those reporting are also those it is in their best interest to continue reporting to all agencies and expecting others to do the same each agency calculates the score independently based on the information reported to that agency thus only reporting a negative item to experian will mean that transunion and equifax scores for the same person will be higher

they are purchasing the company is this correct yes this is correct if i purchase a company here in australia i also purchase its assets and liabilities yes that is correct how can it be nil how can it be legal the value of shares or shareholders is assets liabilities generally a healthy company has assets that are greater than its liabilities and hence the company has value and shareholders have value of the shares in case of ten the company has more liabilities even after all assets are sold off there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors hence the company is in administration i.e. it is now being managed by regulated australian authority the job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal in case of ten the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of cbs will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative as the company is separate legal entity they ca n't recover the negative from shareholders even the current creditors may not be paid in full and may get a pro rated due and may lose some money

they made their money one of two ways   either they got a commission from the original owner similar to how a buyer 's agent in a real estate transaction gets a commission from the original owner of the house and/or a share of the seller 's agent 's commission or they actually participated in the transaction directly buying from the original owner selling to you at a higher price storing it in the vault free of charge of course has an expectation that a certain percentage of those who do so will use that broker to complete the eventual sale

here 's how i think about money there are only 3 categories contexts buckets that my earned money falls into savings is my emergency fund i keep 6 months of total expenses expenses are anything in the consumption bucket you can be as detailed as you want with this area but i tend to leave a fudge factor in other words if i estimate that i spend approximately $ 3,000 a month in consumption dollars then i 'll save $ 3,500 times 6 in the bank this money needs to be liquid some people use a heloc other people use their roth contributions in any case you need to put this money some place you can get access to it in case you go from accumulation income exceed expenses to mode expenses exceed income this money is distinct from consumption which i will cover in paragraph three investments are stocks bonds income producing real estate small businesses etc these dollars require a strategy the strategy can include some form of asset allocation but more importantly a timeline these are the dollars that are working for you each dollar placed here will multiply over time once you put a dollar here it should n't be taken out unless there is some sort of catastrophe that your savings ca n't handle or your timeline has been achieved notice that rental real estate is included so liquidating stocks to purchase rental real estate is not considered removing investment dollars just reallocating based on your asset allocation this bucket includes 401k 's iras all tax sheltered accounts non sheltered brokerage accounts and rental real estate in general your primary residence is not included in this bucket some people include the equity of their primary residence in the investment column but it can complicate the equation and i prefer to leave it out the consumption bucket is the most important bucket and the one you spend the most time with it requires a budget this includes your $ 5 magazine and your $ 200 bottle of wine anything in this bucket is gone you can recover a portion of it by selling it on ebay for $ 3 these are earned dollars but the original $ 5 is still considered spent the reason your thought process in this area is distinct from the other two the decisions made in this area will have the biggest impact on your personal finances warren buffett was famous for on haircuts because they are worth thousands of dollars down the road if they are invested instead remember this is a zero sum game so every $ 1 not consumed is placed in one of the other buckets once your savings bucket is full every dollar not consumed is sent to investments remember to include everything that does not fit in the other two buckets most people forget their car insurance life insurance tax bill at the end of the year accountant bill etc in conclusion there are three buckets savings which serve as your emergency bucket this money should not be touched unless you switch from accumulation to investments which are your dollars that are working for you over time they require a strategy and a timeline consumption which are your monthly expenses these dollars keep you alive and contribute to your enjoyment this is a short explanation of my use of money it can get as complicated and detailed as you want it to be but as long as you tag your dollars correctly you 'll be okay imho hth

a distribution is typically a return of capital in other words you 're getting money back that you 've contributed previously and thus would have been taxed upon in previous years when those funds were first to you distributions are nontaxable so they do not represent income from capital gains but do effect your cost basis when determining the capital gain loss once that capital gain loss is realized as an example publicly traded real estate investment trusts reits generally distribute a return of capital back to shareholders throughout the year as a distribution this is a return of a portion of the shareholder 's original capital investment not a share of the reits profits so it is simply getting a portion of your original investment back and thus is not income being received i like to refer to it as new income to differentiate however the return of capital does change the cost basis of the original investment so if one were to then sell the shares of the reit in this example the basis of the original investment has to be adjusted by the distributions received over the course of ownership in other words the cost basis will be reduced when the shares are sold i 'm wondering if the op could give us some additional information about his her s corp what type of business is it in the course of its business and trade activity does it buy and sell securities stocks etc does it sell assets or business property does it own interests in other corporations or partnerships sales of those interests are one form of capital gain long term capital gains are taxed at rates lower than ordinary income but the irs has very specific rules as to what constitutes a capital gain loss i hate to answer a question with a question but we need a little more information before we can weigh in on whether you have actual capital gains or losses in the course of your s corporation trade

in such a situation is there any reason financial or not to not pay    as many points as mortgage seller allows i can think of a few reasons not to buy points in the scenario you described if interest rates decrease you could be better off refinancing to a lower rate than buying points now if buying points reduced your down payment below 20 then the pmi would more than offset the benefit of having purchased points your situation changes and you are n't able to stay in the home as long as planned   that said current interest rates are pretty low so i 'd probably gamble on them not getting too much lower anytime soon i also assume that if you can afford as many points as they allow that you would n't have to dip below 20 down payment even with points edit others have mentioned that it 's important to note opportunity cost when calculating the benefit of purchasing points i agree you would n't want to buy points at a rate that saved you less than you could earn elsewhere personally i 've not seen a points scenario that did n't yield more benefit than market average returns but that could be due to my market or just coincidence you should definitely calculate the benefit for your scenario and shop for a good lender do n't forget that points are tax deductible in the year paid when calculating their benefit

similarly too much long term investment seems unproductive but what would be too much in 1900 the life expectancy of someone in the united states was less than 50   it is now in the 70s   my grandparents were born around that time and all lived into their 80s and 90s   life expectancy in india is currently about 66   you should expect that to increase into the 70s if not the 80s in the next fifty years    you should plan on living until 120   why   if you die earlier than that you may have wasted some money that you could have used for a better living standard   however if you do live that long and you spent all your savings by the time that you were 66 you 'll have a hard retirement   you 've already said that you wo n't have descendants to take care of you   you 'll need your investments to do so   you need long term investments more than someone with a family not less    you need to able to afford a house for retirement   you need to be able to maintain it buy food etc on your savings   in order to be sure it lasts you need to build your long term investments until they produce a steady income that comes close to matching your income    there are some costs that you wo n't have in retirement   you wo n't need to save for retirement   you wo n't need to commute to work   so your retirement income does n't need to support that    if i were you i 'd save like everyone else until income from investments matched my current expenses minus commuting   at that time you can readjust    overall you are far more likely not to save enough than too much   i would n't worry about in your twenties   no one actually does so

neither party gives an f about the consumer    the real issue is class action lawsuits in which the consumer gets shafted and the lawyers make a killing    real class action reform would not come in the form of favoring arbitration over lawsuits or vice versa but in requiring that fees in class action suits be paid in the same form as the payment to consumers and requiring that people opt in to join a class rather than having to actively opt out ending payment of fees in cash but consumers getting coupons which are only good one buys more of the alleged wrong doing products services would ensure consumers get a fair shake   this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most democrats and many republicans would never support it requiring people to opt in to class action suits rather than go through a long process of opting out would reduce the number of frivolous class action suits   again this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most of our politicians would n’t support it in short it comes down to most democrats favoring the lawyer lobby over the business lobby and most republicans favoring the opposite neither cares about the consumer citizen

credit cards typically charge interest on money you borrow from them   they work in one of two ways most cards will not charge you any interest if you pay the balance in full each month   you typically have around 25 days the grace period to pay that off   if that 's the case then you will use your credit card without any cost to yourself however if you do not pay it in full by that point then you will owe 19.9 interest on the balance typically from the day you charged the payment so retroactively   you 'll also immediately begin owing interest on anything else you charge typically even if you do then pay the next month the entire balance on time   it 's typically a daily rate which means that the annual rate apr is divided into its daily rate think the apr divided by 365 though it 's a bit different than that since it 's the rate which would be 19.9 annualized when you realize interest is paid on interest    say in your case it 's 0.05 daily that means each day 0.05 is added to your balance due   if you charged $ 1000 on day one and never made a payment but never had to ignore penalties here you 'd owe $ at the end of the year paying $ 199 interest 19.9 1000 note that your interest is calculated on the daily balance not on your actual credit limit if you only charge $ 100 you 'd owe $ interest not $ 199 also note that this simplifies what they 're actually doing   they often use things like average daily balance calculations and such to work out actual interest charged they tend to be similar to what i 'm describing but usually favor the bank a bit or are simpler to calculate finally some credit cards do not have a grace period   in the us most do but not all in other countries it may be less common   some simply charge you interest from day one as far as standard purchases that means buying services or goods   using your credit card for cash advances i.e. receiving cash from an atm using those checks they mail you or for cash like purchases for example at a casino are often under a different scheme they may have the same rate or a different rate   they likely incur interest from the moment cash is produced no grace period and they may involve additional fees   never use cash advances unless you absolutely can not avoid it

you asked for simple and i promise you this is it just looks a bit math heavy to start with because we have to handle a couple of different scenarios bear with me i find the best way to deal with these kinds of questions is to put together a total cost for each option for a sensible amount of time and see what the difference is we 'll include the current cost for both options plus the subsequent costs for 12 months i find that more useful than a straight which is more expensive right now because it includes the potential costs of the next upgrade and any changes to the plan let 's throw some numbers together for the next 12 months if your current plan is longer than 12 months read the note at the bottom first first write down the cost of these things the above assume that you have two options if you take the repair option and only one option if you use the buy out option the two options we 're assuming here are that you can either   if you 'd choose the same new plan regardless of whether you take the $ 100 or $ 150 option there 's no need to include both options to simplify things you can just use the same numbers for both b c and pu and the calculation below will still work when you 've found and written down the above just do the sums below to find your two total costs over 12 months nothing fancy just plug the numbers above into the equation eg if pe ebay value of the phone is $ 80 replace pe with 80 do n't forget to do the parts in brackets first that 's your total cost for both options for the next year note i 'm assuming that your plan ends within the next 12 months if not just replace 12 in the above calculations with another term you can also do this if you want to find out the price difference over a longer period noting that if you upgrade to the same plan regardless of choice you 'll get the same answer for any period longer than your current contract

a fund is a portfolio in that it is a collection so the term is interchangeable for the most part   funds are made up of a combination of equities positions i.e. stocks bonds etc plus some amount of un invested cash most of the time when people are talking about a fund they are describing what is really an investment strategy   in other words an example would be a far east agressive fund just a made up name for illustration here which focuses on investment opportunities in the far east that have a higher level of risk than most other investments thus they provide better returns for the investors   the portfolio part of that is what the stocks are that the fund has purchased and is holding on behalf of its investors   other funds focus on municipal bonds or government bonds and the list goes on i hope this helps good luck

how can i calculate my currency risk exposure   you own securities that are priced in dollars so your currency risk is the amount all else being equal that your portfolio drops if the dollar depreciates relative to the euro between now and the time that you plan to cash out your investments not all stocks though have a high correlation relative to the dollar   many us companies e.g. apple do a lot of business in foreign countries and do not necessarily move in line with the dollar   calculate the correlation using excel or other statistical programs between the returns of your portfolio and the change in fx rate between the dollar and euro to see how well your portfolio correlated with that fx rate   that would tell you how much risk you need to mitigate how can i hedge against it   there are various currency etfs that will track the usd eur exchange rate so one option could be to buy some of those to offset your currency risk calculated above   note that etfs do have fees associated with them although they should be fairly small one i looked at had a 0.4 fee which is n't terrible but is n't nothing also note that there are etfs that employ currency risk mitigation internally including one on the nasdaq 100    note that this is not a recommendation for this etf just letting you know about alternative products that might meet your needs

this would depend on what transfer methods your forex broker allows most will allow you to have a check or wire transfer sent best thing would be to call email your broker and ask how to get the money into your account keep in mind many brokers will force you to withdraw using the same funding method you used to deposit up to the amount of the deposit for example if i fund my forex account with $ 500 on a credit card and make $ 500 profit i now have $ 1,000 sitting in my forex account the broker will force me to withdraw $ 500 as a credit to my credit card before allowing me to use another withdrawal method this is an anti money laundering precaution
