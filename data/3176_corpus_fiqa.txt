to other users save yourselves time do not test any of the alternatives mentioned in this post i have to no avail at the moment unfortunately seems to be the only broker who offers otc over the counter fx options trading to retail investors in other words it is the only alternative for those who are interested in trading non exchange options ie only alternative to those interested in trading fx options with any date or strike rather than only one date per month and strikes every 50 pips only i say unfortunately because competition is good saxo options spreads are a rip off and their platform extremely clunky but it is what it is

you missed the catch there is always a catch and in this case it is not well publicized    first some background congress both parties in 98 passed graham leach bliley it allowed commercial banks to invest securitize and insure securities it also had privacy provisions which prevented a of a mortgage from providing any personal information about the mortgage that means that as chase wrote these mortgage backed securities they were forbidden by law from telling the potential purchasers the addresses of the houses or ss 's of the purchasers    of course chase did not choose to insure these mbs 's themselves instead they chose a third party like aig because aig could not know personal information about the mortgages and was thus blinded to risk aig chose a middle of the road risk rating something like 2 risk of default    chase fraudulently represented the quality of the mortgages to the people writing the credit default swaps to insure them and to the potential buyers chase knew the mortgages were crap    fraud is fraud and is illegal in security sales even after graham leach bliley however to be clear in this case there does not need to be any faking of paperwork the loans can be passed along blindly with insurance as they were if it could be documented that chase misrepresented the quality of these aaa mbs 's they would be on the hook but the catch is that graham leach bliley offered them a cop out   aig were the real dummies in all this who writes insurance without having a good idea of the risk

middle class taxes are about as low as they have ever been they are much lower than most of the industrialized world   gt;so proportionally the middle classes end up paying the most tax and gets the least for it   no the rich pay the largest percentage of the tax dollars and they pay more per dollar earned than the middle class you can check this easily from irs tax statistics a person paying a million in taxes a year does n't use the roads 50 times as much as someone paying 20,000 a year either and most other services scale similarly so i 'd say the middle class actually gets more use out of their tax dollars than the rich

so does a post dated check have any valid use in a business or    personal transaction does it provide any financial or legal    protections at all yes most definitely you 're writing a future date on the check not past to ensure that the check will not be deposited before that day keep in mind that this may change from place to place since not every country has the same rules in the us for example such trick would not work since the check may be presented any time and is not a limited obligation however in some other countries banks will not pay a check presented before the date written on it while in the us the date on the check is the date on which it was supposedly written and as such is meaningless for obligation purposes in many other countries the date on the check is the date on which the payment to be made thus constitutes the start of the commitment and payment will not be made before that date for example in canada if you write a post dated cheque under the clearing rules of the    canadian payments association cpa your cheque should not be cashed    before the date that is written on it if the post dated cheque is cashed early you can ask your financial    institution to put the money back into your account up to the day    before the cheque should have been cashed

how when does my employer find out do they get a report from their    bank stating that check for $ paid to john doe was never    deposited or does it manifest itself as an eventual accounting    discrepancy that somebody has to work to hunt down the accounting department or the payroll company they use will report that the check was not deposited the bank has no idea that a check was written but the accounting will know   the bank reports on all the checks that were cashed accounting cares because the un cashed check for $ is a liability they have to keep enough money in the bank to pay all the liabilities it should n't be hard for them to track down the discrepancy they will know what checks are outstanding can my employer punish me for refusing the money in this way do they    have any means to force me to take what i am owed they ca n't punish you but at some time in the future they will will tell their bank not to honor the check they will assume that it was lost or misplaced and they will issue a new one to you   when tax time comes and i still have not accepted the money would it    be appropriate to adjust my reported income down by the refused    amount you ca n't decide not to report it the company knows that in year x they gave you a check for the money they are required to report it since they also withheld money for federal taxes state taxes payroll taxes 401 k insurance they also count your pay as a business expense   if you try and adjust the numbers on the w-2   the irs will note the discrepancy and want more information remember the irs get a copy of every w-2   the employer has to report it because some people who are n't organized may not have cashed a december check before the company has to generate the w-2 in late january it would confuse everything if they could skip reporting income just because a check was n't cashed by the time they had to generate the w-2

check with your bank usually a statement is either at the same day of month e.g. every 15th of the month or every 30 days e.g march 15th april 14th may 14th so forth from my experience most credit cards use the same day of month strategy keep in mind that if the day is not a business day e.g. weekend the statement is closed either the previous or the next business day

i guess the opposite of being hedged is being unhedged typically a hedge is an additional position that you would take on in order to mitigate the potential for losses on another position i 'll give an example say that i purchase 100 shares of stock xyz at $ 10 per share because i believe its price will increase in the future   at that point my full investment of $ 1000 is at risk so the position is not hedged if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've lost $ 200   if the price of xyz increases to $ 12 then i 've gained $ 200 the profit loss curve has a linear relationship to the future stock price suppose that i decide to hedge my xyz position by purchasing a put option i purchase a single option contract corresponding to my 100 shares with a strike price of $ 10 and an expiration date in january 2013 for a price of $ this means that until the contract expires i can always sell my xyz shares for a minimum of $ 10   therefore if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've only lost $ 50 the price of the option contract compared to the $ 200 that i would have lost if the position was unhedged   likewise however if the price increases to $ 12 then i 've only gained a net total of $ 150 due to the money i spent on the hedge the details of how much money you would actually lose in the hedged scenario are simplified out above even out of the money options retain some value before expiration but pricing of options is outside of the scope of this post so as a more pointed answer to your question i would say that the hedged unhedged status of a position can be characterized by its potential for loss if you do n't have any other assets that will increase in value to offset losses on your position of interest i would call it unhedged

before doing anything else you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves seriously you 'll both be safer and happier if it 's all explicit how much you should put on the house is not the right question houses do n't sell instantly and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange you need to have enough operating capital for normal finances plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses there are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions after that the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all it is n't always a better option than renting and again as discussed in answers to other questions there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance if you 're just thinking about the financials it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market the time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income plan not to move for at least five years really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs which will absorb more money   as far as how much to put down vs. finance you really want a down payment of at least 20 anything less than that and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance which is a significant expense whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get this is a good time in that regard versus how much return you are getting on your investments combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment you 're comfortable committing to if you 've got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing if you 're comfortable with that if the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable   this might not be a good answer for you it 's a judgement call i waited until i 'd been in out of school about 25 years before i was ready to buy a house since i 'd been careful with my money over that time   i had enough in investments that i could have bought the house for cash or i could have gone the other way and financed 80 of it for maximum leverage i decided that what i was comfortable with was financing 50 you 'll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with but i say again if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved it may be absolutely the right thing to do but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out and you 'll also want appropriate terms written into your wills being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights but even then it 's safer to make it all explicit edit yes making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan you 'll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you

one of the of free trade is that there is now a global labor market so companies routinely review their operations and think strategically about where the company is going standard options are because the disincentives that once existed in the past are gone the need for humans to do work tariffs regulation poor infrastructure in the developing world the available supply of labor is greater and demand lower thus wages are falling in real terms think in the simplest terms in an office environment   in 1980 to make you needed a xerox machine that required a technician on site every couple of weeks to make adjustments change toner etc there was probably a local rep you called to schedule break fix now technology has replaced that copy machine with a cheap multi function device that requires no maintenance and any technical support is delivered by a person sitting in a indian call center so to answer your question the incremental money from rising prices goes to a number a places alot of it goes to oil producers and other commodity producers much of it consists of indirect costs that fulfill other mandated services when you buy something buried in that cost are things like health insurance prescription drugs and school taxes

gt;if you do n’t have a lot of money the presence of a sizable sum in the house or even in the bank means that you ’ll be constantly tempted to dip into it   the psychology behind statements like this are a source of amusement to me they seem to that those who have less money are bad with it kind of a chicken and egg issue that assumes one over the other   it makes me think that authors researchers and have likely never felt the degree of financial insecurity that drives behaviors such as the ones being discussed   if you do n't have a lot of money the possession of a sizable sum presents other problems such as issues of needs and purchases that have been put off due to a lack of resources while you prioritized for survival you put off buying the washing machine because your car needed repairs how else were you going to be able to get to work you can limp by using a or doing laundry at your parents house but you likely put off all sorts of other needs as well and now you have to find the best way to allocate a sizable sum that likely is n't going to be enough to address all of the needs you have put off   while you 're trying to decide how to best allocate this resource do n't forget the talking heads that lecture you on the importance of an emergency fund disregard for a moment that when cash is such a scarce resource any unexpectedly dire circumstance which would be best resolved by your having more of it probably constitutes an emergency

our view is that just be cause amzn can disrupt somebody else 's profit stream it does n't mean that amzn earns that profit stream for the moment the market does n't agree perhaps simply being disruptive is enough   while he is right in theory the problem with this viewpoint is it is incredibly short sighted amazon is disrupting spaces to the point of near outright eliminating entire markets when amazon eliminates a market that revenue has to go somewhere and while amazon may not turn a profit on it now since they now own that entire market it would be extremely simple to in the future   i can make comments for most of these companies the reason disruption is being valued so high is because the disruption happening today is so massive compared to history the disruption these four companies are causing is on the order of magnitude of what ford caused with the assembly line except greater

edit tldr i can promise you they will lose sight again because it was never regained in the first place they are n't the first company to do it and it wo nt be the last    the company i work for office depot is doing this practice we have insane goals that no one can reach and often more daily responsibilities than an individual can finish when anyone tries to speak up against it at any level the reply is we do nt want excuses or do nt be negative completely ignoring any issues presented to them instead rather than problem solving those who bring issues to light are treated as having created the problem   we the company got in trouble a while back for our pc tune because the tool did n't accurately portray the condition of a customers system if you ran the tool it would ask do you have x or y symptoms pop ups slow etc and if you selected yes it would tell you that it found possible infection symptoms it did n't make it clear that the scan did n't detect this they then paired this with techs that were n't trained in any way other than selling using the tools diagnosis and unrealistic sales goals when you could n't reach numbers you were eventually replaced if the store did n't reach numbers it came down on management who would fake numbers by returning items and reselling them as service sku 's every tech i knew complained about the awful diagnostic tool and the unrealistic goals and what they were causing many of us refused to use the tool on the grounds of it being misleading and immoral depot responded by requiring a minimum amount of logged uses of the tool per week depot did nothing but treat it as negativity until it was brought up in the news after a disgruntled tech let the word out then suddenly it 's were sorry acting like they had no idea what was going on and   the roll out of a new tool that simply had a remote technician give the same diagnostic which has since changed again we still have the same push for sales goals and attach rate push for office service and square trade sales and zero accountability they train no one create goals and act surprised when they figure out how people are meeting these goals   nothing has actually changed in a relevant way the same core problem still exists they 've only changed the face   these issues are prevalent in the company as we have minimal payroll for staffing at all times and high expectations with poor tools across the board i 've watched many people get fired for not meeting goal expectations and many more quit i 've watched the people who could meet the goals praised only to be fired a short time later when it 's found they only met the goal through cheating of some sort    every single strategy corporate tries has still followed this same format of over promise and under deliver they pile more on while cutting resources constantly and they still have n't learned the lesson that the result is the same every time regardless of game plan the best part is the higher ups all switch out every 3 6 months it seems i 've had at least 4 district managers in the short time i 've been here multiple 's and lp 's everyone comes in for 6 months then jumps ship to somewhere more stable meanwhile we cut costs to appear more profitable    the whole retail side of the company is a sham

whole life is life insurance that lasts your whole life   seriously since the insurance company must make a profit and since they know they will always pay out on a whole life policy whole life tends to be very expensive and has lower death benefits than a term policy some of these policies are paid up policies meaning that they are structured so that you do n't have to pay premiums forever   but what it amounts to is that the insurance company invests your premiums and then pays you a smaller dividend much like banks do with savings accounts unless you are especially risk averse it is almost always a better decision to get an inexpensive term policy and invest the money you save yourself rather than letting the insurance company invest it for you and reap most of the benefits if you are doing things properly you wo n't need life insurance your whole life as retirement investments will eventually replace your working income

the stock market is no different in this respect to anything that 's bought or sold the price of a stock like many other things reflects what the seller is prepared to sell it at and what the buyer is prepared to offer for it if those things match then a transaction can take place the seller loses money but gains stocks they feel represent equivalent value the reverse happens for the buyer take buying a house for example did the buyer lose money when they bought a house sure they did but they gained a house the seller gained money but lost a house new money is created in the sense that companies can and do make profits those profits together with the expected profits from future years increase the value that is put on the company if we take something simple like a mining company then its value represents a lot of things and numerous other lesser things too the value of shares in the mining company will reflect all of these things it likely rises and falls in line with the price of the raw materials it mines and those change based on the overall supply and demand for those raw materials stocks do have an inherent value they are ownership of a part of a company you own part of the asset value profits and losses made by that company betting on things is different in that you 've no ownership of the thing you bet on you 're only dependent on the outcome of the bet

lenders pay attention to where your down payment money comes from if they see a large transfer of money into your bank account within about a year before your purchase this will cause an issue for you down payments are not just there to make the principal smaller they are primarily used as an underwriting data point to assess your quality as a borrower if you take the money as loan it will count against your credit worthiness if you take the money as a gift it will raise some other red flags all of this is done for a reason if you ca n't get a down payment you are a higher credit risk poor discipline lack of consistent income even if you can currently pay the monthly cost of a mortgage   ps the cost of home ownership is much higher than the monthly mortgage payment will all this mean you won't get a loan of course not you can almost always get some loan but it will likely be at a higher rate than you otherwise would qualify for if you just waited a little bit and saved money for a down payment   another option cheaper house edit the below comments provide examples where gifts were are not a problem my experience from buying a house just a few years ago and my several friends who bought house in the same period some with family gifts and some without is that it is an issue your best bet is to talk in person with an actual mortgage broker in your area who can go through the options with you and the downsides to various approaches

many companies actually just issue new shares for employee compensation instead of buying back existing ones so actually the share price should go down because the same value is now diluted over more shares in addition this would not necessarily affect companies with many employees than those with fewer employees because companies with more employees tend to be bigger and thus have more shares among which the change in demand would be distributed also i think many companies do not issue shares to employees every pay day but just e.g. once every quarter

william r is a momentum indicator used for measuring overbought and oversold levels it is not used to predict the price of a stock in fact william r like all momentum indicators is a lagging indicator meaning the indicator level changes as the price of the stock changes it ranges from 0 to -100 usually when a reading is less than the stock can be considered to be oversold and when the reading is above -20 the stock can be considered overbought when viewed together with the price chart this can help provide a trader with entry and exit points into and out of a trade

in the dark quantifying the effect of political uncertainty on the global economy europe at the edge of an economic its fate in the hands of political leaders at odds over how to solve the continent ’s twin debt and bank crises america may be pushed over a fiscal cliff at the end of the year by political dysfunction and even china although unlikely to take a deep dive is hostage to the will and ability of its government to stimulate growth more than at any point in recent history the global economy ’s fate is tied to the of policymakers how much does such uncertainty cost anecdotal evidence suggests that it costs a lot customers of cisco systems the world ’s biggest maker of internet gear are taking longer to make decisions according to john chambers the company ’s boss their orders tend to be smaller than before and to require more in house approvals they say they are planning to buy more stuff later this year reported mr chambers recently but then in the very next breath they say it depends on what happens on a global and macro europe firms must reckon not only with recession but also with the risk that their investments may be in a different currency or locked in by capital controls robert of a swedish bank says that several swedish corporate customers have put investment projects on hold because they do n’t know how the euro crisis will unfold if america falls over the fiscal cliff it would suffer a fiscal squeeze of 5 of gdp easily enough to push the economy into recession last summer as america ’s government came close to exhausting its legal authority to borrow barack obama and republicans in congress could not resolve their fiscal differences instead they kicked the can down the road agreeing on huge automatic spending cuts that would start on january 2nd just as all of george bush ’s tax cuts are due to expire along with a separate temporary payroll tax cut no deal to avoid this double whammy is likely before the november 6th election so any firm that sells to the federal government is left in limbo mike head of computer sciences corporation a big technology services firm recently told investors i just do n’t know what ’s going to happen none of us knows the debt ceiling makes last summer ’s weak economy weaker said james the boss of corporation a conglomerate last month and this fiscal cliff is the summer of but on steroids economists have long suspected that uncertainty could hurt growth john maynard keynes said investment was based on expectations that are subject to sudden and violent changes in a 1980 paper ben bernanke now chairman of the federal reserve this effect since most investment is irreversible uncertainty increases the value of waiting for new information and thus retards the current rate of investment in the 1990s and robert went further making an analogy between an investment opportunity and a stock option the value of which rises with the volatility of the stock price but disappears once the option is exercised if an investment is irreversible uncertainty raises the value of hoarding cash and waiting to see what happens the quantifying uncertainty is a more recent sport to measure it nick bloom and scott baker of stanford university and steve davis of the university of chicago constructed an index it counts how often uncertainty related to policy is mentioned in newspapers the number of temporary provisions in the tax code and the degree to which forecasts of inflation and federal spending differ from each other that index hit its highest in 25 years during last summer ’s debt ceiling battle and remains high by contrast the vix index of stock market volatility a conventional gauge of uncertainty remains below its peak of 2009 see chart a simpler index for europe that tracks news reports of uncertainty has similarly spiked mr bloom and his co authors fed their index into a model of growth that seeks to filter out purely economic factors by controlling for interest rates and stock prices they conclude that the rise in uncertainty between 2006 and 2011 reduced real gdp by 3.2 and cost 2.3 m jobs such estimates should be taken with a grain of salt they demonstrate that policy uncertainty and weaker economic growth are related not that the first causes the second many radical policy actions from the tarp bail out programme to the federal reserve ’s quantitative easing and the dodd frank law on financial reform were responses to unprecedented economic trauma collapsing house prices failing financial institutions and the deepest recession since the second world war that trauma did most of the damage to growth not any uncertainty about the policy response had policymakers stood still the result would have been less policy uncertainty but a far more damaging crisis clearly some policies such as mr obama ’s health care reform generate uncertainty independent of economic developments but at least obamacare comes with benefits as well as risks that can not be said for the current political as the fiscal cliff draws nearer argues harris bank of america ’s economist for north america the incentive to defer hiring and investment will grow putting pressure on the economy the process is as important as the outcome he says and the process is a disaster     thomas

as a former computer engineer turned finance guy i 'll attest that matlab or even r are immensely better analytic tools than excel vba excel and vba are good enough if all you 're going to do is cookie cutter dcf analysis lame but if you want to do any advanced monte carlo simulations or something that requires more than a few dozen iterations you 're going to need a mathematical programming language excel is nothing but a kiddie toy compared to those additionally everyone and their dog knows excel and vba adding matlab or r to your resume definitely boosts your appeal to employers   i prefer matlab but r is free and open source so it 's much more widely available they both have similar syntax

i agree with your post 100   on this question gt what is it that allows some people to break out of rigid patterns of thought i.e. routines   it seems to be simply the belief that one first off should and second that they actually have the ability too i believe a lot of that probably comes from culture environment    this is why left leaning people sometimes annoy me with all of their good intentions and aspirations of social justice they do n't realize how much they are fucking over and young black kids by telling them that the system is stacked against them

gt;what i was talking about is personal income tax    got it thanks for clarifying   gt;that would mean amazon would need to offer 5k more pay for an equal job vs an employer in another state   i think cost of living would also be a factor so i do n't know that a state with income tax would automatically not make the cut as you asserted in your first comment because the cost of living might be cheaper and even everything out   gt;this is just one factor a company this huge would consider when moving    agreed there are numerous factors that amazon will have to consider so i see no reason why a state that has an income tax should not submit an application

i think your logic is flawed when you say cd 's are better than records i hope you are not talking about sound quality unless you are working with blu ray quality audio files on those cd 's which i can assure you are not going for 25 cents to $ 1 again assuming we are not talking about blu ray quality cd 's the audio file down thus sacrificing the quality of the sound    your cited source even says are many examples where a vinyl record may sound better than its equivalent cd for extremely specific reasons conversely there are many cd 's that may sound better than a vinyl record for specific reasons

it 's slightly more complicated than that usually a country that was in greece 's situation would be able to use inflation to devalue their currency which would have the effect of lowering the value of the government 's debts and also of making greek prices more competitive in the international market or they could use quantitative easing to inject cheap cash into the economy to help stimulate it because greece is on the euro however they have no control over their own currency and their options are highly limited additionally when you join the eu especially the eurozone that 's supposed to come with additional internal responsibilities but it 's also supposed to come with additional external ones as well greece has a responsibility to get its shit together but the whole point is that more financially stable countries have a responsibility to help them right now that means germany they 're the ones with the greatest control over the euro and they 're away from their duties if the rest of europe did n't want to risk ending up in this position they should n't have let greece into the eurozone

in general i think you 're conflating a lot of ideas    the stock market is not like a supermarket   with the exception of a direct issue you 're not buying your shares from the company or from the new york stock exchange you 're buying from an owner of stock joe sally a pension fund a hedge fund etc it 's not sitting on a shelf at the stock market when you buy an apple stock you do n't own $ 10 of apple you own of apple because apple has shares outstanding   when a the board gets together to vote on and approve a dividend the approved dividend is then divided by billion to determine how much each owner receives   the company does n't pay dividends out to owners from a pot of money it received from new owners it sold iphones at a profit and is sending a portion of that profit to the owners of the company    when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the    company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your    stock for the company 's assets the statement does have backing   it 's backed by the us judicial system   but there 's a difference between owning a company and owning the assets of the company   you own of the company and the company owns the company 's assets   nevermind how disruptive it would be if any shareholder could unilaterally decide to sell a company 's buildings or other assets this is not a ponzi scheme because when you buy or sell your apple stock it has no impact on apple you 're simply transacting with another random shareholder barring a share repurchase or direct issue   apple does n't receive the proceeds of your private transaction you do as far as value goes yes the stock market provides tons of value and is a staple of capitalism   the stock market provides an avenue of financing for companies   rather than taking a loan a company 's board can choose to some control and take on additional owners who will share in the of the enterprise    additionally the exchanges deliver value via an unbelievable level of liquidity   you do n't have to go seek out joe or sally when you want to sell your apple stock   you do n't need to put your shares on craigslist in the hope of finding a buyer   you do n't have to negotiate a price with someone who knows you want to sell   you just place an order at an exchange and you 're aligned with a buyer    also understand that anything can move up or down in value without any money actually changing hands   say you get your hands on a pair of shoes or whatever they 're hot on the market very rare and sought after   you think you can sell them for $ 1,000 on tonight 's news it turns out that the leather is actually from humans and the ceo of the company is being indicted the company is falling apart etc   your shoes just went from $ 1,000 to $ 0 with no money changing hands or from $ 1,000 to $ 100,000 depending on how cynical you are

great question   first my recommendation would be for you to get a card that does not have a yearly fee there are many credit cards out there that provide cash back on your purchases or points to redeem for gift cards or other items be sure to cancel the credit card that you have now so you do n't forget about that yearly fee canceling will have a temporary impact on your credit score if the credit card is your longest held line of credit   second it is recommended not to use more than 20 of all the available credit staying above that line can affect your credit score i think that is what you are hearing about running up large balances on your credit card if you are worried about staying below the 20 line you can always request a larger line of credit just keep paying it off each month though and you will be fine   you already have a history of credit if you have begun paying off your student loans

yes it 's possible however it 's not likely at least not for most people earning a million is not that difficult but when you talk about billions that 's an entirely different story i think the key point that you 're missing is leverage it 's common knowledge that warren buffett likes to have a huge cash at his disposal and does not soak himself in debt however in his early years buffett did not get to where he 's at by investing only his own money he ran what was basically a hedge fund and leveraged other peoples money in the market this magnified his returns quite substantially if you look at buffett 's investments you 'll notice that he had a handful of huge wins in his portfolio and many more just mediocre success stories not everything he invested in turned to gold but his portfolio was by the large wins that continued to compound over many years because he held them for so long also consider the fact that buffett 's wealth is largely measured in berkshire stock this stock is a reflection of anticipated future earnings by the company there 's no way that alone could turn    $ 10k in 1950 into $ 50b today could    it why not take the two founders of google for example they became billionaires in short order when google had it 's ipo and basically started in a garage with very little cash of course they did n't do this by buying and selling shares there are many paths to earnings enormous sums of money like the people you 're talking about but one characteristic that the richest people in society seem to have in common is that they all own their own companies

it would be unusual but it is possible that the expenses could be very high compared to your income the irs in pub 529 explains the deduction you can deduct only unreimbursed employee expenses that are paid or incurred during your tax year for carrying on your trade or business of being an employee and ordinary and necessary an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade    business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate    and helpful to your business an expense does n't have to be required    to be considered necessary the next part lists examples i have cut the list down to highlight ones that could be large you may be able to deduct the following items as unreimbursed employee    expenses damages paid to a former employer for breach of an employment contract job search expenses in your present occupation legal fees related to your job licenses and regulatory fees malpractice insurance premiums research expenses of a college professor rural mail carriers vehicle expenses tools and supplies used in your work work clothes and uniforms if required and not suitable for everyday use work related education if the term of employment was only part of the year one or more of the these could dwarf your income for the year before deducting something that large be sure you can document it i believe the irs computers would flag the return and i would n't be surprised if they ask for additional proof

yes   the investment world is extremely fast paced and competitive there are loads of professional traders with working day in and day out to make smarter faster trade decisions than you if you try to compete with them there ’s a better than fair chance you ’ll lose precious time and money which kind of defeats the purpose a good wealth manager in short they can save you time and money and help you take the most advantage of your current savings or you can think about it in terms of cost most wealth managers charge an annual fee as a of the amount invested for their services this fee can range anywhere from close to zero to 0.75 depending upon how sophisticated the strategy is that the money will be invested in and what kind of additional services they have to offer investing in the s&p500 on the behalf of the investor should n’t need a fee but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy that generates returns independent of the market ’s movement and certainly commands a fee but how does one figure if that fee is justified it is really simple what is the risk adjusted performance of the strategy what is the sharpe ratio large successful funds like renaissance technologies and citadel can charge 3 in addition to 30 of profits because even after that their returns are much better than the market i have this rule of thumb for money management fees that i am willing to pay

i would advise against this my main reason for saying so is that you are in a time of major transition and transition equals uncertainty what if the new job turns out to be a bad one and at the same time the house is more difficult to rent out than you expect that seems like a situation that would be worse than the sum of its parts some other things to consider first if you want to buy a house where your new job is located you will not be able to borrow as much for that house   this is especially important if you are moving to a city with a very high cost of living second your margin on the rental does n't sound like it would leave much room for profit a $ 100 difference between your mortgage and your rent amount will be eaten up very quickly through property management fees and maintenance   if the value of the house does not rise like you expect that could mean you put in a lot of effort for very little or no gain finally this will require a good deal of time management between relocating closing on this house and beginning a new job it sounds like you 'll have a lot going on this may not concern you much but it 's still worth considering

nobody tracks a single company 's net assets on a daily basis and stock prices are almost never derived directly from their assets otherwise there would be no concept of growth stocks   stocks trade on the presumed current value of future positive cash flow not on the value of their assets alone funds are totally different   they own nothing but stocks and are valued on the basis on the value of those stocks   commodity funds and closed funds muddy the picture somewhat but basically a fund 's only business is owning very liquid assets not using their assets to produce wealth the way companies do a fund has no meaning other than the direct value of its assets    even companies which own and exploit large assets like resource companies are far more complicated than funds e.g. gold mining or oil extracting companies derive most of their value from their physical holdings but those holdings value depends on the moving price and assumed future price of the commodity and also on the operations efficiency of extraction etc still different from a fund which only owns very liquid assets

i do n't use pre authorized automatic payment methods because there is no control and it is impossible to get it back once you have authorized a firm to withdraw funds from your account there is no realistic way to revoke that control save closing down your bank account entirely and moving to another institution i once had automatic payments set up for my apartment rent and then one month they withdrew twice on one day overdrawing my account it was very difficult to dispute the charge and get it back the bank was little help as i had authorized them to withdraw funds it did n't make any difference that they had done it twice because i had given them permission to withdraw that amount   the property management company was large and difficult to contact and at first denied any wrongdoing tl;dr version it 's more pain than it 's worth and i will never do it again

the process of borrowing shares and selling them is called shorting a stock or going short   when you use money to buy shares it is called going long in general your strategy of going long and short in the same stock in the same amounts does not gain you anything   let 's look at your two scenarios to see why when you start loot is trading at $ 20 per share   you purchased 100 shares for $ 2000 and you borrowed and sold 100 shares for $ 2000   you are both long and short in the stock for $ 2000   at this point you have invested $ 2000 and you got your $ 2000 back from the short proceeds   you own and owe 100 shares under scenario a the price goes up to $ 30 per share   your long shares have gone up in value by $ 1000   however you have lost $ 1000 on your short shares   your short is called and you return your 100 shares and have to pay interest   under this scenario after it is all done you have lost whatever the interest charges are under scenario b the prices goes down to $ 10 per share   your long shares have lost $ 1000 in value   however your short has gained $ 1000 in value because you can buy the 100 shares for only $ 1000 and return them and you are left with the $ 1000 out of the $ 2000 you got when you first sold the shorted shares   however because your long shares have lost $ 1000 you still have n't gained anything   here again you have lost whatever the interest charges are as explained in the traders exclusive article that posted in the comments there are investors that go long and short on the same stock at the same time   however this might be done if the investor believes that the stock will go down in a short term time frame but up in the long term time frame   the investor might buy and hold for the long term but go short for a brief time while holding the long position however that is not what you are suggesting   your proposal makes no prediction on what the stock might do in different periods of time   you are only attempting to hedge your bets   and it does n't work   a long position and a short position are opposites to each other and no matter which way the stock moves you 'll lose the same amount with one position that you have gained in the other position   and you 'll be out the interest charges from the borrowed shares every time with your comment you have stated that your scenario is that you believe that the stock will go up long term but you also believe that the stock is at a short term peak and will drop in the near future   this however does n't really change things much   let 's look again at your possible scenarios you believe that the stock is a long term buy but for some reason you are guessing that the stock will drop in the short term   under scenario a you were incorrect about your short term guess   and although you might have been correct about the long term prospects you have missed this gain   you are out the interest charges and if you still think the stock is headed up over the long term you 'll need to buy back in at a higher price under scenario b it turns out that you were correct about the short term drop   you pocket some cash but there is no guarantee that the stock will rise anytime soon   your investment has lost value and the gain that you made with your short is still tied up in stocks that are currently down your strategy does prevent the possibility of the unlimited loss inherent in the short   however it also prevents the possibility of the unlimited gain inherent in the long position     and this is a shame since you fundamentally believe that the stock is undervalued and is headed up   you are your long term gains for a chance at a small short term gain

in the us bank or credit union checking savings cd 's are insured through fdic or ncua the coverage is for $ 250,000 this limit can be increased by having multiple accounts you your spouse and a joint account with your spouse are considered 3 different accounts so you could have $ 750 k coverage   ira funds are considered a separate pot of money for insurance coverage here is an explanation from ncua and fdic there is no safety difference between savings and checking there are differences regarding minimum balances maximum number of transactions per month and fees but they are equally safe

usually the to why sell it is to maintain the specific distribution balance or to track the index that this fund was designed to offer a buy and hold fund could only buy when users are actively putting money into it that limits their ability to follow those approaches   and i think there would be problems withdrawls fair in terms of what shares are sold and how the costs for selling them are distributed that do n't arise for a single buy and hold investor if you 're willing to accept the limitations of the former and can overcome the latter it 's an interesting idea   but note that one of the places index funds save money is that since the composition of indexes changes they are already operating mostly in buy and hold mode it 's unclear how much your variant would save worth exploring in greater depth though i think

understanding the bs equation is not needed what is needed is an understanding of the bell curve    you seem to understand volatility 68 of the time an event will fall inside one standard deviation 16 of the time it will be higher 16 lower   now if my $ 100 stock has a std of $ 10 there 's a 16 chance it will trade above $ 110 but if the std is $ 5 the chance is 2.3 per the chart below the higher volatility makes the option more valuable as there 's a chance of it being in the money my answer is an over simplification per your request

you seem to be on the right track   i feel though that it 's worth addressing your maintenance budget   even if both cars described in your question are from the same model year one has been in service 2x more one car has been on the road in weather twice as much as the other   i 'm not sure what 's being represented in the $ 6k of maintenance but a whole host of systems can require maintenance or replacement at 200k+ miles   a c compressor all sorts of rubber parts seals hoses belts computer systems stereo window regulators the list goes on   i do n't know at what point the battery on a hybrid needs to be replaced or what that replacement entails but likely the battery or the hybrid recharge system will require something after 200k miles of service   i would learn more about what actual maintenance a high mileage prius can experience to answer your question though at this level of used i do n't think the dealership adds anything to the equation   when you 're buying certified pre owned the dealership manufacturer relationship and warranty can be meaningful   when you 're buying a 100k+ miles car from a random small used car lot it might as well be a stranger on craigslist

on thing the questioner should do is review the summary plan description for the 401(k plan   this may have details on any plan imposed limits on salary deferrals   if the does not have sufficient detail the questioner should request a complete copy of current plan document and then review this with someone who knows how to read plan documents the document for a 401(k plan can specify a maximum percentage of compensation that a participant in the 401(k plan can defer regardless of the maximum dollar deferral limit in internal revenue code section   for example the document for a 401(k plan can provide that participants can elect to defer any amount of their compensation salary but not to exceed ten percent 10   thus someone whose salary is $ 50,000 per year will effectively be limited to deferring at most $ 5,000   someone making $ 150,000 will effectively be limited to deferring at most $ 15,000   this is true regardless of the fact that the 2013 dollar limit on salary deferrals is $ 17,500   this is also true regardless of whether or not a participant may want to defer more than ten percent 10 of compensation this plan imposed limit on salary deferral contributions is permissible assuming it is applied in a manner   this plan imposed limit is entirely separate from any other rules or restrictions on salary deferral amounts that might be as a result of things like the average deferral percentage test

this probably wo n't be a popular answer due to the many number of disadvantaged market participants out there but yes it is possible to distort the markets for securities this way but it is more useful to understand how this works for any market since it is illegal in securities markets where company shares are involves   since you asked about the company apple you should be aware this is a form of market manipulation and is illegal when dealing with securities in any supply and demand market this is possible especially during periods when other market participants are not prevalent now the way to do this usually involves having multiple accounts you control where you are acting as multiple market participants with different brokers etc the most ways to do with involve shell companies w/ brokerage accounts but this is usually to mask illegal behavior in the securities markets where there are consequences for manipulating the shares of securities in other markets this is not necessary because there is no authority prohibiting this kind of trading behavior account b buys from account a account a buys from account b etc the biggest issue is getting all of the accounts capitalized initially the third issue is then actually being able to make a profit from doing this at all because eventually one of your accounts will have all of the shares or whatever and there would still be no way to sell them because there are no other market participants to sell to since you were the only one moving the price therefore this kind of market manipulation is coupled with promotions to attract liquidity to a financial product note the mere fact of a promotion does not mean that illegal trading behavior is occurring but it does usually mean that someone else is selling into the liquidity another way to make this kind of trading behavior profitable is via the derivatives market options contracts are priced solely by the trading price of the underlying asset so even if your multiple account trading could only at best break even when you sell your final holdings basically resetting the price to where it was because you started distorting it this is fine because your real trade is in the options market lets say apple was trading at $ 200 the options contract at the $ 200 strike is a call trading at $ 1 with no intrinsic value you can buy to open several thousand of the $ 200 strike without distorting the shares market at all   then in the shares market you bid up apple to $ 210 now your options contract is trading at $ 11 with $ 10 of intrinsic value so you just made 1000 gain and are able to sell to close those call options then you unwind the rest of your trade and sell your $ 210 apple shares probably for $ 200 or $ or less because there are few market participants that actually valued the shares for that high the real bidders are at $ 200 and lower this is hardly a thing to do so like i mentioned before this is illegal in markets where actual company shares are involved and should not be attempted in stock markets but other markets wo n't have the same prohibitions this is a general inefficiency in capital markets in general and certain derivatives pricing formulas it is important to understand these things if you plan to participate in markets that claim to be fair there is nothing novel about this sort of thing and it is just a problem of allocating enough capital to do so

this is not the answer you were hoping for   i recommend that you stay out of it and let your parents do what they want with their money   they are obviously very good savers and very thrifty with their money at this point they likely have more money than they need for the rest of their lives even if it does n't grow   it sounds like your parents are the kind of people that would worry too much about investing in the stock market if you invest them heavily in stocks it will go down at some point even if only temporarily   there is no need to put your parents through that stress and anxiety   at some point in the hopefully distant future you will likely inherit a sizable sum at that point you can invest it in a more intelligent way

this is really unfortunate   in general you ca n't back date individual policies   you could have if it was available to you elected to extend your employer 's coverage via cobra for the month of may and possibly june depending on when your application was submitted then let the individual coverage take over when it became effective    groups have some latitude to retroactively cover and terminate employees but that 's not an option in the world of individual coverage the carriers are very strict about submission deadlines for specific effective dates   this is one of the very few ways that carriers are able to say no within the bounds of the aca   you submit an application you are assigned an effective date based on the date your application was received and subsequently approved   it has nothing to do with how much money you send them or whether or not you told them to back date your application if someone at the new york exchange told you you could have a retroactive effective date they should n't have many providers have financial hardship programs   you should talk to the er hospital and see what might be available to you   the insurer is likely out of the equation though if the dates of service occurred before your policy was effective regarding your 6th paragraph regarding having paid the premium   in this day and age carriers can only say no via administrative means   they set extremely rigid effective dates based on your application date   they will absolutely cancel you if you miss a payment   if you get money to them but it was after the grace period date even by one minute they will not reinstate you   if you 're cancelled you must submit a new application which will create a new coverage gap   you pay a few hundred dollars each month to insure infinity risk you absolutely have to cover your administrative bases because it 's the only way a carrier can say no anymore so they cling to it

the biggest and primary question is how much money you want to live on within retirement the lower this is the more options you have available you will find that while initially complex it does n't take much planning to take complete advantage of the tax system if you are intending to retire early are there any other investment accounts that are geared towards retirement or long term investing and have some perk associated with them tax deferred tax exempt but do not have an age restriction when money can be withdrawn   i 'm going to answer this with some potential alternatives the us tax system currently is great for people wanting to early retire if you can save significant money you can optimize your taxes so much over your lifetime if you retire early and have money invested in a roth ira or a traditional 401k that money ca n't be touched without penalty until you 're let 's ignore roth contributions that can technically be withdrawn ok the 401k myth the i 'm hosed if i put money into it since it 's stuck perspective is n't true for a variety of reasons if you retire early you get a long amount of time to take advantage of retirement accounts one way is to primarily contribute to pretax 401k during working years after retiring begin converting this at a very low tax rate you can convert money in a traditional ira whenever you want to be roth you just pay your marginal tax rate which for an early retiree might be 0 then after 5 years you now have a chunk of principle that has become roth principle and can be withdrawn whenever let 's imagine you retire at 40 with 100k in your 401k pretax for 5 years you convert $ 20k assuming married because we get $ 20k between exemptions deduction it means you pay $ 0 taxes every year while converting $ 20k of your pretax ira to roth or if you have kids even more after 5 years you now can withdraw that 20k year 100 tax free since it has become principle this is only a good idea when you are retired early because you are able to fill up all your free income for tax conversions when you are working you would be paying your marginal rate but your marginal rate in retirement is 0 related thread on a forum you might enjoy this is sometimes called a roth pipeline basically assuming you have no income while retired early you can fairly simply convert traditional ira money into roth principle this is then accessible to you well before the age but you get the full benefit of the pretax money but let 's pretend you do n't want to do that you need the money and tax benefit now how beneficial is it to do traditional 401ks imagine you live in a state city where you are paying 25 marginal tax rate if your expected marginal rate in your early retirement is 10 15 you are still better off putting money into your 401k and just paying the 10 penalty on an early withdrawal in many cases for high earners this can actually still be a tax benefit overall the point is this just because you have to work to get money out of a 401k early does not mean you lose the tax benefits of it in fact current tax code really does let an early retiree have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the roth traditional 401k ira question are you limited to a generic taxable brokerage account currently a huge perk for those with small incomes is that long term capital gains are taxed based on your current federal tax bracket if your federal marginal rate is 15 or less you will pay nothing for long term capital gains until this income pushes you into the 25 federal bracket   this might change but right now means you can capture many capital gains without paying taxes on them this is huge for early retirees who can manipulate income you can have significant income and not pay taxes on it you can also stack this with before mentioned roth conversions convert traditional ira money until you would begin owing any federal taxes then capture long term capital gains until you would pay tax on those combined this can represent a huge amount of money per year so littleadv mentioned hsas but for an early retiree they can be ridiculously good what this means is you can invest the maximum into your hsa for 10 years let it grow 100 tax free and save all your medical receipts etc then in 10 years start withdrawing that money while it sucks healthcare costs so much in america you might as well take advantage of the tax opportunities to make it suck slightly less there are many online communities dedicated to learning and optimizing their lives in order to achieve early retirement the question you are asking can be answered in the above but for a comprehensive plan you might want other resources some you might enjoy

there are many good brokers available in the market and many spammers too personally i have been associated with since 2001 and have never faced any problem but everyone has their own personal choice and i recommend you to make your own but the question is how to find out which broker is a good broker and would provide you with a timely and reliable service online google check not really there is so much competition between brokerage firms that they keep writing rubbish about each other on blogs and websites best thing is to is check with regulator 's website for us is a regulator for all forex firms information about any regulated forex firm could be found here for uk its fsa information on all regulated uk based firm could be found here remember in many countries its not compulsory for a forex firm to be regulated but being regulated ensure that the govt has a watch on the operations of the firm also most of the firms out there provide accounts for large as well as small traders so there is nothing much to look for even if you are a small trader do keep in mind that if you are a us citizen you are restricted by the us govt to trade only with a broker within us you are not allowed to trade with any brokerage firm that is based outside the country forex trading involves a significant amount of risk make sure you study the markets well and get yourself educated properly before risking your money while i have made a lot of money trading forex i have seen a lot of people loosing everything please understand the risk and please make sure you only trade with the money which you can afford to loose

this strategy is called trading the golden cross if the 50 day sma moves above the 200 day or the death cross when the 50 day sma moves below the 200 day sma long term indicators carry more weight than shorter term indicators and this cross in a positive direction signals a change in momentum of the stock you will not catch the very bottom using this method but there is a better chance that you will catch a move near the beginning of a longer term trend golden cross information

what what a strange and horribly wrong thesis   buybacks are economically the same as dividends they are a way of distributing profits to investors a company does this when it can not find any good investment opportunities it does not cause a lack of those opportunities this guy has it completely backwards    after the buyback the previous stockholders now have cash to find opportunities that the firm was n't itself either was n't equipped to move on or did n't know about that buyback distribution does n't just get it gets reinvested as per the previous owners desires   his example of how previously a firm had to invest since it had no way to return profits to investors is a perfect example of capital misallocation caused by taxation   this piece should be nominated for worst of the year all intro econ students should read this and learn to such claims

liquidity say you have $ 50k in student loan debt   you come into a large amount of money and throw $ 10k at it   yes it 's now down to $ 40k saving you a lot of money in interest over the long run but it 's money you can no longer use now if you invest that same $ 10k instead you still potentially have access to it if needed paying $ 10k towards a debt at a 5 interest rate has essentially the same rate of return as investing the $ 10k at a 5 return   you 're making the same amount of money either way   but if you say get laid off or need money for medical expenses or a down payment on a house you can tap into that $ 10k investment if needed   it is a liquid asset

you should never invest in a stock just for the dividend dividends are not guaranteed i have seen some companies that are paying close to 10 dividends but are losing money and have to borrow funds just to maintain the dividends how long can these companies continue paying dividends at this rate or at all would you keep investing in a stock paying 10 dividends per year where the share price is falling 20 per year i know i would n't some high dividend paying stocks also tend to grow a lot slower than lower or non dividend paying stocks you should look at the total return both dividend yield and capital return combined to make a better decision you should also never stay in a stock which is falling drastically just because it pays a dividend i would never stay in a stock that falls 20 30 50 or more just because i am getting a 5 dividend regarding taxation some countries may have special taxation rules when it comes to dividends just like they may have special taxation rules for longer term capital gains compared to shorter term capital gains again no one should use taxation as the main purpose to make an investment decision you should factor taxation into your decision but it should never be the determining factor of your decisions no one has ever become poor in making a gain and paying some tax but many people have lost a great portion of their capital by not selling a stock when it has lost 50 or more of its value

the answer likely depends a bit on which state you are in but this should be true for most states   i do n't know anything about pennsylvania specifically unfortunately the affordable care act created the shop marketplace which allows small businesses to effectively form larger groups for group coverage purposes   shop stands for small business health options program and requires only one common law employee on payroll this would effectively allow you to offer group coverage without having a group   talk to your tax accountant for more details as this is still very new and not necessarily well understood there are some other options all of which i would highly suggest talking to a tax accountant about as well   health reimbursement accounts allow the employer to set aside pre tax funds for the employee to use for approved medical expenses they 're often managed by a benefits company say wageworks etc   that would allow your employee to potentially pick a higher deductible health plan which offers poorer coverage on the individual marketplace with after tax dollars and then supplement with your there are also the concept of employer payment plans where the employer reimburses the employee for their insurance premiums but those are not compatible with the aca for the most part although there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether it 's possible to have something effectively the same work see for example this page versus this for example

the optimal down payment is 100 the only way you would do anything else when you have the cash to buy it outright is to invest the remaining money to get a better return   when you compare investments you need to take risk into account as well   when you make loan payments you are getting a risk free return   you ca n't find a risk free investment that pays as much as your car loan will be   if you think you can game the system by taking a 0 loan then you will end up paying more for the car since the financing is baked into the sales price in those cases there is no such thing as free money   if you pay cash you have much more bargaining power    buy the car outright negotiating as hard as you can start saving what you would have been making as a car payment as an emergency fund and you 'll be ahead of the game for the inflation hedge you need to find investments that act as an inflation hedge taking a loan does not hedge against inflation since you 'll still be paying interest regardless of the inflation rate   the fact that you 'll be paying slightly less interest in real terms does not make it a hedge to answer the actual question if your reinvestment rate the return you can get from investing the borrowed cash is less than the interest rate then the more you put down the greater your present value pv if your reinvestment rate is less than the interest rate then the less you put down the better not including risk   when you incorporate risk though the additional return is probably not worth the risk so there is no optimal down payment in between those mathematically it will depend on how much liquid cash you need knowing that every dollar that you borrow is costing you interest

yes and there are almost no checks no pun intended on people pulling money from your account using a routing number it is an extremely insecure system if you want a real halloween scare read this article easy check fraud technique draws scrutiny unfortunately you just have to live with it if you are curious why this loophole is allowed to continue consider how hard it is to close it without undermining the convenience of checks short of you going to the bank with each person you write a check to and showing id to validate the transaction i do n't see how you could continue to use a negotiable instrument like this without such a security hole   the ultimate answer is going to have to be replacing checks with other means of payment

i would add to the other excellent answers that another factor besides just high unemployment numbers is the fear people have regarding the financial aspects of the country that is the value of stocks and the value of the dollar   when the economy is sluggish it means people are n't buying enough therefore companies are n't making enough therefore their profits are too low and people start to divest from them and stock prices drop   or even the fear of this happening can induce people to sell off shares    the point is people are worried in this economy because if due to unemployment low spending consumer confidence the stock market crashes again as it did in that represents a lot of savings lost e.g. 40 50 of what one was counting on to retire with particularly if you panic sell at the bottom   now suddenly it 's as if you had a huge robbery and you will have to work longer into your retirement years than you 'd planned   similarly if due to monetary policy the u.s. inflates the dollar what one saved for retirement may not be sufficient   these arguments are true for shorter periods than just one 's retirement but just taking that as an example so it 's not just unemployment that is worrisome in this economy   this said i agree with george that one ought to be careful and plan well regardless of the winds of the economy   i guess for most people and companies though in this economy means they ca n't get away with the kind of they might have during a boom

the title accepts as fact the attempted smear campaign by goldman against smith   only read the summary of the report over at bloomberg not the report itself but the argument appears to be that smith did not raise these concerns about goldman at any time while employed there except at the very end just after he had written the nyt op ed   goldman is trying to pawn off smith as a disgruntled former employee   however the fact that smith did n't get the raise he sought does not necessarily mean his assertions about the culture at goldman are incorrect   the point being that goldman has not proven smith is a fraud   they have only proven he has an axe to grind

it is true that this is possible however it 's very remote in the case of the large and reputable fund companies such as vanguard fdic insurance protects against precisely this for bank accounts but mutual funds and etfs do not have an equivalent to fdic insurance one thing that does help you in the case of a mutual fund or etf is that you indirectly through the fund own actual assets in a cash account at a bank you have a promise from the bank to pay and then the bank can go off and use your money to make loans you do n't in any sense own the bank 's loans with a fund the fund company can not legally take your money out of the fund except to pay the expense ratio they have to use your money to buy stocks bonds or whatever the fund invests in those assets are then owned by the fund legally a mutual fund is a special kind of company defined in the investment company act of 1940 and is a separate company from the investment advisor such as vanguard funds have their own boards and in principle a fund board can even fire the company advising the fund though this is not likely since boards are n't usually independent a quick google found this article for more maybe someone can find a better one if vanguard goes under the funds could continue to exist and get a new adviser or could be liquidated with investors receiving whatever the assets are worth of course all this legal stuff does n't help you with outright fraud if a fund 's adviser says it bought the s&p 500 but really some guy bought himself a yacht madoff style then you have a problem but a huge well known etf has auditors tons of different employees lots of brokerage and exchange traffic etc so to me at least it 's tough to imagine a risk here with a small fund company with just a few people and there are lots of these then there 's more risk and you 'd want to carefully look at what independent agent holds their assets who their auditors are and so forth with regular mutual funds not etfs there are more issues with diversifying across fund companies with etfs there probably is n't much downside to diversifying since you could buy them all from one brokerage account maybe it even happens naturally if you pick the best etfs you can find personally i would just pick the best etfs and not worry about advisor diversity update maybe also deserving a mention are exchange traded notes etns an etn 's legal structure is more like the bank account minus the fdic insurance of course it 's an iou from the company that runs the etn where they promise to pay back the value of some index there 's no investment company as with a fund and therefore you do n't own a share of any actual assets if the etn 's sponsor went bankrupt you would indeed have a problem much more so than if an etf 's sponsor went bankrupt

the word good was used in contrast to bad but these words are misused here   there are three kinds of debt debt for spending never go into debt to buy consumables go out for a good time for vacations or other purchases with no lasting financial value debt for depreciating assets such as cars and sometimes things like furniture there are those who put this in the same category as the first but i know many people who can budget a car payment and pay it off during the life of the car in a sense they are renting their car and paying interest while doing so debt for appreciating money making assets mortgage and student loans are both often put into the good category the house is the one purchase that in theory provides an immediate return you know what it saves you on the rent you know what it costs you after tax if someone pays 20 of their income toward their fixed rate mortgage and they 'd otherwise be paying 25 to rent and long term the house will keep up with inflation it 's not bad in the sense that they need to aggressively get rid of it student loans are riskier in that the return is not at all guaranteed i think that one has to be careful not to graduate with such a loan burden that they start their life under a black cloud paying 10 of your income for 10 years is pretty crazy but some are in that position finally some people consider all debt as bad debt live beneath their means to be debt free as soon as they can and avoid borrowing money

generally most businesses will not but it 's not uncommon not sure about other countries but in australia merchants here generally have to pay visa or mastercard a commission if the consumer chooses to use credit so even if they do n't levy a charge they may have a minimum purchase amount which you can use credit cards for amongst some of the ones who do include pretty much all of the budget airlines like virgin airlines   i think there 's been some outrage with them cause they charge $ 4.50 per person per trip which in some cases is greater than the transaction cost they have to pay to the credit card companies aldi supermarket link they 're kind of a budget supermarket you got to pay for shopping bags and also charge 1 more for credit card on a side note we also have a thing called here which is a debit card network i think this network charges less commission because generally a of businesses that charge for credit may not charge for i also feel is also more secure as it requires a pin number unlike a credit card which requires a signature

first let me say that you have to take everything your agent says with a grain of salt freakonomics had a great article that discussed the math behind the motivation of the real estate agent   it described the home seller trying to get say $ 400k. on a 6 commission the $ 24 k is destined to be split between seller realtor office and buyer 's realtor 's office the selling agent gets $ 6,000 or so in the end as a seller if i settle for $ 380 k my realtor is only out $ 300 netting $ but $ 20 k lower sale price and i just lost nearly $ 19 k after commission is paid   the agent would have the natural goal of volume not extracting the last dollar from the buyer gaining back the last $ 20 k to the seller will cost the realtor far more than $ 300 in her time keeping the house on the market and waiting for the better offer   sellers might use down payment as one way to estimate the probability of the financing falling through but it 's a rough estimate at best because in the case of bank financing the bank needs the same time to run through the paperwork for a 3 down or a 20 down it 's just as easy for the buyer to qualify or not qualify for one loan or the other there are young couples with great incomes and no debt who blow away the required ratios for proposed debt to income but have n't saved up the otherwise huge 20 downpayment then there are those who have saved for years even having 30 to put down but their income is still not going to qualify them the offer will be contingent on the financing regardless it will show that you are putting $ xx dollars as a downpayment and the final transaction is contingent on your bank approving you

i completely agree with pete that a 401(k loan is not the answer but i have an alternate proposal reduce your 401(k contribution down to the 4 that you get a match on   if you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up those need to be addressed before retirement savings   you 'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off    if your company matches 50 meaning you have to contribute 8 to get the 4 match then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k altogether a 100 match is very hard to give up but a 50 match is less difficult   you have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match   plus the pain of knowing you 're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible   it seems to me that i would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $ 150 per month   no you 'd be deferring $ 150 per month for an additional two years and not reducing debt at all just moving it to a different lender interest rate is not your problem   right now you 're paying less than $ 30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $ 270 in principal and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years   you 're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings    i would buckle down reduce expenses wherever possible cable cell phone coffee movies restaurants until you get these debts paid off   you make $ 70,000 per year or almost $ 6,000 per month   i bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $ 1,100 fairly quickly then the next $ 1,200 should come twice as fast then attack the next $ 4,000 you can argue whether the $ 1,200 should come first because of the interest rate but in the end it does n't matter either one should be paid off very quickly so the interest saved is negligible maybe you can get one of them paid off get yourself some breathing room then loosen up a little bit but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise some more drastic measures

your question indicates that you might have a little confusion about put options and/or leveraging   there 's no sense i 'm aware of in which purchasing a put levers a position   purchasing a put will cost you money up front   leveraging typically means entering a transaction that gives you extra money now that you can use to buy other things   if you meant to sell a put that will make money up front but there is no possibility of making money later   best case scenario the put is not exercised   the other use of the term leverage refers to purchasing an asset that proportionally goes up faster than the value of the underlying   for example a call option if you purchase a put you are buying downside protection which is kind of the opposite of leverage   notice that for an american put you will most likely be better off selling the put when the price of the underlying falls than exercising it   that way you make the money you would have made by exercising plus whatever optional value the put still contains   that is true unless the time value of money is greater than the optional insurance value   since the time value of money is currently exceptionally low this is unlikely   anyway if you sell the option instead of exercising you do n't need to own any shares at all   even if you do exercise you can just buy them on the market and sell right away so i would n't worry about what you happen to be holding the rules for what you can trade with a cash instead of a margin account vary by broker i think   you can usually buy puts and calls in a cash account but more advanced strategies such as writing options are prohibited   ask your broker or check their help pages to see what you have available to you

there are a few ways to look at this question assumptions per the original post 's assumptions this answer in other words if the owner paid the mortgage on its original schedule the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for $   200,000 of equity after 30   years   or the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for a $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years while the owner is paying down the mortgage the return on equity is the principal payment divided by the equity   the principal payment is the net rent minus non financing costs and interest so it is actually a profit the initial return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   210.70 monthly principal payment by the initial $   40,000 equity and converting from monthly return to annual return after 30 years the return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   810.70 monthly cash flow which is no longer reduced by mortgage payments by the $   200,000 equity after 30 years and converting from monthly return to annual return the cap rate is the same as the return on equity in the absence of debt   in this example   apr or   apy the return on equity declines from   apy initially to   apy after 30 years this is because the cap rate exceeds the note rate   apy vs.   apy and the leverage decreases from 5x to 1x the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the equity during the 30 years is   apy   per the original poster 's answer this is computed by taking the 30th root of the increase in equity   because the owner made no extra principal payments besides those already discussed the relevant amounts are the initial $   40,000 owner payment and the final $   200,000 owner equity     apy corresponds to a   apr the internal rate of return if the owner never sells can be computed by treating the deal as a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for an $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years   the internal rate of return irr is not a very useful number because it assumes that you can somehow reinvest the eventual dividends at the same rate   in this example the irr is   apr or   apy   in this example the irr is calculated by finding an interest rate for which initial investment 1 + irr ^ number periods before dividends start = periodic dividend irr growth rate of dividend   for example $   40,000 = $   810.70 0 = $   i then converted the   monthly irr to an annual irr the deal can be thought of as a return on equity plus a return on paying down the mortgage when computing the return from paying down the mortgage the initial equity is irrelevant   it does not matter whether you start with a $ 160,000 mortgage on a $   160,000 property a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   200,000 property or a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   1,000,000 property   all that matters is the note rate on the mortgage which is the applicable compound interest rate the return on paying down the mortgage equals the note rate of the mortgage   for a 4.5 note rate this works out to a annual percentage yield apy you can confirm this by looking at your amortization schedule   suppose you have a $   160,000 mortgage with a fixed 4.5 apr note rate for 360 months   your monthly payment is $   810.70   in the first month $   600 goes toward interest and $   210.70 reduces the principal   in other words the $   210.70 principal payment eliminated the need for a $ 810.70 payment 30 years later   notice that $ 210.70 1 + = $ 210.70 = $ 210.70 = $ which is within rounding error of $   810.70 the interest rate is   per month which is an apr of 4.5 and an apy of

mostly when an equity 's price rises its statistical and implied volatilities fall and vice versa the reason why is a mathematical phenomenon mixed with the reality that a falling asset price will soon not exist skewing the results with survivorship bias    since volatility is standard deviation of price indexes a security that changes in price by the same amount every day will have lower volatility so a rising price will have lower implied volatility because its mostly experiencing positive daily price change while a recently falling price will have higher volatility because factored together with the positive price changes the negative price changes will widen the standard deviation of the securities price index quantitatively any change in or out of one 's favor is a risk because change is uncertain and any uncertainty is a risk this quantitative interpretation while valid runs almost totally counter to the value opinion that a lower price relative to value is a lower risk than a higher price relative to value but both have their place in time over long time periods it 's best to use the value interpretation quantitative for shorter   using the opposite has hastily destroyed many a fund manager

how is it possible that long term treasury bonds which the government has never defaulted on can hold more risk as an etf then the stock market index the risk from long term bonds is n't that the government defaults but that interest rates go up before you get paid so investors want bonds issued more recently at higher interest rates rather than your older bonds that pay at a lower rate so the price for your bonds goes down this is usually caused by higher inflation rates which reduce the value of the interest that you will be paid do you assume more risk investing in bond etfs than you would investing in individual bonds if you are choosing the right etfs there should be a lower amount of risk because the etfs are taking care of the difficult work of buying a variety of bonds   are bond etfs an appropriate investment vehicle for risk diversification yes if you are investing in bonds exchange traded funds are an appropriate way to buy them the markets for etfs are usually very liquid

you are on the right path but this is actually an equivalent annual cost problem you have to take it a step further and divide the npv by the annuity factor   you need to calculate the annuity factor and divide the investment by that amount     annuity factor = /r    we know the annual cost of the the current forklift = $ 5k. we need to figure out the equivalent annual cost of the new forklift   investment annuity factor + annual cost =    therefore $ 20 k 1 ^ 10 0.04 = $ + annual maintenance = $ therefore it makes sense to replace the old machine

machine learning is definitely applied to trading but i have not tried it myself for now i 've been focused on figuring out the platforms and how they work i have not been trying out other strategies besides a strategy the most machine learning like application i 've attempted was cross validation by walk forward analysis i 'm publishing that post on monday   i know nothing about other than it 's used for deep learning and that it does n't work on windows and thus would not work on my more powerful gaming computer and like i said above i have not been exploring machine learning right now neural networks are on my radar on the list of things i need to read but there was a topic on r algotrading recently where most users said that deep learning has not demonstrated better performance than more traditional ml techniques and looks like a fad i want to convince myself of that first though   i 'm glad you enjoyed the post and my site thank you

to answer the investment aspect takes a bit of math first solar numbers   this represents the average sun hours per day for a given area you can see the range from 4 to 6 or hrs to about hrs of sun per year depending on location i believe electricity also has a range of cost but 15 cents per kwh is a good average   so a panel will produce as much as $ per year of electricity in a high sun hrs area but only $ in a lower sun hrs area   if we agree to ignore the government subsidies and look for the stable price unaffected by outside influence an installed price of even $ 2500 would produce a return of 13 and a reasonable full payback over an 8 year period   i call this installed price a tipping point the price where this purchase provides a decent return some would accept a lower return and therefore a higher price as duff points out this should be treated as the post rebate tax credit price those help to push the price below this point at the price point where the energy cost per panel is below the government intervention may be unnecessary the power companies may find consumer owned panels are the cheapest way to clip the peak consumption which tends to be the most expensive power demand one can take the numbers and cost of local power to produce a grid showing the return for a panel in $ $ at this point the cost of money kick in the present value of $ is far higher today than if short term rates were say 8   once panels drop to where they are compelling for the higher return areas i 'd expect volume to drive continued improvements in cost and better economies of scale initially the need for storage is n't there as the infrastructure is in place to drive your meter backwards if you produce more than you use the peek sun coincides with peek demand and the electric companies are happy to have your demand go negative during those times   update the conversation with duff led me to research demand charge a bit more you see the utility company has to have equipment to generate the peak demand usually occurring in the early afternoon say as the sun is brightest and ac use in particular highest i found that austin energy has a pdf describing the fee for this simply put the last kw of demand will cost you $ in summer months and $ in winter this adds to $ that a panel might save the owner even if one does capture the full power at peak every month $ 100 is still non trivial this factor alone justifies $ 1000 worth of panel cost and as duff points out the government may find it cheaper to use this method to clip peak demand than by funding bigger power generators   to summarize the question is n't so much are they worth it as what is a panel worth a function of annual savings and time value of money the ever decreasing installed cost for a given system makes solar an inevitable part of the future power technology i am not a green tree hugging guy but i do like to breathe fresh air as much as anyone i 'm happy with whatever role solar plays in cutting down pollution

i expect the company wanted to pay you for a product on a purchase order rather than as   a contract laborer whatever would they be willing to re issue the check to you as a sole proprietor of a business named abc consulting or anything like that you can register your sole proprietor business with the state using a doing business as dba or fictitious name and then open the bank account for your business using the check provided by the customer as the first deposit there is likely a smaller registration fee for the dba if they wo n't re issue the check and you have to go the llc route up $ 125 doing odd jobs or borrowing from a friend or parents seriously anyone can earn that amount of money in a week or two besides the filing fee for the llc your bank may require you to provide an operating agreement which is not required by the state the operating agreement can be simple or more complex if you have a partner even if it 's a spouse if you do have a partner it is essential to have such an agreement because it would specify the responsibilities and benefits allocated to each partner particularly in the event of equity distributions taking money out of the business or liquidating and ending the llc there are websites that will provide you a boilerplate form for operating agreements but if your business is anything more than just single member llc you should pay an attorney to draw one up for you so the wording is right it 's a safeguard against potential future lawsuits and while we 're at it do n't forget to obtain a ein equivalent to a ssn from the irs for your llc there 's no cost but you 'll have to have it to file taxes as a business for every year the llc exists and has income good luck

now you 're just splitting hairs on definition   the definition of globalism and by extension globalist differs based on source and context     other possible definitions   the attitude or policy of placing the interests of the entire world above those of individual nations   globalism is a group of ideologies that advocate the concept of globalization it tends to advocate for such policies as increases in immigration and global governance economically globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to marxist it is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries such as the united states   political globalization is when governmental action takes place on a global level where responsibilities such as the welfare of citizens and economic growth are acted upon by an international political body   globalism in a political discourse is opposed to nationalism and has very little to do with business owning interest in other nations other than the repercussions vis a vis tariffs and taxes

uh you want to lease a car through a dealer that is the worst possible way to obtain a car dealers love leases because it allows them to sell a car for an price and to hide additional fees it 's the most profitable kind of sale for them the best option would be to buy a used car off of craigslist or ebay then sell it again the same way when you leave if you sell the car for what you paid then you get the car for a year for free if you are determined to go through with the expensive risky and annoying plan of leasing a car then you should use a leasing agent i recommend reading some car buying guides before going out into the wilderness with the tigers and bears comment on leasing tricks do n't get tricked by the interest rate game the whole interest thing is just a distraction to trick you into think you are getting some kind of reasonable deal the leasing company makes most of their money from fees for example if you get into an accident it is a big payday for them the average person thinks they will never get into an accident but the reality is that most people get into an accident sooner or later they also collect big penalties for maintenance failures forget to change the oil boom money forget to comply with manufacture recall boom more money forget to do the annual service boom more money scratch the car boom more money the original car are missing boom you just paid $ 400 for a set of that cost the leasing company $ 25 bucks the leasing company is counting on the fact that 99 of people will not maintain the car correctly or will damage it in some way they also usually have all kinds of other bogus fees so called walk away fees disposition fees initiation fees whatever they think they can get away with the whole system is calculated to screw you

more shares mean less volatility because it takes a larger number of trades a larger number of shares per trade or a combination of both to raise or lower the stock price institutional investors mutual funds pensions hedge funds other investment firms etc are the sorts of organizations with the large amounts of money needed to move a stock price one way or the other   but the more floating shares there are in a company the harder it is for one or two firms to move a stock price   a company with fewer floating shares would n't require as many trades or as many shares per trade to see wider swings in price when it comes to stock price insider trading is n't the same as manipulation   in the surprisingly few cases of insider trading that are prosecuted it tends to be an individual or small group with early access to information that the broader market does n't have being able to buy or sell ahead of the broader market   their individual sales are seldom if ever enough to noticeably move a stock price   they 're locking in profit or limiting a loss   manipulation might but does n't always insider trading if misinformation or truth is released for the purpose of creating a situation that can be profited from via a trade or trades

in some sense the share repurchasing program is better if the company does not foresee the same profit levels down the road   paying a dividend for several years and then suddenly not paying or reducing a dividend is viewed as a slap in the face by investors   executing a share repurchase program one year and then not the next is not viewed as negatively from an investor 's standpoint i would say a dividend is preferred over a share repurchase program for a similar reason   typically companies that pay a dividend have been doing so for quite some time and even increasing it over time as the company increases profits   so it can be assumed that if a company starts paying a dividend it will do so for the long run

savings accounts have lower fees if you do n't anticipate doing many transactions per month e.g. three or fewer withdrawals then i would suggest a savings account rather than a checking account a joint account that requires both account holder signatures to make withdrawals will probably require both account holders signature endorsements in order to make deposits for example if you are issued a tax refund by the u.s. treasury or any check that is payable to both parties you will only be able to deposit that check in a joint account that has both persons as there can be complications due to multi party account ownership if cashing versus depositing a joint check and account tax id number when you open the account you will need to specify what your wishes are regarding whether both parties or either party can make deposits and withdrawals also at least one party will need to be present with appropriate identification probably tax id or social security number when opening the account   if the account has three or more owners you might be required to open a business or commercial account rather than a consumer account this would be due to the extra expense of administering an account with more than two after the questioner specified interest north carolina in the comments i found that the north carolina general banking statutes have specific rules for joint accounts any two or more persons may establish a deposit account    the deposit account and any balance shall be as joint tenants    unless the persons establishing the account have agreed with the bank    that withdrawals require more than one signature payment by the bank    to or on the order of either person on the account the bank 's obligation i looked for different banks in north carolina i found joint account terms similar to this in pdf file format everywhere joint account if an item is drawn so that it is unclear whether one payee ’s    endorsement or two is required only one endorsement will be     required and the bank shall not be liable for any loss incurred by the    maker as a result of there being only one endorsement also   joint accounts are owned by you individually or jointly with others    all of the funds in a joint account may be used to repay the debts of    any co owner whether they are owed individually by a co owner    jointly with other co owners or jointly with other persons or    entities having no interest in your account you will need to tell the bank specifically what permissions you want for your joint account as it is between you and your bank in north carolina

the most likely reason for this is that the relocation company wants to have a guaranteed sale so as to get a new mortgage in the new location   understand that the relocation company generally works for a prospective employer   so they are trying to make the process as painless as possible for the homeowner who is probably getting hired as a professional either a manager or someone like an engineer or accountant    if the sale is guaranteed to go through regardless of any problems then it is easy for them to arrange a new mortgage   in fact they may bridge the gap by securing the initial financing and making the downpayment then use the payout from the house you are buying to buy out their position   that puts them on the hook for a bunch of money a downpayment on a house while they 're waiting on the house you 're purchasing to close    this does not necessarily mean that there is anything wrong with the house   the relocation company would only know about something wrong if the owner had disclosed it   they do n't really care about the house they 're selling   their job is to make the transition easy   with a relocation company it is more likely that they are simply in a hurry and want to avoid a busted purchase   if this sale fails to go through for any reason they have to start over   that could make the employment change fall through    this is a variation of a no contingencies sale   sellers like no contingencies sales because they are easier   buyers dislike them because their protections are weaker   but some buyers will offer them because they get better prices that way   in particular house flippers will do this frequently so as to get the house for less money than they might otherwise pay   this is better than a pure no contingencies sale as they are agreeing to the repairs    this is a reasonable excuse to not proceed with the transaction   if this makes you so uncomfortable that you 'd rather continue looking that 's fine   however it also gives you a bit of leverage as it means that they are motivated to close this transaction quickly   you can consider any of the following    or you can do some combination of those or something else entirely that makes you fell more secure   if you do decide to move forward with any version of this provision get a real estate lawyer to draft the agreement   also insist on disclosure of any previous failed sales and the reason for the failure before signing the agreement   the lawyer can make that request in such a way as to get a truthful response    and again in case you missed it when i said this earlier   you can say no and simply refuse to move forward with such a provision   you may not get the house but you 'll save a certain amount of worry   if you do move forward you should be sure that you are getting a good deal   they 're asking for special provisions they should bear the cost of that   either your current deal is already good and it may be or you should make them adjust until it is

i think everyone else answered before you added the info about your car loan in your comment while it makes sense to pay off loans with the highest interest rate first keep in mind that in most cases you can deduct mortgage interest from your taxable income so the after tax rate of interest that you 're paying on your 8.6 second mortgage will be less than your 7 car loan assuming that your tax bracket is more than 18 federal and state combined if you plan to use your funds to pay down debt definitely attack the car loan first

both credit card and mortgage work on same principle the interest is calculated on the remaining balance   as the balance reduces the interest reduces the mortgage schedule is calculated with the assumption that you would be paying a certain amount over a period of years however if you pay more then the balance becomes less and hence the subsequent interest also reduces this means you would pay the loan faster and also pay less then forecasted the other type of loan typically personal loans auto loans in older days worked on fixed schedule this means that you need to pay principal + pre determined interest this is then broken into equal monthly installment however in such a schedule even if you pay a amount in between the total amount you need to pay remains same only the tenor reduces

if you want to see a more academic version of this look up weighted average cost of capital wacc    it 's a formula that tells you how much it costs for a company to raise $ 1 of capital whether it be through issuing bonds or stocks    one thing you learn is that there are times that if you take on loans even if you do n't need it you can raise shareholder value and therefore the total company the thought process is as it states in the article above that a company can issue debt for cheaper than issue shares and it will have extra cash which it can use to get a better return than its net effective interest rate    i tried to give an example but i only ended up what it says in the article anyhow look up wacc and you 'll understand the fundamentals

you can spend the money quite quickly the problem is that if there is something wrong with the check the bank will ask you for the money back if the check is from a trusted source a trusted friend a business with good reputation etc that 's fine if the money is from an source make sure that having to pay back the money does n't get you into trouble since most people are honest this is fine for a small amount but if it 's more than you can afford to pay back do n't spend it   a simple scam is that people send you checks by mistake the check is for the wrong amount say $ instead of $ 190 and they ask you to send the difference back so you put $ into your account send them $ 720 and six weeks later your bank asks for their $ back if someone pays you too much on a check and asks you to pay them the difference you know it is a scam

ed saw your comment thank you the short answer a rough simplification seems to be that you pay pa income tax for income made in pa you pay il income tax for income made in il not income made across both states and you make sure the il amount paid is correct via a credit calculated on schedule cr it looks to me bear with me i am no expert on tax law in il pa or in general so consult a professional for good advice like you basically do this on schedule cr it looks like there may be some more pertinent info on publication 111 so that may potentially change the math a bit too this check is 2014 income during which you are a resident of il it 's income from a pa employer you must file a tax return in pa regardless since you earned income in pa did your former employer withhold pa income taxes on this particular paycheck i 'm not seeing where it says you should not include tax withheld could you please point that out perhaps they mean you should only include tax actually considered due on the pa tax return from il 's schedule cr instructions what is the purpose of schedule cr    schedule cr credit for tax paid to other states allows you to    take a credit for income taxes you paid to other states on income    you received while a resident of illinois you are allowed this credit    only if you filed a required tax return with the other state you must    use information from the tax return you filed with the other state to    complete schedule cr        what taxes qualify for the credit    taxes that qualify for the credit are income taxes you paid to another    state of the united states

the advice is always to not get a big refund from the irs because that is giving them an interest free loan you actually have an opportunity to get an interest free loan from them   when you file your taxes for 2013 note how much you paid in taxes not the check you had to send in with your tax form or the refund you received but the total amount in taxes you paid multiply that amount by 1.1 or 110 for example $ 8,000 1.10 = $ when you get your paychecks in 2014 you goal is to make sure that your federal taxes not state social security or medicare taken from your paycheck will get you over that number $ or a paycheck keep in mind that the later you start the more each check needs to be you will owe them a big check in april 2015 but because of the 110 rule you will not owe interest penalties or have to deal with quarterly taxes the 110 rule you from these if you end them 110 as much a you paid in taxes the previous year note that no matter how you pay your taxes for 2014 big check now extra per paycheck or minimum now you will have to watch your withholding during 2015 because the 110 rule wo n't protect you

the broker that is issuing the moneys after vesting is more than likely deducting a notional amount of tax and ni based on uk income tax laws if you are not a uk resident then you should pay income tax on those stock options based on your own tax residency best thing to do is speak directly with the broker to explain the situation ask them to not deduct anything from your stock options but keep in mind that you will need to declare these earnings yourself and pay the correct rate of tax from my own personal experience the uk employer more than likely receives the net value after the notional tax and ni have been deducted and in usual circumstances create a tax liability on your payslip if you were working and had earnings if of course this deduction is being made by the employer then you can simply ask them to correct this most uk payroll software will automatically deduct tax and ni for payments after leaving unless manually so they probably are n't aware if it is them doing so

first i 'm really sorry to hear about your mother my wife was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer so i know that there is a possibility that your mind is in survival mode trying to preserve as much as you can in the way of things that you can effect that 's how i 've been feeling recently having a loved one with cancer is really tough because there is absolutely positively nothing tangible that you can do to change the fact that they have cancer you will have to ask yourself some questions how important is it that your mom can stay in her house moving could add some unneeded stress how may years have you been contributing to your 401k if you have 30 years left you could have enough time to recover some of your losses from reducing the amount of money you have given up for your mom will your mom be able to pay you back for paying the taxes over time or would this be a gift have her doctors told her that she has n months left what is the next step after you are able to pay her taxes and save the house   someone close to me recently told me that there is no point in trying to save for someone for the future if you ca n't sustain them until they get to that future what will happen to your mom if she loses her house will it make it easier or harder for her to recover if she can stay to paraphrase someone famous you ca n't take a loan out for your retirement but you could take a loan out for this event at any rate good luck my thoughts are with you and your mother

yes it is under some circumstances basically a piece of paper saying john doe borrowed josh shoe 100 usd is not enough usually the paper should include this is the case for czech republic i believe it 's similar for other countries as well remember that without the repair date you have very complicated position forcing the person to give you the money back as well there 's a withdrawal of rights i.e. after x years after the repair date you can not force the person to give you the money you have to send the case to the court in some period after the repair date if you do n't have the money yet

under what conditions did you move my favourite method of judging prices objectively comes from concepts written in your money or your life by joe essentially it normalizes money spent by making you figure out how much an item costs with respect to the number of hours you needed to work to afford it i prefer that method versus comparing with others since it is objective for yourself and looks beyond just the bare prices

the roofing situation is clear   visas distort the roofing labor market by reducing prevailing wages with lower paid immigrant labor   this allows companies to offer products at reduced prices   it would be unrealistic to try and run a business with local us born labor that 's higher priced   if your competitors can hire low priced foreigners you need to do it too unless you can somehow find locals at the same price quality productivity   if the labor supply was cut off then it 's likely that no roofing companies could find labor for $   they 'd have to raise wages take fewer jobs or go out of business   this would raise prices     customers would n't be happy but they 'd pay the price because they need roof work done   all vendors prices would go up equally   this process may take time   there 's a shortage   prices go up   wages go up   jobs become more desirable   more workers get trained in the field increasing the supply of labor   this occurs until the labor supply is back in balance   on a side note this particular business owner sounds like they need better marketing   if prospects want low priced work they 're going to get low quality results   if she wants to sell a premium roofing product she needs to differentiate it from everyone else   no customer spends more money just to support someone else 's employees   if she can only get penny pinching customers she needs to do penny pinching work

irr is not subjective this is a response to to his remark that irr is subjective not that i feel a need to defend my position but rather i 'm going to explain his   my company offered stock at a 15 discount we would have money withheld from pay and twice per year buy at that discount coworkers said it was a 15 gain i offered some math i started by saying that 100/85 was 17.6 and that was in fact the gain but the funds were held by the company for an average of 3 months not 6 so that gain occurred in 3 months and i did the math ^ 4 and resulted in annual return this is irr   it 's not that it 's subjective but it assumes the funds continue to be invested fully during the time in our case the was real in one sense yet no one doubled their money in just over a year   was the 91 useless not quite it simply meant to me that coworkers who did n't participate were overlooking the fact that if they borrowed money at a reasonable rate they 'd exceed that rate especially for the fact that credit lines are charged day to day even if they borrowed that money on a credit card they 'd come out ahead   irr is a metric it has no emotion no personality no goals it 's a number we can calculate it 's up to you to use it correctly

to keep it simple i will keep the focus between a trad ira and a normal taxable account roth 's and 401(k add more complications that make another problem   i will also assume based on the question that you are n't able to deduct the ira contributions also a roth is better in every way than a non deductible trad ira so the backdoor roth mentioned in other answers is probably the way to go and this is more of an academic exercise   ok so why bother with the ira if you 're taxed anyway   because you are n't taxed as you go with a normal non tax advantaged account you have to pay taxes every year on any realized capital gains and dividends including fund distributions because of the compounding nature of savings delaying paying taxes is in your best interest   simple example   taxable account ira account now this is a very simplified example if you 're more tax conscious i.e. more buy and holding you can delay paying some of the long term cap gains in the taxable account but any short term cap gains including distributions from the underlying funds will be at your marginal income tax rate   a few other observations edit i set up a spreadsheet where each year i deposited $ 1000 for 35 years each year the balance in the ira account grows by 5 but the taxable only by 0.15 = 4.25 due to the effect of taxes at the end of 35 years my simulation assumes you pay 15 on all the gains in the ira which would likely not be the case but easier than forecasting through retirement and demonstrates what i 'm trying to show here 's plot showing the balance in the various accounts the blue is the ira account orange the taxable account and grey is the effective balance of the ira after paying taxes on the gains    and here 's a plot of the advantage of the ira after paying taxes on the gains vs the taxable account   whether that 's worth it to you or anyone depends on some the assumptions in the simulation especially effective tax rates and growth rates as well as any personal issues some people may be less likely to raid an ira account for example than a normal account conversely if you have a project coming up you may need something a bit more liquid than an ira

not to pick your words apart but i 'm used to the word laddering as used with cds or bonds where one buys a new say 7 year duration each year with old money coming due and in effect is always earning the longer term rate while still having new funds available each year   so the article you link suggests that there 's money to be saved by not taking a long term policy on all the insurance you buy they split $ 250 k 30 year $ 1 m 20 year the money saved by going short on the bigger policy is they say $ 11k.   it 's an interesting idea will you use the $ 11 k saved to buy a new $ 1 m 10 year policy in 20 years or will you not need the insurance there are situations where insurance needs drop e.g. 20 years into my marriage college fully funded as are retirement accounts i am semi retired and if i passed there 's enough money there are also situations where the need runs longer the concept in the article works for the former type of circumstance

if bank b has a transfer limit set you bet that there is a nice reason for that either risk of fraud liability client preferences credit scoring etc etc for a bank the cost of denying something 1 is way lower than the potential damages and liabilities of allowing something to go through   regarding your concerns for the ach here is the summarized transaction source an whether that ’s an individual a corporation or another initiates either a direct deposit or direct payment transaction using the ach network ach transactions can be either debit or credit payments and commonly include direct deposit of payroll government and social security benefits mortgage and bill payments online banking payments person to person p2p and business to business b2b payments to name a few instead of using paper checks ach entries are entered and transmitted electronically making transactions quicker safer and easier   the originating depository financial institution odfi enters the ach entry at the request of the originator   the odfi aggregates payments from customers and them in batches at regular predetermined intervals to an ach operator   ach operators two central clearing facilities the federal reserve or the clearing house receive batches of ach entries from the odfi   the ach transactions are sorted and made available by the ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi   the receiver ’s account is debited or credited by the rdfi according to the type of ach entry individuals businesses and other entities can all be receivers   each ach credit transaction settles in one to two business days and each debit transaction settles in just one business day as per the rules   take heed of this like   the originator initiates a direct deposit payment transaction in your scenario the originator would be b. but since the transaction amount is higher than the limit b would not even initiate the ach transaction the request would be denied so the transaction would look like this 1 usually this cost comes down to just the processing costs of the denied transaction and it is rather fail fast like for the other parties involved it may have additional costs missed deadlines penalties for not fulfilling an obligation fines etc but for the bank that is irrelevant

there are two types of 529 programs   one where you put money aside each month the one offered by your state may give you a tax break on you deposits you can pick the one from any state if you like their options better during the next 18 years the focus the investment changes from risky to less risky to no risk this happens automatically the money can be used for tuition room board books fees the 2nd type of 529 is also offered by a state but it is geared for a big lump sum payment when the child is young this will cover full tuition and fees not room and board or books at a state school the deal is not as great if they child wants to go out of state or you move or they want to go to a private school you do n't lose everything but you will have to make up the shortfall at the last minute there are provisions for scholarship money if you kid goes to west point you have n't wasted the money in the 529 the money in either plan is ignored while calculating financial aid other options such as the coverdell education savings account also exist but they do n't have the options and state tax breaks accounts in the child 's name can impact the amount of financial aid offered plus they could decide to spend the money on a car the automatic investment shift for most of the state 529 plans does cover your question of how much risk to take there are also ways to transfer the money to other siblings if one decides not to go to college keep in mind that the funds do n't have to be spent as soon as they turn 18 they can wait a few years before enrolling in college

like dheer said the demand for shorter term money is greater than for longer term money precisely because the banks do n't want to have to pay big interest rates for long periods banks borrow short term and lend long term so they take money from you for one year and lend it away as a 20 year mortgage after a year they take money for another year since short term rates tend to be higher than longer term rates they make money off the spread or the different between the rate they lend and the rate they borrow in this scenario banks should pay higher for longer term deposits but overall banks realize that interest rates will go up and down and they do n't want to lock the up for a longer term since banks believe that rates will come down in the 1 2 year period they offer good rates only till the 1 year period and longer term deposits by offering lower rates if you look at the interbank or money markets trading of very short term bulk money shows that for the 10 15 day periods the interest rates being offered are 10 or so while for one year it 's just 9.5 the market believes that interest rates will go down in the one year time frame but you never really know since this is just a bunch of people that believe so eventually if rates continue to go up the demand at the longer term will also go up because it will become obvious that the rate pressure continues to be strong   if you do want higher rates for the long term check out state bank of india bonds that are currently trading on the nse you can buy them if you have a brokerage account they are just about as safe as sbi fixed deposits and the rate being offered is around for a 10 15 year term hope that helps

it depends where you are going to live and how you are going to pay for your new accommodation if you are moving within the uk and intend to buy another house you run into the problem that you will find it hard to get a second mortgage if you rent out the house in kent you will probably have to change the mortgage basis on it to a mortgage that allows for letting normal residential mortgages exclude that entirely which would allow you to take out a residential mortgage it depends how much equity you have in the house if most of the value of the house is mortgaged then you 'll 1 find it hard to re mortgage on a commercial mortgage 2 may find it hard to cover the costs by letting and 3 are very sensitive to house prices falling also bear in mind that for the past three months in a row house prices in the uk have mostly either stagnated or fallen so you can not guarantee any increase in value of the house in kent what i 'm saying is there is no crystal ball that will tell you what 's financially the best thing to do talk to estate agents find out how much the house would sell for how much it would rent for talk to your mortgage lender and find out if they will let you rent it out talk to other mortgage lenders and find out how much a commercial mortgage would cost do the sums find out if renting the house would cover the costs in which case you can gamble on the housing market continuing to rise do n't rely on house prices continuing to rise as they have done before certainly where i live due to the number of new houses being built and other economic issues house prices have fallen over the past few months and may well continue to fall as more and more new houses come on the market

most of the bankruptcy is due to taking or building over a period of time a loan that one can not service if the interest rates rise then the amount of money to repay the loan increases when one does nt pay the revised amount and keeps paying less the over all debt keeps shooting through the roof a lower interest rate means that one can continue to pay the same amount and few missed payments do not cause as much as damage as it does when the rates are high

when i read that part of his post it reminded me more of credit companies rather than banks people default on credit all the time i have no idea what the regulations are on the amount of credit that a company can issue though   and this is sort of part of what actually happened in the beginning of the economic crunch a bunch of people began to trade for credit debt against what they thought the future value of their house or other real estate would be after a while people stopped being able to afford property at its future value so they stopped buying it when people then tried to sell their property for the future value that they had borrowed against they could n't so they could n't pay back their debt   because real estate had become a popular investment vehicle for the middle class this was able to reach a kind of critical mass and shortly afterward the effects back into the credit market which also had its own crunch a bunch of credit just disappeared overnight because so many people had assumed a level of debt that they could not actually fulfill their promises on once the future value of their home became completely imaginary

if you are trying to invest in closely held private companies things that do n't trade on the stock market you will run into a variety of regulatory problems for various reasons most private companies only raise funds with accredited investors to be an accredited investor you basically have to have $ 1,000,000 in net worth not including your primary residence or you have to make over $ 200,000 a year for the last two years and expect to keep making that much this is a class distinction the federal government created you will see different but similar wealth and investment classes worldwide so your best most organized opportunities are left out unless you do qualify as an accredited investor there are tons of other companies things you will find locally that will let you invest in their smaller time operations think like a local yoga studio looking for $ 20,000 and willing to split the profits with you but the problem here is lack of accountability where partners skip town or just stop answering your calls and the legal remedies cost you more than your claim that being said there are people that provide capital to smaller publicly traded companies on the bulletin boards and pink sheets they have opportunities do much better than the actual stock market investors in these companies because you can negotiate contracts that let you cash out in their inevitable financing death with very little risk to you you can do these things as an individual or as a holding company but the holding company will limit your liability to the amount your holding company invested instead of your personal assets in case your financing starts to incur liability with the company

it comes down to the resolution you want to have on your personal finances   a package like gnucash allows you to easily answer questions like exactly how much do i spend on interest per month year decade   same with pretty much any other expense liability or asset you have whether it be taxes utilities your home equity or your net worth   the other tools you mention are nice and certainly convenient but they tend to lump things together in broad strokes and omit many categories altogether taxes   ultimately by having such a fine grained accounting tool you can target small or large things to better budget your money    another thing a package like gnucash provides is a single private place to consolidate all of your finances   this is nice for things like net worth and asset accounts that you might not want to give a company access to finally gnucash in particular helps normal people think like accountants   rather than lump everything into income and expenses once you start using gnucash you 'll start thinking in terms of equity liabilities net worth and assets in addition to income and expenses   this gives me a much more accurate view of my finances and helps me better target areas for improvement   in short it helps me to see the broader picture which helps me to keep my eye on the prize which of course is to not have to worry about money at all

log returns are very commonly used in financial maths especially quantitative finance   the important property is that they 're around 0 with respect to addition this property makes it possible to talk about an average return for instance if a stock goes down 20 over a period of time it has to gain 25 to be back where you started   for the log return on the other hand the numbers are down over a period of time and up to get you back to square 1 in this sense you can simply take an arithmetic average and it makes sense   you can freely add up or subtract values on the log return scale like log interest rates or log inflation rates   whereas the arithmetic mean of non log returns is simply meaningless a stock with returns -3 and + 3 would have 0 on average when in fact the stock has declined in price the correct approach on direct price returns would be to take a different mean e.g. geometric to get a decent average   and yet it will be hard to incorporate other information like subtracting the risk free rate or the inflation rate to get rate adjusted average returns in short log returns are easier to handle esp in bulk but non log returns are easier to comprehend imagine as a number of their own

if this matters to you a lot i agree you should leave my primary bank account raised chequing account and transaction fees i left when i was closing my account the teller asked for the reason they needed to fill out a form and i explained it was the monthly fees eventually if a bank gets enough of these they will change i want to get back those features for the same price it cost when i opened it they are in their rights to cancel features or raise prices just as you are in your rights to withdraw if they do n't give you a deal the reason why i mention this is that this approach is comical in some instances a grocery store may raise the price of carrots typically you either deal with it or change stores prices rise occasionally thus they will lose a lot of money from my savings from my understanding a bank makes a large chunk of their money from fees very little is from the floating kitty they can have because of your savings if you have an investment account with your bank not recommended or your mortgage that would matter more i 've had friends who have left banks and moved their mortgages because of the bank not giving them a better rate does the manager have any pressure into keeping the account to the point of giving away free products to keep the or they do n't really care depends i 've probably say no one data point is an anecdote it is expected in a client base of thousands that a few will leave for seemingly random reasons only if mass amounts of clients leave or complain will the manager or company care a note some banks waive monthly account or service fees if you keep a minimal account balance i have one friend who keeps x thousand in his bank account to save the account fee he budgets a month ahead of time and savings account rates are 0 so this costs him nothing

a central bank typically introduces new money into the system by printing new money to purchase items from member banks   the central bank can purchase whatever it chooses   it typically purchases government bonds but the federal reserve purchased mortgage backed securities mbs during the 2008 panic since the fed was the only one willing to pay full price for mbs after the crash of 2008 the bank upon receipt of the new money can loan the money out   a minimum reserve ratio specifies how much money the bank has to keep on hand   a reserve ratio of 10 means the bank must have $ 10 for every $ 100 in loans as an example let 's say the fed prints up some new money to purchase some office desks from a member bank   it prints $ 10,000 to purchase some desks   the bank receives $ 10,000   it can create up to $ 100,000 in loans without exceeding the 10 minimum reserve ratio requirement    how would it do so   a customer would come to the bank asking for a $ 100,000 loan   the bank would create an account for the customer and credit $ 100,000 to the customer 's account   there is a problem however   the customer borrowed the money to buy a boat so the customer writes a check for $ 100,000 to the boat company   the boat company attempts to deposit the $ 100,000 check into the boat company 's bank   the boat company 's bank will ask the originating bank for $ 100,000 in cash   the originating bank only has $ 10,000 in cash on hand so this demand will immediately bankrupt the originating bank so what actually happens   the originating bank actually only loans out reserves 1 minimum reserve ratio so it can meet demands for the loans it originates    in our example the bank that received the initial $ 10,000 from the fed will only loan out $ 10,000 1 0.1 = $ 9,000   this allows the bank to cover checks written by the person who borrowed the $ 9,000   the reserve ratio for the bank is now $ which is 11 and is over the minimum reserve requirement   the borrower makes a purchase with the borrowed $ 9,000 and the seller deposits the $ 9,000 in his bank   the bank that receives that $ 9,000 now has an additional $ 9,000 in reserves which it will use to create loans of $ 9,000 1 0.1 = $    this continual fractional reserve money creation process will continue across the entire banking system resulting in $ 100,000 of new money created from $ 10,000 this process is explained very well here

brendan the short answer is no there is no need to get into any other funds for all intents and purposes the s&p 500 is the stock market the news media may quote the dow when the market reaches new highs or crashes but all of the dow 30 stocks are included in the s&p 500   the s&p is also weighted which means that it owns in higher proportion the big blue chip stocks more than the smaller less known companies to explain the top 10 holdings in the s&p represent 18 of the total index while the bottom 10 only represent 0.17 less than 1 percent they do have an equal weighted s&p in which all 500 companies represent only of the index and that is technically even more diversified but in actuality it makes it more volatile because it has a higher concentration of those smaller less known companies so it will tend to perform better during up markets and worse during down markets as far as diversification into different asset classes or other countries that 's non sense the s&p 500 has companies in it that give you that exposure for example it includes companies that directly benefit from rising oil prices rising gold prices etc known as the energy and materials sector it also includes companies that own malls apartment complexes etc known as the real estate sector and as far as other countries most of the companies in the s&p are multi national companies meaning that they do business over seas in many parts of the world apple and facebook for example sell their products in many different countries so you do n't need to invest any of your money into an emerging market fund or an asia fund because most of our companies are already doing business in those parts of the world likewise you do n't need to specifically invest into a real estate or gold fund   as far as bonds go if you 're in your twenties you have no need for them either why because the s&p 500 also pays you dividends and these dividends grow over time so for example if microsoft increases its dividend payment by 100 over a ten year period all of the shares you buy today at a 2.5 yield will in 10 years have a higher 5 yield a bond on the other hand will never increase its yield over time if it pays out 4 that 's all it will ever pay you want to invest because you want to grow your money and if you want to invest passively the fastest way to do that is through index etfs like the $ spy $ ivv and $ rsp also look into the $ xiv it 's an inverse vix etf it moves 5x faster than the s&p in the same direction if you want to actively trade your money you can grow it even faster by getting into things like options highly volatile penny stocks shorting stocks and futures do n't get involved in fx or currency trading unless it through futures

yes there is it is called a one cancels the other order oco investopedia defines a oco order as definition of one cancels the other order oco a pair of orders stipulating that if one order is executed then the    other order is automatically canceled a one cancels the other order    oco combines a stop order with a limit order on an automated trading    platform when either the stop or limit level is reached and the order    executed the other order will be automatically canceled seasoned    traders use oco orders to mitigate risk i use cmc markets in australia and they allow free conditional and oco orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock see the place new order box below   once you have selected a stock to buy the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders the first condition is a place order if conditional order here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first   say the stock last traded at $ and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at $ 10.00 so you would place order if price is at or above $ 10.00 so if the next day the price moves up to $ 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market the next two conditional orders form part of the oco orders the second condition is a stop loss conditional order here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price it will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded so if you wanted to place your stop loss at $ 9.00 you would type in 9.00 in the box after if at or below and select if you want a limit or market order the third condition is a take profit conditional order this allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price say you wanted to take profits at 30 that is if the price reached $ so you would type in in the box after if at or above and again select if you want a limit or market order once you have bought the stock if the stop order gets triggered then the take profit order gets cancelled automatically if on the other hand the take profit order gets triggered then the stop loss order gets cancelled automatically these oco conditional orders can be placed either at the time you enter your buy order or after you have already bought the stock and they can be edited or deleted at any time the broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional and oco orders such as these

yes you should budget some amount of your emergency fund for healthcare expenses   how much you budget is really dependent on your particular anticipated costs   be aware that health insurance likely costs significantly more than your employer charges you for access to its plan since healthcare reform mandated guaranteed issue individual coverage you will have the ability to buy individual coverage for you and if applicable your family   when buying individual coverage you have essentially two choices your decision hinges on whether or not you 'd qualify for a premium subsidy   if your agi is below 400 of the poverty line you 'll be able to receive subsidized coverage at a state or federal health insurance exchange   if the subsidy is not meaningful to you or you would n't qualify you can buy an off exchange plan offered either directly through a carrier or an insurance agent some insurance agents are also licensed to sell exchange plans though it 's somewhat rare   in order to receive subsidized coverage you must buy through a state or federal exchange or an agent licensed to sell exchange products specifically if your employer was large enough to be required to offer its plan via cobra or you live in a state that extends the cobra requirement to smaller businesses you can choose that as well   bear in mind this option is likely to be expensive relative to individual plans   it 's becoming a less relevant solution with the advent of guaranteed issue individual coverage   cobra is not a special type of insurance it 's a mandate that your employer allow you to remain on its plan but pay the full gross premium plus an up to 2 10 for administrative fee popular there is no such thing as obamacare or aca coverage   obamacare the insurance market   the aca outlines certain minimum coverage requirements generally referred to as minimum essential coverage   while employers and plans are not required to meet all of these coverage requirements there is a penalty associated with non compliance   the single exception to this is grandfathered plans which can still sidestep a few of the requirements   the penalty is harsh enough that it 's not worth the cost of offering a non compliant plan whether you buy coverage through a state or federal exchange through an insurance agent or via your employer 's cobra program you will have aca coverage unless on the off chance your employer 's plan does n't check the minimum essential coverage box   so generally all plans available to you will have $ 0 preventive coverage pregnancy benefits cancer treatment benefits etc another thing to consider is your entire family does n't need to be on the same plan   if your family is healthy with the exception of one child you can purchase $ 0 deductible coverage for the one child and higher deductible more catastrophic plan for the remainder of your family in fact you could choose cobra for one child and purchase individual coverage for the remainder of the family   the things to consider when you face a lay off i tried to mitigate my use of all and always because there are some narrow exceptions to these requirements such as the hobby lobby decision allowing closely held organizations with highly religious owners the ability to remove certain benefits   understand that these exceptions are rare and not available to individual plans

one way is to think of a reit as a fully managed portfolio of real estate investments risks and returns are averaged across the real estate portfolio and managed by experts possibly industry leading experts   reits have a well documented track record you can research most individuals do not many individuals have learned a hard lesson or two while attempting to generate passive income with real estate conversely some people derive a great deal of satisfaction from owning real estate and have a true passion to do so   plus if you are expecting interest rates to raise and/or rate of inflation to increase in the next 30 years you may benefit from the financing aspects of the investment as well   there are some opportunities that seem to do better than the average reit a majority of the time but may not be desirable to you or fit into your budget for various reasons i 'm not sure what your level of experience knowledge or financial situation but for everyone considering there are many additional things to know about investment property compared to a primary residence   a good place to start with reits is the prospectus of one that interests you   research their holdings create a model or otherwise make a connection with the reit before clicking buy

if the person has prepared put your affairs in order then they will have a will and an executor and this executor will have a list of the life insurance policies and will contact the companies to arrange payouts to the beneficiaries it 's not really the beneficiary 's job to do that if the person has n't made a list of their policies but has a will and an executor then the executor can try things like looking at recently paid bills you 're sending $ 100 a month to friendly life insurance company bet it 's a life insurance policy or paperwork that is in the person 's home or their safety deposit boxes even if you do n't have the key to those boxes a copy of the will and the death certificate will get the box drilled out for you if you do n't know what bank they might have sd boxes at again your paperwork will get the manager to find out for you if there is a box at that particular branch so a day spent visiting branches can be fruitful something i know from personal experience with someone whose affairs were nowhere near in order generally you find out you 're a beneficiary of a will because the executor tells you i suppose it 's possible that a person might name you beneficiary of their life insurance without telling you or anyone else and without writing a will but it 's pretty unlikely if you 're worried i suggest you encourage your parents grandparents and other likely of you to write up some paperwork and keep it somewhere family is likely to find it not hidden inside a book on a or in the back of the wool

a 401(k is just a container like real world containers those that are usually made out of metal you can put almost anything you want in it signing up for your employer 's match is a great thing to do getting into the habit of saving a significant portion of your take home pay early in your career is even better doing so will put you ahead of lots of people by the time you approach retirement age even if you love your job that will give you options you otherwise would n't have there is no real reason why you ca n't start out by putting your retirement money in a short term money market fund within that 401(k by doing so you will only earn a pittance probably not even enough to keep up with inflation in today 's economic environment but at this point in your savings and investment career that does n't really matter much what really matters is getting into the habit of setting that money aside every single time you get paid and not thinking much of it and that 's a lot easier if you start out early especially at a time when you likely have received a significant net pay increase salaried job vs college student i know everyone says to get the best return you can but if you are just starting out and feel the need to be conservative then do n't be afraid to at least start out that way you can always rebalance into investment classes that have the potential for higher return and correspondingly higher volatility in a few years in the meantime you will have built a pretty nice capital that you can move into the stock market eventually the exact rate of return you get in the first decade matters a lot less than how much money you set aside regularly and that you keep contributing see for example your investment plan means nothing if you do n’t do this by matt no affiliation which illustrates how it takes 14 years for saving 5 at a consistent 10 return to beat saving 10 at a consistent 0 return so look through what 's being offered in terms of low risk investments within that 401(k go ahead and pick a money market fund or a bond fund if you want to start out easy if it gets you into the habit of saving and sticking with it then the overall return will beat the out of the return you would get from a good stock market fund if you stop contributing after a year or two especially but not only if you do pick an interest bearing investment do make sure to pick one that has as low fees as you can possibly find for what you want because otherwise the fees are going to eat a lot into your potential returns benefiting the bank or investment house rather than yourself just keep an open mind and very strongly consider shifting at least some of your investments into the stock market as you grow more comfortable over the next several years you can always keep a portion of your money in various interest bearing investments to act as a cushion in case the market

assuming a price is set on an free market there are particular difficulties to pricing a free market is one where the price is entirely determined by the willingness of people to buy and sell at a particular price point what you perceive as price is actually the tick i.e. the quote of the last transaction the first and most serious major obstacle to pricing is a variation of the prisoners dilemma a psychological phenomenon for instance bitcoin might be worth 4 $ now but you believe it will be worth 5 $ in 3 days will you buy bitcoin if acting only on your conviction yes but what if you consider what other people will do will others believe bitcoin will be worth 5 $ in 3 days will they act on their conviction will the others believe that others believe that it wil be worth 5 $ in 3 days and will the others believe that the others who believe will act on their conviction will the others believe that others believe of still others who believe that they will act on their conviction it goes on like this ad infinitum the actual behavior of any individual on the market is essentially chaotic and unpredictable for the reason stated above and others this is related to a phenomenon you call market efficiency an efficient market always reflects the optimal price point at any given time if that is so then you can not win on this market because at the time you would have to realize a competitive edge everybody else has already acted on that information markets are not 100 efficient of course but modern electronic markets can be very very efficient as say compared to stock markets fro 100 years ago where you could get a competitive edge just by having access to a fast courier what makes matters rather more difficult for price forecasting is that not only are humans engaging in the market machines are as well the machines may not be terribly good at what they do but they are terribly fast the machines that work well i.e. do n't loose much will survive and the ones that do n't will die in short order since speed is one of the major benefits of the machines over humans they tend to make markets even more efficient another phenomenon to price forecasting is that of information and suppose you found a reliable method to predict a market at a given time you act on this information and indeed you make a profit the profit you will be able to achieve will diminish over time until it reaches zero or reverts the reason for this is that you acted on private information which you leaked out by engaging in a trade the more successful you are in exploiting your forecast the better you train every other market participant to react to their losses since for every trade you make successfully there has to be somebody who lost people or machines who lose on markets usually exit those markets in some fashion so even if the other participants are not adjusting their behavior your success is weeding out those with the wrong behavior yet another difficulty in pricing forecasts are black swan events since information can have a huge impact on pricing the sudden appearance of new information can throw a conservative forecast completely off the rails and incur huge losses or huge unexpected benefits you can not quantify black swan events in any shape or form it is my belief that you can not predict efficient and well working markets you might be able to predict some very sub optimal markets but usually hedge funds are always on the hunt for inefficient markets to exploit so by simple decree of market economics the inefficient markets tend to be a perpetually dying species
