yes maybe for themselves but for you that depends on quite a number of things but not all advisors are scum but accept the fact that you are their cash cow and you are there for their some advisors are true to their professions and advise ethically trying to get the best for their clients so search for a good advisor rather than a cheap one and regarding the mortgage you are talking about the mortgage provider and the mortgage taker do n't deal directly but use their solicitors every party wants the least of legal hassles for their transactions and get the best legal help the financial advisor maybe both rolled into one or he has legal practitioners in his firm who would do the legal job after he takes care of the financial matters seems a cost effective workshop

this argument appears to assume that premiums will remain the same     you have to ask   if autonomy reduces the frequency of accidents why would you consider to pay the same insurance premium for the product   if geico was selling a product that had a $ 1000 premium with a 50 margin but is now selling a $ 200 product with a 75 margin it 's making a heck of a lot less in aggregate   ca n't say that 's a good thing

the only way to avoid paying the corporation tax is buying a house for say $ 100,000 and then letting it burn down by accident so your money is gone without anything to show for it your profits are gone and you pay no corporation tax   you pay corporation tax on profits profits that you invest are still profits

you would think so would n't you after all it 's your money in practise though it 's not as easy as you might think because anti money laundering and anti fraud laws mean you generally have to withdraw money to the same account you funded your trading from some forex trading account providers will allow you to fund from multiple sources but then insist on putting money back to those sources in some proportion or some order or other some forex trading account providers at least claim that they may at their discretion let you do it if the destination account is in the same name but i would n't be surprised if they charged you for it and actually the charges might be somewhat justified if they have to invoke identification procedures to make sure the other account is indeed actually you you would have to talk to a specific service provider and see if they agree to do what you want they all have faqs about funding and withdrawal so you can scan around online for the slightly more flexible ones and then give them a call you might find it difficult to get any guarantees out of them though

there are at least a couple problems    your friend may not manage money well and so may not have enough money in the account   check bounces   they get charged a fee   you get charged a fee   you have to chase after the friend to get the fee paid   the friend was cheap about the regular fees and does n't want to pay this much higher fee    your friend may really be a crook   the check is no good   perhaps it 's written under a false identity such that you are attempting to cash a stolen forged check   you cash it   they take the money and disappear   you get charged with participating in the crime go to jail and now have a criminal record worst case    my quick thought is that if you do n't know the person well enough to know the home address you do n't know the person well enough to cash checks    in general i would view this the same as a loan   when loaning to a friend you should never loan more than you are willing to lose   note that an actual loan would be safer   if you loan $ 50 to a friend at worst you 're out $ 50   if you deposit a fraudulent check you did something illegal   you will have to be convincing when you tell your story to the police   if they do n't believe you they could charge you   a couple bad breaks and you could go to jail

this was a huge question for me when i graduated high school should i buy a new or a used car i opted for buying used i purchased three cars in the span of 5 years the first two were used first one was $ 1500 honda reliable for one year than problem after problem made it not worth it to keep second car was $ 2800 subaru had no problems for 18 months then problems started around 130k miles $ 1800 fix fixed it and it still burnt oil i stopped buying old after that finally i bought a nissan for $ 5500 30,000 miles private owner over 5 years i found that the difference between your typical car for $ 1500 and the typical car you can buy for $ 5500 is actually a pretty big difference   things to look for low mileage one owner recent repairs search google known issues for the make and model based on the mileage of the car your reviewing receipts clean interior buying from a private owner getting a deal where they throw in winter tires for free so you already have a set are all things to look for with that said buying new is expensive for more than just the ticket price of the car if you take a loan out you will also need to take out full insurance in order for the bank to loan you the car this adds a lot to the price of the car monthly depending on your views of insurance and how much you 're willing to risk buying your car outright should be a cheaper alternative over all than buying new save save save its very probably that the hassles of repair and surprise break downs will you enough to buy new or newer at some point but like the previous response said you worked hard to stay out of debt i 'd say save another grand buy a decent car for $ 3000 and continue your wise spending habits try to sell your cars for more than you bought them for look for good deals buy and sell work your way up to a newer more reliable car good luck

i think you came up with a worthy masters phd research project it is a great question this is in australia so it is difficult for me to have complete perspective   however i can speak about the us of a. to your first point relatively few people inherit their wealth   according to a brief web search about 38 of billionaires and 20 of millionaires inherited their wealth   the rest are self made again in the us income mobility is very common   some act like high level earners are just born that way but studies have shown that a great deal of income mobility exists   i personally know people that have grown up without indoor plumbing and extremely poor but now earn in the top 5 of wage earners    quid 's points are valid   for example a starbucks new i phone and a brake job on your car are somewhat catastrophic if your income is 50k year hurts if your income is 100 k and an inconvenience if you make 250k year   these situations are normal and happen regularly   the first person may have to take a pay day loan to pay for these items the second credit card interest the third probably has the money in the bank   all of this the effect of an emergency on one 's net worth     to me there is also a chicken and egg effect in wealth building and income   how does one build wealth   by investing wisely planning ahead budgeting delaying gratification finding opportunities etc   now if you take those same skills to your workplace is n't it likely you will receive more responsibility promotions and raises   i believe so   and this too the effect on one 's net worth   if investing helps you to earn more then you will have more to invest to me one of the untold stories of this graph is not just investing but first building a stable financial base   having a sufficient emergency fund having enough and the right kind of insurance keeping loans to a minimum   without doing those things first investments might need to be withdrawn often at an inopportune time for emergency purposes thanks for asking this

a roth ira is simply a tax sheltered account that you deposit funds into and then invest however you choose within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with for example you could open a roth ira account with vanguard   you could then invest the $ 3000 by purchasing shares of voo which tracks the s&p 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time i checked   fidelity has a similar option or schwab or whatever brokerage firm you prefer iras are basically just normal investment accounts except they do n't owe taxes until you withdraw them and roth do n't even owe them then though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit   they have some limitations regarding options trading and such but if you 're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments you 'll not notice    then your ira would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value you do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds roth ira has fewer than a normal ira as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty but the profits can not be withdrawn until you 're retirement age i wo n't put an actual year as i suspect that actual year will change by the time you 're that old but think 60s the reason not to invest in an ira is if you plan on using the money in the near future even as an emergency fund   you should have some money that is not invested aggressively that is in something very safe and very accessible for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds do n't start an ira   but if this is truly money you want to save for retirement that 's the best place to start note this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment   you can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing

i am wondering weather it is worth it how taxation works in this    scenario ect or not and legally possible to do so whether it is worth it or not is up to you there 's nothing illegal in this unless of course there 's a legal issue in the foreign country the us does n't care re taxes it is a bit trickier if your lender does not provide you with form 1098 you 'll have to report the lender 's name address and ssn itin on your tax return in order to claim a deduction the irs will then expect the lender to report that interest as income this is us sourced income and is taxed in the us despite the fact that the lender is non resident see here for more info if the lender does n't report the income and does n't pay the taxes your deduction may be denied as well for double dipping it is easier if this is an investment then the deduction is not going to schedule a but rather as an expense to schedule e. the irs may still require matching but you wo n't need to report the ssn itin just have the expense properly documented obviously the best when it comes to legal issues is to talk to an attorney licensed in the state in question similarly with tax questions you should talk to a ea cpa licensed in that state i 'm neither

if the company is non public your hands are tied most startups have a stock option plan with specific rules on the shares in almost all cases they have a clause preventing transfers of options and shares unless approved by the company who would almost always say no additionally they usually have a right of first refusal which states that if shares are going to be transferred the company gets the chance to buy it first in your case the company may argue your friend would sell you the shares for free and the company would exercise their and buy back the shares for free there is not much you can do in this case you may be able to write up a contract between your friend and you but it would be costly and possibly not worth the effort you may be better off asking for a lump sum or some other sort of compensation additionally your friend might want to be careful with this idea you could potentially gain access to sensitive company tools documents which could get them in a lot of trouble

currencies are a zero sum game if you make money someone else will lose it because bank notes sitting in a pile do n't create anything useful but shares in companies are different because companies actually do useful things and make money so it 's possible for all investors to make money the best way to benefit is generally to put your money into a low cost index fund and then forget about it for at least five years

data is a funny thing there are many different ways of constructing data sets keep in mind the cite you linked is fine i follow this kind of site when i am data mining they got their data from the government and there 's no reason to doubt its validity keep in mind it 's a survey they extrapolate from a survey of a small population in the 2016 survey families were interviewed and in the 2013    survey were interviewed 1 let 's set that aside and look at the numbers as if they were gospel $ m net worth to be top 1 that 's people at all different ages and not the wealth cutoff for those dying else the estate tax would hit closer to the 1 given the limited data set i 'd only if we the age along the bottom x axis vs number of people the curve would peek in mid to late 60 's as people retire with 20 years for the couple to spend and gift it 's not tough to imagine that by the time they pass away the taxable estate $ 11 m couple falls to just .2   2 when the estate tax impacted estates over just $ 600 k and my daughter was born we set up a trust out net worth was barely positive but insurance alone would have created enough wealth to have our child be subject to the tax of our estate before she received a dime we also used the trust to fund her college as a completed gift had we made some bad decisions and lost it all at least that money would be protected keep in mind there are different flavors of trusts but it 's safe to say that in a survey to collect data the million trusts are considered family wealth not tough to imagine a good fraction of those families over $ 10 m have a nice chunk already protected this way   3 last for any illiquid assets there 's a discount that gets applied typically 30 i own a ranch and want to start gifting it to the kids the process involves creating stock with restrictions as a way to transfer the fractions required to gift the $ 14k yr per person combination that is a couple can gift = $ 56 k to a child with a spouse 4 kids all married and the gifting is $ yr $ 320 k at full valuation again these gifts may be to irrevocable trusts and still thought of as their wealth

i have comcast and hate their guts from the time they bought the local cable system a couple of years ago they have raised prices at least 10 a year and at the same time cut 2 4 channels every year now they want customers to get a bunch of new equipment which they claim is free like the cable modem was free until one month they started charging extra for it every month i 'm not paying any more for their crap    i 've let go of everything but the local channels and tomorrow or the next day it will take more equipment to even get those but i 've ordered the equipment necessary to get channels off the air    then once they start messing with my internet i 'll try at&amp;t and satellite internet or even go back to    cause i 'm not paying more for less not paying more for crap hell half of what you pay is for sports and i never watch sports    i felt sorry when so many good newspapers started going under but i feel no sympathy at all for comcast they are like the bank of america of cable tv when they die people will cheer    tv is run by greedy people i remember when cable started there were no ads they made their money from cable subscriptions then they decided they wanted more money than that and added ads they can make plenty of money without ads but there is no end to their greed so screw them

yikes not always is this the case for example you purchased a new car with an interest rate of 5 even higher why pay that much interest throughout the loan sometimes trading in the vehicle at a lower rate will get you a lower or sometimes the same payment even with an upgraded newer safer technology design the trade off when going from new to new the car may depreciate faster than what you would save from the interest savings on a new loan sometimes the tactics used to get you back to the dealership could be a little harsh but if you do your research long before you inquire you may come out on the winning end look at what you 're paying in interest and consider it a re finance of your car but taking advantage of the manufacturer 's low apr special to off set the costs

as far as taxes are concerned if your income is € 10 to € 20 a month the does n't even want to hear from you to be on the safe side give them a call and you will probably be told that there is a minimum amount and if your revenue is below that you do n't have to do anything    as far as vat is concerned you can only deduct it from vat that you would have to pay to the government if you are supposed to pay € 100 vat to the government you can deduct up to € 100 vat paid to suppliers if you do n't pay vat you ca n't deduct it

merely their words in a mocking tone is not a counter argument if you have no car you will have great difficulty finding and retaining employment unless you live in a relatively dense urban area which you may be able to afford either   if you have no education you will similarly have difficulty finding employment and finding employment that will afford you a stable life    if your choices are to relative poverty or debt it 's hard to argue that you are in charge of those choices

well reserve requirements concern as the name suggests the reserves e.g. a position on the balance sheet the price of equity only marginally impacts the balance sheet via positions in their own stock not nearly strong enough to be significant the french banks mainly had trouble with liquidity this year we witnessed another collapse of the interbank lending market just as in 2007 watch the libor o n spread and solvency through deterioration of the asset side of the balance sheet    naturally your ability to raise additional equity is influenced by the historic return of your stock but sharp price drops in fact can help you to raise equity simply because your ratios improved p e p b in fact any ratio that includes the price part and the stock became cheaper see ubs singapore gic and gs warren buffet

ianal and nor am i an accountant so i ca n't give a definitive answer as to legality but afaik what you propose is legal   but what 's the benefit   avoiding corporation tax it 's simplistic and costly to think in terms like that you need to run the numbers for different scenarios and make a plan   you can end up ahead of the game precisely by choosing to pay some corporate tax each year really read on one of the many reasons that self employed canadians sometimes opt for a corporate structure over being a sole proprietor is to be able to not pay themselves everything the company earns each year this is especially important when a business has some really good years and others meh   using the corporation to retain earnings can be more tax effective example imagine your corporation earns net of accounting other non tax costs except for your draws $ for 5 years and $ 0 in year 6   assume the business is your only source of income for those 6 years   would you rather pay yourself the entire $ in years 1 5 then $ 0 in year 6 living off personal savings you hopefully accumulated earlier subjecting the $ to personal income tax only leaving nothing in the corporation to be taxed very roughly speaking assuming tax rates brackets are level from year to year and using this calculator which simplifies certain things then in ontario then you 'd net for years 1 5 and $ 0 in year 6 overall you realized $ drawing the income in this manner the average tax rate on the $ 600,000 was vs. pay yourself only $ in years 1 5 leaving $ subject to corporation tax assuming a 15.5 combined federal provincial corporate tax rate includes the small business deduction then the corp is left with $ to add to retained earnings in years 1 5 in year 6 the corp has $ in retained earnings to be distributed to you the sole owner as a dividend of the non eligible kind again very roughly speaking you 'd personally net $ in years 1 5 and then on the $ dividend in year 6 you 'd net $   overall you realized $   drawing the income in this manner the average tax rate on the $ 600 k was i.e. scenario 2 which spreads the income out over the six years saved in tax or $ smoothing out your income is also a prudent thing to do would you rather find yourself in year 6 having no clients and no revenue with nothing left to draw on or would you rather the company had saved money from the good years to pay you in the lean one

so i 've read the article in question basically it 's over   here 's my opinion i respect charlie munger but i think his parable misses the mark   if he 's trying to convince the average person or at least the average slate reading person that america is overspending and headed for trouble the parable could have been told better   i was n't sure how to follow some of the analogies he was making and did n't experience the clear i was hoping for nevertheless i agree with his point of view which i see as   in the long run the united states is going to have serious difficulty in supporting its debt habit energy consumption habit and its currency in terms of an investment strategy to protect oneself here are some thoughts   these do n't constitute a complete strategy but are some points to consider as part of an overall strategy if the u.s. is going to continue debt fast it would stand to reason it will become a worse credit risk requiring it to pay higher interest rates on its debt   long term treasury bonds would decline as rates increase and so would n't be a great place to be invested today in order to pay the mounting debt and debt servicing costs the u.s. will continue to run the printing presses to inflate itself out of debt   this increase in the money supply will put downward pressure on the u.s. dollar relative to the currencies of better run economies   u.s. cash and short term treasuries might not be a great place to be invested today   hedge with inflation indexed bonds e.g. tips or the bonds of stronger major economies but diversify do n't just pick one if you agree that energy prices are headed higher especially relative to u.s. dollars then a good sector to invest a portion of one 's portfolio would be world energy producing companies   send some of your money over to canada we have lots of oil and we 're right next door anybody who has already been practicing broad global diversification is already reasonably protected   clearly diversification across just u.s. stocks and bonds is not enough finally i do n't underestimate the ability of the u.s. to get out of this   u.s. history has impressed upon me as a canadian two things in particular it is highly capable of both innovating and of overcoming challenges   i 'm keeping a small part of my portfolio invested in strong u.s. companies that are proven innovators not of the financial innovation variety and with global reach

you need to protect from two types of disasters you need to set a goal in 5 years i will have x months of emergency funds then start building it you can also make sure that any found money birthday check from your grandmother or bonus check at work goes into building the fund   while is seems a waste to pay all that interest for the student loans you may decide that having an emergency fund is more important note do n't mix the two types of emergency funds it is less confusing to have two sub accounts because it avoids the double counting of the funds

it pretty much comes down to where you interview and what you are trying to do   finance is something that you learn   while yes you can major in it i did it is really about how clever you are   you need to be creative in the way you perceive the problems that come at you   since you seem to be quantitative in nature you should be fine   when a hiring manager reads your resume he she will see that   they are probably tired of hearing drone on about how they would buy this vanilla stock because of a pe ratio or a solid balance sheet   everyone is the same   if you can stand out you can probably get a job wherever you want to within the realm of finance with some minor exceptions   odds are if you work at   bb i bank you will be trained in any sort of finance they deem necessary for you to be aware of   know some basic stuff   if you major in mathematics or stats or what have you you must be intelligent   buy a few novels   the quants fiasco the big short liars poker black swan a random walk down wall street   these will expose you to the ethos of a typical wall   you will also learn a few things about major events of the past and what is going on in the present   over all math is key   know some programming r python maybe perl   vba is whack   know your excel no mouse programming is a huge skill set that will set you apart from kids who were involved in random clubs   if you have a skill you are more valuable to a company compared to someone with a supposed knowledge of a subject matter   when i came out of school i knew my academics but never had applied any of it to a real world problem   your resume is not about what you have learned in the past it is all about demonstrating what you are capable of learning   if you can show that you are intelligent and a go from your resume you will do fine no matter what you studied   best of luck

regardless of wether or not you are registered for gst you are legally required to include a gst total on every invoice sent to an australian customer this gst total must be 10 of the payment amount if you are registered for gst or it must be $ 0.00 if you are not registered for gst since all gst transactions with the government are in australian dollars this amount on the invoice also needs to be in aud or else it 's impossible for you and your customer to both be working off the same gst amount this means you need to transfer your money from usd to aud in paypal 's manage currencies area before you can send a tax invoice to the customer so that you can provide the correct amount in aud based on the actual exchange rate for the day and you are required to send invoices promptly alternatively you can collect payments in aud using paypal or use a different payment service that collects payments in usd but immediately converts them to aud for sending an invoice australian paypal competitors often provide this service

look i agree with you in theory    in practice it is quite different    the fact that there is way more educated people than is even remotely necessary the extreme vast majority of jobs out there do not even require actual ability to get a diploma let alone a degree    think about your daily life with whom do you actually deal with that requires much of an education few people are going to pay more to their retail sales or car because they have an advanced degree     everybody having a college degree drives the value down for everybody which is exactly what is happening     things need to be turned on their head i propose that colleges need to receive their income as a percentage of the first 10 15 years of income from their students   it will cut down on bogus degrees concentrate on valuable students even those with questionable academics like steve jobs and larry and concentrate on degrees with high future value    however when you get 2500 applications for a lower end job i would immediately take it down to those with a degree because it 's easy and nobody will second guess you

without more info to go on such as a screenshot of the relevant portion of the statement or what country you 're in i will run with the answer that balance is the amount the collection agency is attempting to collect from you including any and all fees the agency may have added one important idea to keep in mind is that depending on how old the debt is the amount involved and the importance to the agency to collect it you may be able to negotiate a settlement for less than the full amount   this is n't always possible but sometimes you get lucky and it does n't hurt to try collection agencies work in several ways   some will actually buy the outstanding debt from the original creditor for some percentage of the debt 's face value and then take their chances on whether they collect anything at all while others work on behalf of the creditor and earn some percentage of what they manage to recover   in the latter case your chance of negotiating a reduced amount is better because the agency is being evaluated by the creditor on how quickly and efficiently they collect debts   an agency that is slower or less effective than another is less likely to continue earning the creditor 's business i hope this helps good luck

the primary tax sheltered investing vehicles in canada include the rrsp you can contribute up to 18 of your prior year 's earned income up to a limit $ in 2015 plus past unused contribution allowance and receive an income tax deduction for your contributions in an rrsp investments grow on a tax deferred basis no tax is due until you begin withdrawals when you withdraw funds the withdrawn amount will be taxed at marginal income tax rates in effect at that time the rrsp is similar to the u.s. traditional ira being an individual account with pre tax contributions tax deferred growth and ordinary tax rates applied to withdrawals yet rrsps have contribution limits higher than iras higher even than u.s. 401(k employee contribution limits but the rrsp is dissimilar to the ira and 401(k since an individual 's annual contribution allowance is n't use it or lose it unused allowance accumulates the tfsa once you turn 18 you can put in up to $ 5,500 each year irrespective of earned income like the rrsp contribution room accumulates if you were 18 in 2009 when tfsas were introduced you 'd be able to contribute $ if you 'd never contributed to one before unlike the rrsp contributions to a tfsa are made on an after tax basis and you pay no tax when you withdraw money the post tax nature of the tfsa and completely tax free withdrawals makes them comparable to roth type accounts in the u.s. i.e. while you wo n't get a tax deduction for contributing you wo n't pay tax on earnings when withdrawn yet unlike u.s. roth type accounts you are not required to use the tfsa strictly for retirement savings there is no penalty for pre retirement withdrawal of tfsa funds there are also employer sponsored defined benefit db and defined contribution dc retirement pension plans generally employees who participate in these kinds of plans have their annual rrsp contribution limits reduced i wo n't comment on these kinds of plans other than to say they exist and if your employer has one check it out many employees lose out on free money by not participating the under appreciated resp typically used for education savings a lifetime $ 50,000 contribution limit per beneficiary and you can put that all in at once if you 're not concerned about maximizing grants see below no tax deduction for contributions but investments grow on a tax deferred basis original contributions can be withdrawn tax free qualified educational withdrawals of earnings are taxed as regular income in the hands of the beneficiary an resp beneficiary is typically a child and in a child 's case the canadian federal government provides matching grant money called cesg of 20 on the first $ 2500 contributed each year up to age 18 to a lifetime maximum of $ 7200 per beneficiary grant money is subject to additional conditions for withdrawal while resps are typically used to save for a child 's future education there 's nothing stopping an adult from opening an resp for himself if you 've never had one you can deposit $ 50,000 of after tax money to grow on a tax deferred basis for up to 36 years as far as i understand an adult resp will not qualify for cesg moreover if you use the resp strictly as a tax shelter and do n't make qualified educational withdrawals when the time comes your original contributions still come out free of tax but you 'll pay ordinary income tax plus 20 additional tax on the earnings portion that 's the however if at that time you have accumulated sufficient rrsp contribution room you may move up to $ 50,000 of your resp earnings into your rrsp without any tax consequences i.e. also avoiding the 20 additional tax at time of transfer perhaps there 's something above you have n't considered still be sure to do your own due diligence and to consult a qualified experienced and conflict free financial advisor for advice particular to your own situation

transit fsas have $ 255 limits for each of parking public transit per month considered on a monthly basis separately and that limit applies both to funding and to claims you may fund your transit fsa with up to $ 255 per month for each purpose   you may withdraw up to $ 255 per month for each purpose   the amounts each month do n't have to match but they do need to each be under the maximum    any amount you spend over $ 255 for either parking or public transit would need to be funded with post tax money   most transit fsas have a mechanism for adding a credit card to the account to allow this to be seamless and on demand as opposed to be declared in advance you can change your deduction each month up to the limit your benefits provider permits for me for example i can choose up to the 10th of the prior month what to do this differs from health care fsas which are annual in nature and must be entirely defined during open enrollment but as they have annual limits would allow you to use the full amount even when employed for only half the year

given the current low interest rates let 's assume 4 this might be a viable option for a lot of people   let 's also assume that your actual interest rate after figuring in tax considerations ends up at around 3   i think i am being pretty fair with the numbers now every dollar that you save each month based on the savings and invest with a higher net return of greater than 3 will in fact be free money   you are basically betting on your ability to invest over the 3   even if using a conservative historical rate of return on the market you should net far better than 3   this money would be significant after 10 years    let 's say you earn an average of 8 on your money over the 10 years   well you would have an extra $ 77 k by doing interest only if you were paying on average of $ 500 a month towards interest on a conventional loan   that is a pretty average house in the us   who does n't want $ 77 k more than you would have compared to just principal   so after 10 years you have the same amount in principal plus $ given that you take all of the saved money and invest it at the constraints above i would suggest that people take interest only if they are willing to put away the money as they had a conventional loan   another scenario would be a wealthier home owner that may be able to pay off house at any time to reap the tax breaks and cheap money to invest pros cons   if people ask how viable is this   well i have done this for 8 years   i have earned an extra   i have smaller than $ 500 i put away each month since my house is about 30 owned but have earned almost 14 on average over the last 8 years   my money gets put into an e trade account automatically each month from there i funnel it into different funds diversified by sector and region   i literally spend a few minutes a month on this and i truly act like the money is n't there   what is also nice is that the bank will account for about half of this as being a liquid asset when i have to renegotiate another loan

the point is that the bid and ask prices dictate what you can buy and sell at at market at least and the difference between the two or spread contributes implicitly to your gains or losses for example say your $ 1 stock actually had a bid of $ 0.90 and an ask of $ 1.10 i.e. say that $ 1 was the last price you would have to buy the stock at the ask price of $ 1.10 but now you can only sell that stock at the bid price of $ 0.90 thus you would need to make at least that $ 0.20 spread before you can make a profit

this is an excellent question one that i 've before as well here 's how i 've reconciled it in my mind why should we agree that a stock is worth anything after all if i purchase a share of said company i own some small percentage of all of its assets like land capital equipment accounts receivable cash and securities holdings etc as others have pointed out notionally that seems like it should be worth something   however that does n't give me the right to lay claim to them at will as i 'm just a very small minority shareholder the old adage says that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay you for it that share of stock does n't actually give me any liquid control over the company 's assets so why should someone else be willing to pay me something for it as you noted one reason why a stock might be attractive to someone else is as a potentially tax advantaged revenue stream via dividends especially in this low interest rate environment this might well exceed that which i might obtain in the bond market the payment of income to the investor is one way that a   stock might have some inherent value that is attractive to investors as you asked though what if the stock does n't pay dividends as a small shareholder what 's in it for me without any dividend payments there 's no regular method of receiving my invested capital back so why should i or anyone else be willing to purchase the stock to begin with i can think of a couple reasons expectation of a future dividend you may believe that at some point in the future the company will begin to pay a dividend to investors dividends are paid as a percentage of a company 's total profits so it may make sense to purchase the stock now while there is no dividend banking on growth during the no dividend period that will result in even higher capital returns later this kind of your question a non dividend paying stock might be worth something because it might turn into a dividend paying stock in the future expectation of a future acquisition this addresses the original premise of my argument above if i ca n't as a small shareholder directly access the assets of the company why should i attribute any value to that small piece of ownership because some other entity might be willing to pay me for it in the future in the event of an acquisition i will receive either cash or another company 's shares in compensation which often results in a capital gain for me as a shareholder   if i obtain a capital gain via cash as part of the deal then this proves my point the original non dividend paying stock was worth something because some other entity decided to acquire the company paying me more cash than i paid for my shares they are willing to pay this price for the company because they can then reap its profits in the future if i obtain a capital gain via stock in as part of the deal then the process in some sense maybe the new stock pays dividends otherwise perhaps the new company will do something to make its stock worth more in the future based on the same future expectations the fact that ownership in a stock can hold such positive future expectations makes them worth something at any given time if you purchase a stock and then want to sell it later someone else is willing to purchase it from you so they can obtain the right to experience a positive capital return in the future while stock valuation schemes will vary both dividends and acquisition prices are related to a company 's profits this provides a connection between a company 's profitability expectations of future growth and its stock price today whether it currently pays dividends or not

this is a good point and where i think we should start the conversation   we have three coins the penny nickel and dime which have so little value that people question whether it 's even worth the time to handle them   i think we should consider just getting rid of all three and start pricing everything in multiples of 1/4 dollars   there are some things like gas stocks etc that may still need to be sold in smaller increments but do those things really make the costs and effort of and handling pennies nickels and dimes worth it

i agree with joe that you seem to have your stuff together however i ca n't disagree more otherwise   you are getting a loan at such a cheap rate that it would be almost impossible to not substantially beat that rate over the next 15 20 years   you paying off your home early might give you warm fuzzy feeling but would make me   this is a money website   make money for our purposes let 's say your home is worth 500k you can get a fixed rate loan at 3 over 30 years and you can earn 7 on your investments per year   note that i have earned 12 on mine the past 15 years so i am being pretty conservative so let 's not get into your other stuff because that is fine   let 's focus just on that 500k your house interest only loan for the whole   the flip side is you pay off your house   your house could be worth 400 k in 30 years   probably not but neighborhood could decline house not kept up or whatever   your house is not a risk free investment   and it fluctuate in many areas more than the stock market   but let 's just say your area stays ok or normal   in 30 years you can expect your house to be worth somewhere between 700k to 1.5 million   let 's just say you did great with your house   guess what   at 1.5 million selling price you still lost 1.5 million because of your decision plus sunk your money into a less liquid option    let the bank take the risk on your house price   the warm fuzzy feeling will be there when you realize you could rebuy your house two times over in 6 7 years note i know my example does n't use your exact numbers   i am just showing what your true cost is of making a decision in the most extreme way   i am guessing you have great credit and might be able to find an all interest loan at 3   so not doing this is costing you 1.5 million over 30 years   given a lower home price after 30 years or a higher rate of return this easily be much more   if you earned 12 over the 30 year period you would be costing yourself 16 million do the math   now you are talking about doing something in between   which means you will basically have the same risk factors with less return

gt;i agree the numbers are bunk however the 900k figure is the opportunity cost of a moderate income family and not the actual   the problem with that is that sans kids most people really do n't have much incentive to work all that hard   you do n't need anywhere near as big of a house heck as a single or childless couple you do n't need a house you can easily just rent a small studio or 1 br apartment   you do n't need a minivan or crossover or whatever the heck they call the equivalent of a station wagon these days   you are feeding a lot less people   you do n't need to worry about keeping anyone in shoes or clothes and buying new shit every year provided you control your weight of course and do n't ruin good clothing or follow fashion trends like a fool   you do n't have to plan amp take expensive disney vacations for anyone much less a group of 4 or 5 or more people   you do n't have anyone to send to college or a teenager to buy a car for much less pay insurance to cover   you can pretty much ignore the vast majority of life insurance costs if you 're single do you really give a shit who gets anything if when you   likewise with health insurance dirt cheap while you 're young and even cheap when your middle aged if you have no kids and with good reason no pregnancy birth costs no or childhood diseases no removal operations etc   etc   quite seriously people without kids simply do n't have as many reasons to work like slaves   a single person or childless couple can easily buy a home car and other assets and pay it all off in a few short years certainly less than a decade and live content amp fairly well on a minimal income after that   remember things like cars chiefly wear down because of mileage and most mileage is spent either chasing after income commuting to from a job from a home in the suburbs said home bought to get the kids into a good school and to give the kids room to play etc or chasing round for the kids explicitly playing taxi driver carrying the kids around to from school team sports amp other inane activities   ergo the childless person or couple really does n't have to chase after the all mighty dollar in the same way   instead they can enjoy life amp leisure and to paraphrase mastercard that can be priceless

the example you give would clearly be illegal and so unenforceable in court   if a contract contains a clause which is deemed legal but so unreasonable completely unfair it is unenforceable by the court then the court can replace that cause with a more reasonable clause   i think it would be a fairly expensive and likely losing argument to convince a court that this particular contract was unfair   but if you did it would probably mean only a change in the penalty clause to make it reasonable

the united nations is already working on stripping us of our world reserve currency status so are the brics people think we need to maintain the status quo and give a specific country the world reserve currency there are serious discussions to create a neutral global currency so no country has an edge   i found a lot of posts on the topic but am linking to a really interesting post from a well known publication   gt;the us dollar is getting close to losing its status as the world ’s reserve currency should it cross the line the 2008 financial crisis could look like a summer storm yes worries about insolvency in europe dominate the headlines last week standard amp poor ’s cut spain ’s bond rating to a clear sign that europe ’s financial crisis is far from over but america ’s escalating debt problem is far more likely to a truly global crisis because the dollar has for decades played such a central role in the world economy how bad is the us problem former treasury official lawrence recently pointed out that investors are us bonds and notes the lack of other buyers forced the federal reserve to buy a stunning 61 percent of the total net issuance of us government debt last year like many others he warns that ballooning debt puts the us economy at risk for a sharp correction   reuters the greenback ’s losing to the yuan   but the even larger risk is the potential loss of the dollar ’s reserve currency status a key support of the world economy for the last four decades it started with the 1973 saudi commitment to accept only us dollars as payment for oil followed by opec ’s 1975 agreement to trade only in dollars trading of other commodities came to be priced in dollars reinforcing the dollar ’s reserve status as a result central banks worldwide have held onto large reserves of dollars to facilitate trade that in turn has enabled the us to print much larger amounts of its currency with seemingly little inflationary consequences it ’s also made it easier for americans to import more than they export to consume more than they produce and to spend more than they earn but all that is changing rapidly a number of countries are abandoning the dollar for the chinese yuan last december japan and china agreed to trade in yen and yuan in january the 10 nations of the association of southeast asian nations finalized a non dollar credit agreement equivalent to $ 240 billion strengthening their links with china japan and south korea that same month chinese premier signed a currency swap agreement with the united arab which holds 7 percent of the world ’s oil reserves iran has agreed to accept rubles and yuan in trade with russia and china and now is trading oil with india in rupees and gold in late march the china development bank agreed with its counterparts in brazil russia india and south africa to eschew dollar lending and extend credit to each other in their own respective currencies with global demand for dollars falling central banks around the world will inevitably reduce their dollar reserves that selloff further weakens the dollar against other currencies and in turn drives up inflation all this comes as us federal debt is soaring adding to concerns about the future value of that debt and of the dollar it ’s suddenly much easier to imagine a dollar collapse which would be a highly unexpected occurrence known as a black swan event this would unprecedented disruption because the dollar remains the world ’s most important currency let ’s hope we can avert a global crisis triggered by reckless us government spending what ’s needed is new leadership in washington with the courage to get our fiscal house in order and to defend the dollar against attack in a competitive global market   here is another opinion on the topic   edit let me add if we are constantly adding stimulus from the central banks we are going to be seriously the faith the rest of the world has in us as well the fed was the buyer of what like 10 of our bonds before the crisis now they are buying 60 we have using quantitative easing and stimulus for three years to fix the economy if we were suddenly having a recovery that would be fine because people would know we would be ready to start paying down our debts however we have spent trillions and our gdp growth is about two thirds the average since that 's a sign that there is something wrong with our economy right now clearly not an argument to end stimulus because without it we would be in a major depression the problem is that once people realize that they will question how stable our economy really is   your argument that we are the most stable economy in the world and deserve the reserve currency status is circular logic we have had the reserve currency status since 1944 that has helped us maintain the stability the rest of the world has n't enjoyed for a very long time without it we may never have become anything near the country we are today it gave us access to tremendous capital which we were able to use to expand our nation incredibly we have built an empire on our ability to take on massive amounts of debt i am sure we would have been a superpower without it but no one can say how much or how harder other recessions would have been if we had never been granted that privilege

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

mortgages with a prepayment penalty usually do not charge points as a condition of issue the points usually in the range of the amount borrowed are paid from the buyer 's funds at the settlement and are effectively the prepayment penalty   once upon a time e.g. 30 years ago in some areas   buyers had a choice of   this last option usually had a higher interest rate than the first two it was advantageous for a buyer to accept this option if the buyer was sure that the mortgage would indeed be paid off in a short time e.g. because a windfall of some kind huge bonus big inheritance a killing in the stock market a successful ipo was anticipated where the higher interest charged for only a few years did not make much of a difference taking this third option and hanging on to the mortgage over the full 15 or 20 or 25 or 30 year term would have been a very poor choice i do not know if all three options are still available in the current mortgage market the irs treats points for original and points for re financed mortgages differently for the purposes of schedule a deductions points paid on an original mortgage are deductible as mortgage interest in the year paid whereas points paid on a refinance must be amortized over the life of the loan so that the mortgage interest deduction is the sum of the interest paid in the monthly payments plus a fraction of the points paid for the refinance the part of the points get deducted in the year that the mortgage is paid off early or refinanced again prepayment penalties are of course deductible as mortgage interest in the year of the prepayment

if your gut told you to buy during the depths of 09 your gut might be well calibrated the problem is stock market declines during recessions are frequently not that large relative to the average long run return of 9   a better strategy might be hold a percentage in equities based upon a probability distribution of historical returns   this becomes problematic because of changes in the definition of earnings and the recent inflation stability which has encouraged high valuations   cash flow has not been as corrupted as earnings now and might be a better indicator   this obviously is n't perfect either but returns can be improved since there is no way yet available the optimal primary strategy is still buy hold which has made the most successful investor frequently one of the richest people on the planet for decades but this could still be used as an auxiliary for cash management reserves during recessions once retired

i was in the health insurance game for 10 years and never heard of this until the affordable care act came about   to my knowledge there is no rule or regulation prohibiting it however trying to get an insurer underwrite that risk is extremely unlikely it 's the same reason why you do n't see aaa offering health insurance there is n't a contractual relationship between the church and their constituents so no underwriter worth their salt would put a reasonable price on that risk    members can easily come and go and since insurance through your employer is still the dominant distribution channel for health insurance it would be seen as an adverse risk meaning that people who could n't get it through normal channels must be getting it through the church which it would then be assumed that this person applying for coverage is an adverse risk or someone who is abnormally unhealthy   there are faith based healthcare reimbursement programs that are not health insurance and do not satisfy the aca required minimum coverages from what i 've seen and read it 's basically members of the religion or faith that pay money into the system like paying an insurance premium and they elect a board that basically evaluates each claim and pays or does n't pay it either partially or in full while this is a nice way to get your bills paid odds are it wo n't cover your $ 300,000 cancer treatment or your $ 50,000 section birth

you want to know if you should pay cash or use a credit card like cash there are so many benefits to the card like purchase protection cash back and postponed payments that there needs to be a really good reason to pay cash   if you are concerned about the 10 threshold ask your credit card company to raise your limit   if you are indifferent let the merchant decide for you by asking for a discount if you pay cash   the biggest reason is that credit cards when handled make your money work for you by keeping it in less liquid higher interest investments like inflation adjusted t bills you will still be able to access it by using the credit card to float large expenses without liquidating at a loss investment accounts like schwab one are great for this since you can borrow cash at a low interest rate against your securities until your security sale clears

it really depends on the answers to two questions 1 how tight is your budget going to be if you have to make that $ payment every month   obviously you 'd still be better off than you are now since that 's still $ 30 cheaper but if you 're living essentially paycheck to paycheck then the extra flexibility of the $ 400/month option can make the difference if something unforeseen happens   2 how disciplined financially have you proven you can be the i 'll make extra payments every month sounds real nice but many people end up not doing it i should know i 'm one of them i 'm still paying on my student loans because of it if you know by having done it before that you can make that extra $ 130 go out each and every month and not talk yourself into using it on all sorts of more important needs then hey go for it financial flexibility is a great thing and having that monthly nut all your minimum living expenses combined as low as possible contributes greatly to that flexibility   update another thing to consider another thing to consider is what they do with your extra payment will they apply it to the principal or will they treat it as a prepayment if they apply it to principal it 'll be just like if you had that shorter term your principal goes down additionally by that extra amount and the next month you owe another $ 400   on the other hand if they treat it as a prepayment then that extra $ 130 will be applied to the next month 's bill principal stays the same and the next month you 'll be billed $ 270    there are two practical differences for you   1 with prepayment you 'll pay slightly more interest over that 60 months paying it off because it 's not amortized into the loan the principal balance does n't go down faster while the loan exists and since interest is calculated on the remaining principal balance end result is more interest than you otherwise would have paid that sucks but   2 with the prepayment consider that at the end of year 2 you 'd have over 7 months of payments prepaid so if some emergency does come up you do n't have to send them any money at all for 7 months there 's that flexibility again   honestly while this is something you should find out about the loan it 's really still a wash i have n't done the math but with the interest rate amount of the loan and time frame i think the extra interest would be pretty minor

setting aside for the moment the very relevant issue of whether you need the full amount quickly i 'll just tackle comparing which option gives you to maximum amount of money in terms of real dollars the trick is unless you think inflation will suddenly reverse itself or stop entirely not likely $ 50 k today is worth a lot more than $ 50 k in 20 years if you do n't believe me consider that just 30 years ago the average price for a mid level new car was around $ 3k when you grandfather says he got a burger for a nickel he is n't talking about 2010 dollars   so how do you account for this well the way financial people and project managers do it to estimate how much to pay today for $ 1 at some point in the future is through a net present value npv calculation you can find a calculator here in your question you gave some numbers for the payout but not the lump sum prize amount going solely on what you have provided i calculate that you should take the lump sum if it is greater than $ which is the net present value of 20 years of $ 50 k payments assuming 3 annual inflation which is fairly a fairly reasonable number given history however if you think the out of control gov't spending is going to send inflation through the roof possible but not a given then you almost certainly would want the lump sum i suppose in that scenario you might want the lump sum anyway because if the govt starts on their obligations doing it to a small number of lottery winners might be politically more popular than cutting other programs that affect a large number of voters

also to add to my other point you do n't give more money to someone who ca n't use the money they already have wisely for example a friend borrows your money to pay his rent and he blows it all on alcohol and cigarettes and when he asks you for more you do n't give more to him you direct him to a place where he can solve his problems the same needs to happen with the us the money they recieve now is more then enough to run the country

it is not so useful because you are applying it to large capital think about theory of investment value it says that you must find undervalued stocks with whatever ratios and metrics now think about the reality of a company for example if you are waiting ko the coca cola company to be undervalued for buying it it might be a bad idea because ko is already an international well known company and ko sells its product almost everywhere so there are not too many opportunities for growth even if ko ratios and metrics says it 's a good time to buy because it 's undervalued people might not invest on it because ko does n't have the same potential to grow as 10 years ago the best chance to grow is demographics you are better off either buying etfs monthly for many years 10 minimum or find small cap and mid cap companies that have the potential to grow plus their ratios indicate they might be undervalued if you want your investment to work remember this stock price growth is nothing more than you might ask yourself what is your investment profile agressive speculative income dividends capital preservation if you want something not too risky etfs and not waste too much time if you want to get more returns you have to take more risks find small cap and mid companies that are worth i hope i helped you

keep in mind this is a matter of preference and the answers here are going to give you a look at the choices and the member 's view on the positive negative for each one   my opinion is to put 20 down to avoid pmi if the bank will lend you the full 80 then buy the house move in and furnish it keep track of your spending for 2 years minimum it 's the anti budget not a list of constraints you have for each category of spending but a rear view mirror of what you spend this will help tell you if in the new house you are still saving well beyond that 401(k and other retirement accounts or dipping into that large reserve   at that point start to think about where kids fit into your plans people in million dollar homes tend to have child care that 's 3 5x the cost the middle class has disclosure 10 years ago our 's cost $ 30k year   today your rate will be about 4 and federal marginal tax rate of meaning a real cost of 3 just under the long term inflation rate 3.2 over the last 100 years i am 53 and for my childhood right through college the daily passbook rate was 5 long term government debt is also at a record low level this is the chart for 30 year bonds   i 'd also suggest you get an understanding of the long term stock market return long term 10 but with periods as long as 10 years where the return can be negative   once you are at that point 2 3 years in the house you can look at the pile of cash and have 3 choices   we are in interesting times right now for much of my life i 'd have said the potential positive return was n't worth the risk but then the mortgage rate was well above 6 7 very different today

kudos for wanting to start your own business   now let 's talk reality unless you already have some kind of substantial track record of successful investing to show potential investors what you want to do will never happen and that 's just giving you the honest truth there are extensive regulatory requirements for starting any kind of public investment vehicle and meeting them costs money   you can be your own hedge fund with your own money and avoid all of this if you like   keep in mind that a hedge fund is little more than someone who is contrarian to the market and puts their money where their mouth is   i know some of you will argue this is simplistic and you 'd be right but i 'm deliberately avoiding complexity for the moment the simple truth is that nobody is going to just give you their money to invest unless for starters you can show that you 're any good at it and for the sake of it we 'll assume you 've had success in the markets and perhaps most importantly you have skin in the game meaning you have a substantial investment of your own in the fund too    you might have a chance at creating something if you can show that whatever your hedge fund proposes to invest in is n't already overrun by other hedge funds   at the moment there are more mutual and hedge funds out there than there are securities for them to invest in so they 're basically all fighting over the same pie   you must have some fairly unique opportunity or approach that nobody else has or has even considered in order to begin attracting money to a new fund these days   and that 's not easy trust me there is no short or easy path to what you want to do and perhaps if you want to toy around with it a bit find some friends who are willing to invest based on your advice and/or picks   if you develop a track record of success then perhaps you could more seriously consider doing what you propose and in the meanwhile you can look into the requirements for laying the foundations toward your goal i hope you do n't find my answer cruel because it is n't meant to be   i am all about encouraging people to succeed but it has to start with a realistic expectation   you have a great thought but there 's a wide gulf from concept to market and no quick or simple way to bridge it here 's a link to a web video on how to start your own hedge fund if you want to look into it more deeply how to legally start a hedge fund from the investopedia website good luck

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

see my comment for some discussion of why one might choose an identical fund over an etf   as to why someone would choose the higher cost fund in this instance the admiral shares version of the fund vfiax has the same expense ratio as the etf but has a minimum investment of $ 10k.   some investors may want to eventually own the admiral shares fund but do not yet have $ 10k.   if they begin with the investor shares now and then convert to admiral later that conversion will be a non taxable event   if however they start with etf shares now and then sell them later to buy the fund that sale will be a taxable event vanguard etfs are only commission free to vanguard clients using vanguard brokerage services   some investors using other brokers may face all sorts of penalties for purchasing third party etfs   some retirement plan participants either at vanguard or another broker may not even be allowed to purchase etfs

dude you are totally moving the goal posts first of all the fact that you had to crawl through my comment history and came up with a completely unrelated response rather than addressing my point is pretty pathetic and a pretty common behavior who are wrong and do n't want to admit it i do n't hate california i think it 's overrated and i think it 's overrated because what you get is n't worth what you pay that is n't being biased it 's cause and effect if it did n't cost 3x as much to live in california as anywhere else i would like it a lot more   and the math does n't work out you in your original comment said the typical salary is now that you have been proven wrong you are now claiming it 's 200k+ that is n't the math working out that 's distorting reality until it lines up with your preconceived notions   and now you are restricting nature to mountains since apparently anything that is n't red river is hills and therefore not worth anything again moving the goalposts and even if your idea of things to do in nature means i like in the mountains exclusively you would be much better off in places like utah than california   repeatedly saying i 've done the math i 've been offered a job does n't mean anything when i 've already shown you the math does n't work out and i too have been offered a 6 figure job in sf   i 'm clearly not the one that 's biased you are look if you have built up california into some mythical place so sacred that you are so clearly willing to do mental gymnastics you are demonstrating in order to make reality conform with your personal notions great but for everyone else the math as in actual math not changing the numbers around until it makes sense does nt work out

if you pay off a debt through a collections agency it will damage your credit   here 's an alternative approach   settling a $ 10 k loan for $ 2 k shows the lender is keen to settle    instead of paying the collections agency negotiate with the lender and agree to pay 2 k to settle provided that they agree to this could be a win win for both   the lender gets to keep full 2 k without having to pay the collection agency a fat commission and your credit is n't damaged not saying this will always work but worth a try    pro tip get everything in writing before you pay anything

that 2 t is if you invest the money for a decade before cutting checks which is the methodology with which i mentioned i disagree   from the article   gt after spending a little quality time in microsoft excel i ’d say it ’s somewhere the ballpark of $ 1,350 per household or $ 1,000 per worker   if you divide $ 1000 per worker by ten years you get $ 100 per year which is what i said and which the title   edit i see what you mean i typed households instead of workers thanks for pointing out my typo i edited the comment to correct and show i originally also i put instead of 2 t either way the point is it is $ 100 per year not $ 1000 i should ’ve paid attention when commenting but the point remains valid

the $ per share figure is the trading price or fair market value of the old johnson controls and should not be used to figure your gain nor to figure your basis in the new johnson controls international your new basis is the total of the gross proceeds received that is the cash   plus the fair market value of the new shares which was $ per share i am not referring to cash in lieu for fractional shares but the $ per share received upon the merger a person holding 100 shares of the old johnson controls would have received $ plus shares of the new company   ignoring the fractional share for simplicity 's sake gross proceeds would equal 83 x $ = $   in fair market value of shares plus the cash of $ for a total of $ this is your basis in the 83 new shares regarding the fractional share since new basis is at fair market value there should be no gain or loss recognized upon its sale

you must understand that not everyone has or can get credit cards consider that those who are in the the lowest 20 30 of income tend to have fewer credit cards or none and lower credit debt although some have quite high credit card debt relative to their income   so you really are n't comparing the same demographics the population of all income earners used to calculate average income and the population of all credit card debt holders are not the same groups of people once you remove those folks from consideration then credit card usage may still average higher but accept that it is unusual for people making less than $ year to have much credit card debt you must understand that wealth and income are two very different although related concepts one must note that there are millions of people in the u.s. who have wealth they have net assets of over $ 1 m excluding their homes many of those folks have assets greatly exceeding $ 1m. and although it might seem foolish to carry a large balance on their credit cards they may have quite low interest rates and simply find it simpler and more convenient to use credit cards in lieu of personal loans   suppose you have $ 2 m in net assets and want to buy a classic car or a diamond necklace   charging $ 30 k and carrying the balance until a dividend check arrives may make sense understand also that not everyone makes the same choices or good choices carrying a credit card balance may appear like a poor choice especially when you are not wealthy or have lower income but suppose you have a high credit limit across several cards and you need to handle a short term financial challenge car repair layoff medical bills etc   you might use the credit card to pay for that purchase essentially financing an extraordinary event over a longer period of time   and although having a balance of more than 5 10 of your monthly income may seem foolish to some it may make sense to others and some people choose to carry balances of 50 to 100 of their credit limit   others realize that keeping their credit utilization below 30 20 or 10 of the credit limit is a better plan both interest rate and risk wise

there are a few major risks to doing something like that first you should never invest money you ca n't afford to lose an emergency fund is money you ca n't afford to lose by definition you may need to have quick access to that money if you determine that you need for example $ 3000 in emergency savings that means that you need to have at least $ 3000 at all times if you lose $ 500 then you now only have $ 2500 in emergency savings imagine what could 've happened if you had invested your emergency savings during the 2008 crash for example you could easily have been in a position where you lost both your job and a good portion of your emergency savings at the same time which is a terrible position to be in if the car breaks down you ca n't really say now 's a bad time wait until the stock market bounces back second with brokerage accounts there may be a delay before you can actually access the money or transfer it to an account that you can actually withdraw cash from or write checks against but some of this depends on the exact arrangement you have with your bank this can be a problem if you 're in a situation where you need immediate access to the money if your furnace breaks in the middle of winter you probably do n't want to wait a few days for the sale and transfer to go through before you can have it fixed third you can be forced to sell the investments at an unfavorable price because you 're not sure when you 're going to need it you 'd also likely incur trading fees and/or early withdrawal penalties when you tried to withdraw the money think about it this way if you buy a bond that matures in 5 years you 're effectively betting that you wo n't have an emergency for the next 5 years if you do you 'll have to either sell the bond or if you 're allowed to get the money back early you 'll likely forfeit a good amount of the interest you earned in the process which kind of kills the point of buying the bond in the first place edit as pointed out in the comments you may also have to pay taxes on the profits if you sell at a favorable price in the u.s. at least capital gains on stuff held for less than a year is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate and stuff held longer than a year is taxed at the long term capital gains tax rate so if you hold the investment for less than a year you 're opening yourself up to the risks of short term stock fluctuations as well as potential tax penalties so if you put your emergency fund in stocks you 're essentially betting that you wo n't have an emergency that year which by definition you ca n't know the purpose of an emergency fund is just that to be an emergency fund its purpose is n't really to make money

there are several types of financial advisors some are associated with brokerages and insurance companies and the like their services are often free on the other hand the advice they give you will generally be strongly biased toward their own company 's products and may be biased toward their own profits rather than your gains remember anything free is being paid for by someone and if you do n't know who it 's generally going to be you there are some who are good but i could n't give you any advice on finding them others are not associated with any of the above and serve entirely as experts who can suggest ways of distributing your money based on your own needs versus resources versus risk tolerance without any affiliation to any particular company   consulting these folks does cost you or if it 's offered as a benefit your employer some money but their fiduciary responsibility is clearly to you rather than to someone else they are n't likely to suggest you try anything very sexy but when it comes to your primary long term savings exciting is usually not a good thing the folks i spoke to were of the latter type they looked at my savings and my plans talked to me about my risk tolerance and my goals picked a fairly standard strategy from their files ran simulations against it to sanity check it and gave me a suggested mix of low overhead index fund types that takes almost zero effort to maintain rebalance occasionally between funds has acceptable levels of risk and i admit i 've been lucky has been delivering more than acceptable returns nothing exciting but even though i 'm relatively risk tolerant i 'd say excitement is the last thing i need in my long term savings i should actually talk to them again some time soon to sanity check a few things they can also offer advice on other financial decisions whether when i might want to talk to charities about gift annuity plans whether roth versus traditional 401(k makes any difference at all at this point in my career and so on

it depends what rate mortgage you can get for any extra loans   if you remortgage you are likely to get a rate of 3.5 4 depending who you go with with deposit accounts in the uk around 1 yes you can get more by tying it up for longer but not a huge amount more clearly you 're better off not having a mortgage rather than money in the bank does your 8k income allow for tax if it does you are getting 6 return on the money tied up in the flat if you are getting 6 after tax on the invested money that 's way better than you would get on any left over cash paid into an investment borrowing money on a mortgage would cost you less than 6 so you are better off borrowing rather than selling the flat if you are getting 6 before tax depending on your tax rate it probably makes very little difference you 'd need to work out how much an extra 80k mortgage would cost you how much the 50k on deposit would earn you and how much you make after tax there is a different route set up a mortgage on the rental flat you can claim the interest payment off the flat 's income reduce your tax bill so the effective mortgage rate on the flat would be less than what you could get with a mortgage on the new house use the money from the flat 's mortgage to finance the difference in house price in fact from a tax view you may be better off having a mortgage free house and maxing out the mortgage on the flat so you can write off as much as possible against your tax bill all of the above assume that the flat is rented all the time the odd dry spell on the flat could influence the sums a lot all of the above assume that   your cash flow works whichever route you choose as no one on stack exchange has all of the numbers for your specific circumstances it may be worth talking to a tax accountant they could advise you properly knowing the numbers which makes the best sense for you in terms of overall cost cash flow risk and so on

you could try to refine your options strategy   for instance you could buy the usd 750 call you mentioned and at the same time sell short call options with a higher strike price which is above the share price level you expect that apple will trade at in one year for instance usd 1,100   by doing this you would receive the premium of the call with the higher option which in turn would help you finance buying your usd 750 the net effect of this trading strategy would be that you would give up the extra profit you would earn if apple would rose above usd 1,100 the strike price of the call option sold short your total risk would be even less than with your actual strategy in my view

sipc is a corporation a legal entity separate from its owners in the case of sipc it is funded through the fees paid by its members all the us brokers are required to be members and to contribute to sipc funds can it go bankrupt of course any legal entity can go bankrupt a person can go bankrupt a country can go bankrupt and so can anything in between however looking at the history of things there are certain assumptions that can be made these are mere guesses as there 's no law about any of these things to the best of my knowledge but seeing how things were we can try and guess that they will also be like this in the future i would guess that in case of a problem for the sipc to meet its obligation any of the following would happen or combinations too big to fail large insurance companies had been bailed out before by the governments since it was considered that their failure would be more destructive to the economy than the bailout aig as an example in the us sipc is in essence is an insurance company so is lloyd 's of london breach of trust of the individual investors that can lead to a significant market crash that 's what happened in the us to fannie mae and freddie mac they 're now officially backed by the us government if sipc is incapable of meeting its obligation i would definitely expect the us government to step in even though there 's no such obligation raising funds through charging other members if the actuary calculations were incorrect the insurance companies adjust them and raise premiums that is what should happen in this case as well while may not necessarily solve a cashflow issue in the long term it will allow sipc to balance so that bridge loans from the us government feds public bonds could be used in between not meeting obligations i.e. bankruptcy that is an option and insurance companies have gone bankrupt before not unheard of but from the past experience again i 'd expect the us government to step in in general i do n't see any significant difference between sipc in the us and a generic insurance coverage elsewhere except that in the us sipc is mandatory well regulated and the coverage is uniform across brokerages which is a benefit to the consumer

in my view it 's better to sell when there 's a reason to sell rather than to cap your gains at 8 i 'm assuming you have no such criteria on the other side i.e. hold your losses down to 8 that 's because what matters is how much you make overall in your portfolio not how much you make per trade example if you own three stocks equal amounts and two go up 20 but one falls 20 if you sell your gains at 8 and hold the loser you have net lost money so when do you actually sell you might say a fall of 10 from the last high is good enough to sell this is called a trailing stop which means if a stock goes from 100 to 120 i 'll still hold and sell if it to 108 needless to say if it had gone from 100 to 90 i would still be out the idea is to ride the trend for as long as you can because trends are strong and keep your trailing stops wide enough for it to absorb natural because you may get stopped out of a stock that falls 4 but eventually goes up 200 or sell under other conditions if the earnings show a distinct drop or the sector falls out of favor   whenever you decide to sell also consider what it would take for you to buy the stock back increased earnings strong prices a product release whatever because getting out might seem like a good thing but it 's just as important to not think of it as saying a stock is crappy it might just be that you had enough of one ride that does n't mean you ca n't come back for another one

to get the factors you want start with a complete amortization calculator and a tax deduction calculator filling in values for your down payment purchase price tax rates and mortgage rate   if you are talking about a specific property you should be able to get taxes for the current year and perhaps using historical values estimate taxes going out   some calculators will include pmi which you should avoid like the plague in an actual purchase   given some preliminary data you can calculate your insurance so once you have your principal interest tax and insurance monthly payment and tax deduction you can calculate how much you spend a month on the house minus the deduction to estimate maintenance costs you could either figure out about what you 'd need to replace in the given time you plan to stay put and use a rough estimate on what it is   you can also use some rough estimates like this 1 of the property value yearly or this moving the number up to a whopping 2 do n't forget closing costs as a buyer and seller   you can find estimates for these as well and they are a function of the purchase price usually around 2 so to figure out how much it costs you to live in a house for x months you can do so your total cost is total return is you can adjust that total return for inflation using this calculator to get your total return adjusted for inflation   if projecting into the future you can try a formula found here to figure out the return on your investment use so to figure out the total return adjusted you need for a given roi find

gnucash is much more designed for accounting than for budgeting while it does have some simple budgeting features they 're largely based around tracking how much has been spent in the expense categories accounts and seeing how close one is to a limit that 's been set because the point of gnucash is accounting there 's not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously you can split a transaction across multiple categories to have a grocery store purchase of $ 150 be split across $ 100 food and $ 50 phone minutes or whatever but not have a $ 150 purchase be tracked as $ 150 food and $ 150 household expenses because that 's not how double entry accounting works the closest way to do what i think you 're looking for is to take advantage of the account structure and repeat as needed for example this would allow you to see household expenses vs. vacation expenses and still see what it got spent on reporting on all food purchases if you want to do so is slightly more tricky as you 'd need to select all those food categories separately in your report but it 's possible you speak about wanting to track expenses multiple ways so i think that this would allow you to record data sufficient to track it but the point of tracking any data is to be able to report on it in some fashion so if you have more specific reporting requirements you might want to ask about that as well

depending on your income you may owe amt instead of the taxes from the regular code   even if you do n't do that you may hit the place where you have to at least check if you owe amt as you probably know amt was established early on to catch the wealthiest of tax payers who were able to use various loop holes in the code to pay much less tax than one would expect   over time the limits on amt have not risen with the rising wage gap and amt catches an increasing number of tax payers each year   if the limit is not raised at all for 2010 then it will catch even more people this year    amt has worked it 's way into the upper middle class fairly solidly especially if you exercise stock options whose strike price is significantly different than the current sale price

earnings per share is the company profit or loss divided by the number of outstanding shares the number should always be compared to the share price so for instance if the eps is $ 1 and the share price is $ 10 the eps is 10 of the share price this means that if the company keeps up this earning you should expect to make 10 yearly on your investment long term the stock price may fluctuate but if the company keeps on making money you will eventually do so too as investor if the eps is low it means that the market expects the earnings to rise in the future either because the company has a low profit margin that can be vastly improved or because the business is expected to grow especially the last case may be a risky investment as you will lose money if the company does n't grow fast enough even if it does make a healthy profit note that the listed eps like most key figures is based on the last financial statement recent developments could mean that better or worse is generally expected also note that the earnings of some companies will fluctuate wildly for instance companies that produce movies or video games will tend to have a huge income for a quarter or two following a new release but may be in the negative in some periods this is fine as long as they turn a profit long term but you will have to look at data for a longer period in order to determine this

if you really believe in the particular stocks then do n't worry about their daily price   overall if the company is sound and presumably paying a dividend then you 're in it for the long haul notwithstanding that it is reasonable to look for a way out   the two you describe are quite different in their specifics selling sounds like the simpler of the two but the trigger event and if it is automatic or manual matters   if you are happy to put in a sell order at some time in the future then just go ahead with that many brokers can place a stop order that will trigger on a certain price threshold being hit   do note however that by default this would place a market order and depending on the price that breaks through in the event of a flash crash depending on how fast the brokers systems were you could find yourself selling quite cheaply a stop limit order will place a limit order at a triggered price   this would limit your overall downside loss but you might not sell at all if the market is really running away options are another reasonable way to deal with the situation sort of like insurance   in this case you would likely buy a put which would give you the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at the price the that was specified in the option   in this case no matter what you are out the price of the option itself hence my to insurance but if the event never happens then that was the price you paid to have that peace of mind i can not recommend a specific course of action but hopefully that fleshed out the options you have

on contrary of what mike scott suggested i think in case of euro doom it 's a lot safer if your savings were changed into another currency in advance beware that bringing your money into an euro core country like finland austria germany it 's useful if you think those banks are safer but totally useless to avoid the conversion of your saving from euro into your national currency in case of euro crash only the central bank will decide what happens to all the euro deposited wherever single banks even if they are deutsche bank or bnp or ing can not decide what to do on their own ecb european central bank might decide to convert euro into local currencies based on the account 's owner nationality therefor if you are greek and you moved your saving in a german bank the ecb might decide that your euro are converted into new even if they sit in a german bank account the thing is that if you ask to a finland bank in case of euro crash would you convert my euro into new they sure would answer no we ca n't which is true they can not because it 's only the ecb europe central bank the one that decides how an ordered euro crash has to be and the ecb might decide as i explained you above other central banks swiss fed etc would only follow the decisions of the ecb moreover in case of euro doom it 's highly probable that the euro currency looses a tremendous value compared to other currencies the loss would be huge in case the euro crash happens in a way i.e. a strong country like germany and their banks decides to get out and they start printing their own money w/o listening to the ecb anymore so even if your saving are in euro in germany they would loose so much value compared to other currencies that you will forever not to have converted them into another currency when you had the time to do it couple of advises 1 if you want to change you savings into another currency you do n't need to bring them into another bank country like us you could simply buy us shares bonds at your local bank shares bonds of a us company us gov will always be worth their value in dollars no matter in what new pathetic currency your account will be converted 2 but is there a drawback in converting my saving into another currency i.e. buying dollars in the form of us treasury bonds unfortunately yes the drawback is that in case this euro drama comes finally to an happy ending and germans decide to open their wallets for the time to save the currency the euro might suddenly increase its value compared to other currencies therefor if you changed your saving into another currency you might loose money i.e. us dollars looses value against the euro

determining how much you should budget to spend on any area of your budget is one of those hard topics to find good information about   part of the problem is that everyone has different priorities and needs and incomes and expenses vary greatly depending upon where you live and your career choices the best thing you can do is track your spending for 1 3 months you can use the envelope system if you need to to track and control how much you spend on miscellaneous things like lunches coffee etc   the precision is important though you probably do nt need to measure to the penny however you should capture all the areas where you spend money even if you later gather them into more broad areas split your spending into three broad areas and try to limit the spending for each of those areas to the stated percentages adjust for your preferences you state net income $ 2600 and you stated you have $ of known expenses so you are spending another $ on groceries debt payments restaurants unplanned expenses and emergencies essentials rent transportation food total $ you probably spend $ 400 600 on groceries so your essentials are higher by $ 100 300 than you can afford   you should try to cut your electricity usage $ 30 50 and you may be able to find cheaper car insurance save $ 20 financial priorities savings debt payments total $ nearly 15 before you pay for credit cards and savings   please focus on paying off your debts credit cards window loan student loans   you are spending almost 10 of your income on student loans and you can not afford much other debt lifestyle total $ over 10 of your income on communications   please try to cut cellphone and costs at least until you have reduced debt since you have internet your wife could use a voip provider etc or get an ipod touch and use skype or similar at least until you get out of debt you might consider trying to find a way to earn extra money until you have paid off either the loan for windows your credit card debt or one of your student loans

the euro is a common currency between various countries in europe   this means that individual countries give up their traditional sovereign control of their own currency and cede that control to the eu such a system has many advantages but it also means that individual countries can not deal with their unique situations as easily   for instance if the us were a part of the eu then the fed could n't issue $ 600b the way they are to bolster the economy the danger to the euro is that countries will withdraw their participation in order to micromanage their economies more effectively   if a major country withdraws its participation it could start a domino effect where many countries withdraw so that they too can manage their economies more effectively   as more countries withdraw a shared currency becomes less and less appealing

since you mentioned £ there 's a good chance you 're in the uk the uk is something of an anomaly in the world in so much as you do n't need to use because you can spread bet the principle is ultimately the same you 're making a bet that the price will change in your favour as others have said this is n't investment and is n't a good idea if you do n't know what you 're doing it 's a possibly risky way into the field because your losses can exceed your deposit it 's generally pretty short term and so is highly susceptible to unpredictable temporary market fluctuation real investing is usually longer term and so based on the general trend of the market which is generally less difficult to predict that said half way decent spread betting companies will check you out pretty thoroughly before you start they 'll offer a demo account where you can trade with fake money ie you make no deposit and can make no withdrawals until you 're comfortable some do training courses and seminars too when you first start trading for real you 'll need to put a stop loss on every trade and thus mostly avoid the problem of losing more than you it 's still possible to lose more than you with a stop loss but in most cases your excess loss wo n't be just eye watering i worked for one such spread betting company a good honest one at that we once had an internal competition using demo accounts the aim was to make as much money as you could in a two week period i think we started with £ 10,000 each a couple of people made a decent looking amount of money in that time but dozens more of us lost at least all of the money it is possible to make money but there 's a far far greater chance you 'll lose all you 're prepared to stake and maybe more also using a demo account is very different from using real money no matter how much you tell yourself it is n't

anything is negotiable   clearly in the current draft of the contract the company is n't going to calculate or withhold taxes on your behalf that is your responsibility but if you want to calculate taxes yourself and break out the fees you are receiving into several buckets on the invoice the company might agree they might have to run it past their legal department first i do n't see how that helps anything it just divides the single fee into two pieces with the same overall total as points out it appears that the company expects you to cover your expenses from within your charges thus it 's up to you to decide the appropriate fees to charge and you are assuming the risk that you have estimated your expenses incorrectly if you want the company to pay you a fee plus reimburse your expenses you will need to craft that into the contract it 's not clear what kind of expenses you need to be covered and sometimes companies will not agree to them for specific tax rule questions applicable to your locale you should consult your tax adviser

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

in general i 'd advise you to do it the other way around in the future    know what your plan is and what you need for it before reaching out publicly that way you can respond more quickly and answer questions more easily    as for the meeting you basically need to prepare three things    1 what do you need to know when the meeting is over 2 what can you offer the client 3 what is a fair price for your time   under 1 what kind of website do they want do you have complete freedom or do you have to work within their existing branding can you deliver what they 're asking for example if they want a cms to manage their portfolio can you build that   under 2 what 's your own portfolio like what can you use to convince the client you have the capabilities to deliver what they 're asking note the difference with 1 that 's if you can actually do it this is if you can convince them of that fact    under 3 determine what you 'd find a fair hourly wage so that during the meeting you can estimate what the total price should be and when you should consider backing out    finally you should consider what you 'll do if you run into complications as it 's your first client it 's good to give it some thought ahead of time but it probably wo n't come up during the meeting   as for being convincing if you get 2 right you should be confident that you can actually do what you promise if your portfolio is limited you can look up websites yourself for other interior designers before the meeting so that you can go over them with the client ask which elements the client does and does n't like summarize it in the end and affirm you can deliver something combining those things

yes just set aside the amount of money if you buy a cfd long in a stock for a 1000 $ set aside if you buy a cfd short set aside the same amount and include a stoploss at the value at which the money is depleted in this case however you can lose more because of opening gaps by doing this you replicate the stock return apart from the charged interest rate

underwriters are n't subject to lock up   they actually do n't hold anything   they at ipo with their short position covered by the green shoe an option from the company   if the deal does well the underwriters exercise the green shoe to cover their short   if the deal runs into some pressure they step in to support the price by buying back shares thereby covering their short   so they are doing price support in the early days of a deal but it is almost always paid for by the company granting them an option   but the underwriters are n't taking stock   correct that typically all insiders and existing investors are expected to sign up a lock up

if you are going to be a long term investor you are only going to buy and hold you will not sell thus future price is not relevant only dividend payout is relevant divide the dividend by the price you paid to get the yeald   edit   once again the will not allow me to add a comment so i have to edit a previous post   what you call active investor is not really investing it is speculating when you try to buy low sell high you have at best a 50 50 chance of picking the low you then pay a commission on that buy after you buy then you have a 50 50 chance at best of picking the high you also have to pay the commission on the sell 50 times 50 is you have at best a 25 chance of buying low and selling high you are churning your account which makes money for the broker whether you make money or not if instead you buy and hold a dividend paying security then the going price is irrelevant you paid for the security once and do not have to pay for it again meanwhile the dividends roll in forever buy low sell high is a fools game warren buffet does not do it he buys and holds

the debt is absolutely real china loans money to us via buying the us treasury bonds the bond is essentially a promise to pay back the money with interest just like a loan as you point out the us can print money if this were to happen then the usd that the owner of a treasury bond receives when the bond matures are worth less that than the usd used to purchase the bonds there are lots of reasons why the us does n't want to print lots of money so the purchaser of the bond is probably confident it wo n't happen if for some reason they think it is possible then they will want to cover that risk by only purchasing bonds that have a higher interest rate the higher interest offsets the risk of the usd being worth less of course there are lots more details e.g. the bonds themselves are bought and sold before maturity but this is the basic idea

ordinarily a stock split increases all shareholders share counts so that there is no change in anybody 's voting power   for example if you owned 1 of the company before the split after the split you now have twice as many shares but there are now twice as many shares outstanding so you still own 1 of the company   also stock splits are not ordinarily triggered   usually they happen when the board decides that for one reason or another it 's desirable to increase the number of shares in circulation which causes the price of each share to decrease proportionally    i 'm not familiar with the show and in particular i do n't know what the action is that the character being addressed is thinking of taking but it sounds like they are describing something akin to a poison pill   in these arrangements the pill is triggered by some predefined condition say a party acquiring shares in excess of a defined threshold   what typically happens is that shareholders other than the ones who triggered the pill get a chance to buy shares at a substantial discount thereby diluting the shares of the party that triggered it   because the other shareholders have to buy their additional shares albeit at a discount and because it applies only to certain shares it 's not really a split but it 's close enough that the writers of the show may have felt it was worth using the term that is more familiar to the public

this is an older question but i thought i 'd give the correct response for anyone else that might look yes there definitely could be issues you can form in friendly states such as delaware and nevada without having a physical location in the state but you ca n't run a business from another state without having to qualify to do business in that state to give a bit more clarification lets say you open a delaware llc   but you answer the phone when it rings on your new york phone and money comes into your new york bank account and your suppliers and vendors all use your new york address to send invoices and correspondence well you can pretty much count that you fall into the definition of doing business in new york and expected to pay new york taxes and qualify to do business in the state the solution would be to set up your business to truly operate from the state you would rather be in

can i pay $ 12,000 extra once a year or $ 1000 every month which option is better depends when if you mean 12 k now vs 1 k a month over the next 12 months repeating this each year now wins if you mean saving 1 k a month for 12 months then doing a the 1 k a month wins basically a sooner payment saves you more money than a later payment the first option does sound better but for a 30 year mortgage is it that significant your number one issue is that you have a thirty year mortgage the interest you pay on it is monstrous for the 30 year term you pay around 500 k in interest a 15-year mortgage is 300 k cheaper only 200 k in interest will be paid the monthly payment would be 1250 more how much money and years on a mortgage can i save when is the best time to pay at the end of each year you can knock off about a dozen years save i think you can find mortgage calculators online or talk to your mortgage advisor to play around with the numbers

i notice that a lot happened four months ago you were denied credit twice your income went up from $ 20k to $ 60k i 'm wondering if you were denied credit based on your $ 20k income since you could n't provide proof of your income i wonder if they used $ 0 for your income   debt to income ratio is one significant factor included in the credit score calculation you may not have a lot of debt but if you do n't have any income even a few hundred dollars on a credit card would throw your debt to income ratio into a panic i 'm assuming that your change from $ 20k to $ 60k income involved a change of jobs perhaps now you can provide proof of income you would certainly need to do that before being approved for a mortgage   well that 's my two cents about what may or may not have gone wrong last time as for what to do next i would agree that the most helpful thing you could do is check your credit score and fix any errors that might negatively impact your credit score there might also be non errors that need addressed such as open credit accounts that you thought you had closed when building credit history time is on your side if you just go on living your life and paying your bills promptly your credit will slowly climb to an acceptable level unfortunately in the time frame you mentioned ~1 year there is n't really enough time to build it significantly   you bring up a valid point about credit applications reducing your credit score of course that effect is somewhat minimal and temporary 2 yrs according to the thread linked to above but again 1 year is not enough to recover if you 're considering applying for additional credit as a means to improve your credit score it may be too late to reap the benefits before your mortgage application of course if you could pay off any debts that would help your debt to income ratio but it would also reduce any house down payment you could save up and thereby increase the amount of your mortgage   better just save those pennies or preferably and to put toward a down payment

while the issuer of the security such as a stock or bond not the short is responsible for the credit risk the issuer and the short of a derivative is one in all cases it is more than likely that a trader is owed securities by an agent such as a broker or exchange or clearinghouse legally only the options clearing corporation clears openly traded options   with stocks and bonds brokerages can clear with each other if approved while a trader is expected to fund margin the legal responsibility is shared by all in the agent chain   clearinghouses are liable to exchanges   exchanges are liable to members   traders are liable to brokerages   both ways and so on clearinghouses are usually ultimately liable for counterparty risk to the long counterparty and the short counterparty is ultimately liable to the clearinghouse clearinghouses are not responsible for the credit risk of stocks and bonds because the issuers are not short those securities on the exchange thus no margin is required   credit risk for stocks and bonds is mitigated away from the clearing process

  adding to h answer about damage limitation online purchases could include phone tablet app purchases which could be an issue if you have children or you are a victim of fraud first link from googling kid racks up almost $ 6,000 on world in app purchases adding to c. answer i think credit cards perhaps can make it more difficult to budget if you are more lazy have limited savings   these might happen more long term if you do n't keep track of your spending i.e. if your credit limit matches your monthly income and if you pay off your card each month i think it is harder to overspend as you do n't have more credit available than you can afford to spend however this is countered by that a slightly higher credit limit may help to avoid fees from exceeding your credit card limit i think due to that some not all purchases are instantly banked i.e. the shop might send all of its monies to its bank at the end of the day or something like this so you can just keep spending not realising you have exceeding your credit limit and get hit by fees

economy of the bahamas   the bahamas is a stable developing nation with an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels resorts and residences had led to solid gdp growth for many years but the slowdown in the us economy and the attacks of september 11 2001 held back growth in these sectors in 2001 03 financial services constitute the second most important sector of the economy accounting for about 15 of gdp however since december 2000 when the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector many international businesses have left the bahamas manufacturing and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of gdp and show little growth despite government incentives aimed at those sectors overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector which depends on growth in the us the source of more than 80 of the visitors     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r economy about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^|

my problem with your argument is the idea that we make a decision and reap the benefits sometime in the near and measurable future   where as the actual outcome of our decision may not be realized until many other decisions are made afterwards thus making the number of permutations very high   while i agree there tend to be people who can make better or more informed decisions given a situation i think you give them entirely too much credit given the long run possibilities of outcomes   my ultimate point being no matter who you are you are limited to being able to consider so many steps ahead or combinations at a single time   and there are certainly people who make bad choices but get good outcomes and vice versus   since we do n't see one person or a specific model for making decisions i have to believe that one simply does not exist   so call it luck or informed decisions i think at a certain point people make decisions and reap the rewards of those decisions independently   maybe more often than not the informed win but there have been plenty of smart people out there with brilliant models and ideas that go down in flames   likewise i 've meet some pretty dumb people who happen to be at the right place at the right time and turn the right knob   not sure i was clear in explaining my point its been a long day

this answer relies on why you are holding shares of a company in the first place so let 's address that so does this mean you would like to vote with your shares on the directions the company takes if so your reasons for selling would be different from the next speculator who only is interested in share price volatility regardless of your participation in potential voting rights associated with your share ownership a different reason to sell is based on if your fundamental reasons for investing in the company have changed   enhancements on this topic include trade management how to deal with position sizes buying and selling partial positions based on price action while keeping a core long term position but this is not something long term investors generally put too much effort in price targets start your long term investment with a price target in mind derived from a future market cap based on your initial fundamental analysis of the company 's prospects and finally there are a lot of things you can do with a profitable investment in shares

for personal investing and highly risky securities wasting assets which is exactly what options are it is better to think in terms of sunk costs do n't chase this trade trying to make your money back you should minimize your loss unwind the position now while there is still some remaining value in those call options and take a short term loss or you could try this   let 's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock very general case i do n't know how much time remains before the option 's expiration date be that as it may i could suggest this to effect a recovery   you 'll be long the call and short the stock this is called a delta hedge as you would be delta trading the stock delta refers to short term price volatility   in other words you 'll short a single large block of the stock then buy shares in small increments whenever the market drops slightly on an intra day basis when the market price of the stock rises incrementally you 'll sell a few shares back and forth in response to short term market price moves while maintaining a static hedge ratio as your original call option gets closer to maturity roll it over into the next available contract either one month or preferably three month time to expiration if you do n't want to or ca n't borrow the underlying stock to short you could do a synthetic short a synthetic short is a combination of a long put and a short call whose pay off replicates the short stock payoff   i personally would never purchase an unhedged option or warrant but since that is what you own right now you have two choices get out or dig in deeper with the realization that you are doing a lot of work just to trade your way back to a net zero   while you can make a profit using this sort of strategy i 'm not certain if that is within the scope of the website

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

this turned out be a lot longer than i expected   so here 's the overview despite the presence of asset allocation calculators and what not this is a subjective matter   only you know how much risk you are willing to take   you seem to be aware of one rule of thumb namely that with a longer investing horizon you can stand to take on more risk   however how much risk you should take is subject to your own risk aversion   honestly the best way to answer your questions is to educate yourself about the individual topics   there are just too many variables to provide neat concise answers to such a broad question   there are no easy ways around this   you should not blindly rely on the opinions of others but rather use your own judgment to asses their advice some of the links i provide in the main text s&p 500 total and inflation adjusted historical returns 10-year index fund returns the motley fool risk aversion disclaimer these are the opinions of an enthusiastic amateur   why should i invest 20 in domestic large cap and 10 in developing markets instead of 10 in domestic large cap and 20 in developing markets should i invest in reits why or why not   simply put developing markets are very risky   even if you have a long investment horizon you should pace yourself and not take on too much risk   how much is too much is ultimately subjective   specific to why 10 in developing vs 20 in large cap it is probably because 10 seems like a reasonable amount of your total portfolio to gamble   another way to look at this is to consider that 10 as gone because it is invested in very risky markets   so if you 're willing to take a 20 haircut then by all means do that   however realize that you may be throwing of your money out the window meanwhile reits can be quite risky as investing in the real estate market itself can be quite risky   one reason is that the assets are very much fixed in place and thus can not be liquidated in the same way as other assets   thus you are subject to the of a relatively small market   another issue is the large capital outlays required for most commercial building projects thus typically requiring quite a bit of credit and risk   another way to put it donald trump made his name in real estate but it was and still is a very ride   yet another way to put it you have to build it before they will come and there is no guarantee that they will like what you built what mutual funds or index funds should i investigate to implement these strategies   i would generally avoid actively managed mutual funds due to the expenses   they can seriously eat into the returns   there is a reason that the most mutual funds compare themselves to the average instead of something like the s&p 500   all of those costs involved in managing a mutual fund teams of people and trading costs tend to weigh down on them quite heavily   as the motley fool on years ago if you can not do better than the s&p 500 you should save yourself the headaches and simply invest in an s&p 500 index fund that said depending on your skill and luck picking stocks or even funds you may very well have been able to beat the s&p 500 over the past 10 years   of course you may have also done a whole lot worse   this article discusses the performance of the s&p 500 over the past 60 years   as you can see the past 10 years have been a very ride yielding in a negative return   again keep in mind that you could have done much worse with other investments that site simple stock investing may be a good place to start educating yourself   i am not familiar with the site so do not take this as an endorsement   a quick once over of the material on the site leads me to believe that it may provide a good bit of information in readily digestible forms   the motley fool was a favorite site of mine in the past for the individual investor   however they seem to have turned to the dark side charging for much of their advice   that said it may still be a good place to get started   you may also decide that it is worth paying for their advice this blog post though dated compares some vanguard index funds and is a light introduction into the contrarian view of investing   simply put this view holds that one should not be a following the crowd rather one should do the opposite of what everyone else is doing   one strong argument in favor of this view is the fact that as more people pile onto an investing strategy or into a particular market the yields thin out and the risk of a correction i.e. a downturn increases    in the worst case this leads to a bubble which corrects itself suddenly or pops thus the term bubble leading to quite a bit of pain for the participants   an participant is one who is not hedged properly   basically this means they were not invested in other markets strategies that would increase in yield as a result of the event that caused the bubble to pop    note that the recent housing bubble and resulting credit crunch beat quite heavily on the both the stock and bond markets   so the easy hedge for stocks being bonds did not necessarily work out so well   this makes sense as the housing bubble burst due to concerns over easy credit unfortunately i do n't have any good resources on hand that may provide starting points or discuss the various investing strategies   i must admit that i am turning my interests back to investing after a    as i stated i used to really like the motley fool but now i am somewhat suspicious of them   the main reason is the fact that as they were exploring alternatives to advertising driven revenue for their site they promised to always have free resources available for those unwilling to pay for their advice   a cursory review of their site does show a decent amount of general investing information so take these words with a grain of salt   another reason i am suspicious of them is the fact that they spammed me with lots of to pay for their advice which seemed just like the type of advice they spoke against anyway time to put the soapbox away   as i do that though i should explain the reason for this   simply put investing is a risky endeavor any way you slice it   you can never eliminate risk you can only hope to reduce it to an acceptable level   what is acceptable is subject to your situation and to the magnitude of your risk aversion   ultimately it is rather subjective and you should not blindly follow someone else 's opinion professional or otherwise   point being use your judgment to evaluate anything you read about investing    if it sounds too good to be true it probably is   if someone purports to have some strategy for guaranteed steady returns be very suspicious of it   read up on the madoff scandal   if someone is putting on a heavy sales pitch be weary   be especially suspicious of anyone asking you to pay for their advice before giving you any solid understanding of their strategy   sure many people want to get paid for their advice in some way in fact i am getting paid with reputation on this site   however if they take the sketchy approach of a slimy salesmen they are likely making more money from selling their strategy than they are from the advice itself   most likely if they were getting outsized returns from their strategy they would keep quiet about it and continue using it themselves   as stated before the more people pile onto a strategy the smaller the returns   the typical model for selling is to make money from the sale   when the item being sold is an intangible good your risk as a buyer increases you may wonder why i have written at length without much discussion of asset allocation   one reason is that i am still a relative and have a mostly high level understanding of the various strategies   while i feel confident enough in my understanding for my own purposes i do not necessarily feel confident creating an asset allocation strategy for someone else   the more important reason is that this is a subjective matter with a lot of variables to consider   if you want a quick and simple answer i am afraid you will be disappointed   the best approach is to educate yourself and make these decisions for yourself   hence my attempt to educate you as best as i can at this point in time personally i suggest you do what i did   start reading the wall street journal every day an acceptable substitute may be the business section of the new york times   at first you will be overwhelmed with information but in the long run it will pay off   another good piece of advice is to be patient and not rush into investing    if you are in a hurry to determine how you should invest in a 401(k or other such investment vehicle due to a desire to take advantage of an employer 's matching funds then i would place my money in an s&p 500 index fund   i would also explore placing some of that money into broad index funds from other regions of the globe   the reason for broad index funds is to provide some protection from the normal fluctuations and to reduce the risk of a sudden downturn causing you a lot pain while you determine the best approach for yourself   in this scenario think more about capital preservation and hedging against inflation then about beating the market

even ignoring the match which makes it like a non deductible ira the 401k plans that i know all have a range of choices of investment   can you find one that is part of the portfolio that you want   for example do you want to own some s&p500 index fund   that must be an option   if so do the 401k and make your other investments react to it reduce the proportion of s&p500 because of that the values in the 401k are pretax so only count in asset allocation   the tax deferral is huge over time   for starters you get to invest the 30 40 you would have paid as taxes now   yes you will pay that in taxes on withdrawal but any return you generate is yours to keep   the same happens for your returns

buy the minimum of one fund now eg total bond market buy the minimum of the next fund next time you have $ 2500 eg large cap stocks continue with those until you have enough to buy the next fund eg small cap stocks   adjust as you go to balance these funds according to your planned ratios or as close as you can reasonably get without having to actually transfer money between the funds more than once a year or so build up to your targets over time if you ca n't easily afford to tie up that first $ 2500 stay with banks and cds and maybe money market accounts until you can and do n't try to invest except maybe through a matched 401k before you have adequate savings both for normal life and for an emergency reserve note too that the 401k can be a way to buy into funds without a minimum check with your employer if you have n't maxed out your 401k yet and it has matching funds that is usually the place to start saving for retirement otherwise you are leaving free money on the table

the main reason to exercise the shares sooner rather than later is that you have to hold the shares for 1 year to gain access to the long term capital gains rate when you sell your shares you do not want short term capital gains rates to apply to these shares when you sell them if the company is unable to go public and sells privately you may not have any choice but to sell your shares immediately if the company goes public you will simply have to hold your shares for a year after you buy them before selling to get the lower tax rate

first note that cibc issued these bonds with a zero coupon so they do not pay any interest   they were purchased by the market participants at a small premium paying an average of for a nominal value of 100   this equates to a negative annual redemption yield of i.e. if held until maturity then the holder will witness a negative annual return of you ask why does this make sense   clearly it makes no sense for a private individual to purchase these bonds since they will be better off simply holding cash   to understand why there is a demand for these bonds we need to look elsewhere the european bond market is currently suffering a dwindling supply owing to the bond buying programme i.e. quantitative easing   the ecb is purchasing eur 80 billion per month of eurozone sovereign debt   this means that the quantity of high grade bonds available for purchase is shrinking fast against this we have all of those european institutions and financial corporations who are legally obliged to purchase bonds to be held as assets against their obligations   these are mostly national and private pension funds as well as insurance companies and fund managers    in this sort of environment the price of high quality bonds is quickly bid up to the point where we see negative yields in this environment companies like cibc can borrow by issuing bonds with a zero coupon and the market is willing to pay a small premium over their nominal value tl dr the situation is further complicated by the inflation outlook for the eurozone with a very real possibility of deflation   should a prolonged period of deflation then negative redemption yield bonds may provide a positive real return

the difference it makes is in the magnitude of risk difference people will need in order to overcome the amount they 're paying to keep their money safe     for example if someone charged me $ 100 to keep $ 10,000 of my money safe such that i felt very very confident in getting $ 9,900 back at the end of a year i might go for that if the only alternatives are to move it somewhere where there 's a good chance i get less than $ 9,900 back at the end of a year   in short i might feel i lose less by paying that -1 interest rate

excellent question for a six year old actually a good question for a 20 year old   one explanation is a bit more complicated your son thinks that after the christmas season the company is worth more for example they might have turned $ 10 million of goods into $ 20 million of cash which increases their assets by $ 10 million and is surely a good thing however that 's not the whole picture before the christmas season we have a company with $ 10 million of goods and the christmas season just ahead while afterwards we have a company with $ 20 million cash and nine months of slow sales ahead   let 's say your son gets $ 10 pocket money every sunday at 11 am five minutes to 11 he has one dollar in his pocket five minutes past 11 he has 11 dollars in his pocket is he richer now not really because every minute he gets a bit closer to his pocket money and five past eleven he is again almost a week away from the next pocket money on the other hand on monday he loses his wallet with $ 10 inside he is now $ 10 poorer or his neighbour unexpectedly offers him to wash his car for $ 10 and he does it he is now $ 10 richer   so if the company got robbed in august with all stock gone no insurance but time to buy new stock for the season they lose $ 10 million the company is worth $ 10 million less and the share price drops if they get robbed just before christmas sales start they do n't make the $ 20 million sales so they are $ 10 million poorer but they are $ 20 million behind where they should be the company is worth $ 20 millions less and the share price drops twice as much on the other hand if there is a totally unexpected craze for a new toy going on from april to june and then it drops down and they make $ 10 million unexpectedly they are worth $ 10 million more expected $ 10 million profit = no increase in share price unexpected $ 10 million profit increase in share price   now the second totally different explanation the share price is not based on the value of the company but on what people are willing to pay say it 's november and i own 100 shares worth $ 10 if everyone knew they are worth $ 20 in january i would hold on to my shares and not sell them for $ 10 it would be very hard to convince me to sell them for $ 19   if you could predict that the shares will be worth $ 20 in january then they would be worth $ 20 now the will not go up or down if something good or bad happens that everyone expects it only goes up or down if something happens unexpectedly

this is more of a legal question than a monetary one you can try to negotiate with the debt owner as pete b. suggests alternatively you can ignore them and see what happens they might sue you for the 400 plus costs or maybe not that is a pretty small amount for a lawyer to show up in a court of law if you go to court you can win by that you returned the box and the charge is invalid if you testify in court that you did not return the box then you will lose sometimes a debt collector will just file a credit complaint against you and you would have to go to court to get that complaint removed from your record with the credit agency the loan owner has no idea whether you returned the box at all all they have is a debt security which simply says who owes the money and how much it is in a court room they have zero evidence against you unless you said something to them and they wrote it down or recorded it

average rent rates will typically rise and fall and are market dependent just like real estate in the short term a collapse in housing like the one we saw in 2008 can induce a spike in rental costs as people walk away or get foreclosed on and move back into apartments that then tends to self adjust as the people who had been in the apartments find a deal on a foreclosed house and move out however one thing i 've seen to be near constant in the apartment business is that a landlord will offer you a deal to get in then increase the rent on you from year to year until you get fed up and move this is a big reason i did n't have the same address for two years in a row until i bought my house the landlord is basically betting that you wo n't want to deal with the hassle of moving and so will pay the higher rent rate even if when you do the math it makes more sense to move even to maintain the same rent rate eventually though you do get fed up look around find the next good deal and move resetting your rent rate i have never not once in my life seen or heard of any landlord offering a drop in rent as a loyalty move to keep you from going somewhere else it 's considered part of the game retailers will price match but most service providers landlords but also utility providers expect a large amount of churn in their customer base as people shop around it averages out

the liquidity of options is really not a problem as the option price is determined by the underlying price and even if there was very little liquidity in the option itself market makers are required to make a market at the price determined by the underlying as long as the underlying has enough liquidity your slippage in trading the options should not be too much of a problem you can read this market making scheme document for more details

yes an index is by definition any arbitrary selection in general to measure performance there are 2 ways by absolute return meaning you want a positive return at all times ie 10 is good -1 is bad by relative return this means beating the benchmark for example if the benchmark returns -20 and your portfolio returns -10 then it has delivered + 10 relative returns as compared to the benchmark

lost checks happen occasionally and there are procedures in place banking business to handle the situation   first and foremost you need to note the money is legally yours so the company is obligated to work with you here   if they refuse to cancel or reissue the check at a minimum you 'll want to contact the state government and let them know about the company 's actions if small claims court is not an option   businesses are n't permitted to keep forfeited funds in most states instead they are required to turn them over to the government who would then return them to you when you ask for it   it 's rather scummy of the government bureaucrats because it puts them in the sole position to benefit from forgotten money but that 's the system we 've given ourselves since you 've moved overseas since the last time you worked with this company you might need to exercise a little patience and be willing to jump through some hoops to get this resolved   be prepared to provide them proof of who you are and be ready to pay for extra security such as certified mail fedex so that you 're both sure that the new check is delivered to you and only you last of all learn from your mistake this time and be a little more cautious proactive in keeping track of checks and depositing them in the future

here is where i am confused on the income statement i am looking at it has a line item in cogs that is change in jobs in progress    change in =   starting raw materials and finished goods ending raw materials and finished goods for the accounting period   from what i researched cost of goods manufactured is added to cogs   the formula for the cost of goods manufactured is the costs of direct materials   used   + direct labor   used   + manufacturing overhead assigned = the   manufacturing costs incurred in the current accounting period   + beginning work in process inventory ending work in process inventory   a manufacturer 's   cost of goods sold   is computed by adding the finished goods inventory at the beginning of the period to the   cost of goods manufactured   and then subtracting the finished goods inventory at the end of the period   so it is nt that is in the income statement it is change in inventory why do they include the change of inventory in cogs wo nt this just be material and labor that should be in for the next accounting period calculation

wow all the answers here are a joke retained earnings is a funding side liabilities + equity of the balance sheet accounting entry it 's a residual value so if you end up funding your assets with more liabilities for example then retained earnings will be smaller   when worrying about the funding side of the balance sheet you should consider mainly 1 how much you want in the business of your own money equity and 2 how much debt your business can support as well as how much debt you 're comfortable with   2 is a function of looking at your income generating capacity once you 've figured out how much you will fund with debt you then need the remainder to be your money some of this is contributed capital the rest is retained earnings so to wonder about how much in retained earnings to have is n't really the way to think about it you should have the debt vs. equity conversation with yourself and figure it out that way do n't worry about the components of equity if you 're a sole owner and it 's all yours there are other ways to finance equity like preferred shares but for all intents and purposes this is a small business   from a risk perspective retained earnings is largely irrelevant on a standalone basis you should pay far more attention to your assets for example if you asked how much cash or working capital do i need that 's an operational question that 's very important to know for running the business it can be debated and there is a right answer retained earnings is just a partial accounting entry of equity and can even be manipulated by repurchasing shares and then contributing more capital so i would n't focus on it

not sure where the confusion is coming from software digital intangible goods are just like any other product with regard to vat turns out it 's being made complicated by hmrc anyone would think they enjoy making everyone who collects tax for free on their behalf a crook you charge customers everywhere in the eu vat and pay it to hmrc the only exception being customers outside the uk who can provide you with a vat number for these customers you are free to not charge vat as it 's assumed they would be it in their home country anyway the above is true until 2015 when the rules become more relaxed you will not need a vat number from customers outside the uk in order to exempt yourself from collecting vat turns out you need to be part of the moss scheme more here which was set up to prevent you having to register for vat in every country you sell your software unless you only sell through app stores and then it 's easier because each sale is treated as you selling your software to the store for it to be sold on you can reclaim all vat on your eligible purchases in the uk just as any other uk vat registered business would usual rules apply and of course you do n't collect vat from anyone outside the eu so you can either reduce the price of your software or pocket the additional 20

my reaction to this is that your observation is spot on correct it sounds like long term market timing trying to do a better job than    the rest of the market at predicting based upon a simple formula    whether the market is over priced or under priced i read the post by the founder of valuation informed indexing rob glance at   the comments section rob clearly states that he does n't even use his own strategy and has not owned nor traded any stocks since 1996 as another commenter summarizes it addressing rob this is 2011 you ’ve been 100 out of stocks including indexes    since 1996 that ’s 15 years of taking whatever the bond market cds or    tips will yield often and currently less than 2 i ’m curious how    you defend not following your own program even as you recommend it for    others rob basically says that stocks have n't shown the right signals for buying since 1996 so he 's stuck with bonds cd 's and fixed income instead this is a very long term horizon point of view a bit of sarcasm edges in from me answering your more general question what do i think of this particular earnings based ratio as a way to signal asset allocation change i.e. valuation informed investing i do n't like it much

you asked for simple and i promise you this is it just looks a bit math heavy to start with because we have to handle a couple of different scenarios bear with me i find the best way to deal with these kinds of questions is to put together a total cost for each option for a sensible amount of time and see what the difference is we 'll include the current cost for both options plus the subsequent costs for 12 months i find that more useful than a straight which is more expensive right now because it includes the potential costs of the next upgrade and any changes to the plan let 's throw some numbers together for the next 12 months if your current plan is longer than 12 months read the note at the bottom first first write down the cost of these things the above assume that you have two options if you take the repair option and only one option if you use the buy out option the two options we 're assuming here are that you can either   if you 'd choose the same new plan regardless of whether you take the $ 100 or $ 150 option there 's no need to include both options to simplify things you can just use the same numbers for both b c and pu and the calculation below will still work when you 've found and written down the above just do the sums below to find your two total costs over 12 months nothing fancy just plug the numbers above into the equation eg if pe ebay value of the phone is $ 80 replace pe with 80 do n't forget to do the parts in brackets first that 's your total cost for both options for the next year note i 'm assuming that your plan ends within the next 12 months if not just replace 12 in the above calculations with another term you can also do this if you want to find out the price difference over a longer period noting that if you upgrade to the same plan regardless of choice you 'll get the same answer for any period longer than your current contract

fica taxes are separate from federal and state income taxes as a sole proprietor you owe all of those   additionally there is a difference with fica when you are employed vs. self employed   typically fica taxes are actually split between the employer and the employee so you pay half they pay half but when you 're self employed you pay both halves this is what is commonly referred to as the self employment tax if you are both employed and self employed as i am your employer pays their portion of fica on the income you earn there and you pay both halves on the income you earn in your business edit as @joetaxpayer added in his comment you can specify an extra amount to be withheld from your pay when you fill out your w-4 form this is separate from the calculation of how much to withhold based on dependents and such see line 6 on the linked form this could allow you to avoid making quarterly estimated payments for your self employment income i think this is much easier when your side income is predictable personally i find it easier to come up with a percentage i must keep aside from my side income for me this is about 35 and then i immediately set that aside when i get paid i make my quarterly estimated payments out of that money set aside   my side income can vary quite a bit though if i could predict it better i would probably do the extra withholding yes you need to pay taxes for fica and federal income tax   i ca n't say exactly how much you should withhold though if you have predictable deductions and such it could be lower than you expect i 'm not a tax professional and when it comes doing business taxes i go to someone who is you do n't have to do that but i 'm not comfortable offering any detailed advice on how you should proceed there i mentioned what i do personally as an illustration of how i handle withholding but i ca n't say that that 's what someone else should do

i love giving non answer answers   it will depend on you   suppose you are embarrassed by driving older cars your significant other does n't like having you drive an older car you do n't really maintain the car well it develops a variety of problems acquires a few dents and you really worry about reliability   then the value of the car will probably drop rather quickly below the blue book value and you should sell it on the other hand if you do n't care how the car looks it runs pretty well fewer repairs than you would expect you maintain it yourself aka cheaply and do a good job at that and have plenty of friends who owe you a favor and will give you a ride if your car wo n't start there will probably never be a time that the value to you drops below the official blue book value what others will pay so you would drive it until the engine drops out of the   the blue book value represents some kind of rough consensus about what a car of that age and exterior condition is worth to the typical person it will be the discrepancy between the typical person and you that determines whether you 'll sell an illustration of this   i know a few people who 1 do n't care what their car looks like and 2 are very handy at repairs   these people started out by buying cheap used cars and ran them until they basically fell to pieces   however even though their taste in cars did n't changes as their incomes increased it finally reached the point where doing their own repairs was too much of a time sink so the value of really old cars dropped in their minds and they shifted to buying newer cars and selling them before they completely fell apart   that 's why this is a hard question to answer

congratulations on your raise is my employer allowed to impose their own limit on my contributions    that 's different from the irs limit no is it something they can limit at will or are they required to allow    me to contribute up to the irs limit the employer can not limit you you can contribute up to the irs limit your mistake is in thinking that the irs limit is 17 k for everyone that is not so you 're affected by the hce rules highly compensated employees these rules define certain employees as hce if their salary is significantly higher than that of the rest of the employees and limit the ability of the hce 's to deposit money into 401k based on the deposits made by the rest of the employees basically it means that while the overall maximum is indeed 17 k your personal and other hce 's in your company is lowered down because those who are not hce 's in the company do n't deposit to 401k enough you can read more details and technical explanation about the hce rules in this article and in this blog post

yes you can claim your business deductions if you are not making any income yet but first you should decide what structure you want to have for your business either a company structure or a sole trader or partnership company structure if you choose a company structure which is more expensive to set up you would claim your deductions but no income so you would be making a loss and continue making losses until your income from the business exceed your expenses so these losses will remain inside the company and can be carried forward to future income years when you are making profits to offset these profits refer to ato company tax losses for more information sole trader of partnership structure if you choose to be a sole trader or a partnership and your business makes a loss you must check the non commercial loss rules to see if you can offset the loss against your income from other sources such as wages in order to offset your business losses against your other income your business must   pass one of these tests if you do n't pass any of these tests which being a start up you most likely wo n't you must carry forward your business losses until an income year in which you do pass one of the tests then you can offset it against your other income this is what a legitimate business from someone having a hobby because unless you start making at least $ 20,000 in sales income the easiest test to pass you can not use your business losses against your other income refer to ato non commercial losses for more information

any retail equity brokerage will give you access to the nyse and thus facebook shares as they become available   however it is important to note that you nor any retail investor will be able to purchase fb at the ipo prices $ 33 38 iirc   the only people who will be able to buy in at that price are the underwriting investment banks and major investors who have subscribed to the ipo   you and all the other retail investors will only be able to buy in as those major investors offer shares on the secondary market    this being facebook there will probably be a significant premium over the ipo price both due to demand and systemic underpricing of ipos to encourage the opening pop    so if you 're intent on buying in at the ipo pay close attention as the date approaches   look at how the recent big ipos have performed come to mind   know how much you 're willing to commit and what price you want   however no one is going to know what the opening market price will be come friday morning   be watching your financial data source analysis of choice and be prepared to make a judgement

thanks for your question dai the circumstances under which these buyouts can occur is based on the us takeover code and related legislation as well as the laws of the state in which the company is incorporated it 's not actually the case that a company such as dell needs to entice or force every shareholder to sell what is salient is the conditions under which the bidder can acquire a controlling interest in the target company and effect a merger this usually involves acquiring at least a majority of the outstanding shares methods of acquisition the quickest way for a company to be acquired is the one step method in this case the bidder simply calls for a shareholder vote if the shareholders approve the terms of the offer the deal can go forward any legal or other to the deal in the two step method which is the case with dell the bidder issues a tender offer which you mentioned where the current shareholders can agree to sell their shares to the bidder usually at a premium if the bidder secures the acceptance of 90 of the shares they can immediately go forward with what is called a short form merger and can effect the merger without ever calling for a shareholder meeting or vote any stockholders that hold out and do not want to sell are squeezed out once the merger has been effected but retain the right to redeem their outstanding shares at the valuation of the tender offer in the case you mentioned if shareholders controlling 25 of the shares not necessarily 25 of the shareholders were to oppose the tender offer there would be alternatives if the bidder did not have at least 51 of the shares secured they would likely either increase the valuation of the tender offer or choose to abandon the takeover if the bidder had 51 or more of the shares secured but not 90 they could issue a proxy statement call for a shareholder meeting and a vote to effect the merger or they could increase the tender offer in order to try to secure 90 of the shares in order to effect the short form merger if the bidder is able to secure even 51 of the shares either through the proxy or by way of a controlling interest along with a consortium of other shareholders they are able to effect the merger and squeeze out the remaining shareholders at the price of the tender offer majority rules some states laws specify additional circumstances under which the bidder can force the current shareholders to exchange their shares for cash or converted shares but not delaware where dell is incorporate there are also several special cases with a top up provision if the company 's board management is in favor of the merger they can simply issue more and more shares until the bidder has acquired 90 of the total outstanding shares needed for the short form merger top up provisions are very common in cases of a tender offer if the board management opposes the merger this is considered a hostile and they can effect poison pill measures which have the opposite effect of a top up and dilute the bidders percent of outstanding shares however if the bidder can secure 51 of the shares they can simply vote to replace the current board who can then replace the current management such that the new board and management will put into place whatever provisions are amenable to the bidder in the case of a short form merger or a vote to effect a merger the shareholders who do not wish to sell have the right to sell at the tender price or they can oppose the deal on legal grounds by arguing that the valuation of the tender offer is materially unfair however there are very few cases which i 'm aware of where this type of challenge has been successful however they do not have the power to stop the merger which has been agreed to by the majority of the shareholders this is similar to how when the president is elected the minority voters ca n't stop the new president from being or how you can be affected if you own a condo and the condo owners association votes to change the rules in a way you do n't like tough luck for you if you do n't like it if you want more detail i 'd recommend checking out a web guide from 2011 here as well as related articles from the harvard law blog here i hope that helps

first and foremost being cool stops being a thing you have to worry about once you graduate from secondary school nobody 's really going to care what car you drive the ones that do care are n't worth maintaining personal friendships or relationships with the notable exception would be a sales job requiring you to look successful to be successful and in that case you 'll need to either have a nice looking car or buy one very quickly also consider what you 're buying an which for the u.s. crowd was the previous generation of and sedans will be at best a old car and they made these as long ago as 98 which would make it 15 years old the standard in the u.s. is to put about 10k miles which would be about 17k km per year on it so you would expect even the newest to have at least 100 000 km on them at this point even the best cars start needing increasing amounts of maintenance and on a bmw that maintenance does n't come cheap   consider why a bmw would be sold it sounds cliche but in the u.s. at least there are three tiers of used car in the luxury class there are the and two year olds used by the dealer as a loaner or owned by the type of guy who buys a new car every year they 're practically new for 30 50 off sticker and a great deal when you find them there are the 15-year old or older cars which were used up and traded in the majority of these end up auctioned off and for parts with the remaining sold for salvage then there are the in between three and ten years old you get a wide variety this car could have been all its life and driven to and from work and around town before its owner got a raise and decided to splurge or its previous owner could have driven the wheels off all over the continent for work or travel it could have a major problem that developed or was discovered after the warranty expired and there is n't an on the road that 's still under warranty which caused the owner to sell overall i would wait until you have your first real job to spend real money on a car like this the one that will actually pay the bills with enough left over for fun when you 're making 35k a year with only your own personal expenses as long as you manage your debt well and do n't get in trouble with credit you should have no trouble buying a car like this or even a newer one if you are going to buy used even then i recommend you do your homework on required maintenance for the brand and in general what each milestone will cost you and based on mileage how soon and i would find a reputable used car dealer which is a contradiction in terms but there are guys out there who are n't out to completely screw you over

there is no direct relationship between volume and stock price high volume indicates how much stock is changing hands that can be because people are enthusiastically buying or enthusiastically selling and their reasons for doing so may not agree with your own sense of the future value of the stock higher volume may mean that the price is more likely to change during the day but it can be in either direction or in no direction at all if there is n't a general agreement on how to react to some piece of news it 's a possibly interesting but it means nothing in isolation

one way is to think of a reit as a fully managed portfolio of real estate investments risks and returns are averaged across the real estate portfolio and managed by experts possibly industry leading experts   reits have a well documented track record you can research most individuals do not many individuals have learned a hard lesson or two while attempting to generate passive income with real estate conversely some people derive a great deal of satisfaction from owning real estate and have a true passion to do so   plus if you are expecting interest rates to raise and/or rate of inflation to increase in the next 30 years you may benefit from the financing aspects of the investment as well   there are some opportunities that seem to do better than the average reit a majority of the time but may not be desirable to you or fit into your budget for various reasons i 'm not sure what your level of experience knowledge or financial situation but for everyone considering there are many additional things to know about investment property compared to a primary residence   a good place to start with reits is the prospectus of one that interests you   research their holdings create a model or otherwise make a connection with the reit before clicking buy

the article said $ 65,000 rounds numbers imply an estimate was the original amount she borrowed however she is n't on the hook for only $ 65,000 her loans have interest and one of the loans had an 8 interest rate    let 's assume for the purposes of this exercise to illustrate what compound interest can do to good debt that all of her loans are at 8 interest over a 30 year repayment period her total payments over the course of the 30 years will amount to $ yes that 's a big number $ going to interest and $ 65,000 going towards the original loan balance    more realistically her loans are probably in the 6 8 interest range since interest rates were higher 20 years ago so the amount is a little smaller but the bulk of her payments will be for paying interest not paying down her loan balance she really could n't afford to borrow for a master 's degree to make so little in a high cost of living area

what is my best bet with the 401 k i know very little about retirement    plans and do n't plan to ever touch this money until i retire but could    this money be of better use somewhere else if you do n't know your options i would suggest reading some material on it that might be a little more extensive than an answer here for instance has some good and free information about a myriad of financial topics   with retirement accounts you can roll it over or leave it in the current account   things to look at would be costs of the accounts options you have in each account and the flexibility of moving it if you need to   depending on what type of retirement account it is roth 401 k traditional 401 k etc you may have some advantages with moving it to another type the student loans pay them off in one shot i have the extra money    and it would not be a hardship to do so unless that money can be best    used somewhere else unless i was making more money in a savings investing business opportunity i would pay off the student loans in a lump sum   the reason is basic opportunity cost economics if a better opportunity is n't on the horizon with your money kill the interest you 're paying because it 's money you 're losing every month with the money just sitting in the bank i get a little sick feeling    thinking that i can be doing something better with that outside of general savings you could look at investing in stocks etfs mutual funds currencies lending club loans vary by state or something similar   or you could try to start a business or invest in a start up directly though depending on the start up they may not accept small investors   otherwise if you do n't have a specific idea at this time it 's best to have money in savings while you ponder where else it would serve you keep in mind having cash on hand even if it 's not earning anything can bail you out in emergencies or open the door if an opportunity arises   so you 're really not losing anything by having it in cash if you 're patiently waiting on opportunities

's response is generally correct you would n't have to pay taxes on insurance benefits since those are in fact bringing you whole to what you 've lost however in some cases you do need to consider taxes specifically if the insurance payout is higher than your cost basis in the lost property while you may think that this never happens why would the insurance company pay more than what it cost you it in fact quite frequently does specific example would be a car used in your business if you used your car as part of your business and deducted car depreciation on your tax return your cost basis was reduced by the depreciation getting a full car cost payout form insurance would in fact constitute taxable income to you for the difference between your cost basis adjusted for the depreciation and the payout another example would be collectibles say you bought a car 20 years ago at $ 5000 you maintained it well during the years assume you spend another $ 5000 on repairs and it is now insured at fmv of $ 50000 but alas it got destroyed by a mountain lion who climbed over the fence and pushed it over a cliff you got a $ 50000 payout from your insurance company because you insured it for full fmv coverage as a collectible should be insured of which $ 40000 will be taxable to you there may be more specific cases where insurance payouts are partially taxable however as a general rule they 're not as long as they 're at or below your cost basis level

you would want to prioritize roth and retirement over hsa as the hsa is only for health and dental expenses which you will always have it will put you in a bit of a pickle for all of the life involved for example even if you or a loved one develop a strange expensive the hsa will only cover the medical costs but not any travel to specialists hotel stays home alterations special vehicles or lifestyle alterations food clothing however you will eventually stop working even if you are healthy throughout your life   i would suggest that you treat the hsa as a part of your overall emergency fund giving it a cap the same as you would normal non retirement savings since you stated you have three young children small and large medical expenses such as braces trips to the emergency room are something that are almost guaranteed thus having fairly large amount in the hsa would be very beneficial throughout their time with you once the children have left however if you still have an overwhelming balance in your hsa you may not want to add anymore to the hsa setting a cap for the hsa based off a certain number of years of deductible payments for medication would be a good place to start   roth accounts whether it be within your company 's 401k plan or the iras for yourself and your spouse are single the best location for your money for long term savings roth money grows tax free is immune to required minimum distribution provisions and will avoid estate escrow when going to one 's beneficiaries even if you tap into the funds prior to age 59 1/2 you would only pay taxes on any investment growth in addition to the 10 early withdrawal penalty if you have established roth ira accounts and have an agi that disallows you to further contribute to them there is still a provision to get roth funds contributed via conversion through what is commonly called a back door roth

the standard double entry approach would just be to create a liability account for the loan and then make a transfer from that account to your asset savings account when the loan proceeds are distributed to you after that point the loan does n't belong to your savings account in any way each account and transaction is tracked separately so you might for instance pay that loan back with a transfer from your checking account even though the initial disbursement arrived into your savings account in order to see how much of a loan you have remaining you need to look at the loan 's liability account to see what transactions occurred in it and what its remaining balance is it sounds like what you 're really trying to accomplish is the idea of   or putting into an envelope certain assets for certain purposes this kind of budgeting is n't really something that gnucash at it does have some budget features but there 's more about being able to see how actual expenses are to expected expenses for a reporting period not about being able to ask how much discretionary assets do i have left before i start hitting my emergency fund the closest you get is splitting up your asset accounts into subaccounts as you suggest in which case you can allocate funds for your specific purposes and make transfers between them as needed that can work well enough depending on your exact goals though it can sometimes make it a little trickier to reconcile with your actual bank statements but there 's not really an accounting reason to associate the emergency fund portion of your assets with the remaining balance of your loan though there 's nothing stopping you from doing so if that 's what you 're trying to do accounting answers questions like how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now if you want to ask how much am i allowed to spend on x right now or am i likely to run out of money soon you may want a budgeting tool rather than an accounting tool

small cap and mid cap shares tend to outperform large cap shares in a bull market but they tend to underperform large cap shares in a bear market since the stock markets tend to go up in the long term this suggests that a low cost small and mid cap index etf should offer the best long term returns    having said that we are currently in a mature bull market having experienced over seven years without a bear market   if a bearish outlook is something you worry about then perhaps a broad market index which will be heavily weighted towards large cap shares may be a better choice for you at this time with an eye toward switching to small and mid cap indices during the next bear market

the bonus share also improves the liquidity however there is some difference in treatment lets say a company has 100 shares of $ 10 ea the total capital of the is 100 10 = 1000 assuming the company is doing well its share is now available in the market for $ 100 ea now lets say the company has made a profit of $ 1000 and this also gets factored into the price of $ 100 lets say the company decides to keep this $ 1000 kept as cash reserve and is not distributed as dividends    in a share split say 1:1 the book value of each share is now reduced to $ 5 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital stays at 200 5 = 1000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    in a bonus share issue say 1:1 the funds $ 1000 are moved from cash reserve and transferred to share capital the book value of each share will remain same as $ 10 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital increases to 200 10 = 2000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    so essentially from a liquidity point of view both give the same benefit as to why some companies issue bonus and not a split this is because of multiple reasons a split beyond a point can not be done ie $ 10 can be split to $ 1 ea but it does n't look good to make it $ 0.50 the other reason is there is adequate cash reserve and you want to convert this into share holders capital having a larger share holders capital improves some of the health ratios for the at times is used to play upon that one is getting something free

when it comes to norway there is also a cultural aspect that translated into politics natural resources are seen as belonging to the people therefore natural resources are not sold to the higher bidder for instance the oil companies pay an extremely high extra tax in norway around 80 tax this means that most of the profit from the oil and gas goes back to the people and are put into a common wealth fund rather than going to a few share holders in oil companies over the years this has added up to a considerable amount of money this would not work in places like the us because it is seen as socialism not to let the oil companies and others rip off the population

first note that a share represents a of ownership of a company in addition to the right to vote in the management of the company by voting on the board of directors who hires the ceo who hires the vps etc this gives you the right to all future value of the company after paying off expenses and debts you will receive this money in two forms dividends approved by the board of directors and the final liquidation value if the company closes shop there are many ways to attempt to determine the value of a company but the basic theory is that the company is worth a cashflow stream equal to all future dividends + the liquidation value so the market 's goal is to attempt to determine what that future cash flow stream is and what the risk related to it is depending on who you talk to a typical stock market has some degree of market efficiency market efficiency is basically a comment about how quickly the market reacts to news in a regulated marketplace with a high degree of information available market efficiency should be quite high this basically means that stock markets in developed countries have enough traders and enough news reporting that as soon as something public is known about a company there are many many people who take that information and attempt to predict the impact on future earnings of the company for example if starbucks announces earnings that were 10 less than estimated previously the market will quickly respond with people buying starbucks shares lowering their price on the assumption that the total value of the starbucks company has decreased most of this trading analysis is done by institutional investors it is n't simply office workers selling shares on their break in the coffee room it 's mostly people in the finance industry who specialize in various areas for their firms and work to quickly react to news like this is the market perfectly efficient no the psychology of trading ie people panicking or reacting based on emotion instead of logic as well as any of information means that not all news is perfectly acted upon immediately however my personal opinion is that for large markets the market is roughly efficient enough that you can assume that you wo n't be able to read the newspaper and analyze stock news in a way better than the institutional investors if a market is generally efficient then it would be very difficult for a group of people to manipulate it because someone else would quickly take advantage of that for example you suggest that some people might collectively short amzn a company worth half a trillion dollars so your nefarious group would need to have $ 5 billion of capital just to trade 1 of the company if someone did that the rest of the market would happily buy up amzn at reduced prices and the people who shorted it would be left holding the bag however when you deal with smaller items some more likely market manipulation can occur for example when trading penny stocks there are people who attempt to manipulate the stock price and then make a profitable trade afterwards this takes advantage of the low amount of information available for tiny companies as well as the limited number of institutional investors who pay attention to them effectively it attempts to manipulate people who are not very sophisticated so some manipulation can occur in markets with limited information but for the most part prices are determined by the market consensus on what the future profits of a company will be   additional example of what a share really is imagine your neighbor has a treasure chest on his driveway he gathers the neighborhood together and asks if anyone wants to buy a of the value he will get from opening the treasure chest perhaps it 's a glass treasure chest and you can mostly see inside it you see that it is mostly gold and silver and you weigh the chest and can see that it 's about 100 lbs all together so in your head you take the price of gold and silver and estimate how much gold is in the chest and how much silver is there you estimate that the chest has roughly $ 1,000,000 of value inside so you offer to buy 10 of the chest for $ 90k you do n't want to pay exactly 10 of the value of the company because you are n't completely sure of the value you are taking on some risk so you want to be compensated for that risk   now assume all your neighbors value the chest themselves and they come up with the same approximate value as you so your neighbor hands out little certificates to 10 of you and they each say this person has a right to 10 of the value of the treasure chest he then calls for a vote from all the new shareholders and asks if you want to get the money back as soon as he sells the chest or if you want him to buy a ship and try and find more chests it seems you 're all impatient because you all vote to fully pay out the money as soon as he has it so your neighbor collects his $ 900k $ 90k for each 10 share 10 and heads to the to sell the chest but before he gets there a news report comes out that the price of gold has gone up because you own a share of something based on the price of gold you know that your 10 treasure chest investment has increased in value you now believe that your 10 is worth $ you put a flyer up around the neighborhood saying you will sell your share for $ because other flyers are going up to sell for about $ it seems your valuation was mostly consistent with the market   eventually someone driving by sees your flyer and offers you $ for your shares you agree because you want the cash now and do n't want to wait for the treasure chest to be sold now when the treasure chest gets sold to the assume it sells for $ turns out you underestimated the value of the company the person who bought your 10 share will get $ he gained $ 2k your neighbor who found the chest got $ 900k because he sold the shares earlier when the value of the chest was less clear and you got $ which for you was a gain of $ 14k above what you paid for it this is basically what happens with shares buy owning a portion of the company you have a right to get a dividend of future earnings but it could take a long time for you to get those earnings and they might not be exactly what you expect so some people do buy and sell shares to try and earn money but the reason they are able to do that is because the shares are inherently worth something they are worth a small of the company and its earnings
